Gunmen kill 20 miners, wound others in attack in southwest Pakistan	QUETTA, Pakistan — Gunmen killed 20 miners and wounded another seven in Pakistan’s southwest, a police official said Friday, drawing condemnation from authorities who have ordered police to trace and arrest those who are behind the killings. It’s the latest attack in restive Balochistan province and comes days ahead of a major security summit being hosted in the capital. Police official Hamayun Khan Nasir said the gunmen stormed the accommodations at the coal mine in Duki district late Thursday night, rounded up the men and opened fire. Most of the men were from Pashtun-speaking areas of Balochistan. Three of the dead and four of the wounded were Afghan. No group claimed immediate responsibility for the attack, but the suspicion is likely to fall on the outlawed Baloch Liberation Army, which often targets civilians and security forces. The group committed multiple attacks in August that killed more than 50 people, while authorities responded by killing 21 insurgents in the province. Those killed included 23 passengers, mostly from eastern Punjab province, who were fatally shot after being taken from buses, vehicles and trucks in Musakhail district in Baluchistan. The latest attack drew a strong condemnation from Sarfraz Bugti, the chief minister in Balochistan, who said the 'terrorists have once again targeted poor laborers.' He said the attackers were cruel and had an agenda to destabilize Pakistan. 'The killing of these innocent laborers would be avenged,' he said in a statement. The province is home to several separatist groups who want independence. They accuse the federal government in Islamabad of unfairly exploiting oil- and mineral-rich Balochistan at the expense of locals. On Monday, a group called the Baloch Liberation Army said it carried out an attack on Chinese nationals outside Pakistan's biggest airport. There are thousands of Chinese working in the country, most of them involved in Beijing’s multibillion-dollar Belt and Road Initiative. The explosion, which the BLA said was the work of a suicide bomber, also raised questions about the ability of Pakistani forces to protect high-profile events or foreigners in the country. Islamabad is hosting a summit next week of the Shanghai Cooperation Organization, a grouping founded by China and Russia to counter Western alliances. Authorities have beefed up security in the capital by deploying troops to prevent any acts of terrorism. The Ministry of Interior this week had alerted the country's four provinces to take additional measures to enhance security as the separatist groups and Pakistani Taliban could launch attacks at public places and government installation.	https://www.voanews.com/a/gunmen-kill-20-miners-wound-others-in-attack-in-southwest-pakistan/7818644.html	2024-10-10T21:59:45-07:00	
Blinken tells ASEAN the US is worried about China's actions in South China Sea	VIENTIANE, Laos — U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken told Southeast Asian leaders Friday that the U.S. is concerned about China's 'increasingly dangerous and unlawful' activities in the disputed South China Sea during an annual summit meeting and pledged the U.S. will continue to uphold freedom of navigation in the vital sea trade route. The 10-member Association of Southeast Asian Nations’ meeting with Blinken followed a series of violent confrontations at sea between China and ASEAN members Philippines and Vietnam, which have fueled concerns that China’s increasingly assertive actions in the waterways could spiral into a full-scale conflict. China, which claims almost the entire sea, has overlapping claims with ASEAN members Vietnam, the Philippines, Malaysia and Brunei, as well as Taiwan. About a third of global trade transits through the sea, which is also rich in fishing stocks, gas and oil. Beijing has refused to recognize a 2016 international arbitration ruling by a U.N.-affiliated court in the Hague that invalidated its expansive claims and has built up and militarized islands it controls. 'We are very concerned about China’s increasingly dangerous and unlawful activities in the South China Sea which have injured people, harm vessels from ASEAN nations and contradict commitments to peaceful resolutions of disputes,' said Blinken, who is filling in for President Joe Biden, in his opening speech at the U.S.-ASEAN summit. 'The United States will continue to support freedom of navigation, and freedom of overflight in the Indo Pacific.' The United States has no claims in the South China Sea but has deployed navy ships and fighter jets to patrol the waters in a challenge to China’s claims. Chinese and Philippine vessels have clashed repeatedly this year, and Vietnam said last week that Chinese forces assaulted its fishermen in the disputed sea. China has also sent patrol vessels to areas that Indonesia and Malaysia claim as exclusive economic zones. The United States has warned repeatedly that it’s obligated to defend the Philippines — its oldest treaty ally in Asia — if Filipino forces, ships or aircraft come under armed attack, including in the South China Sea. Philippine President Ferdinand Marcos Jr. complained to summit leaders on Thursday that his country 'continues to be subject to harassment and intimidation' by China. He said it was 'regrettable that the overall situation in the South China Sea remains tense and unchanged' due to China’s actions, which he said violated international law. He has called for more urgency in ASEAN-China negotiations on a code of conduct to govern the South China Sea. Singaporean leader Lawrence Wong earlier this week warned of 'real risks of an accident spiraling into conflict' if the sea dispute isn't addressed. Malaysia, who takes over the rotating ASEAN chair next year, is expected to push to accelerate talks on the code of conduct. Officials have agreed to try and complete the code by 2026, but talks have been hampered by sticky issues including disagreements over whether the pact should be binding. Chinese Premier Li Qiang was defiant during talks on Thursday. He called South China Sea a 'shared home' but repeated China’s assertion that it was merely protecting its sovereign rights, officials said. Li also blamed meddling by 'external forces' who sought to 'introduce bloc confrontation and geopolitical conflicts into Asia.' Li didn’t name the foreign forces, but China has previously warned the U.S. not to meddle in the region’s territorial disputes. In another firm message to China, Blinken said the United States believed 'it is also important to maintain our shared commitment to protect stability across the Taiwan Strait.' China claims the self-ruled island of Taiwan as its own territory and bristles at other countries’ patrolling the body of water separating it from the island. Blinken also attended an 18-nation East Asia Summit, along with the Chinese premier, Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov, and leaders from Japan, South Korea, India, Australia and New Zealand. ASEAN has treaded carefully on the sea dispute with China, which is the bloc's largest trading partner and its third largest investor. It hasn't marred trade relations, with the two sides focusing on expanding a free trade area covering a market of 2 billion people. Blinken said the annual ASEAN summit talks were a platform to address other shared challenges including the civil war in Myanmar, North Korea’s 'destabilizing behavior' and Russia’s war aggression in Ukraine. He said the U.S. remained the top foreign investor in the region and aims to strengthen its partnership with ASEAN.	https://www.voanews.com/a/blinken-tells-asean-the-us-is-worried-about-china-s-actions-in-south-china-sea/7818641.html	2024-10-10T21:49:47-07:00	
New Zealand official: No, ship didn't sink because its captain was a woman	WELLINGTON, New Zealand — New Zealand's defense minister issued stinging rebukes of what she said were 'vile' and 'misogynistic' online remarks by 'armchair admirals' about the woman captain of a navy ship that ran aground, caught fire and sank off the coast of Samoa. 'Seriously, it's 2024,' Judith Collins told reporters Thursday. 'What the hell's going on here?' After days of comments on social media directed at the gender of Commander Yvonne Gray, Collins urged the public to 'be better.' Women members of the military had also faced verbal abuse in the street in New Zealand since the ship — one of nine in the country's navy — was lost on Sunday, Collins said. All 75 people on board evacuated to safety with only minor injuries after the vessel ran aground on the reef it was surveying about a mile off the coast of Upolu, Samoa's most populous island. The cause of the disaster is not known. 'The one thing that we already know did not cause it is the gender of the ship's captain, a woman with 30 years' naval experience who on the night made the call to get her people to safety,' Collins said. One of the posters was a truck driver from Melbourne, Australia, she added. 'I think that he should keep his comments to people who drive trucks rather than people who drive ships,' Collins said. 'These are the sorts of people I'm calling out and I'm happy to keep calling them out for as long as it takes to stop this behavior.' About 20% of New Zealand's uniformed military members are women. Collins is New Zealand's first woman defense minister and said she stood alongside Gray and Maj. Gen. Rose King, the country's first woman army chief, who assumed her role in June. 'We are all appointed on merit, not gender,' said Collins. The sinking prompted fears of a major fuel spill. On Thursday, officials in Samoa said while the vessel was leaking oil from three places, the amount was reducing each day and was dissipating quickly due to strong winds in the area. Most of the ship's fuel appeared to have burned out in the fire, according to a statement by the Marine Pollution Advisory Committee. Officials were due to meet with locals Thursday to discuss how to remove the vessel's anchor and three shipping containers from the reef without further damaging the fragile marine ecosystem. New Zealand's government has ordered a military court of inquiry into the episode, which will be led by senior military officers. It will assemble for the first time on Friday. Passengers, including civilian scientists and foreign military personnel, left the vessel on lifeboats in 'challenging conditions' and darkness, New Zealand's Chief of Navy Rear Admiral Garin Golding told reporters after the sinking. Those on board have since returned to New Zealand by plane. The specialist dive and hydrographic vessel had been in service for New Zealand since 2019 but was 20 years old and had previously belonged to Norway. The military said the ship, purchased for $100 million NZ dollars ($61 million), was not covered by replacement insurance. The state of New Zealand's aging military hardware has prompted warnings from the defense agency, which in a March report described the navy as 'extremely fragile,' with ships idle due to problems retaining the staff needed to service and maintain them. Of the navy's eight remaining ships, five are currently operational. Golding said the HMNZS Manawanui underwent a maintenance period before the deployment.	https://www.voanews.com/a/new-zealand-official-no-ship-didn-t-sink-because-its-captain-was-a-woman/7818637.html	2024-10-10T21:29:55-07:00	
Hurricane Milton disrupts Yom Kippur plans for Jews in Florida	WINTER PARK, Florida — Many Jews worldwide will mark Yom Kippur in fasting and prayer at their synagogues this weekend. But for the faithful in Florida, destructive Hurricane Milton has disrupted plans for observing the Day of Atonement — the holiest day of the year in the Jewish faith — that begins Friday evening and caps off the High Holy Days that began with Rosh Hashana on October 2. Across the storm-threatened areas, rabbis and their congregants spent part of the Days of Awe — the span between Rosh Hashana and Yom Kippur — protecting their homes and synagogues as Milton churned off the coast, spiraling into a Category 5 storm. Many — though not all — evacuated, heeding the voluntary and mandatory orders, and found safekeeping for their synagogues' Torah scrolls and themselves. Milton hit Florida's Gulf Coast on Wednesday as a Category 3 cyclone, with damaging winds, heavy rains and tornadoes. By Thursday, the storm had moved eastward into the Atlantic Ocean. Why this rabbi decided against evacuating before storm Rabbi Yitzchok Minkowicz evacuated most of his family ahead of the storm, but chose to ride it out with his son, also a rabbi, at Chabad Lubavitch of Southwest Florida near Fort Myers. The center is hosting people displaced by the storm, including doctors, first responders and elderly who cannot evacuate. It's important to be 'with the people and for the people,' and provide emotional and spiritual support, he said as the storm approached. Near midnight Thursday, the Chabad center and the rest of the neighborhood lost power, said Minkowicz, making them among the millions without it. The center was spared from the storm surge, but homes and other buildings in the area were not, he said. 'Our pressing need is for Power so that we can help our community & hold Yom Kippur services,' Minkowicz told The Associated Press via email Thursday. 'We're praying for this to be resolved asap.' The center planned to host Yom Kippur observances regardless of the storm. He said it was similar two years ago, when the holy day followed the major hurricane, Ian. 'Yom Kippur is a day that you open up your soul to God and you totally connect with God,' Minkowicz said. 'When you go through a hurricane, anything materialistic is not important. They're already in that zone where they're totally focused on God.' Congregation Beth Am in the Tampa Bay area also lost power and plans to hold Yom Kippur services online, said Rabbi Jason Rosenberg of the Reform synagogue. 'It's important to keep perspective. Having a service online is not what anybody wants, but it could've been a lot worse,' he said. 'This feels like a blessing.' The storm underscored one of Yom Kippur's annual reflections. An implicit question, he said before Milton's landfall, is 'If this was going to be your last year on earth, how would you want to act differently? ... When you've got a historical storm, a potentially life-threatening and life-altering storm bearing down on you, that message is really present.' Milton disrupts Yom Kippur and October 7 commemoration Like most of her congregants, Rabbi Nicole Luna had evacuated after helping secure Temple Beth El in Fort Myers, and entrusting several Torah scrolls to congregants should the threatened surge devastate the synagogue. While the congregation braved Hurricanes Irma in 2017 and Ian in 2022, Milton's timing hit especially hard, having already forced the postponement of community-wide commemoration of Hamas attacking Israel on October 7, 2023. The war that followed is ongoing. 'It just feels like too much for our hearts to carry right now,' Luna said from Miami ahead of the storm. 'It's all very heavy.' After the storm passed through, Luna told her congregation that their synagogue had emerged undamaged, though it lost power. She announced plans for a service via Zoom on Friday evening, and in-person services Saturday. 'We hope by Saturday more traffic lights will be restored but please only come if you can safely navigate the roads,' she said in her message. Luna said she was grateful for the 'big outpouring of support' she received from fellow rabbis across the East Coast of Florida, who were opening their temples for the holidays to evacuees and have emphasized they can come as they are since few grabbed 'holiday-appropriate clothing' in the rush to escape Milton's fury. The Chabad of Southwest Broward near Fort Lauderdale is hosting several evacuees from areas most affected by the storm, ranging from a mother with her newborn to an elderly couple, said director Rabbi Pinny Andrusier. They are invited to spend Yom Kippur with the Cooper City-based group, including sharing kosher meals before and after the day of fasting. 'We were spared, thank God,' Andrusier said of the storm. 'We've been able to open up our doors' for those in the hurricane zone. Synagogue skips holding Yom Kippur services Hundreds of Jewish families on Longboat Key, a barrier island off Sarasota Bay, won't be able to observe Yom Kippur in their synagogue for the very first time in their 45-year history, said Shepard Englander, CEO of The Jewish Federation of Sarasota-Manatee. Access to the island, specifically the John Ringling Causeway, was closed ahead of the storm. The congregation decided it wasn't worth risking Milton's might for Day of Atonement services. They had celebrated Rosh Hashana in their building despite a number of nearby homes being damaged by Hurricane Helene, which made landfall last month. Englander said he and his family evacuated from their home on a riverbank outside Sarasota and were hunkered down at a friend's home inland. From there, he was trying to make sure community members from Longboat Key and other temples that won't have services can say their prayers and break their daylong Yom Kippur fast at a newly constructed conference center in Sarasota with food items like blintzes, bagels, cream cheese and smoked salmon. Ahead of the storm, people were scattered in the region at emergency shelters or staying with family or friends, Englander said. 'It's in difficult times that you really understand the power of community,' he said. 'And this is a caring, tight-knit, generous Jewish community.'	https://www.voanews.com/a/hurricane-milton-disrupts-yom-kippur-plans-for-jews-in-florida/7818633.html	2024-10-10T21:18:34-07:00

Chinese entries skyrocket at this year's Taiwan Golden Horse Awards	Taipei, Taiwan — Organizers of Taiwan's premier film festival report a huge increase this year in entries from China, despite a ban imposed by Beijing six years ago on participation in the festival by Chinese filmmakers and actors. As many as 100 Chinese entries had been submitted for Golden Horse Awards in recent years, in defiance of the ban and without apparent consequences. But this year organizers say the number of movies and documentaries submitted from China shot up to 276. More than a dozen of the Chinese films are potential finalists, some in multiple categories. The winners will be announced on November 23. Industry analysts and directors say many of the Chinese filmmakers may have turned to the Golden Horse Awards to earn exposure for their movies, fearing they would be banned at home. Others point to the festival's reputation for hosting a diversity of films. According to a list of finalists released on October 2, Chinese director Lou Ye's pseudo-documentary, An Unfinished Film, and Geng Jun's black-and-white gay film Bel Ami were shortlisted for multiple awards. Wonder Weng, executive director of the Taiwan Film Critics Society in Taipei, said both movies are likely to be banned in China. He said that Lou, a regular participant in the Golden Horse Awards, has never bowed to the Chinese system and that his An Unfinished Film deviates from Beijing's favored narratives about the COVID-19 pandemic. Geng's Bel Ami, Weng added, challenges the values of the Chinese Communist Party amid a heavy-handed crackdown on the LGBTQ community. Among this year's entrants is Zheng Yu, a 27-year-old independent director from Inner Mongolia who specializes in expressing thoughts and emotions through images and who has been involved in film and television production for eight years. His entry, Her Dream in the Living Room is a short film that records how life for his family was changed by an elder's chronic disease. Although he was not shortlisted in the end, he told VOA that he still dreams of standing on the stage of the Golden Horse Awards one day. Zheng said there are three golden awards in the Chinese film industry: the Taiwan Golden Horse, the Hong Kong Golden Statue and the China Golden Rooster Awards. Among the three, 'The Golden Horse Awards are more welcoming to varieties of films, and it is also more supportive of young directors, so this is why I wanted to apply for the Golden Horse Awards,' he said. In addition to the film entries from China, this year's festival includes 277 entries from Taiwan, 72 from Hong Kong, 17 from Macau, 21 from Malaysia, 17 from Singapore and 67 from other countries. Ng Kwok Kwan, an associate professor at the Academy of Film at Hong Kong Baptist University, said the Golden Horse Awards are the oldest Chinese film awards on either side of the Taiwan Strait. Although entries from China, Hong Kong and Macao have been discouraged by politics, the Golden Horse Awards are still seen as major awards in the Chinese film industry, and being nominated for a festival award will greatly enhance a film's visibility, he said. Ng added that the festival has become the best channel for Chinese-speaking audiences to access excellent works, and it is also the ideal outlet for some non-mainstream Hong Kong and Chinese filmmakers. He said Hong Kong-made films received a total of 18 nominations at last year's Golden Horse Awards and finally won four awards: Best New Director, Best New Actor, Best Feature Short Film and Best Animated Short Film. 'In recent years, some of the Hong Kong films nominated have been very good. They belong to a relatively niche and non-mainstream, and [the festival] has a special [interest] in the themes of non-mainstream, social issues, and experimental films, and I think it really has a certain contribution [to Hong Kong films],' he said. Seventy-two Hong Kong films participated in this year's Golden Horse Awards. From Now On, which explores the situation of older lesbians, was shortlisted for the Best Feature Film, Best Director and Best Actress awards. Among the five shortlisted films for Best Short Film, three are Hong Kong films, including Colour Ideology Sampling.mov, Something About Us and Letters from the Imprisoned: Chow Hang Tung.	https://www.voanews.com/a/chinese-entries-skyrocket-at-this-year-s-taiwan-golden-horse-awards/7818588.html	2024-10-10T19:38:45-07:00

Afghan charged in Election Day terror plot passed multiple screenings	washington — The Afghan national charged in a plot to carry out an Election Day terror attack in the United States passed multiple background checks before being allowed to enter the country, U.S. officials told VOA. FBI agents arrested Nasir Ahmad Tawhedi, 27, in Oklahoma City, Oklahoma, on Monday, alleging he and a juvenile co-conspirator had been in contact with a recruiter for the Islamic State terror group and had been planning to die in a mass shooting. Court documents also stated that Tawhedi hoped to relocate most of his family, including his wife and 1-year-old daughter, back to Afghanistan to live according to what he described as 'pure Islam.' However, U.S. officials, speaking to VOA on the condition of anonymity to discuss details of a case still under investigation, said Thursday that there were no indications Tawhedi was sympathetic to the Islamic State, also known as IS, ISIS or Daesh, either when he worked for the United States in Afghanistan or when he was screened immediately before to coming to the U.S. three years ago. 'Every Afghan being resettled in the United States undergoes a rigorous screening and vetting process, no matter which [U.S.] agency they worked with,' the official said. 'That process includes checking against a full range of relevant U.S. records and holdings,' the official added. 'Tawhedi would not have been admitted to the United States had information of concern surfaced.' Kinds of data A second U.S. official told VOA that Tawhedi's vetting included checks that involved both biometric data collected by the U.S. Department of Defense and the FBI, and classified information held by U.S. intelligence agencies. Subsequent screenings that allowed him to be approved for a Special Immigrant Visa after he entered the U.S. also came up clean. 'Vetting is a point-in-time check that evaluates information available to the U.S. government at that time,' the official said. The second official also said the government can take additional actions 'if individuals who have entered the country are later found to be associated with information indicating a potential national security or public safety concern.' NBC News, which first reported that Tawhedi's background checks failed to detect any red flags, quoted sources as saying he had worked as a security guard for the CIA before being resettled in the U.S. When reached by VOA, the CIA declined comment. But the arrest has raised concerns among some U.S. lawmakers. The chairman of the House Homeland Security Committee, Republican Representative Mark Green, sent a letter Wednesday to the FBI and the Department of Homeland Security demanding more information. 'These recent arrests raise serious concerns about the ongoing threat that ISIS and its fanatical supporters pose to U.S. national security, as well as the shortfall in the Biden-Harris administration's screening and vetting capabilities,' Green wrote. 'Additionally, news of these potential Afghan terrorists comes when only months ago, it was widely reported that eight Tajikistanis with ties to ISIS were arrested in Los Angeles, New York and Philadelphia after they had illegally crossed the border,' Green added. The FBI confirmed receipt of Green's letter but declined further comment. A Homeland Security spokesperson did not comment on the letter but described the vetting process for Afghans fleeing Taliban rule as 'multilayered.' 'Afghan evacuees who sought to enter the United States were subject to multilayered screening and vetting against intelligence, law enforcement and counterterrorism information,' the spokesperson told VOA in an email. 'If new information emerges after arrival, appropriate action is taken.' When was he radicalized? But in the case of Tawhedi, questions remain. 'What's not clear from the information currently available is exactly when Tawhedi was radicalized to the Islamic State ideology,' said Austin Doctor, the director of counterterrorism research initiatives at the National Counterterrorism Innovation, Technology and Education Center (NCITE). 'We don't know yet whether he radicalized after arriving to the United States or if he already held pro-ISIS beliefs prior to leaving Afghanistan,' Doctor told VOA. 'This matters.' According to court documents, a search of Tawhedi's phone and social media accounts showed he had been doing internet searches to find and consume IS propaganda, though when that started is not clear. The earliest date for any involvement with IS, according to the criminal complaint filed Monday, is sometime around March of this year, when Tawhedi made two cryptocurrency transfers worth at least $540 to what prosecutors described as a charity that fronts for IS. About four months later, in July, someone made a video recording – saved to Tawhedi's phone – of Tawhedi reading to a nephew and his daughter about the rewards waiting for martyrs in the afterlife. The first indications of a possible terror plot emerged that same month, when the FBI said Tawhedi did online searches about webcams for the White House and the Washington Monument, as well as about procuring guns. It also remains unclear whether Tawhedi's Islamic State contact was working for the group's Afghan affiliate, known as IS-Khorasan or ISIS-K. 'We've seen ISIS-K make a concerted effort to recruit from diaspora communities,' NCITE's Doctor told VOA. 'And facilitating external operations and inspiring homegrown violent extremist attacks are both prominent elements of the group's playbook.'	https://www.voanews.com/a/afghan-charged-in-election-day-terror-plot-passed-multiple-screenings/7818235.html	2024-10-10T16:56:18-07:00	
Russian propagandists push fake story that Zelenskyy bought Hitler's car	washington — The article in the Seattle Tribune had everything: Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy, Adolf Hitler and a $15 million classic car. Unsurprisingly, it spread like wildfire across Russia's state and pro-Kremlin media. But the subject was a strange one for a news site about a U.S. city; such outlets usually cover only local stories. In fact, the article with headline 'Hitler's parade car bought by Ukraine's Zelensky' was another fake spread by Russian propaganda. There is no such media outlet as the Seattle Tribune, just a website masquerading as a full-fledged publication. And the article itself was a compilation of Russia's disinformation 'greatest hits' about Ukraine — 'Nazism,' 'unrestrained corruption' and 'wasting American aid.' According to the phony news article, Zelenskyy was spotted in Kyiv exiting a Mercedes-Benz 770K Grosser Offener Tourenwagen, Adolf Hitler's parade car. The sighting supposedly occurred just days after the Ukrainian leader returned from Washington, where the U.S. government had allocated an $8 billion aid package to his country. The article featured a screenshot of a post by the Ukrainian Telegram messenger channel Realna Viyna ('Real War' in Ukrainian) featuring a photo of the vehicle parked in front of the Ukrainian presidential administration building in Kyiv. However, beyond the Seattle Tribune news site not actually existing, the article had several other glaring problems. First, Realna Viyna did not publish the post in the screenshot. Second, the image of 'Hitler's car' was stolen from a photo widely available on the internet that was digitally edited into an image of the Ukrainian presidential administration building. VOA found that the angle of photo in the screenshot, a black spot on the asphalt under the car's running board, and the reflection on the front windshield completely match the image of the Mercedes-Benz 770K found across the internet. Third, the Seattle Tribune website was registered on October 3, 2024, just six days before the fake article was published. And the registration was set for only one year. The Seattle Tribune appears to belong to a network of disinformation websites controlled by John Mark Dougan, an American living in Russia, according to Shayan Sardarizadeh, a journalist who fact checks and debunks disinformation at the BBC. He noted on social network X that creating fake local American news sites is Dougan's standard approach. That conclusion matches VOA's observations about Dougan's network. A former deputy sheriff in Florida, Dougan was charged with extortion and wiretapping in the United States. In 2016, he fled to Russia and later received political asylum there. He now operates at least 167 disinformation sites that often publish narratives serving Russian interests, according to a May 2024 investigation by NewsGuard. Dougan's sites previously attracted widespread attention for spreading a fake story claiming that Ukraine's first lady, Olena Zelenska, had purchased a $4.8 million Bugatti supercar during a visit to France for commemorations of the D-Day landing. That story seemed to be aimed at a Western audience. The fake 'Hitler car' story, however, is mostly spreading in the Russian information space. In a message on the Telegram messenger, Dougan told VOA that he was unaware of the Seattle Tribune. 'Never heard of it. But I looked it up [and] heard there's lots of great information on there. A real pillar of journalistic integrity, on par with the NYT, CNN and MSNBC,' he wrote, referring to The New York Times and two major U.S. TV news channels. As is often the case with higher-quality fakes, the phony story about Hitler's parade car combines a fictitious narrative about Zelenskyy with real facts about the sale of a former Nazi parade car in the United States. The factual information comes from an article in a real American newspaper: The Seattle Times, which reported in February 2018 that the Mercedes-Benz 770K had briefly appeared in the Seattle area after having been put up for auction in Scottsdale, Arizona, a month earlier. While the vehicle did not sell at the auction, it soon found a buyer. After that, the 'Hitler car' was briefly unloaded from a truck in the wealthy Seattle suburb of Medina, where it attracted the attention of a local resident, who told The Seattle Times about it. Later, the car was likely reloaded onto the truck and taken way. The director of the auction company Worldwide Auctioneers, Rod Egan (his name was also mentioned in the fake Seattle Tribune story), refused to tell The Seattle Times the buyer of the car, citing a non-disclosure agreement. However, Egan said the car's ultimate destination was 'very, very far away' outside the United States. The Seattle Times article also cited a German media report that six such cars were bought by a Russian billionaire in 2009. Among them was the vehicle mentioned in the fake article. The fake story about Zelenskyy and the 'Hitler car' also recalled a scene from the 2001 American comedy film 'Rat Race,' in which actor Jon Lovitz steals Hitler's parade car from a fictional museum of Nazi SS officer Klaus Barbie and then crashes it into a gathering of American World War II veterans. Asked whether he was familiar with the film and scene, Dougan replied, 'Comedy gold right there.'	https://www.voanews.com/a/russian-propagandists-push-fake-story-that-zelenskyy-bought-hitler-s-car/7818175.html	2024-10-10T15:53:50-07:00	
Kenya's national airline produces diesel fuel from plastic waste	Kenya's national airline is producing diesel fuel made from plastic waste.

Pakistan's banned PTM: A movement for Pashtun rights	washington — This week, Pakistan banned a grassroots protest movement advocating for the rights of Pashtuns, an ethnic minority inhabiting the country's northwestern region. The government in Islamabad contends the movement, known as PTM, poses a threat to national sovereignty and security, but human rights groups view the move as part of a larger crackdown on dissent. The ban, enacted Sunday under Pakistan's anti-terror law, comes as tensions are mounting ahead of a PTM-planned jirga, or council of elders, on Friday. Here is what you need to know about PTM: What is it? The Pashtun Tahafuz (Protection) Movement grew out of the turmoil of the U.S.-led war in Afghanistan and Pakistan's counterterrorism operations in the tribal region. With the 2001 U.S. invasion of Afghanistan driving the Taliban and al-Qaida into the region, the Pakistani military launched a series of operations over the next two decades to hunt down the militants. The consequences were devastating for the local population. Tens of thousands were killed, thousands were forcibly disappeared and millions more were displaced. These experiences fueled a growing sense of resentment and injustice among the Pashtuns. In response to the alleged human rights abuses by the army and extremists, a group of eight university students from the Mehsud tribe formed the Mehsud Tahafuz Movement in 2014. The movement gained national attention in 2018 after leading a 300-kilometer march to the capital to protest the killing of a Pashtun man by Pakistani police. The group then rebranded as the Pashtun Tahafuz Movement, or PTM, giving fellow Pashtuns a cause to rally around. PTM co-founder Manzoor Pashteen, known for his charismatic personality and oratorical skills, has become the face of the movement. Other key leaders include Ali Wazir and Mohsin Dawar, both of whom served as independent lawmakers in Pakistan's parliament. Along with other PTM leaders and activists, they've been repeatedly arrested on a variety of charges. How large is PTM? While there are no figures on PTM membership, it has emerged as a formidable grassroots movement in recent years. Its rallies routinely attract tens of thousands of people. What does PTM want? PTM began with a narrow set of demands, including the removal of military checkpoints, clearance of landmines and recovery of missing persons. But its campaign has evolved over the years into a broader struggle for justice, even as the government has met some of its demands. What methods does it use? Modeling itself on a British-era Pashtun civil disobedience movement, PTM uses a variety of peaceful methods such as marches, protests, processions through bazaars and open-air meetings known as jalsas. The groups have reportedly formed study circles to promote nonviolence and have called for a peace-and-reconciliation commission for justice. How does the Pakistani government view PTM? Though the movement has drawn support from other Pashtun groups, as well as progressive Pakistani activists and politicians, it has become, as one expert said, a 'thorn in the side' of Pakistan's powerful army. The army, which rejects accusations that it has committed egregious human rights abuses, views PTM as a threat to its legitimacy. As Madiha Afzal, a fellow at the Brookings Institution, noted in a 2020 report, by 'calling the army to account' and questioning its integrity, PTM effectively undermines the authority of an institution that sees itself as the guardian of the nation. But the army's hostility stems from a deeper fear: Pashtun nationalism. Pakistan, created in 1947 out of several ethnolinguistic parts of then-British India, has long been wary of 'strong ethnic loyalties,' according to Afzal. While PTM has remained peaceful, it is seen by the army as a potential threat to Pakistani sovereignty, as is a violent Baluch insurgency the army has been battling for decades. Since the early days of the movement, the army has used a variety of tactics to try to shut it down, censoring media coverage of its activities, arresting and jailing PTM leaders, and launching a disinformation campaign to brand PTM activists as traitors and terrorists supported by India and Afghanistan. But PTM has shown few signs of faltering, combining peaceful protests with legal battles and political activism while resisting the urge to turn violent. As one activist told researcher Qamar Jafri, 'We defend against attacks through resistance driven by legal activism and remaining resilient.' What is next? Human rights groups such as Amnesty International have called on Pakistan to revoke its ban on PTM. But Pakistani officials say PTM has ties to both the Afghan and Pakistani Taliban, a charge the group denies. Meanwhile, the government says PTM's planned three-day jirga will not be allowed to proceed. At least three people were killed and several others injured as police clashed with activists near the site of the gathering on Wednesday.

Russian opposition politician Kara-Murza: 'Putin must lose in Ukraine'	WASHINGTON — Russian opposition politician and journalist Vladimir Kara-Murza was released from a Russian prison on August 1 as part of a wide-ranging exchange of prisoners between Russia and several Western countries. He had been jailed in April 2022 on charges of treason for criticizing Russia's war in Ukraine. He was almost fatally poisoned twice, in 2015 and 2017. Since his release, Kara-Murza has been actively involved in the Russian opposition’s diplomatic efforts, meeting with the U.S. and French presidents and the German chancellor. During a recent visit to Washington, he sat down for interviews with Voice of America journalists. Speaking to VOA’s Ukrainian Service, he discussed the agenda that the Russian opposition is promoting in the West. The following interview has been edited for brevity and clarity. VOA: After your release, you met with [U.S.] President [Joe] Biden, [French] President [Emmanuel] Macron and [German] Chancellor [Olaf] Scholz. What was your main message to them about policy toward Russia? Vladimir Kara-Murza, Russian opposition politician: There are two main messages. The first message is that [Russian President] Vladimir Putin must lose the war in Ukraine, because if he does win, that means that in a year or a year and a half, we will be talking about another war or another Russian invasion, because this is what this man does. The second message is that the democratic nations of the free world must have a strategy. We know from the last couple of centuries of Russian history that failed wars of aggression always lead to political changes at home. Once Putin is defeated in Ukraine, there must be a prepared strategy for reintegrating a new, changed, post-Putin democratic Russia back into Europe, back into the civilized world, and back into what we call the international rules-based order. VOA: If Putin loses power, how can democratization possibly happen? Someone from his inner circle would most likely grab power. Kara-Murza: I hope he doesn't die in office and that's how it ends. I'm a Christian, and I know that everybody gets a trial up there, and so will he. But I really want that man to get a trial in this life, too. On the question of change, this is a personalistic dictatorship. It is not an ideological dictatorship like in Soviet times, with the collective Politburo, when you could replace the person at the top without replacing the regime. This system is going to collapse very quickly, as we saw in 1953 after [Josef] Stalin's death. VOA: But [Nikita] Khrushchev, who replaced Stalin, was from his inner circle; he wasn't an outsider. Kara-Murza: Even if the next leader comes from the same circle, they always base their rule on a complete denial of everything that happened before. Khrushchev was one of Stalin's closest entourage. He was the one who released millions of people from the gulag and engaged in a very incomplete, very imperfect but nevertheless de-Stalinization process that we had in the late 1950s, early 1960s — the so-called 'Thaw.' VOA: What kind of preparations should be made? How could democratic forces seize power? Kara-Murza: The domestic aspect concerns reflection and accountability, which I call a truth-and-reconciliation process. That is necessary for any society that has undergone the trauma of totalitarian rule. All the people who are responsible for the crimes against Russian citizens, like the assassination of Boris Nemtsov, the assassination of Alexei Navalny and the persecution of hundreds and hundreds of political prisoners, have to be brought to justice. All the archives and the documents of all the crimes committed must be made public. VOA: What about confronting the Russian imperialist mentality? Should Russia also confront all the crimes it has committed toward other people throughout its history? Kara-Murza: It is part of the totalitarian past, because for years and years, for decades, the regime in the Kremlin has been committing crimes against our people in Russia and against other countries, other people and other nations. Look at the aggression and the wars this regime has conducted against the Chechens, against the Georgians, against Ukraine — let's not forget, starting in 2014. Then, in Syria, of course, let's not forget [Sergei] Shoigu, [Putin’s] defense minister, boasted about new armaments they had tested — tested! — on people, on civilians in residential areas. VOA: I want to address your main argument about integrating Russia into the West after democratization and liberalization. The main argument against this would be that the West already tried that in the 1990s. Russia was part of the G8. NATO and the EU engaged with Russia. It received assistance. However, as Russia became richer, it became more aggressive. The more it became integrated with the West, the more efficient its malicious activities against the West became. Kara-Murza: Here is where I fundamentally disagree, because the whole problem is that the West did not do that in the 1990s. Yes, there were some symbolic steps, like the G8, which is just a summit meeting. But, unlike other countries of the former Warsaw Pact, Russia in the 1990s was never offered a prospect of what I would call first-tier European or Atlantic integration with tangible benefits like free trade, visa-free travel and common security guarantees. VOA: But it requires time. Ukraine still hasn't been offered NATO membership ... Kara-Murza: But the problem is that these windows of opportunity are, by definition, short and brief. They last a few months at best, and the West lost that window of opportunity in Russia in the early 1990s. We cannot allow that to happen again. In 1943, as WWII was ongoing, the U.S. government developed the Morgenthau Plan for postwar Germany. It was about dismembering, de-industrializing, humiliating and basically destroying Germany as a functioning state. Given the horrors committed at the time of the war, it was emotionally very understandable. However, leaders of Western-allied nations realized that they could not base long-term strategic policy on emotion. So, the Morgenthau Plan was abandoned in favor of the Marshall Plan, which was the exact opposite: to rebuild and reconstruct Germany after the war, to make it a successful market economy and a functioning liberal democracy. VOA: Should this happen before or after Russia pays reparations for the destruction of Ukraine? Kara-Murza: It should be simultaneous. The only way we can ensure long-term peace, stability, security and democracy on the European continent is with a democratic Russia. It's not going to happen any other way.	https://www.voanews.com/a/russian-opposition-politician-kara-murza-putin-must-lose-in-ukraine-/7818173.html	2024-10-10T15:02:47-07:00

Houthis strike tanker off Yemen, causing minor damage, no injuries	CAIRO — A Liberia-flagged tanker was struck twice with missiles and drones in the Red Sea on Thursday morning, in an attack claimed by Iran-aligned Houthi militants. The Olympic Spirit was hit about 135 kilometers southwest of the Yemeni port of Hodeidah, British maritime security firm Ambrey said. The tanker, en route from Saudi Arabia's Jeddah to Muscat in Oman, was struck on its starboard side. The projectile hit the bridge and caused minor damage, Ambrey said. Four hours later, two additional projectiles reportedly detonated within half a kilometer of the vessel’s port side. The United Kingdom Maritime Trade Operations agency said in a statement that the captain of the Olympic Spirit did not report any fires or casualties. 'The damage is minor. The vessel has some technical issues, but it is seaworthy and continues its journey,' a maritime security source said. '[The crew members] are all safe.' The vessel is proceeding to its next port of call, the British maritime agency said. Yemen's Iran-aligned Houthi movement said later Thursday it had targeted the Olympic Spirit with 11 ballistic missiles and two drones. It said that it had also targeted a vessel it identified as St. John in the Indian Ocean with a winged missile, as part of attacks it launches on global shipping over Israel's war in Gaza. Houthi fighters in Yemen have carried out nearly 100 attacks on ships crossing the Red Sea since November and say they are acting in solidarity with Palestinians in Israel's year-long war in Gaza. They have sunk two vessels, seized another and killed at least four seafarers.	https://www.voanews.com/a/houthis-strike-tanker-off-yemen-causing-minor-damage-no-injuries/7818145.html	2024-10-10T14:22:33-07:00	
Turkey evacuates upwards of 900 people from Lebanon via naval ships	BEIRUT / ISTANBUL — Hundreds of Turkish citizens seeking refuge from Israel's attacks on the armed group Hezbollah were evacuated from Lebanon Thursday on board two Turkish naval ships. The two vessels — the TCG Sancaktar and TCG Bayraktar — also delivered 300 tons of humanitarian aid, including food, blankets and tents, upon arrival at Beirut’s port on Wednesday. The Turkish Foreign Ministry said the ships are carrying 878 Turkish citizens, 24 Turkish Cypriots from northern Cyprus and 64 of their first-degree relatives. The Turkish ambassador to Lebanon, Ali Baris Ulusoy, told Turkey’s state-run Anadolu news agency on Wednesday that about 13,000 to 14,000 Turkish citizens live in Lebanon and that 2,000 Turkish citizens had applied for the latest evacuation. 'Our country will continue to extend a helping hand to the people of the region in the face of the humanitarian crisis created by the war spread by Israel in the region and will continue to take every step to protect the life and property of its citizens abroad,' Turkish Foreign Minister Hakan Fidan wrote on social media platform X. Fidan noted that Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan gave the evacuation order. After a period of relative calm, Hezbollah began firing rockets at Israel following Hamas' October 7, 2023, terror attack on Israel, displacing tens of thousands of people on both sides of the border and leading to the current escalation. The conflict between Israel and Hezbollah recently intensified, with Israel launching a ground operation in south Lebanon and bombing Beirut's southern suburbs. Eyup Sabri Kirgiz, a Turkish engineer who has lived in Lebanon since 2003, was among the Turkish citizens who waited at the Beirut port to be evacuated. Kirgiz said that Lebanon was never calm but that it was manageable until the recent escalation. 'Where we live is close to the area that was bombed. Each time a bomb was dropped, the house shook, the windows opened and the doors made noise. I have two children, my wife and mother-in-law. So, we could not stand it anymore,' Kirgiz told VOA’s Turkish Service before boarding one of the ships in Beirut with his family, two dogs and a turtle. 'There is nowhere else to go. For instance, if you go somewhere else, the rent is four or five times higher than it used to be, and they also ask for four or five months of rent up front. Lebanon is already in crisis. Thank God, our state has taken care of us,' Kirgiz said. Kirgiz also said that he and his family want to return to Lebanon when things get better. 'My job and everything are here,' he said. 'My children were born here. They grew up here. So, they feel like they are half Lebanese and half Turkish.' Several people with dual Lebanese and Turkish citizenship were among the evacuees. Maya, a 20-year-old Lebanese Turkish woman who did not give her surname, was waiting with her family to board the ship and said she is grateful to Turkey for taking its citizens out of Lebanon. 'We were living under great pressure and in difficult conditions. We have to leave our university and our home in Lebanon and go to Turkey,' Maya told VOA’s Turkish Service. 'There was so much bombardment, it was absolutely impossible to sleep because of the noise. Thank God, nothing happened to our house,' she said, adding that she and her family aim to return to Lebanon when the situation calms down. Turkey's Ministry of National Defense announced that the ships are expected to reach port in Turkey's southern Mersin province on Thursday. The voyage on the Mediterranean Sea is expected to take about 12 hours. In a statement shared on X, the ministry also noted that two frigates and two patrol ships will escort the naval ships for protection. A source in the Turkish Foreign Ministry said that Turkey is collecting the names of its citizens who want to leave Lebanon for further evacuation efforts. According to the Turkish Embassy in Lebanon, Ankara is also planning to organize a limited number of charter flights from Beirut to Istanbul or Adana. Hundreds of people of different nationalities have fled Lebanon through a commercial ferry line that operates twice a week from Tripoli port to Turkey's Tasucu port in southern Mersin province. The United States also has evacuated more than 1,000 U.S. citizens and their dependents via U.S.-chartered flights arriving in Turkey. In an interview in Istanbul, U.S. Consul General Julie Eadeh said, 'It's the fastest, safest way to get Americans out of harm's way. 'The security situation is dynamic, so we have been planning for months for all contingencies. Given the airport in Beirut remains operational and open, our focus is on facilitating departures by air,' Eadeh said. According to another U.S. official, reported by the Reuters news agency, 10 of 12 U.S. chartered flights from Beirut have arrived in Istanbul carrying 1,025 citizens and immediate family members since October 2. Reuters also reported that U.S. citizens and those arriving on chartered flights from some other Western countries must continue onward from Turkey within 72 hours of arrival under an agreement with Ankara. Two other U.S.-chartered flights arrived in Frankfurt, Germany, and Doha, Qatar, and U.S. authorities expect to continue providing such flights for remaining U.S. citizens who wish to leave Lebanon.

2 Pakistani police, 4 insurgents killed ahead of Asian security summit	PESHAWAR, Pakistan — Militants opened fire on a police vehicle and killed two officers on Thursday in restive northwest Pakistan before fleeing the scene, police said, a sign of increasing violence ahead of a summit of an Asian security grouping in the capital, Islamabad. Hours later, the military said it killed four militants in North Waziristan, a district in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa province bordering Afghanistan. The latest attack on police happened in the city of Tank, also in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa, local police official Sher Afzal said. No group has claimed responsibility, but suspicion is likely to fall on the Pakistani Taliban, known as the Tehreek-e-Taliban Pakistan or TTP, who often target security forces. The TTP are outlawed in Pakistan. They are separate from but a close ally of the Afghan Taliban who control neighboring Afghanistan. Pakistan has witnessed a surge in militant violence in recent months. On Wednesday, a suicide bomber dispatched by the Baloch Liberation Army, an outlawed separatist group, struck a convoy carrying Chinese nationals outside an airport in Karachi on Sunday, killing two engineers and wounding another. The latest violence comes ahead of the summit of the Shanghai Cooperation Organization, which will take place in Islamabad on October 15. The Asian group was established in 2001 by China and Russia to discuss security concerns in Central Asia. Its other members are Iran, India, Pakistan, Kazakhstan, Kyrgyzstan, Tajikistan and Uzbekistan. The killing of the Chinese has drawn condemnation from Pakistan's leaders. On Thursday, President Asif Ali Zardari visited the Chinese Embassy in Islamabad, where he met with Ambassador Jiang Zaidong to offer condolences. Zardari denounced the attack and promised that those behind it would be punished, a government statement said. Also on Thursday, Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesperson Mao Ning told a news conference in Beijing that 'China will work with Pakistan to protect the safety and security of Chinese personnel, projects and institutions in Pakistan.' But she said she didn't know if the movement of the Chinese nationals was being restricted because of the summit. Security in Islamabad was beefed up, with the authorities deploying troops, shutting schools and closing two restaurants on the road that will take guests from the airport to the summit venue. Thursday's developments came a day after at least three people were killed in clashes in the northwestern town of Jamrud between police and supporters of a banned organization, the Pashtun Protection Movement, or PTM, which authorities say supports TTP. The government has also barred PTM from holding rallies in the northwest, allegedly because the demonstrations are against the interests of Pakistan. PTM denies backing the Pakistani Taliban, and tension was growing Thursday after the group vowed to resist the ban on its rallies.	https://www.voanews.com/a/pakistani-police-4-insurgents-killed-in-the-restive-northwest-ahead-of-asian-security-summit/7818101.html	2024-10-10T13:44:54-07:00	
Indonesia arrests suspect wanted by China for running $14 billion investment scam	JAKARTA, Indonesia — Indonesia's immigration officers on the tourist island of Bali have arrested a Chinese suspect sought by Beijing for helping run over $14 billion investment scam to clients in China, officials said Thursday. The 39-year-old man, identified only by his initial, LQ, was arrested on October 1, when an immigration auto-gate in Bali's Ngurah Rai international airport denied him departure for Singapore. The biometric data in the computer registry at the airport identified him as a suspect wanted by Beijing, which led to his arrest, according to Silmy Karim, the immigration chief at Indonesia's law and human rights ministry. He had been listed on an Interpol warrant since late September. The suspect first arrived in Bali from Singapore with a Turkish passport as Joe Lin on September 26, just a day before Interpol released a so-called Red Notice for him, a request to law enforcement agencies worldwide to detain or arrest a suspect wanted by a specific country. Indonesian authorities brought the suspect, wearing a detainee's orange shirt and a facemask, before reporters to a news conference Thursday in the capital of Jakarta. The suspect did not make any statements and was not asked any questions. 'He was wrong to use Indonesia as a transit country, let alone as a destination country to hide,' said Karim, lauding technological advances and cooperation between immigration and the national police. Krishna Murti, the chief of the international division of the National Police, said the decision to deport or to extradite the suspect to China will take some time. Indonesia needs to confirm whether he has truly become a Turkish citizen in the meantime or if he used a fake passport to enter Indonesia. 'We have to respect the suspect's rights,' Murti said, adding that the suspect has not committed any violations inside Indonesia. The man was named as a suspect by Beijing, which requested the Red Notice from Interpol, after he allegedly collected more than 100 billion Chinese Yuan ($14 billion) from more than 50,000 people in a Ponzi scheme. Indonesia, an archipelago nation on the crossroads between Asia and the South Pacific, is attractive to local, regional and global organized crime because of its geographical location and its multi-cultural society. Last month, Indonesia arrested Alice Guo, a fugitive former mayor of a town in the Philippines accused of having links to Chinese criminal syndicates. She has since been deported to the Philippines. In June, Chaowalit Thongduang, one of Thailand's most wanted fugitives, was escorted back to Thailand on a Thai air force plane after being arrested in Bali following months on the run in connection with several killings and drug trafficking charges in his homeland.	https://www.voanews.com/a/indonesia-arrests-a-suspect-wanted-by-china-for-running-a-14-billion-investment-scam/7818080.html	2024-10-10T13:17:26-07:00	
China to lift 4-year ban on Australian lobster imports, Australia's prime minister says	MELBOURNE, Australia — China will resume importing Australian live lobsters by the end of the year, removing the final major obstacle to bilateral trade that once cost Australian exporters more than 20 billion Australian dollars ($13 billion) a year, Australia's prime minister said Thursday. Prime Minister Anthony Albanese made the announcement after meeting Premier Li Qiang on the sidelines of a Southeast Asian summit in Vientiane, Laos. The ban on lobsters was the last of a series of official and unofficial trade barriers that Beijing has agreed to lift since Albanese's center-left Labor Party government was elected in 2022. 'I'm pleased to announce that Premier Li and I have agreed on a timetable to resume full lobster trade by the end of this year,' Albanese told reporters. 'This of course will be in time for Chinese New Year, and this will be welcomed by the people engaged in the live lobster industry,' he added. Albanese has given assurances that relations with China have been improved without compromising Australian interests. Beijing is unhappy with restrictions Australia has placed on some Chinese investments because of security concerns. 'What's important is that friends are able to have direct discussions. It doesn't imply agreement, it doesn't imply compliance, and I'll always represent Australia's national interest. That's what I did today. It was a very constructive meeting,' Albanese said. 'I'm encouraged by the progress that we have made between Australia and China's relationship in producing stabilization to the benefit of both of our nations and with the objective of advancing peace and security in the region,' Albanese added. China's embassy in Australia did not immediately respond to a request for comment on Thursday. Australian lobster exports to China had been worth $700 million Australian dollars ($470 million) in 2019. Beijing ended trade with Australia in 2020 on a range of commodities including lobster, coal, wine, barley, beef and wood as diplomatic relations plumbed new depths. Conservative Prime Minister Scott Morrison had angered Beijing that year by demanding an independent investigation into the origins of and responses to the COVID-19 pandemic. Tom Ryan, a manager at lobster exporter Five Star Seafoods at Port MacDonnell in South Australia state, said he was disappointed that his trade would be the last to resume with China. 'It's been a long time coming,' Ryan told Australian Broadcasting Corp. of Albanese's announcement. 'Between myself and other people in Port MacDonnell, it's an absolute relief,' he added. The industry had found new markets for lobster products but at lower profit margins, Ryan said. Li said during a state visit to Australia in June that he had agreed with Albanese to 'properly manage' their nations' differences. Beijing had severed minister-to-minister contacts during the conservatives' nine years in power.	https://www.voanews.com/a/china-to-lift-4-year-ban-on-australian-lobster-imports-australia-s-prime-minister-says-/7818067.html	2024-10-10T13:05:15-07:00

Police investigate shooting near Israeli target in Sweden; no injuries reported	STOCKHOLM — Swedish police said on Thursday they were investigating a shooting near an Israeli target in the city of Gothenburg, which the national broadcaster said was a unit of Israeli defense electronics firm Elbit Systems. Police said in a statement it had apprehended a young suspect at the scene and launched a probe into suspected attempted murder and serious weapons crimes. They did not identify the company, but Elbit Systems Sweden CEO Tobias Wennberg told Reuters there had been a serious incident outside its premises on Thursday, adding that no one was injured in the incident. 'Elbit Systems Sweden otherwise has no knowledge of the incident. Our operations continue as usual,' he said in an email. A police spokesperson said there was only one suspect, and investigators were not aware of any concrete threats against other Israeli targets in the city on Sweden's west coast. The suspect is under 15 years of age, public broadcaster SVT and other Swedish media reported, without identifying their sources. The Israeli Embassy in Stockholm did not immediately respond to a request for comment. Swedish police in May said they had stepped up security around Israeli and Jewish interests in the Nordic country after officers on patrol heard suspected gunshots near Israel's embassy in Stockholm. Sweden has seen an epidemic of gun violence in recent years, driven by criminal gangs feuding over drugs and other illicit activities.	https://www.voanews.com/a/police-investigate-shooting-near-israeli-target-in-sweden-no-injuries-reported-/7818029.html	2024-10-10T12:45:10-07:00	
Florida residents take shelter, lean on federal program for assistance	When major disasters like hurricanes and floods hit the United States, the Federal Emergency Management Agency, or FEMA, coordinates major rescue efforts that would overwhelm local officials.

Hurricane disinformation leads to danger, experts say	WASHINGTON — Disinformation and conspiracy theories have spread quickly in response to natural disasters in the southeastern United States, creating distrust in the government response, according to the head of the Federal Emergency Management Agency. 'It is absolutely the worst I have ever seen,' FEMA Administrator Deanne Criswell told reporters on a Tuesday call. The spread of lies surrounding the natural disasters comes at a time when social media infrastructure will allow 'virtually any claim' to amplify and spread, experts say. Hurricane Helene left more than 200 people dead and many more injured or without power, and Hurricane Milton has left at least four dead after ravaging Florida, according to the Associated Press. Some frequently spread falsehoods include accusations that FEMA prevented Florida evacuations and claims that funding for storm victims was instead given to undocumented migrants. Such misinformation is 'demoralizing' to first responders, Criswell said in the press call. Additionally, the fabrications could put first responders and residents of impacted areas in even more danger, according to Matthew Baum, a Harvard University professor who focuses on fake news and misinformation. 'When you're talking about life-and-death situations, [misinformation] can cause people not to take advantage of help that's available to them, and it can also be dangerous for first responders who are being accused of all sorts of badness,' Baum told VOA. 'And if first responders start to worry about their own safety, that's going to undermine how they do their jobs.' Many of the other falsehoods stem from former President Donald Trump’s campaign and allies. In an October 3 rally, the former president falsely claimed that the Biden-Harris administration was diverting FEMA funding to house illegal migrants. Last week, Representative Marjorie Taylor Greene, a Republican from Georgia, claimed that 'they control the weather' in a post on social media platform X, formerly Twitter. She did not specify who 'they' are. To combat popular conspiracies surrounding hurricane relief efforts, FEMA launched a 'Hurricane Rumor Response' webpage to 'help correct rumors and provide accurate information,' according to a press release. Baum, however, told VOA that those who believe the false claims may not be swayed by the government-funded website, as they are already 'deep down the rabbit hole of conspiratorial thinking.' 'I don’t think the website will have a significant effect, but it’s still worth doing because journalists read it and having that information out there gets it into the news ecosystem,' Baum said. 'But fundamentally, it's not likely to reach many of the people that are at risk of being harmed by this disinformation.' FEMA put up a similar rumor response webpage during the 2020 coronavirus pandemic. On social media platforms such as X, misinformation tends to spread faster than true stories, a 2018 MIT study found. False news stories are 70% more likely to be reposted than true ones are. Media scholar Matt Jordan told VOA the vast amount of disinformation circulating is part of a 'firehose of falsehood' strategy, in which bad actors publish so much 'garbage' that people don’t know what to believe. 'It's a way of eliminating the capacity for the press to help generate democratic consensus by just putting so much garbage into the zone,' the Penn State professor said. U.S. President Joe Biden said during a Tuesday morning briefing that this misinformation 'misleads' the public. 'It’s un-American, it really is,' he said in his remarks. 'People are scared to death; people know their lives are at stake.'	https://www.voanews.com/a/hurricane-disinformation-leads-to-danger-experts-say/7817837.html	2024-10-10T10:37:33-07:00	
Cameroonians wait for news on president, said to be alive in Geneva	Yaounde, Cameroon — The condition and exact whereabouts of Cameroon’s President Paul Biya remain unclear Thursday, two days after the government was forced to announce Biya was alive in Geneva, Switzerland, in response to rumors on social media that he had died. Biya has not been seen in public for more than five weeks, since he attended the Africa-China forum in Beijing in early September. Cameroon's Territorial Administration minister Paul Atanga Nji told residents of Massock, a village near the Atlantic coast, that Biya dispatched him to provide humanitarian assistance to victims of floods sweeping across the central African state. Nji, like many Cameroon senior state functionaries, told civilians that Biya is in good health, and that information circulating on social and mainstream media about the 91-year-old president's death is being spread by people who want to see Cameroon devolve into chaos. 'The president of our nation Cameroon cannot be dead,' Gregory Mewano, a member of Biya’s Cameroon People’s Democratic Movement party, said Thursday on Cameroon state radio. 'And you find the prime minister in Germany with a whole entourage, the minister of interior taking care of internal politics and the minister of public works inspecting projects.' Officials say Biya will return to Cameroon soon, but they have not said when. There was no indication he was unwell in Beijing. He was scheduled to attend a meeting of French and African leaders in Paris afterward, but he did not appear, and no reason was given for his absence. Cameroon opposition and civil society groups say they are concerned about Biya's absence and health, and ask government officials to present Biya to civilians instead of simply saying he is alive. With elections only a year away, some groups say it is time to begin thinking about a new, much younger candidate who could take the country forward. 'We have had to make it clear to both national and international opinions that a number of opposition political parties are … consulting with regards to the happenings of Cameroon, and this rumor [about Biya’s death] is not an exception,' said Michael Ngwese Eke Ekosso, president of the opposition United Socialist Democratic Party. 'Decisions will be arrived at with regards to the upcoming presidential elections.' Some opposition political parties have proposed uniting behind Akere Muna, an English-speaking anti-corruption lawyer and good governance crusader, as a candidate in the October 2025 presidential election. Muna, who is 72, said if elected, he would launch a three-year transitional period to lift Cameroon from Biya's iron-fisted 42-year rule. 'Our profound reflection is that a non-renewable transition is essential,' Muna said. 'The vision we are proposing is to strengthen democracy and governance, adopt a new constitution that incarnates the present and future aspirations of the people of Cameroon, and promote free and fair elections.' If elected, Muna would be Cameroon’s first leader from the western regions where English is the primary language. His supporters say having a president from that area may help end a seven-year insurgency by English-speaking armed groups, who say English-speakers in Cameroon are marginalized by the French-speaking majority. Opposition parties blame Biya for not being able to solve the crisis. Meanwhile, Cameroonians of all parties wait anxiously for concrete signs that Biya is alive and will be returning to his country.	https://www.voanews.com/a/cameroonians-wait-for-news-on-president-said-to-be-alive-in-geneva/7817801.html	2024-10-10T10:03:38-07:00	
Blinken builds ties with Thailand, Malaysia after turbulence	VIENTIANE, LAOS — U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken voiced hope Thursday for cooperation with Thailand and Malaysia after recent turbulence as he met their prime ministers at an Asia summit. In a shift of focus after exhaustive diplomacy on the Middle East crisis, Blinken is representing the United States in Laos at the annual East Asia Summit, which President Joe Biden is skipping for the second straight year. Blinken met Thai Prime Minister Paetongtarn Shinawatra, the 38-year-old heir of a political dynasty who took over a month ago after her predecessor was ousted and the main opposition party dissolved. Blinken said the United States hoped to work with Shinawatra to 'focus on things that we can do to better the lives of our people,' including on the economy, security and climate change. 'The two countries have such an extraordinary history together, and we simply want to build on it,' Blinken told her. Shinawatra told Blinken of northern Thailand's recent deadly floods and voiced support for long-term relations with the United States. Thailand is the oldest U.S. ally in Asia, but Washington has repeatedly criticized its record on democracy, although usually gently. The State Department voiced alarm in August after a Thai court dissolved the reformist Move Forward Party and banned from politics the kingdom's most popular politician, Pita Limjaroenrat. Blinken, wearing a dark blue, traditional Laotian jacket, later met separately with Malaysian Prime Minister Anwar Ibrahim, who has been a vocal critic of U.S. support for Israel. Neither mentioned the Middle East in brief remarks in the presence of reporters, with Blinken instead noting that the United States is the top foreign investor in Malaysia. 'I think this is a tremendous sign of both trust and confidence, because the investments don't happen unless there's tremendous confidence in the country,' Blinken told Anwar. U.S. officials privately say that they understand the political pressure in the Muslim-majority country and that they seek a cooperative relationship with Anwar, who enjoyed strong advocacy from Washington when he was controversially imprisoned. Thailand has taken a lead at the Laos summit in seeking diplomatic progress on the crisis engulfing its neighbor Myanmar, whose military junta sent a representative to a top-level Southeast Asian gathering for the first time in more than three years. The United States, while backing diplomatic efforts, said it would press for sustained pressure on the junta, seeing no progress on key concerns such as freeing political prisoners and reducing violence. Blinken, who met two weeks ago with his Chinese counterpart in New York, will also back efforts by Southeast Asia to raise concerns with Beijing about its actions in the South China Sea. The summit marks a rare occasion in which Blinken is in the same room as Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov, but no talks between the two are expected. The Biden administration, including presidential nominee Vice President Kamala Harris, has ruled out talks with Russia on its invasion of Ukraine without involving Kyiv.	https://www.voanews.com/a/blinken-builds-ties-with-thailand-malaysia-after-turbulence/7817731.html	2024-10-10T09:17:01-07:00	
Ethel Kennedy, social activist and widow of Robert F. Kennedy, dies at 96	Boston, Massachusetts — Ethel Kennedy, the widow of Sen. Robert F. Kennedy who raised their 11 children after he was assassinated and remained dedicated to social causes and the family's legacy for decades thereafter, died on Thursday, her family said. She was 96. Kennedy had been hospitalized after suffering a stroke in her sleep on Oct. 3, her family said. 'It is with our hearts full of love that we announce the passing of our amazing grandmother,' Joe Kennedy III posted on X. 'She died this morning from complications related to a stroke suffered last week.' 'Along with a lifetime's work in social justice and human rights, our mother leaves behind nine children, 34 grandchildren and 24 great-great grandchildren along with numerous nieces and nephews, all of whom love her dearly,' the family statement said. The Kennedy matriarch, whose children were Kathleen, Joseph II, Robert Jr., David, Courtney, Michael, Kerry, Christopher, Max, Douglas and Rory, was one of the last remaining members of a generation that included President John F. Kennedy. Her family said she had recently enjoyed seeing many of her relatives, before falling ill. A millionaire's daughter who married the future senator and attorney general in 1950, Ethel Kennedy had endured more death by the age of 40, for the whole world to see, than most would in a lifetime. She was by Robert F. Kennedy's side when he was fatally shot in the kitchen of the Ambassador Hotel in Los Angeles on June 5, 1968, just after winning the Democratic presidential primary in California. Her brother-in-law, President John F. Kennedy, had been assassinated in Dallas less than five years earlier. Her parents were killed in a plane crash in 1955, and her brother died in a 1966 crash. Her son David Kennedy later died of a drug overdose, son Michael Kennedy in a skiing accident and nephew John F. Kennedy Jr. in a plane crash. Another nephew, Michael Skakel, was found guilty of murder in 2002, although a judge in 2013 ordered a new trial and the Connecticut Supreme Court vacated his conviction in 2018. In 2019, she was grieving again after granddaughter Saoirse Kennedy Hill died of an apparent drug overdose. 'One wonders how much this family must be expected to absorb,' family friend Philip Johnson, founder of the Robert F. Kennedy Foundation, told the Boston Herald after Michael Kennedy's death. Ethel Kennedy sustained herself through her faith and devotion to family. 'She was a devout Catholic and a daily communicant, and we are comforted in knowing she is reunited with the love of her life, our father, Robert. F. Kennedy; her children David and Michael; her daughter-in-law Mary; her grandchildren Maeve and Saorise and her great-grandchildren Gideon and Josie. Please keep our mother in your hearts and prayers,' the family statement said. Ethel's mother-in-law, Rose Fitzgerald Kennedy, initially worried about how she would handle so much tragedy. 'I knew how difficult it was going to be for her to raise that big family without the guiding role and influence that Bobby would have provided,' Rose recalled in her memoir, 'Times to Remember.' 'And, of course, she realized this too, fully and keenly. Yet she did not give way.' She founded the Robert F. Kennedy Center for Justice and Human Rights soon after husband's death and advocated for causes including gun control and human rights. She rarely spoke about her husband's assassination. When her filmmaker daughter, Rory, brought it up in the 2012 HBO documentary, 'Ethel,' she couldn't share her grief. 'When we lost Daddy ...' she began, then teared up and asked that her youngest daughter 'talk about something else.' Presidential Medal of Freedom In 2008, she joined brother-in-law Ted Kennedy and niece Caroline Kennedy in endorsing Sen. Barack Obama for president, likening him to her late husband. She made several trips to the White House during the Obama years, receiving the Presidential Medal of Freedom in 2014 and meeting Pope Francis in 2015. Many of her progeny became well known. Daughter Kathleen became lieutenant governor of Maryland; Joseph represented Massachusetts in Congress; Courtney married Paul Hill, who had been wrongfully convicted of an IRA bombing; Kerry became a human rights activist and president of the RFK center; Christopher ran for governor of Illinois; Max served as a prosecutor in Philadelphia and Douglas reported for Fox News Channel. Her son Robert F. Kennedy Jr., also became a national figure, although not as a liberal in the family tradition. First known as an environmental lawyer, he evolved into a conspiracy theorist who spread false theories about vaccines. He ran for president as an independent after briefly challenging President Joe Biden, and his name remained on ballots in multiple states after he suspended his campaign and endorsed Donald Trump. Ethel Kennedy did not comment publicly on her son's actions, although several other family members denounced him. Decades earlier, she seemed to thrive on her in-laws' rising power. She was an enthusiastic backer of JFK's 1960 run and during the Kennedy administration hosted some of the era's most well-attended parties at their Hickory Hill estate in McLean, Virginia, including one where historian Arthur M. Schlesinger Jr. was pushed fully clothed into the swimming pool. In the Kennedy spirit, she also was known as an avid and highly competitive tennis player and a compulsive planner. 'Petite and peppy Ethel, who doesn't look one bit the outdoorsy type, considers outdoor activity so important for the children that she has arranged her busy Cabinet-wife schedule so she can personally take them on two daily outings,' The Washington Post reported in 1962. In February of that year, she accompanied her husband on a round-the-world goodwill tour, stopping in Japan, Hong Kong, Italy and other countries. She said it was important for Americans to meet ordinary people overseas. 'People have a distinct liking for Americans,' she told the Post. 'But the Communists have been so vocal, it was a surprise for some Asians to hear America's point of view. It is good for Americans to travel and get our viewpoint across.' Kennedy was born Ethel Skakel on April 11, 1928, in Chicago, the sixth of seven children of coal magnate George Skakel and Ann Brannack Skakel, a devout Roman Catholic. She grew up in a 31-room English country manor house in Greenwich, Connecticut, and attended Greenwich Academy before graduating from the Convent of the Sacred Heart in the Bronx in 1945. She met Robert Kennedy through his sister Jean, her roommate at Manhattanville College in New York. They moved to Charlottesville, Virginia, where he finished his last year of law school at the University of Virginia, and then in 1957, they bought Hickory Hill from by John and Jacqueline Kennedy, who had bought it in 1953. Robert Kennedy became chief counsel to the Senate Select Committee in 1957. He later was appointed attorney general by his brother, the newly elected President Kennedy. She had supported her husband in his successful 1964 campaign for the U.S. Senate in New York and his subsequent presidential bid. Pregnant with their 11th child when he was gunned down by Sirhan Sirhan, her look of shock and horror was captured by photographers in images that remained indelible decades later. The assassination traumatized the family, especially son David Kennedy, who watched the news in a hotel room. He was just days before his 13th birthday and never recovered, struggling with addiction problems for years and overdosing in 1984. In 2021, she said Sirhan Sirhan should not be released from prison, a view not shared by some others in her family. Two years later, a California panel denied him parole. Although Ethel Kennedy was linked to several men after her husband's death, most notably singer Andy Williams, she never remarried. In April 2008, Ethel Kennedy visited Indianapolis on the 40th anniversary of the assassination of the Rev. Martin Luther King Jr. A monument there commemorated King's death and the speech her husband had given that night in 1968, which was credited with averting rioting in the city. 'Of all the Kennedy women, she was the one I would end up admiring the most,' Harry Belafonte would write of her. 'She wasn't playacting. She looked at you and immediately got what you were about. Often in the coming years, when Bobby was balking at something we wanted him to do for the movement, I'd take my case to Ethel. 'We have to talk to him,' she'd say, and she would.' Ethel Kennedy joined President Obama and former President Bill Clinton — each held one of her hands — as they climbed stairs to lay a wreath at President Kennedy's gravesite during a November 2013 observance of the 50th anniversary of JFK's death. The nonprofit center she founded remains dedicated to advancing human rights through litigation, advocacy, education and inspiration, giving annual awards to journalists, authors and others who have made significant contributions to human rights. She also was active in the Coalition of Gun Control, Special Olympics, and the Earth Conservation Corps. And she showed up in person, participating in a 2016 demonstration in support of higher pay for farmworkers in Florida and a 2018 hunger strike against the Trump administration's immigration policies. Hickory Hill was sold in 2009 for $8.25 million, and Ethel Kennedy divided her time between homes in Hyannis Port, Massachusetts, and Palm Beach, Florida.	https://www.voanews.com/a/ethel-kennedy-social-activist-and-widow-of-robert-f-kennedy-dies-at-96/7817743.html	2024-10-10T09:08:25-07:00	
Bangladeshi Hindus voice fear, anxiety as Durga Puja begins	WASHINGTON — Sharadiya Durga Puja, the largest Hindu festival in Bangladesh, started Wednesday under a cloud of concern following recent acts of vandalism. Reports of idol desecration in various regions have raised concerns about the safety of religious minorities. On Tuesday, vandals damaged five idols at the Sajjankanda District Road Transport Owner Oikya Parishad temple in Rajbari. This is the latest incident of vandalism of Durga idols reported in the media. Ranadash Dasgupta, the Bangladesh Hindu Buddhist Christian Unity Council’s general secretary, told VOA, 'In the last 15 days, idols of Durga Puja have been damaged in 19 Puja [ritual prayer] pavilions in 14 districts of the country.' Dasgupta said Hindu minorities are worshipping in fear of attacks. 'The minority community is in a sense of trauma. While they want to celebrate Puja, they also feel the risk of attack,’ he said. Longtime lawyer Subrata Chowdhury said attacks on Hindu minorities have been taking place since the country became independent. 'The first attacks on Durga idols took place in Chattogram and Dhaka in 1972. Since then, hundreds of such attacks have taken place. Justice was not ensured in any of these incidents and perpetrators not identified,' Chowdhury told VOA. According to a report by Ain O Salish Kendro, a Dhaka-based human rights organization, there were 12 attacks on religious minorities, 17 temples set on fire, five people injured and three homes attacked in 2022. In 2023, there were 22 incidents of violence, 43 idols vandalized, five reported home invasions and 19 people injured. 'Law enforcers have failed miserably here,' Chowdhurry said, 'and we saw the judiciary's reluctance to ensure fair trial over such incidents.' Dasgupta said that violence against Hindu minorities continues because attackers face no consequences. Heightened security in Puja pavilions Army Chief General Waker-uz-Zaman announced on October 5 that the Bangladeshi Army has made extensive preparations to ensure security during Durga Puja. The interim government has issued directives to maintain order, including deploying police, the Rapid Action Battalion and all local forces. Inspector General of Police Mohammad Moinul Islam confirmed increased security at 31,000 festivals. Several arrests have been made, and police officials in Barisal, Pabna and Kishoreganj have been removed following vandalism incidents. Special Assistant to the Chief Adviser Mahfuz Alam said Tuesday that action would be taken on complaints and that financial assistance would be provided to those affected. But recent reports of vandalism have left many unsatisfied with the security measures. Moni Mitra, who works for an online news outlet in Dhaka, said, 'Every year before the start of Puja, we get reports of attacks in different parts of the country. This time too was no exception. We want to perform the Puja without fear. This is what we as a citizen of the country want from the government.' Concern in India over safety of minorities India has voiced concerns about idol vandalism and the safety of Hindus in Bangladesh. Indian Ministry of External Affairs spokesperson Randhir Jaiswal said on October 4 that concerns for minority safety include Durga Puja and Vijayadashami. He urged the Bangladeshi government to ensure security for minority communities. In response, Bangladeshi Foreign Adviser Md Touhid Hosasin said Bangladesh will address any attacks on puja mandaps without foreign interference. The Indian government on several other occasions expressed concerns over the safety and security of minorities in Bangladesh since the fall of the Sheikh Hasina-led government on August 5. At a news conference on September 18, the Bangladesh Hindu Buddhist Christian Unity Council reported 2,010 incidents of communal violence across the country from August 4 to 20. They included nine deaths, four rapes or gang rapes, and attacks on 69 places of worship, which were vandalized or set on fire. Additionally, 953 businesses were attacked, vandalized, looted, or burned. The organization also reported 38 cases of physical assault and 21 instances of illegal land and business seizures. US concerned, too Concerns about the safety of religious minorities in Bangladesh were also raised by the United States. On September 20, the chairs of the U.S. Senate Foreign Relations Committee — Senators Ben Cardin, Chris Murphy, Chris Van Hollen and Jeff Merkley — wrote to the chief adviser of the interim government, urging stronger law enforcement and prompt action against those responsible for attacks on vulnerable communities, including Hindus. On September 26, U.S. Secretary of State Anthony Blinken met with Chief Adviser Muhammad Yunus. They discussed strengthening the partnership between the countries and highlighted the need to protect human rights for all Bangladeshis, particularly minority communities.

US inflation reaches lowest point since February 2021, though price pressures remain	WASHINGTON — Inflation in the United States dropped last month to its lowest point since it first began surging more than three years ago, adding to a spate of encouraging economic news in the closing weeks of the presidential race. Consumer prices rose 2.4% in September from a year earlier, down from 2.5% in August, and the smallest annual rise since February 2021. Measured from month to month, prices increased 0.2% from August to September, the Labor Department reported Thursday, the same as in the previous month. But excluding volatile food and energy costs, 'core' prices, a gauge of underlying inflation, remained elevated in September, driven higher by rising costs for medical care, clothing, auto insurance and airline fares. Core prices in September were up 3.3% from a year earlier and 0.3% from August. Economists closely watch core prices, which typically provide a better hint of future inflation. Taken as a whole, the September figures show that inflation is steadily easing back to the Fed's 2% target, even if in a gradual and uneven pattern. Apartment rental costs grew more slowly last month, a sign that housing inflation is finally cooling, a long-awaited development that would provide relief to many consumers. Overall inflation last month was held down by a big drop in gas prices, which fell 4.1% from August to September. Grocery prices jumped 0.4% last month, after roughly a year of mild increases, though they're 1.3% higher than a year earlier. Restaurant food prices increased 0.3% last month and are up 3.9% in the past year. And clothing prices rose 1.1% from August to September and are up 1.8% from a year ago. The improving inflation picture follows a mostly healthy jobs report released last week, which showed that hiring accelerated in September and that the unemployment rate dropped from 4.2% to 4.1%. The government has also reported that the economy expanded at a solid 3% annual rate in the April-June quarter. Growth likely continued at roughly that pace in the just-completed July-September quarter. Cooling inflation, solid hiring and healthy growth could erode former President Donald Trump's advantage on the economy in the presidential campaign as measured by public opinion polls. In some surveys, Vice President Kamala Harris has pulled even with Trump on the issue of who would best handle the economy, after Trump had decisively led President Joe Biden on the issue. At the same time, most voters still give the economy relatively poor marks, mostly because of the cumulative rise in prices over the past three years. For the Fed, last week's much-stronger-than-expected jobs report fueled some concern that the economy might not be cooling enough to slow inflation sufficiently. The central bank reduced its key rate by an outsized half-point last month, its first rate cut of any size in four years. The Fed's policymakers also signaled that they envisioned two additional quarter-point rate cuts in November and December. In remarks this week, a slew of Fed officials have said they're still willing to keep cutting their key rate but at a deliberate pace, a signal that any further half-point cuts are unlikely. The Fed 'should not rush to reduce' its benchmark rate 'but rather should proceed gradually,' Lorie Logan, president of the Federal Reserve's Dallas branch, said in a speech Wednesday. Inflation in the United States and many countries in Europe and Latin America surged in the economic recovery from the pandemic, as COVID closed factories and clogged supply chains. Russia's invasion of Ukraine worsened energy and food shortages, pushing inflation higher. It peaked at 9.1% in the U.S. in June 2022. Economists at Goldman Sachs projected earlier this week that core inflation will drop to 3% by December 2024. And few analysts expect inflation to surge again unless conflicts in the Middle East worsen dramatically. Though higher prices have soured many Americans on the economy, wages and incomes are now rising faster than costs and should make it easier for households to adapt. Last month, the Census Bureau reported that inflation-adjusted median household incomes — the level at which half of households are above and half below — rose 4% in 2023, enough to return incomes back to their pre-pandemic peak. In response to higher food prices, many consumers have shifted their spending from name brands to private labels or have started shopping more at discount stores. Those changes have put more pressure on packaged foods companies, for example, to slow their price hikes. This week, PepsiCo reported that its sales volumes fell after it imposed steep price increases on its drinks and snacks.	https://www.voanews.com/a/us-inflation-reaches-lowest-point-since-february-2021-though-price-pressures-remain-/7817555.html	2024-10-10T07:30:10-07:00	
Prayer camps in Nigeria attract 'miracle seekers'	The power of simple prayer to heal illness is not clear, according to scientists, and is difficult to study.

Uzbekistan accepts ambassador from Taliban-led Afghanistan	Islamabad, Pakistan — Afghanistan’s Taliban said Thursday that Uzbekistan had accepted their appointed ambassador, and both sides marked the action as an important advancement in strengthening diplomatic ties between the neighboring countries. The action is seen as a rare diplomatic achievement for the internationally isolated Taliban leaders since they regained control of the country three years ago. Until now, China and the United Arab Emirates were the only two countries that had formally accredited a Taliban-appointed ambassador since Afghan insurgents regained power in Kabul. None of the three nations has recognized the Taliban as the official government of Afghanistan, and neither has the rest of the world, citing concerns about inclusivity, terrorism, and restrictions on women's access to education and work. The Taliban's foreign ministry identified its diplomat to Tashkent as Sheikh Abdul Ghafar Bahr, saying he formally presented a copy of his credentials to Uzbek Minister of Foreign Affairs Bakhtiyor Saidov on Wednesday. 'Bahr described the upgradation of bilateral relations as a pivotal phase, hoping for further progress,' the Taliban quoted their ambassador as saying at Wednesday’s ceremony to welcome him in the Uzbek capital. The statement quoted Saidov as noting that 'both countries enjoy shared interests and have achieved substantial economic growth over the past three years.' The Taliban said that Bahr 'is expected to present his original letter of credence' to President Shavkat Mirziyoyev of Uzbekistan. 'Our countries share a common history and interests of prosperity that serve as an impetus for the development of cooperation ties in all areas,' Saidov said on his social media platform X, formerly known as Twitter, after Wednesday’s ceremony. 'We also discussed the acute topics on bilateral, regional, and global agendas,' the Uzbek foreign minister wrote. The Taliban separately stated Thursday that their Ministry of Mines and Petroleum had signed a 10-year contract with an Uzbek company for the exploration and extraction of gas in Afghanistan. The announcement said the agreement requires the Uzbek company to invest $100 million in the first year and $1 billion over the next 10 years. The investment will target the gas reserves of the Totimaidan field in the northern Afghan province of Faryab, which spans an area of about 7,000 square kilometers. Russia reported last week that a 'principal decision' had already been made to remove the Taliban from its list of transnational terrorist organizations, saying relevant Russian agencies were 'putting finishing touches' on the delisting in line with federal law. U.S.-led Western countries have been pressing the Taliban to reverse restrictions on women’s freedoms and their right to education as well as employment before they could consider engaging diplomatically with Kabul. Washington also wants the de facto Afghan rulers to address regional and international terrorism concerns. 'We have not changed our designation of the Taliban as a specially designated global terrorist organization, and we continue to make clear that any significant steps towards normalization of relations is contingent upon a profound shift in the Taliban’s human rights conduct,' Matthew Miller, the U.S. State Department spokesperson said on Tuesday. 'We continue to work with our allies and partners to press the Taliban to reverse their discriminatory edicts, and we make sure that any significant steps toward normalization of relations are contingent upon profound improvements in their treatment of women and girls, including but not limited to allowing women and girls back in school and lifting the restrictions on women’s employment,' Miller explained. Taliban leaders defend their governance, arguing that it is in line with their interpretation of the Islamic law of Sharia. They also rejected criticism of their curbs on Afghan women’s access to education, employment, and public life at large. Abdul Kabir, the Taliban's deputy prime minister for political affairs, reportedly said Thursday that their government aims to maintain positive relations with all countries. However, he emphasized that 'they will not sacrifice Islamic principles or values to please others.' Kabir asserted in his remarks that the Taliban are currently in control of '40 diplomatic missions in different countries and engagement with the world is moving in a positive direction.'	https://www.voanews.com/a/uzbekistan-accepts-ambassador-from-taliban-led-afghanistan/7817434.html	2024-10-10T06:13:23-07:00	
China defiant over South China Sea skirmishes in ASEAN talks, blames meddling by foreign forces	Vientiane, Laos — Southeast Asian leaders stepped up pressure on China to respect international law following clashes in the disputed South China Sea during annual summit talks on Thursday, but Chinese Premier Li Qiang was defiant as he blamed 'external forces' for interfering in regional affairs. The 10-member Association of Southeast Asian Nations' meeting with Li followed recent violent confrontations at sea this year between China and ASEAN members Philippines and Vietnam that heightened unease over China's increasingly assertive actions in the contested waters. Malaysian Prime Minister Anwar Ibrahim, who will take over the rotating ASEAN chair next year, said the bloc has called for an early conclusion to a code of conduct to govern the South China Sea. Talks on the code of conduct have been ongoing for years, hampered by sticky issues including disagreements over whether the pact should be binding. ASEAN reiterated the need to maintain peace and security in the strategic waterway, he said, according to Malaysian national news agency Bernama. But Li said meddling by foreign forces is creating conflicts within the region. 'We must realize that our development is also facing some unstable and uncertain factors. In particular, external forces frequently interfere and even try to introduce bloc confrontation and geopolitical conflicts into Asia,' Li said during an ASEAN meeting with China, Japan and South Korea. He called for more dialogue between countries to ensure disputes are resolved amicably. Li didn't name the foreign forces but China has previously warned the U.S. not to meddle in the region's territorial disputes. U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken, who arrived in Vientiane on Thursday for the meetings, is expected to raise the issue of China's aggression in the sea, officials said. The U.S. has no claims but it has deployed Navy ships and fighter jets to patrol the waterway and promote freedom of navigation and overflight. ASEAN members Vietnam, the Philippines, Malaysia and Brunei along with Taiwan have overlapping claims with China, which claims sovereignty over virtually all of the South China Sea. Chinese and Philippine vessels have clashed repeatedly this year, and Vietnam said last week that Chinese forces assaulted its fishermen in the disputed sea. China has also sent patrol vessels to areas that Indonesia and Malaysia claim as exclusive economic zones. Philippines President Ferdinand Marcos Jr. made clear to Li during talks Thursday that ASEAN-China cooperation cannot be separated from the sea dispute, according to an ASEAN official who declined to be named due to the sensitivity of the discussion. Li responded by saying the South China Sea is 'a shared home' and that China has an obligation to protect its sovereignty, the official said. The Philippines, a longtime U.S. ally, has been critical of other ASEAN countries for not doing more to get China to back away. Aside from regional security issues, China's Li also emphasized Beijing and ASEAN's economic ties, saying intensifying trade relations and creating an 'ultra large-scale market' are keys to economic prosperity amid rising trade protectionism. ASEAN and China said they expect to conclude negotiations to upgrade their free trade pact next year. Since the two sides signed the pact covering a market of 2 billion people in 2010, ASEAN's trade with China has leaped from $235.5 billion to $696.7 billion last year. China is ASEAN's No. 1 trading partner and its third-largest source of foreign investment — a key reason why the bloc has been reluctant to criticize Chinese actions in the South China Sea. ASEAN leaders, who held a summit among themselves on Wednesday, also separately met with new Japanese Prime Minister Shigeru Ishiba and South Korean President Yoon Suk Yeol. ASEAN elevated its ties with South Korea to a 'comprehensive strategic partnership.' Yoon said the new designation will further help both sides to 'create a new future together.' Ishiba also pledged to boost the Japan-ASEAN relationship by providing patrol vessels and training on maritime law enforcement, strengthening economic security through financial and other support and bolstering cybersecurity. 'Japan shares principles such as freedom, democracy and the rule of law, and would like to create and protect the future together with ASEAN,' he said. The bloc is also holding individual talks with dialogue partners India, Australia, Canada, the U.S. and the United Nations that will culminate in an East Asia Summit of 18 nations including Russia and New Zealand on Friday. Former ASEAN Secretary-General Ong Keng Yong said that despite challenges in addressing disputes in the South China Sea and the Myanmar civil war, ASEAN's central role in the region is undisputable. 'ASEAN and its diplomatic maneuvers have sustained the relative peace and progress of Southeast Asia to date. ASEAN will continue to be useful in that regard. Big powers cannot do what they wish in the region,' said Ong, who is now deputy chairman of the S. Rajaratnam School of International Studies in Singapore. Nearly 6,000 people have been killed and over 3 million displaced in a civil war after the Myanmar army ousted an elected government in 2021. The military has backtracked on an ASEAN peace plan it agreed to in late 2021 and fighting has continued with pro-democracy guerillas and ethnic rebels. Myanmar's top generals have been shut out of ASEAN summits since the military takeover. Thailand will host an informal ASEAN ministerial-level consultation on Myanmar in mid-December as frustration grows in the bloc over the prolonged conflict.	https://www.voanews.com/a/china-defiant-over-south-china-sea-skirmishes-in-asean-talks-blames-meddling-by-foreign-forces/7817384.html	2024-10-10T05:24:01-07:00

Hong Kong court rejects activist Jimmy Lai's bid to have a jury trial for libel case	HONG KONG — A Hong Kong court rejected jailed publisher Jimmy Lai 's request to have a jury trial for his libel case against a pro-Beijing newspaper Thursday, the latest setback for the activist who suffered multiple blows in other legal battles. Lai, the founder of the now-defunct Apple Daily newspaper, is one of the city's leading activists who was prosecuted under a sweeping national security law during Beijing's crackdown on dissent. He has been the subject of criticism by pro-Beijing media outlets for years. The 76-year-old brought the case against Ta Kung Pao in 2020, alleging that the publication had maliciously suggested he was planning to illegally abscond from the city and would breach his bail condition. On Thursday, judge Queeny Au Yeung ruled against Lai's bid, saying the case requires a prolonged examination of documents. '(It) is not suitable for jury trial and plainly not suitable for putting only one or some questions to the jury, leaving the rest to the trial judge,' she wrote in her judgment. The libel case centered on an article published by Ta Kung Pao headlined 'Leaders who create chaos in Hong Kong plotting escape, escape route exposed, charge one million dollars' on June 25, 2020. The article named Lai as a potential suspect who intended to abscond and evade criminal liability. The paper denied the libel charge. Many of Hong Kong's most prominent activists were arrested, forced into self-exile or silenced since the 2020 security law came into force. Lai's Apple Daily was shut down after the arrests of its top management in 2021. The closure was widely seen as an erosion of freedoms that were promised when the former British colony returned to Chinese rule in 1997. Lai has suffered setbacks in his landmark security trial. Last December, judges rejected his bid to throw out a sedition charge against him. The court last year also refused to overturn Hong Kong national security authorities' decision to block him from hiring veteran British lawyer Timothy Owen. Lai will testify in court in his defense for that security trial next month. Lai is now serving a jail term of over five years after being convicted in a separate fraud case. He has been in custody since December 2020. The U.S. and U.K. governments have called for Lai's release and have criticized the security law, which the Beijing and Hong Kong governments say is necessary for the city's stability.	https://www.voanews.com/a/hong-kong-court-rejects-activist-jimmy-lai-s-bid-to-have-a-jury-trial-for-libel-case-/7817249.html	2024-10-10T02:38:44-07:00

Taiwan celebrates National Day holiday against background of Chinese threats	TAIPEI, Taiwan — Taiwan celebrated its National Day holiday Thursday against the background of threats from China, which claims the self-governing island republic as its own territory. The celebration marks the establishment of the Republic of China, which overthrew the Qing Dynasty in 1911 and fled to Taiwan as Mao Zedong's Communists swept to power on the mainland during a civil war in 1949. Taiwan was run under martial law until transitioning to full democracy in the 1980s and 1990s but maintains the original constitution brought from China and the ROC flag. President Lai Ching-te took office in May, continuing the eight-year rule of the Democratic Progressive Party that rejects China's demand that it recognize Taiwan is a part of China. The Nationalists adhere to a unification stance that recognizes both sides of the Taiwan Strait as a single nation. Thursday's commemorations were to include speeches by Lai and others, performances in front of the Presidential Office Building in Taipei, including an honor guard, military marching band and overflight by military aircraft, but no display of heavy military equipment as seen in years past. Maintaining its military pressure on Taiwan, China's People's Liberation Army sent 15 planes across the median line in the Taiwan Strait, prompting Taiwan to scramble jets, dispatch ships and activate missile systems.	https://www.voanews.com/a/taiwan-celebrates-national-day-holiday-against-background-of-chinese-threats/7817179.html	2024-10-09T21:32:49-07:00

Russia-Ukraine war appears frozen in place as winter approaches	WASHINGTON — Neither rising death tolls nor plunging temperatures are likely to change the trajectory of Russia's war against Ukraine, according to senior U.S. officials charged with supporting Kyiv's fight against Moscow's forces. The officials, briefing reporters Wednesday on the condition of anonymity to discuss battlefield developments, said fighting over the past several weeks has resulted in only minor changes to the front lines, with few indications Russia is making any adjustments. 'It's an attritional strategy,' said a senior U.S. military official. 'It's kind of the Russian way of war that they continue to throw mass into the problem.' That willingness to try to overwhelm Ukrainian positions with sheer numbers has cost Russia's military, according to the latest U.S. military assessments. The U.S. estimates Russian forces have suffered 600,000 casualties, killed and wounded, since Moscow first launched its invasion of Ukraine in February 2022 — a toll that U.S. officials said surpasses the number of Russian casualties in any conflict since World War II. September has been especially costly, with Russia sustaining more casualties last month than in any other month of the war, officials said. Russia's military has also suffered in other ways. Senior U.S. officials estimate Ukraine has destroyed or damaged more than 30 medium to large Russian ships stationed in the Black Sea, forcing Russia to relocate its Black Sea fleet. Ukraine is also thought to have destroyed more than two-thirds of Russia's prewar tank inventory. '[It is] forcing the Russian military to dig into Soviet-era stockpiles and fuel tanks from World War II,' said a senior U.S. defense official. And then there are the Ukrainian drone attacks on Russian ammunition depots, believed to have destroyed hundreds of thousands of Russian and North Korean-made rounds. U.S. officials said the damage would likely slow delivery of ammunition and artillery rounds to the front lines. Still, they warned, the Kremlin appears undeterred, even it means more Russian casualties. 'Russia does continue to devote significant amounts of resources and … lives toward a grinding campaign, redoubling its efforts in the east,' said the senior defense official. 'Russia has also demonstrated time and time again a willingness to do whatever it takes to attempt to force the Ukrainians to capitulate, including purposely targeting Ukrainian civilians and critical infrastructure.' For now, senior U.S. officials assess that Russian President Vladimir Putin has managed to avoid calling for a mass mobilization, like the call-up of some 300,000 reservists back in September 2022, thanks in part to pay increases for Russian volunteers. But just how long Putin can sustain Russia's efforts without new troops is not clear. As for Ukraine, senior U.S. officials point to the country's success with its domestically produced drones and even its offensive into Russia's Kursk region as reasons for hope. 'My assessment is that the Ukrainians will be able to maintain their position in Kursk for some amount of time, here into the future,' said the senior U.S. military official. 'Several months and potentially beyond.' The official said Ukraine's military leadership appears to be looking at the big picture. 'Certainly, they're focused on how they get through the winter, but they're thinking a little bit longer term about how they set conditions for success next year,' the official said. 'The Ukrainians are thinking forward to 2025,' the U.S. official added. 'That includes things like ensuring that the additional brigades can come online as they increase their recruitment, as they get better equipment and training, reconstituting brigades that they're cycling off the front line and really building up their combat power for the future.'	https://www.voanews.com/a/russia-ukraine-war-appears-frozen-in-place-as-winter-approaches/7817119.html	2024-10-09T20:06:34-07:00	
On TikTok, AI-generated 'Russian' women deliver pro-China messages with sales pitch	WASHINGTON — 'What Americans are really worried about now is not wars, shootings or homelessness. It’s the puzzling absence of any issues with China,' declares a blonde influencer on TikTok, speaking in near-fluent Mandarin. 'A U.S. presidential candidate recently stated that America should learn from China and stop causing trouble,' she added, displaying an image of President Biden. The influencer, who says her name is Alina and claims to be a Russian living in Singapore, promotes what she says are 'high-quality Russian and Chinese products' on her account. However, the same blonde Russian woman also appears in other posts on TikTok and goes by the name Lisa. Lisa likes to discuss such topics as 'celebrating the 75th anniversary of the founding of China,' 'Germany is facing a dead-end,' and 'the U.S. is on the brink of bankruptcy.' In one video posted on September 17, she talked about the two assassination attempts against Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump, suggesting that the intensifying political rivalry is fueling violence in the U.S. and could lead to further societal division. Patriotism before commerce A joint investigation by Voice of America and social media analytics firm Doublethink Lab uncovered several accounts on TikTok like Alina's and Lisa’s that feature videos of Russian women generated by artificial intelligence, or AI. All the accounts emerged around July and August and followed a similar pattern of leveraging patriotic sentiment to bolster China-Russia ties before going on to promote products. Earlier this year, VOA noted a similar trend on Chinese social media platforms like Douyin and Xiaohongshu, and the use of AI-manipulated videos of young, purportedly Russian women to rally support for China-Russia ties and stoke patriotic fervor before selling products such as snacks, nutritional supplements and drinks. It is hard to tell whether the creators of the videos have an ideological motive or are simply trying to exploit Chinese patriotism to sell their products, said Wei-Ping Li, who holds a fellowship at the Taiwan FactCheck Center. 'I still think they are more like aiming to sell products rather than state-sponsored influence campaigns,' she told VOA. Either way, the use of Russian AI personas to foster patriotism was once limited to Chinese social media sites targeting domestic audiences. The accounts identified on TikTok, however, appear to be operated from Singapore, indicating that the use of attractive blonde Russian women to push patriotism, propaganda and products has expanded beyond China. TikTok is unavailable in China. Most users download its Chinese counterpart, Douyin. Both platforms are owned by the same parent company, ByteDance, which is headquartered in Beijing. When VOA contacted TikTok to find out more about the accounts Tuesday, they were taken down several hours later. TikTok spokesperson Ariane de Selliers told VOA that TikTok does 'not allow account behavior that may spam or mislead our community.' According to TikTok’s rules, creators are required to label realistic AI-generated content. The accounts discovered by VOA uniformly claim to be from Russia and to love China, often highlighting China's economic achievements and its status as a global friend while criticizing Japan and Western nations like the U.S. and Germany. Most of the content does not appear to come from original creators because the posts are similar or identical to content on other social media platforms. For the most part, it appears that these accounts have been largely republishing videos from Chinese social media platforms such as Douyin, Xiaohongshu and possibly WeChat and bilibili. Some accounts, however, seek to make their postings look legitimate by having the AI-generated Russian women talk about their lives and experiences in China and why they like the country. Interestingly, while many of these characters on Chinese platforms talk about their desire to 'marry a Chinese man,' videos targeting Chinese overseas do not talk about that at all. Li of the Taiwan FactCheck Center said the TikTok accounts seem aimed at older Chinese audiences overseas, diverging from the previous focus on younger males with patriotic inclinations and military backgrounds. This shift can be observed in the use of hashtags such as #Singapore, #Malaysia and #OverseasChinese. 'For the target audiences of these Singaporean accounts, imagine a 65-year-old Chinese [males or females] living in Southeast Asia or even Australia, New Zealand, the U.S., whose friends often share TikTok or Douyin videos,' she said. 'These videos first employ nationalistic themes to attract viewers before promoting their products,' she added. Why Russians? Once these videos gain traction, they pivot to sales. One post claimed, 'China will always be the big brother of Russia,' before recommending a health product: 'I suggest Sinopharm Group's Glucosamine Chondroitin for joint protection.' By featuring foreign women praising China’s political and economic systems, these videos convey a message designed to instill pride among Chinese viewers, aligning with their patriotic sentiments. But why the focus on Russian women? Li attributes this trend to cultural connections, noting that since the 2010s, Chinese men have sought brides in Russia. A 2016 report from China's state media highlighted this phenomenon, suggesting that 'a Chinese husband and a Russian wife make a perfect match.' 'The rhetoric we see in these TikTok videos are exactly the same,' Li pointed out. Additionally, economic factors play a role. As Russia’s economic growth lags China’s, some Chinese individuals may seek partnerships in economically disadvantaged areas. Li emphasized that the TikTok videos aimed at Southeast Asian audiences feature Russian women probably because their creators believe that viewers will appreciate foreign endorsements of China and Singapore. 'In addition, using these existing Russian women’s images (on Chinese social media), producers can churn out videos more easily,' she added.	https://www.voanews.com/a/on-tiktok-ai-generated-russian-women-deliver-pro-china-messages-with-sales-pitch/7817142.html	2024-10-09T19:44:41-07:00

Three African countries on cusp of death penalty abolition	Harare, zimbabwe — The international human rights organization Amnesty International says three sub-Saharan African countries considering ending the death penalty should do it now and pave the way for others around the world to follow in their footsteps. There hasn't been an execution in Gambia, Kenya or Zimbabwe in over a decade, Amnesty has said, and all three nations have commuted multiple death sentences during that time. Lucia Masuka, head of Amnesty in Zimbabwe, said most countries in the world are moving away from the death penalty, and she urged African countries to follow suit. 'It's time for all countries to move away from this cruel, inhuman and degrading punishment once and for all,' Masuka said. 'Zimbabwe’s president himself was sentenced to death for terrorism, as a young man, due to his involvement in Zimbabwe's liberation struggle. He narrowly avoided execution. He was below the age of 21 at the time, and was sentenced to 10 years in prison instead. 'The president knows what it is like to be facing the death penalty, and he now has the opportunity to ensure that no one else goes through that.' Addressing Parliament this month, President Emmerson Mnangagwa stuck to his 2017 promise that he would not allow the death penalty to stand in Zimbabwe. 'Parliament has an obligation to expedite the enactment of all bills that, for one reason or another, are outstanding from previous sessions,' he said. 'You can carry the burden.' Bills relating to death penalty abolition 'should be passed.' Casten Matewu, a legislator from the country’s main opposition party, the Citizens Coalition for Change, and a member of the justice, legal and parliamentary affairs committee, said Mnangagwa should not be worried about the death penalty abolition bill. 'I am for the abolition of the death penalty, and this must be abolished before December,' Matewu said. 'This is going to sail through seamlessly through Parliament, because there is a majority of parliamentarians, both from both sides of the house, who are actually in support of this bill.' But not everyone agrees. Zachariah Choga, an attorney who formerly practiced in South Africa and is now practicing law in Harare, said the death penalty 'should not be abolished.' 'I've had the privilege to practice in the South African legal system,' he said. 'If you look at statistics since 1994, when the death penalty was abolished in South Africa, the increase has been a super-increase in heinous crimes, violent crimes and crimes of passion. So I’m actually of the opinion that the death penalty is a deterrent to crime. I think the fear of one losing their life can assist, or can be a deterrent, when one considers committing a crime.' Amnesty International’s Masuka has a different opinion. 'Countries that still retain the death penalty in their laws often resort to the death penalty, believing the punishment can make their people and communities safer,' she said. 'However, that is a misconception. The death penalty does not have a unique, deterrent effect, and it violates the right to life, as proclaimed in the universal declaration of human rights. The small minority of countries that insist on using this punishment must move with the times and abolish the death penalty once and for all.' According to Amnesty International, 24 countries across sub-Saharan Africa have abolished the death penalty for all crimes, while two countries have abolished it for ordinary crimes only. Zimbabwe’s last known execution was in 2005, though courts continue to impose death sentences. All of the condemned were sentenced to life imprisonment by Mnangagwa’s amnesty in April this year.	https://www.voanews.com/a/three-african-countries-on-cusp-of-death-penalty-abolition/7817102.html	2024-10-09T18:46:14-07:00

UN calls for safer migration from Horn of Africa to Gulf countries	Addis Ababa, ethiopia — The head of the U.N. International Organization for Migration, or IOM, is calling for safe migration to and from the Gulf countries as the dangerous eastern Horn of Africa route claims more lives. The so-called eastern route runs from the Horn of Africa to Saudi Arabia and the Persian Gulf by way of Ethiopia, Djibouti, Somalia and Yemen. Migrant workers, mainly from Ethiopia but also from other East African countries, travel over the route in search of jobs and economic opportunities. At least 48 people died and 75 others were missing or presumed dead after smugglers forced migrants off two boats on October 1 in the Red Sea, off the coast of Djibouti. Almost all of the migrants were Ethiopians. Speaking at the IOM’s regional review of the Global Compact for Safe, Orderly and Regular Migration held Wednesday in Ethiopia, Director-General Amy Pope said more people were being harmed on the eastern route than on any other migration route in the world, though it does not get a lot of attention. 'What it demonstrates is that we need to build up safe and regular ways for people to move because we know, for example, within the Gulf, there are tremendous opportunities for people to go and live and work, whether they're going in low-skilled sectors or they're going in higher-skilled sectors,' she said, commenting on the recent deaths off the Djibouti coast. 'There should be no reason for people to have to move through a smuggler, through a trafficker, a route that will subject them to exploitation and often abuse,' she said. Pushed into the sea Frantz Celestin, IOM regional director for East, Horn and Southern Africa, told VOA's Horn of Africa Service that smugglers forced migrants on two fully loaded boats to jump into the sea about 3 a.m. on October 1. In an email, Celestin said the first boat, which had two pilots, was carrying 100 migrants voluntarily returning from Yemen to Djibouti who had paid for and planned their trip. 'The two pilots forced them off the boat, even though they had not reached the shore. There were 99 migrants who survived, and one woman died. The pilots were able to flee the arrival of the coast guard and return to Yemen,' he said. The second boat, with three pilots, had 220 migrants on board who were forced to return from Yemen to Djibouti. They were being brought back either from prison or from several other places in Yemen, Celestin said. Two or three of the migrants were returning voluntarily. 'They forced, pushed or threw the migrants into the sea far from the shore. The pilots abandoned their boat and fled by land,' Celestin said. 'The Djiboutian coast guard brought many survivors from the sea point back to shore.' One of the survivors, who did not want to be identified for safety reasons, told VOA Horn of Africa that the pilots asked them to 'get out.' 'They asked us to get out of the boat into the seawater,' the survivor said, adding that the Yemeni pilot told them how to get to land. 'But all of us could not make it as it was dark and lack of swimming experience.' 'We are peaceful people who want to work and help our families back home,' a second survivor said. Root causes At the regional review, Pope called on the international community to address the root causes of migration, including conflicts, development and climate shocks. 'The drivers of migration are really complex; some of it is about peace. We see, for example, the situation in Sudan, where there are millions of people who have been pushed out of their homes. The solution, the root cause of that, is the conflict, and until there's peace in Sudan, then people will continue to move,' she said. 'In other cases, it's the impact of poverty and the lack of economic opportunity for people at home, and the answer to that is about development and governance,' Pope said, adding that countries need to assume responsibility and address climate change, which she identified as one of the drivers of migration. 'On the one hand, it means that governments need to take seriously their obligations to mitigate the impact of climate change, but importantly, that is just not going to be enough, because we know people are being forced to move now,' she said. 'So, working with communities to adapt to climate change and ensuring there are resources to help people who've already been displaced by climate change will be critical moving forward.' Pope urged governments to work together to ensure people vulnerable to exploitation — especially people who are being recruited by smugglers and traffickers — can migrate safely and obtain the information they need to access a regular pathway for migration.

Last-minute change in US swing state's election rules alarms some	leesburg, georgia — In the town of Leesburg in the U.S. state of Georgia, slightly more than a dozen election workers sit at card tables, each thumbing through stacks of 50 blank pieces of paper, practicing counting ballots by hand. With the U.S. presidential vote only weeks away, the Georgia State Election Board, led by a pro-Donald Trump majority, passed a controversial requirement in September that counties manually hand count their ballots, a move that has caused alarm in the closely watched swing state. Veronica Johnson, who is leading the training session as the Lee County director of elections and registration, says hand counting the ballots is unlikely to pose major operational problems in her small county. But logistics are far from election officials' only concern. Georgia officials from both sides of the political aisle say the count is not only superfluous — machines already count the ballots — but also a potential tool to sow doubt by slowing the process and creating space for disinformation should discrepancies arise via error-prone human counting. 'I don't feel it's necessary. I have no problem saying that. I think that at our precincts here in Lee County we're already balancing our numbers,' Johnson told AFP. The change is all the most notable given Republican candidate Trump's alleged election tampering in the state in 2020, pushing for Georgia officials to 'find' enough votes to overturn President Joe Biden's victory. 'Misguided' Lee is among Georgia's 159 counties, which encompass major metropolitan areas such as Atlanta and rural regions like the area surrounding Leesburg, with populations ranging from majority white to majority Black. Like many of its rural counterparts, Lee County voted heavily in 2020 for Trump, who received 72 percent of its votes. Poll workers such as those at the training will be stationed across the county's 10 voting precincts on November 5, when U.S. voters choose between Trump and his Democratic rival, Vice President Kamala Harris, in addition to candidates in hundreds of down-ballot races. Because of lawsuits, Johnson is unsure if hand counting will actually happen. 'Honestly, every election director I know really just wants to serve the people and not get bogged down by the political ramifications,' she said, emphasizing that ballots are already counted by machine three times. Calling the rule change 'misguided,' Georgia's Republican Secretary of State Brad Raffensperger said that 'activists seeking to impose last-minute changes in election procedures' only 'undermine voter confidence and burden election workers,' while Georgia's Republican attorney general has stated the new rule is likely illegal. The Democratic National Committee and the Democratic Party of Georgia sued to block the rule last week with the Harris campaign's backing. 'Untrusting' The state election board passed the rule by a three-to-two vote — those in favor being staunch Trump backers praised by the ex-president as 'pit bulls' fighting for 'victory.' Along the same three-to-two lines, the board passed another rule in August allowing county election boards to conduct a 'reasonable inquiry' before certifying results. Like the hand count requirement, the measure is being challenged in court, with critics particularly worried about the vagueness of the word 'reasonable.' Mitchell Brown, director of the election administration program at Auburn University in Alabama, told Agence France-Presse that such a rule is unnecessary given that election officials 'have meetings regularly where they go through the documentation and the information with the certifying body.' 'The bigger, more interesting question to me is, what happens if a body chooses not to certify?' Back in Lee County, Donna Mathis, who has served as a poll worker since 2018, noted that the 'country is divided so much.'

But 'I think you can inquire too much, it ties things up,' she added.

China tries to silence critics in Japan, new report finds	taipei, taiwan — China has used transnational harassment and intimidation to prevent Chinese people living in Japan from engaging in protests and activism, a new report by Human Rights Watch said. Most of the 25 Chinese people interviewed by Human Rights Watch, including ethnic minorities from Xinjiang, Tibet and Inner Mongolia, said Chinese police have warned them, sometimes through their relatives in China, against taking part in activities or peaceful protests critical of the Chinese Communist Party and its rule over China. 'Several ethnic Uyghurs from Xinjiang said that Chinese authorities contacted them through their relatives back home, and the police told them to either stop their anti-Chinese government activities in Japan or pressed them to share information about Japan’s Uyghur community,' the report said. Analysts say that while Chinese authorities haven’t used physical violence to intimidate Chinese people in Japan, they are still able to deter them from continuing their activism abroad. 'Beijing’s strategies targeting the Chinese diaspora community in Japan are sophisticated, because while they keep their threats relatively low-key — which is less likely to attract the Japanese government’s attention — it’s still enough to scare members of the diaspora community,' Teppei Kasai, Asia program officer at Human Rights Watch, told VOA by phone. Some Japanese experts say Beijing’s transnational repression has created a chilling effect within the Chinese diaspora in Japan. 'More and more Chinese and Hong Kong people in Japan are minimizing their participation in public events, especially those related to sensitive issues, because they are concerned about facing retaliation from the Chinese government,' said Tomoko Ako, a China studies professor at the University of Tokyo. The Chinese foreign ministry and the Chinese Embassy in Japan didn’t respond to VOA’s requests for comments. When responding to a similar question in August, the Chinese Embassy in Washington told VOA that China 'strictly abides by international law and fully respects the law enforcement sovereignty of other countries.' Targeting activists’ families Human Rights Watch said Chinese authorities often try to intimidate activists in Japan by targeting their family members in China. In one case, a Chinese activist in Japan told Human Rights Watch that local police in Inner Mongolia interrogated his relatives, restricted their freedom of movement and prevented them from getting their passports after he took part in public protests against the Chinese government’s policy of replacing the Mongolian language with Mandarin Chinese at school. The activist, who used the pseudonym A.B. because of security concerns, said the pressure his family members face has instilled in him a sense of guilt. 'My [relatives] tell me they’re afraid of the pressure they’re feeling, and that has been tough on me,' he told Human Rights Watch. In another case, Hong Kong activist Alric Lee told VOA that his parents received a letter listing all the activities he had joined in Japan and demanded that they publicly apologize for 'his wrongdoings.' 'They were asked to apologize for what I’ve done in Japan and publicly renounce their relationship with me,' he said in a phone interview, adding that his parents asked him to stop his activism in Japan after receiving the letter. Since the letter included detailed records of his activities in Japan, Lee said he thought the threat might have been initiated by the Hong Kong government. In addition to threats against family members, Lee said he and other members of the Hong Kong diaspora in Japan have been followed by unknown individuals after organizing or taking part in public activities. Lee said these threats have forced him to reevaluate the potential consequences of his activism in Japan. 'I’m definitely thinking twice before taking part in activities, but since I don’t think I have done anything wrong, I don’t think I’ll change anything concerning my activism in Japan,' he told VOA. No confidence in Japan Despite the threats, some Chinese people told Human Rights Watch that they didn’t seek help from the Japanese police because of fear of reprisal or because they didn’t think doing so would resolve the problems they were facing. 'Some people said they think Japanese authorities can’t do much about what the Chinese police have done to them, and they feel that the Chinese government would find out if they try to seek help from the Japanese police,' Kasai told VOA. In a written response to inquiries from VOA, the Japanese foreign ministry declined to comment on transnational repression against Chinese people in Japan and what the Japanese government can do to safeguard their basic rights. Officials said both matters were related to 'foreigners in Japan.' Ako said the Japanese government’s reluctance to comment on Beijing’s transnational repression against Chinese people in Japan reflects Tokyo’s attempt to avoid increasing tensions between the two countries. 'The Japanese government probably doesn’t want to heighten tensions with China, but I think it is their basic responsibility to publicly comment on this concerning trend that’s happening in Japan,' she told VOA by phone. Kasai said since Japan and 54 other countries at the U.N. Human Rights Council condemned transnational repression and vowed to hold those responsible accountable in June, Tokyo should consider establishing mechanisms to help protect the basic rights and safety of those being intimidated. 'The Japanese police should try to create a system that allows Chinese people to report their experiences of facing transnational repression initiated by the Chinese government,' he told VOA, adding that such a system should include safeguards for individuals’ privacy. Kasai and Ako said they thought the Japanese government should go further. 'I think human rights should remain an important aspect of Japan’s bilateral engagement with China, so I believe Tokyo should try to raise the issue of Beijing’s transnational repression against Chinese people in Japan during bilateral meetings,' Ako said.	https://www.voanews.com/a/china-tries-to-silence-critics-in-japan-new-report-finds/7816790.html	2024-10-09T16:46:39-07:00	
Observers: Chinese-made fighter jets play key role in deadly airstrikes in Myanmar	Washington — Local media in Myanmar are reporting that six FTC-2000G fighter jets purchased from China have arrived, and observers are concerned that Chinese military support for the Myanmar military is prolonging the conflict and worsening civilian suffering. China's supply of fighter jets, such as the FTC-2000G, has helped the junta maintain air superiority, and that has caused widespread casualties across Myanmar. According to media reports, this delivery in August 2024 is the second batch of FTC-2000G jets received by Myanmar’s military. The junta took delivery of the first batch in November 2022. Military-controlled media later showed the FTC-2000G aircraft at a Myanmar Air Force ceremony on Dec. 15, 2022. The second batch is widely expected to be showcased at this year’s Air Force Day celebration in December. Zay Ya, a former sergeant in the Myanmar Air Force, explained to VOA from an undisclosed location on the Thai-Myanmar border, 'Many of the Russian-made Yak-130s are out of service, so the Chinese jets are now critical to the military’s operations.' He added that the Chinese jets are already used in combat, with several stationed at key air bases. Zay Ya, who served in Myanmar’s Air Force for nearly a decade, deserted the military following the February 2021 overthrow of an elected government and is now assisting fellow former service members who have joined the Civil Disobedience Movement against the military junta. Based on his hands-on experience with the Myanmar Air Force, Zay Ya pointed out that Russia’s aircraft are high-cost and fuel-consuming, while Chinese planes are more compatible with Myanmar’s existing defense industry. 'The Russian-made Sukhoi Su-30 — four of them arrived before the FTC-2000G — but the FTC-2000G can be used immediately,' Zay Ya said. VOA’s Burmese Service contacted the Myanmar government’s military information team in Nay Pyi Taw and the Chinese Embassy in Yangon and Washington, D.C., regarding the delivery of FTC-2000G jets but has not yet received a response. Use of FTC-2000G The FTC-2000G’s ability to carry missiles, rockets and bombs has significantly enhanced the junta’s airstrike capabilities, particularly in conflict zones like northern Shan State and areas controlled by the Brotherhood Alliance, an ethnic armed group near the Chinese border, according to the observers. A report by Justice for Myanmar and Info Birmanie highlighted how China's FTC-2000G aircraft have been used for air raids on civilian areas. On Jan. 16, 2024, opposition forces downed an FTC-2000G jet involved in an attack over the Namhpatkar region in northern Shan State. In December 2023, another FTC-2000G jet dropped bombs on residential buildings near Namkham. ‘It will not shift the balance’ Dr. Abdul Rahman Yaacob, an expert on Southeast Asia’s defense and security issues with Lowy Institute, commented on the broader implications of the jet deliveries. 'China is clearly taking sides in the civil war,' he told VOA. 'It shows that China is not a neutral actor in the Myanmar crisis by supplying arms to the junta.' While the delivery of combat aircraft may give the junta some tactical advantage, Yaacob said, 'Overall, it will not shift the balance to the side of the junta. The junta is actually facing a counterinsurgency. An insurgency campaign cannot be dealt with just by air power alone. It has to be fought by foot soldiers. And this is where the junta is facing a major problem — it has a shortage of manpower.' Several experts believe China’s actions are about more than military support. Jason Tower, the country director for the Burma program at the United States Institute of Peace, or USIP, told VOA, 'It’s very clear that China still sees the Myanmar military as the government of Myanmar, and it seems unlikely that over the short term, China’s posture is going to change.' He argues that the sale of the fighter jets signals China’s intention to maintain stability in Myanmar and convince other international actors to accept the military junta. Thomas Kean, a senior consultant at the International Crisis Group, said China’s goal is to stabilize Myanmar and protect its strategic interests. 'I think China wants stability and a degree of normalization,' Kean said. 'China is pushing for a deal between the military and ethnic armed groups.' Civilian impact, international calls The conflict has displaced millions, with the United Nations estimating that more than 2.3 million people have fled their homes since the coup. Bombings have targeted schools, hospitals, and residential areas with little regard for civilian lives, according to the U.N. The international community has condemned Myanmar’s military for its atrocities. In a statement to the U.N. Human Rights Council, Nicholas Koumjian, head of the Independent Investigative Mechanism for Myanmar, said, 'In many instances, civilians are not just collateral damage but the target of attacks, which appear intended to create terror.' Human rights organizations, including Amnesty International and Justice for Myanmar, have called on China to stop arms transfers to the junta.	https://www.voanews.com/a/observers-chinese-made-fighter-jets-play-key-role-in-deadly-airstrikes-in-myanmar/7816747.html	2024-10-09T15:45:21-07:00	
Though voter fraud rare, US election offices feature safeguards to catch it	NEW YORK — You've heard the horror stories: Someone casting multiple ballots, people voting in the name of dead relatives, mail-in ballots being intercepted. Voter fraud does happen occasionally. When it does, we tend to hear a lot about it. It also gets caught and prosecuted. The nation's multilayered election processes provide many safeguards that keep voter fraud generally detectable and rare, according to current and former election administrators of both parties. America's elections are decentralized, with thousands of independent voting jurisdictions. That makes it virtually impossible to pull off a large-scale vote-rigging operation that could tip a presidential race — or almost any other race. 'You're probably not going to have a perfect election system,' said Republican Trey Grayson, a former Kentucky secretary of state and the advisory board chair of the Secure Elections Project. 'But if you're looking for one that you should have confidence in, you should feel good about that here in America.' What's stopping people from committing voter fraud? Voting more than once, tampering with ballots, lying about your residence to vote somewhere else, or casting someone else's ballot are crimes that can be punished with hefty fines and prison time. Non-U.S. citizens who break election laws can be deported. For anyone still motivated to cheat, election systems in the United States are designed with multiple layers of protection and transparency intended to stand in the way. For in-person voting, most states either require or request voters provide some sort of ID at the polls. Others require voters to verify who they are in another way, such as stating their name and address, signing a poll book or signing an affidavit. People who try to vote in the name of a recently deceased friend or family member can be caught when election officials update voter lists with death records and obituaries, said Gail Pellerin, a Democratic in the California Assembly who ran elections in Santa Cruz County for more than 27 years. Those who try to impersonate someone else run the risk that someone at the polls knows that person or that the person will later try to cast their own ballot, she said. What protections exist for absentee voting? For absentee voting, different states have different ballot verification protocols. All states require a voter's signature. Many states have further precautions, such as having bipartisan teams compare the signature with other signatures on file, requiring the signature to be notarized or requiring a witness to sign. That means even if a ballot is erroneously sent to someone's past address and the current resident mails it in, there are checks to alert election workers to the foul play. A growing number of states offer online or text-based ballot tracking tools as an extra layer of protection, allowing voters to see when their ballot has been sent out, returned and counted. Federal law requires voter list maintenance, and election officials do that through a variety of methods, from checking state and federal databases to collaborating with other states to track voters who have moved. Ballot drop boxes have security protocols, too, said Tammy Patrick, chief executive officer for programs at the National Association of Election Officials. She explained the boxes are often designed to stop hands from stealing ballots and are surveilled by camera, bolted to the ground and constructed with fire-retardant chambers, so if someone threw in a lit match, it wouldn't destroy the ballots inside. Sometimes, alleged voter fraud isn't what it seems After the 2020 election, social media surged with claims of dead people casting ballots, double voting or destroyed piles of ballots on the side of the road. Former President Donald Trump promoted and has continued to amplify these claims. But the vast majority of them were found to be untrue. An Associated Press investigation that explored every potential case of voter fraud in the six battleground states disputed by Trump found there were fewer than 475 out of millions of votes cast. That was not nearly enough to tip the outcome. Democrat Joe Biden won the six states by a combined 311,257 votes. The review also showed no collusion intended to rig the voting. Virtually every case was based on an individual acting alone to cast additional ballots. In one case, a man mistakenly thought he could vote while on parole. In another, a woman was suspected of sending in a ballot for her dead mother. Former election officials say that even more often, allegations of voter fraud turn out to result from a clerical error or a misunderstanding. Pellerin said she remembered when a political candidate in her county raised suspicion about many people being registered to vote at the same address. It turned out the voters were nuns who all lived in the same home. Patrick said that when she worked in elections in Maricopa County, Arizona, mismatched signatures were sometimes explained by a broken arm or a recent stroke. In other cases, an elderly person tried to vote twice because they forgot they had already submitted a mail ballot. 'You really have to think about the intent of the voter,' Patrick said. 'It isn't always intuitive.' Why voter fraud is unlikely to affect the presidential race It would be wrong to suggest that voter fraud never happens. With millions of votes cast in an election year, it's almost guaranteed there will be a few cases of someone trying to game the system. There also have been more insidious efforts, such as a vote-buying scheme in 2006 in Kentucky. In that case, Grayson said, voters complained, and an investigation ensued. Then participants admitted what they had done. He said the example shows how important it is for election officials to stay vigilant and constantly improve security in order to help voters feel confident. But, he said, it would be hard to make any such scheme work on a larger scale. Fraudsters would have to navigate onerous nuances in each county's election system. They also would have to keep a large number of people quiet about a crime that could be caught at any moment by officials or observers. 'This decentralized nature of the elections is itself a deterrent,' Grayson said.	https://www.voanews.com/a/though-voter-fraud-rare-us-election-offices-feature-safeguards-to-catch-it/7816733.html	2024-10-09T15:26:18-07:00

Ukrainian news outlet says it faces 'pressure' from Zelenskyy's office	WASHINGTON — A prominent Ukrainian news outlet reported Wednesday it is facing 'ongoing and systematic pressure' from the office of the Ukrainian president that is threatening the outlet’s work. In a statement on its website, the online newspaper Ukrainska Pravda said officials are being blocked from communicating with the outlet’s journalists, its reporters are being denied access to official events and businesses are being pressured to stop advertising on its website. In the statement, the outlet also highlighted a tense exchange between Ukrainska Pravda journalist Roman Kravets and Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy during a recent press conference. During the interaction, Zelenskyy questioned the outlet’s editorial independence. Ukrainska Pravda editor-in-chief Sevgil Musayeva told VOA it was important for the outlet to be honest with readers about the pressure it faces from the government. 'Ukraine is fighting for the right to exist but also for the right to be democratic, independent and transparent,' Musayeva said from Kyiv. 'And freedom of press and freedom of speech is one of [the] essential values of democracy. That’s why we will protect this value as much as we can,' Musayeva continued. Ukrainska Pravda said it views the government’s actions as attempts to influence the outlet’s editorial policy. The outlet has been facing this kind of pressure for about one year, but it has become even worse over the past two months, according to Musayeva. From now on, Ukrainska Pravda said, it will make public any attempts by the president’s office to pressure the outlet, according to the statement. 'Each such attempt only strengthens our motivation to expose corruption and mismanagement in the highest ranks of power,' the statement said. 'We call on everyone who values freedom of speech and the independence of Ukrainian journalism to join us in defending these values.' Media watchdogs — and Ukrainian journalists — have expressed concern about the state of press freedom in Ukraine in recent months amid Russia’s war on the country. In June, Reporters Without Borders, or RSF, said press freedom was 'shrinking' in Ukraine, with challenges that include rising political pressure, surveillance and threats. 'The pressure, threats and interference must stop,' Jeanne Cavelier, head of RSF’s Eastern Europe and Central Asia desk, said in the June statement. 'Despite their admirable resilience after Russia launched its full scale invasion on 24 February 2022, the Ukrainian media landscape remains fragile.' The Ukrainian president’s office, the Foreign Ministry and Ukraine’s Washington embassy did not immediately reply to VOA emails requesting comment for this story. Musayeva told VOA she believes the pressure is in response to critical coverage Ukrainska Pravda has produced about the Ukrainian government, including on misconduct and corruption. Ever since Russia invaded Ukraine in 2022, Musayeva said, there has been a sense of less tolerance for news stories critical of the government. Still, the outlet will continue to cover all aspects of government, good or bad, she said. 'We continue our critical coverage on some bad governance,' she said. 'We still see that corruption didn’t disappear.' Musayeva said she recognizes the importance for the media to cover positive stories about Ukraine. 'But at the same time, the role of independent media in democratic countries is to provide information for the people and truthful information for the people about the current situation,' she said.	https://www.voanews.com/a/ukrainian-news-outlet-says-it-faces-pressure-from-zelenskyy-office/7816617.html	2024-10-09T13:13:06-07:00	
Pakistan counters criticism of crackdown on ethnic rights group	Islamabad — Pakistan has justified its decision to outlaw a regional ethnic rights movement, citing alleged incitement of violence against the state and attempts to establish a 'parallel judicial system' under the guise of peaceful public gatherings. The group, known as the Pashtun Tahaffuz Movement (PTM), has openly criticized the powerful Pakistani military and mainly gets support from residents of the militancy-hit northwestern tribal districts bordering Afghanistan. On Sunday, the government listed the PTM as a proscribed organization, saying it was engaged in activities 'prejudicial to the peace and security of the country.' The ban drew backlash from local and international human rights groups. Wednesday, Federal Interior Minister Mohsin Naqvi told a televised news conference in Islamabad that PTM leaders were using 'abusive language' against security institutions at their rallies and promoting 'racial discrimination' in Pakistan. The ban under the country’s anti-terrorism law allowed authorities to seal PTM offices, assets and bank accounts; seize literature; and prohibit public advocacy such as media statements or speeches. Naqvi spoke hours after hundreds of enraged PTM supporters clashed with police near Peshawar, the capital of the Khyber Pakhtunkhwa border province, resulting in the deaths of at least three activists. The violence took place in an area where the PTM had planned to hold a three-day public gathering Friday, called a 'Pashtun National Jirga [assembly] Court.' It was intended to protest the civilian casualties and regional losses of property and commerce due to the increased Islamist militancy and army operations to counter the threat. 'We cannot allow anyone to set up a parallel judicial system in the country,' the minister said. 'You are allowed to engage in discussions about politics and rights, but you are not allowed to encourage people to revolt against national institutions or to provoke them to take up arms against these institutions,' Naqvi stated. The independent Human Rights Commission of Pakistan, or HRCP, denounced the ban on the PTM as 'neither transparent nor warranted' and criticized the subsequent use of force by police against the group’s members. 'We oppose any use of unwarranted and unlawful force against those protesters who are unarmed. The state has already taken disproportionate measures by proscribing the PTM and attempting to prevent it from holding this assembly,' the watchdog said. The HRCP noted that a provincial high court ruling had protected PTM supporters’ 'right to assemble peacefully.' Amnesty International has also demanded Pakistan immediately revoke the ban on the PTM. 'The listing of the Pashtun Tahaffuz Movement as a proscribed organization, days ahead of their gathering scheduled on 11 October, is part of a systematic and relentless clampdown by the Pakistani authorities on peaceful protests and assemblies by dissenting groups,' the global rights defender said in a Tuesday statement. 'This latest arbitrary ban under overbroad powers of the terror law is only the tip of the iceberg — for years, the Pakistani authorities have suppressed such movements from marginalized regions by resorting to unlawful use of force, enforced disappearances, and media bans on the coverage of protests or rallies,' said Babu Ram Pant, Amnesty’s deputy regional director for South Asia. Pakistan has experienced a surge in terrorist attacks claimed by or blamed on Tehrik-Taliban Pakistan, or TTP, which is listed as a terrorist group by the United Nations. An alliance of banned Pakistani groups, TTP is commonly known as the Pakistani Taliban, and its fighters are mainly active in border districts, allegedly conducting cross-border attacks from sanctuaries in Afghanistan with the support of the Taliban government there.	https://www.voanews.com/a/pakistan-counters-criticism-of-crackdown-on-ethnic-rights-group/7816630.html	2024-10-09T13:02:41-07:00

Las Vegas says goodbye to Tropicana with flashy casino implosion	LAS VEGAS — Sin City blew a kiss goodbye to the Tropicana before first light Wednesday in an elaborate implosion that reduced to rubble the last true mob building on the Las Vegas Strip. The Tropicana's hotel towers tumbled in a celebration that included a fireworks display. It was the first implosion in nearly a decade for a city that loves fresh starts and that has made casino implosions as much a part of its identity as gambling itself. 'What Las Vegas has done, in classic Las Vegas style, they've turned many of these implosions into spectacles,' said Geoff Schumacher, historian and vice president of exhibits and programs at the Mob Museum. Former casino mogul Steve Wynn changed the way Las Vegas blows up casinos in 1993 with the implosion of the Dunes to make room for the Bellagio. Wynn thought not only to televise the event but created a fantastical story for the implosion that made it look like pirate ships at his other casino across the street were firing at the Dunes. From then on, Schumacher said, there was a sense in Las Vegas that destruction at that magnitude was worth witnessing. The city hasn't blown up a Strip casino since 2016, when the final tower of the Riviera was leveled for a convention center expansion. This time, the implosion cleared land for a $1.5 billion baseball stadium for the relocating Oakland Athletics, part of the city's latest rebrand into a sports hub. That will leave only the Flamingo from the city's mob era on the Strip. But, Schumacher said, the Flamingo's original structures are long gone. The casino was completely rebuilt in the 1990s. The Tropicana, the third-oldest casino on the Strip, closed in April after welcoming guests for 67 years. Once known as the 'Tiffany of the Strip' for its opulence, it was a frequent haunt of the legendary Rat Pack, while its past under the mob has long cemented its place in Las Vegas lore. It opened in 1957 with three stories and 300 hotel rooms split into two wings. As Las Vegas rapidly evolved in the following decades, including a building boom of Strip megaresorts in the 1990s, the Tropicana also underwent major changes. Two hotel towers were added in later years. In 1979, the casino's beloved $1 million green-and-amber stained glass ceiling was installed above the casino floor. The Tropicana's original low-rise hotel wings survived the many renovations, however, making it the last true mob structure on the Strip. Behind the scenes of the casino's grand opening, the Tropicana had ties to organized crime, largely through reputed mobster Frank Costello. Costello was shot in the head in New York weeks after the Tropicana's debut. He survived, but the investigation led police to a piece of paper in his coat pocket with the Tropicana's exact earnings figure, revealing the mob's stake in the casino. By the 1970s, federal authorities investigating mobsters in Kansas City charged more than a dozen operatives with conspiring to skim $2 million in gambling revenue from Las Vegas casinos, including the Tropicana. Charges connected to the Tropicana alone resulted in five convictions. There were no public viewing areas for the event, but fans of the Tropicana did have a chance in April to bid farewell to the vintage Vegas relic. 'Old Vegas, it's going,' Joe Zappulla, a teary-eyed New Jersey resident, said at the time as he exited the casino, shortly before the locks went on the doors.	https://www.voanews.com/a/las-vegas-says-goodbye-to-tropicana-with-flashy-casino-implosion-/7816292.html	2024-10-09T09:17:49-07:00	
Kenyan lawmakers impeach deputy president for abuse of office	Nairobi — Kenya’s National Assembly has impeached the country's deputy president over accusations of corruption and abuse of office. Lawmakers voted overwhelmingly to remove Rigathi Gachagua from office in the vote Tuesday night. The fate of the deputy president now rests in the hands of the Senate. The process to consider removal of Kenya's deputy president from office moved to the Senate Wednesday after parliamentarians approved a motion to do so Tuesday night. Ahead of the vote, embattled deputy president Rigathi Gachagua and his allies presented his defense to the National Assembly for more than 90 minutes. But the lawmakers were not swayed, and 281 of them approved a motion to remove Gachagua from office. Forty-four others voted against the motion, and one abstained. Gachagua was accused of acquiring properties through corrupt means, though he argued the assets belonged to his late brother. He is also accused of practicing ethnic politics and acting to undermine the government. The impeachment comes after Gachagua's fell out with President William Ruto. The deputy president has denied all the allegations against him, calling them outrageous and saying they are propaganda meant to tarnish his name. Political commentator Martin Andati said the way in which Gachagua works with other politicians and the people cost him his job. 'His fate is sealed. He antagonized the MPs, he antagonized the Senate by talking badly about the chambers and the speakers, and generally, he is not a pro-people person. He has poor people management skills,' he said. Some members of parliament, like Robert Mbui, who is also deputy leader of the minority, were against the impeachment. He said the house should concentrate on public issues instead of debating one man. 'The cost of living has gone too high, people have no jobs, Mr. Speaker. Those are the things that this house should passionately deal with, but for a whole day, even the last two or three weeks to deal with one matter, I think we are losing direction. It's important that we deal with things that are affecting our people,' he said. In the past four months, Kenya has witnessed a wave of protests aimed at President Ruto's government over allegations of corruption by some politicians and government officers. Kenyans also protested high taxes and parliament’s alleged failure to act independently from the president. Some politicians have accused the deputy president of helping to organize anti-government protests, an accusation Gachagua denies. Kenyan political expert Harman Manyora said the parliament is setting a dangerous precedent that threatens the country's political future and ethnic cohesion. '[It] should not surprise us. In the future, we can have governments fall in the manner in which governments come and go in parliamentary democracies like India, Israel, the UK, and Italy, which I doubt we can withstand. From a political front, this is also a country with a lot of flashpoints. It is an ethnically charged country, and a move like this has the potential of negatively impacting the country by causing division, and you can never know where it can lead us,' said Manyora. The debate and voting about Gachagua’s conduct will continue next week. After that, some believe the issue may go to court, where he could seek legal help to either keep his job or clear his name of the allegations against him.	https://www.voanews.com/a/kenyan-lawmakers-impeach-deputy-president-for-abuse-of-office/7816273.html	2024-10-09T08:58:15-07:00	
Republicans, Democrats work to preempt fraud claims ahead of election	ANN ARBOR, FLINT AND DETROIT, MICHIGAN — U.S. election officials in battleground states are pushing back against disinformation about election integrity and working to assure Americans that their votes will be counted. Officials from both major parties in six states — Arizona, Georgia, Michigan, North Carolina, Pennsylvania and Wisconsin — met in Ann Arbor, Michigan, last month for panel discussions hosted by the nonpartisan group Keep our Republic. The group seeks to educate the American public about threats to the U.S. election system and build trust in the electoral system. They’re working to avoid a repeat of November 2020 scenes in nearby Detroit and other American cities where supporters of then-President Donald Trump, riled up by his baseless accusations of election fraud, pressured officials to stop counting the votes. This year, many Trump supporters who spoke with VOA say they worry about fraud in this election. 'Right now, our government, you're going to question everything about it,' said Marvin Minton, a Trump supporter who attended the Republican presidential nominee's town hall event in Flint, Michigan, in September. 'I wish I could say differently, but that's not how America feels. We don't trust nobody.' Angelina Kandow, who was also at the Flint event, said, 'Was [the 2020 election] stolen or not? One case, one case is enough to question the whole system.' Some Trump supporters quoted alleged instances of 2020 election fraud that were disproven during court cases triggered by the more than 60 lawsuits filed by Republicans and the Trump campaign after that year’s election. Disinformation around election integrity has gained traction among Republicans, according to an Associated Press-NORC Center for Public Affairs Research and USAFacts poll, released in August. The poll found 67% of Republicans trust Trump and his campaign for accurate information on the outcome of the election. Only 51% of Republicans said they trust the government’s certification of election results. In contrast, 87% of Democrats trust government certifications, while 82% trust Vice President Kamala Harris, the party’s presidential nominee, and her campaign. Dangerous disinformation Officials in battleground states say disinformation can be dangerous. 'They can in some cases lead to people making threats to election officials or worse, based on lies or misinformation they have been told about elections,' said Jonathan Brater, director of the Michigan Bureau of Elections. 'Even if it doesn't result in any sort of physical violence, it does undermine trust long term in the election system, which is bad for our republic and is bad for our democracy,' he told VOA. Meagan Wolfe, an election official in Wisconsin, another battleground state, has been targeted with intimidation, even death threats. Republicans loyal to Trump have attempted to oust her over false claims that she helped to rig the 2020 vote in favor of President Joe Biden. Wolfe encouraged people who don’t trust the election process to become involved. 'They can become a poll worker. They can become a poll observer. They can watch the audits of the voting equipment,' she told VOA.' All of that is open for [the] public to view.' In many states, efforts to ensure voters that elections are secure are supported by Republicans. Justin Roebuck, a Republican election official in Ottawa County, Michigan, acknowledges it’s an uphill battle. 'Our political leaders at every level need to also seek facts and to seek data,' he told VOA. 'And I think until that happens, we will have a problem in terms of our confidence and trust in the process.' Roebuck said he is working directly with citizens, instead of through the campaigns. 'We have very decentralized elections in the United States. There are always things that we can do better,' he said. 'Sometimes we have to work through those challenges and work through those messes.' Messy in Michigan It’s already looking like it could become messy in Michigan. Republicans loyal to Trump have sued Secretary of State Jocelyn Benson, a Democrat, over absentee ballot processing guidelines and voter registration lists. 'If Jocelyn Benson is not responding to what is required under the law, we will take her to court to get the courts to compel her to do that,' Michigan Republican Party chairperson Pete Hoekstra told VOA. Benson dismissed it as a Republican strategy to create a 'false sense of irregularities in the process.' 'In general, we see lawsuits masquerading as a legal strategy when they're really a PR strategy to get misinformation or sow seeds of doubt about our elections into the narrative,' she told VOA. She said that there are 'more checks and balances in place than ever before' to ensure the integrity and accuracy of the election process. Both parties have launched election-related lawsuits in various battleground states, which could mean chaos in the November election. 'Any kind of legal challenge happening this close to an election, typically, is lawyers putting a placeholder in case they may not win in a state or may not have an outcome they like, and it gives them the ability to challenge the election after the fact,' said Kim Wyman, senior fellow with the Bipartisan Policy Center's Elections Project in Washington. There are other potential disruptions, including efforts to delay election certification by county officials who support Trump. 'We've seen some legal maneuvers and some boards of elections that have changed the rules that allow more scrutiny over the canvas period and the certification of the election,' Wyman told VOA. After Trump's efforts to overturn his 2020 loss culminated in the January 6, 2021, attack on the U.S. Capitol by his supporters, Congress sought to prevent such events from recurring by passing the Electoral Count Reform and Presidential Transition Improvement Act. Mandatory deadline The reforms set a new mandatory December 11 deadline for states to submit certified slates of presidential electors, provided expedited court access to resolve challenges and raised the threshold for objecting to election results in Congress. Battleground states Arizona, Georgia, Michigan, Nevada and North Carolina have passed legislation to ensure that canvasses, recounts, audits and legal challenges meet the new deadline. Pennsylvania and Wisconsin have not, leaving their electoral systems vulnerable to partisan lawsuits and political pressures that could force them to miss the certification deadline. This could leave uncertain the fate of 29 electoral college votes. A presidential candidate needs at least 270 electoral college votes to win.

Taliban publicly flog 9 Afghan men, women despite UN outcry	ISLAMABAD — Hardline Taliban authorities in Afghanistan reported Wednesday that nine people, including at least two women, were publicly flogged after being convicted of various crimes, such as adultery. Five of the punishments took place at a sports stadium in Kandahar, capital of the eponymous southern province. Local Taliban officials, judicial officers, and ordinary Afghans were among the onlookers. The Taliban’s Supreme Court announced the details, saying the five individuals were found guilty of adultery, sodomy, and robbery, with each of them receiving 39 lashes and prison sentences ranging from two to seven years. It did not say whether females were among the convicts. The court separately announced that two men and two women were publicly flogged Wednesday for adultery in the northern Afghan provinces of Takhar and Samangan. Hundreds of men and women have been lashed in sports stadiums across Afghanistan since the Taliban regained power in 2021. In June this year, the Islamist leaders carried out a mass lashing of 63 convicts, including 14 women, in a packed northern sports stadium for committing 'immoral crimes,' such as adultery and homosexuality. The Taliban have also executed at least five Afghan murder convicts in crowded sports stadiums, citing the Islamic concept of retributive justice known as qisas. Global outcry The executions and corporeal punishments have drawn an outcry and calls from the United Nations to immediately end them for being in breach of human rights and international law. Taliban leaders defend their criminal justice system, arguing that it is in line with their interpretation of the Islamic law of Sharia. They also rejected criticism of their curbs on Afghan women’s access to education, employment, and public life at large. The United States and the world at large have refused to recognize Taliban authorities as the official government of Afghanistan, citing their treatment of women, among other human rights concerns. 'We continue to make clear that any significant steps towards normalization of relations is contingent upon a profound shift in the Taliban’s human rights conduct,' said Matthew Miller, the U.S. State Department spokesperson, speaking to reporters Tuesday. 'And there has been remarkable unity among the international community on that question.' Girls ages 12 and older are not allowed to attend secondary school, making Afghanistan the only country in the world with this restriction, while female students have been barred from universities. Most Afghan women are prohibited from working in both public and private sectors, including the U.N. The Taliban last month enacted so-called 'vice and virtue' laws that, according to critics, have dealt another blow to women’s rights in Afghanistan. The contentious decree deems the sound of a woman’s voice in public a moral violation and requires them to cover their entire bodies and faces when outdoors. It also forbids women from looking at men to whom they are not related and vice versa.	https://www.voanews.com/a/taliban-publicly-flog-9-afghan-men-women-despite-un-outcry/7816230.html	2024-10-09T08:44:12-07:00	
Expansion of ASEAN-China free-trade pact questioned amid summit	TAIPEI, TAIWAN — As Laos hosts this year’s summit of the Association of Southeast Asian Nations, Beijing is calling for additions to its free-trade agreement with the regional forum that focus on smart cities, 5G, artificial intelligence and e-commerce. Ahead of the ASEAN summit, which began Sunday and ends Friday, Chinese state media have stepped up efforts to promote the benefits of what they call an upgrade to the China-ASEAN Free Trade Area, or CAFTA, agreement. Analysts point out that the two sides have not reached agreement on what’s being called 'CAFTA 3.0,' and that it remains to be seen whether including China's electric vehicles and e-commerce would benefit Southeast Asian industries that are struggling to compete with their Chinese counterparts. 'The establishment of a free-trade demonstration zone is actually nothing more than the hope that things can be sold into China,' Ming-Fang Tsai, a professor in the Department of Industrial Economics at Taiwan’s Tamkang University, told VOA. However, he said the Chinese market is facing a lack of domestic demand and overproduction, leading to price competition. 'So, is the FTA 3.0 really an upgrade? Actually, it is a big question mark,' he said by email. Nevertheless, some specific areas in the 3.0 agreement still attract the attention of experts, including its focus on the EV industry. Although ASEAN is also actively developing an EV industry, He Jiangbing, a China-based economist and finance commentator, told VOA if China's major EV manufacturers pour into Southeast Asia through changes in the agreement, it would likely have a huge impact on the local automobile industries. 'China’s mainland started relatively early in new-energy vehicles and has developed rapidly for 10 years. But the automotive industry in ASEAN is relatively weak. If China's new-energy vehicles are sold in ASEAN, it will be difficult for Southeast Asian [traditional] car companies to resist,' He said. Southeast Asia's own automobile industry will be greatly affected or cease to exist, He said. But Lu Xi, a senior lecturer at the Lee Kuan Yew School of Public Policy at the National University of Singapore, told VOA that most of China's EVs are not getting into Southeast Asia through exports but through production-line transfer, similar to joint ventures, so a price war should not cause a negative impact. 'With the transfer of [China's EV] manufacturing industry chain, the economic structure of Southeast Asia will undergo a huge transformation,' Lu said by email. 'Depending on the current political and economic situation between China and the US, Southeast Asia itself also has a very broad local market and a very good young population structure, so on the whole, the Southeast Asian market should be one of the important engines of economic growth in the whole region in the future.' Tsai noted that Chinese manufacturers will set up factories in Southeast Asia to avoid the 'Made in China' label and restrictions on Chinese products. 'U.S. controls on technology may affect the components of EVs in the future,' he said, 'which brings great pressure to Chinese manufacturers.' In addition to EVs, the 3.0 agreement also focuses on smart cities, 5G, artificial intelligence and e-commerce. Analysts say China’s e-commerce is already having a negative impact on the region as orders of cheaper Chinese imports and knockoffs are flooding Southeast Asia. Half of the ceramic factories in Thailand's northern Lampang province have closed, and Indonesian textile workers are facing mass layoffs, the South China Morning Post and the Bangkok Post reported. 'In the face of the massive entry of the [Chinese] e-commerce, frankly speaking, these Southeast Asian countries are relatively uncompetitive,' said Tsai. 'Because first, [they] will not be able to compete with China in marketing and sales. Second, [China's] own products are cheaper. 'If my entire e-commerce system is better than yours,' Tsai said, 'and my products are not more expensive than yours, then how can you compete with me?' Nonetheless, in a September speech for the Regional Comprehensive Economic Partnership, or RCEP, in Nanning, China, ASEAN Secretary-General Kao Kim Hourn called on businesses to take full advantage of the partnership as they move toward the changes. He touted the RCEP, the world’s largest trade bloc, covering nearly 30% of global gross domestic product at $29 trillion and 2.3 billion people across the Asia Pacific region. 'ASEAN’s multidirectional economic relations have been a major driver behind the use of RCEP,' said Hourn, according to a written statement. 'China, for example, has remained ASEAN’s largest trading partner for the past 15 years and has also climbed from the 5th largest source of FDI to ASEAN in 2022 to the 3rd largest in 2023. With both RCEP and ACFTA 3.0 in place, I am confident that trade and investment between ASEAN, China, and the rest of the RCEP partners will continue to flourish for the benefit of the people in this wider region.' ASEAN calls the free-trade agreement ACFTA; Beijing refers to it as CAFTA. The agreement was established by China and ASEAN in 2009, and the ASEAN-China Summit announced the launch of negotiations for the changes in November 2022.

Wimbledon tennis tournament replaces line judges with AI in break with tradition	LONDON — That long-held Wimbledon tradition of line judges dressed in elegant uniforms is no more. The All England Club announced Wednesday that artificial intelligence will be used to make the 'out' and 'fault' calls at the championships from 2025. Wimbledon organizers said the decision to adopt live electronic line calling was made following extensive testing at the 2024 tournament and 'builds on the existing ball-tracking and line-calling technology that has been in place for many years.' 'We consider the technology to be sufficiently robust and the time is right to take this important step in seeking maximum accuracy in our officiating,' said Sally Bolton, chief executive of the All England Club. 'For the players, it will offer them the same conditions they have played under at a number of other events on tour.' Bolton said Wimbledon had a responsibility to 'balance tradition and innovation.' 'Line umpires have played a central role in our officiating setup at the championships for many decades,' she said, 'and we recognize their valuable contribution and thank them for their commitment and service.' Line-calling technology has long been used at Wimbledon and other tennis tournaments to call whether serves are in or out. The All England Club also said Wednesday that the ladies' and gentlemen's singles finals will be scheduled to take place at the later time of 4 p.m. local time on the second Saturday and Sunday, respectively — and after doubles finals on those days. Bolton said the moves have been made to ensure the day of the finals 'builds towards the crescendo of the ladies' and gentlemen's singles finals, with our champions being crowned in front of the largest possible worldwide audience.'	https://www.voanews.com/a/wimbledon-tennis-tournament-replaces-line-judges-with-ai-in-break-with-tradition-/7816112.html	2024-10-09T07:07:00-07:00	
Mozambicans casts ballots in election that may prolong ruling party dominance	Maputo — Mozambicans vote Wednesday between the party that has dominated their country’s political landscape for nearly 50 years or something different. Whoever wins will inherit major challenges, including an insurgency in the oil and gas-rich area of Cabo Delgado. Voters braved morning rain in Maputo to line up as early as 7:00 am to cast their ballots. They have four candidates to choose from; Daniel Chapo, the ruling Frelimo party leader; Ossufo Momade, the candidate of one main opposition party that came in second in the last presidential election; Lutero Simango, the leader of the Mozambique Democratic Movement and Venancio Mondlane, an independent who seems popular among youth. Aslak Ore, a researcher on Mozambique at the Christian Michelsen Institute in Norway, said that while supporters of Mondlane have shown excitement, he still faces stiff challenges. 'There’s been a lot of enthusiasm about his candidature, however he doesn’t have the electoral organization of either Renamo or Frelimo. The question is if he’s going to be able to convert that obvious enthusiasm among the population… into the votes,' he said. At a polling place at the Josina Machel secondary school in Maputo, 22-year-old Augusto Paz said he waited about an hour, but he had to make sure to vote. 'As a young Mozambican man, I feel like this is important because it might be the choice that would change things in our country. I am talking about healthcare, education, and development in general,' he said. After casting his ballot, Sergio Pantie, a member of parliament and Frelimo supporter, told us he is confident his party will win. 'People continue to love and highly consider Frelimo as an option to continue running this country... the results will prove, once again, that Frelimo is loved and esteemed by the Mozambican people,' he said. Two of the candidates, Momade and Simango, voted at the same polling place where outgoing President Filipe Nyusi casts his ballot. Former St. Lucia prime minister Dr. Kenny Anthony, who arrived in Maputo on October 2nd, heads the Commonwealth International Observers’ delegation. He told VOA his group was still visiting other polling stations and getting reports from other parts of the country. Meanwhile... 'There seems to be some optimism that this is going to be a better administered election than previous elections. Whether that will be the case, I don’t know… we’ve just visited this polling station, and all seem to have gone on very well here,' he said. Whoever wins these elections will inherit many challenges starting with the economy and debt repayments, Ore said. 'It’s between 12 and 14 billion dollars in external debt. Recently they have been able to pay back much of that debt, but they have done so by way of accumulating a lot of domestic debt. The state takes up loans from the banking system and institutions locally, so they are accumulating debt at the same time as they are paying back the external debt,' said Ore. In addition to debt challenges, the government has been battling an insurgency in the gas- and oil-rich Cabo Delgado province, where about 4,000 people have been killed and about 1 million displaced since 2017, hindering multibillion-dollar oil and gas projects. Some countries, including Rwanda, have stepped in recently to help quell the insurgency -- an act that Adriano Nuvunga, a social activist and director of the Center for Democracy and Human Rights in Mozambique, disagrees with. 'Mozambique, big as it is, massive as it is… 33 million people… but it needs to import soldiers from Rwanda to protect its sovereignty… Rwanda, a tiny country of 13 million people to protect us here,' said Nuvunga. Ruling party candidate Chapo said if he wins, securing the Cabo Delgado area will be his top priority because without security, there is no development he recently told supporters. Nuvunga said while Frelimo was seen as a liberation movement 50 years ago, times have changed. 'The people here, they have nothing to do with what people did five decades ago. It’s about today; are you able to put in place credible policies and put in place a credible system of governance that would work for the people,' said Nuvunga. More than 17 million people are registered to vote.	https://www.voanews.com/a/mozambicans-casts-ballots-in-election-that-may-prolong-ruling-party-dominance/7816076.html	2024-10-09T06:49:51-07:00

Study: Climate change made deadly Hurricane Helene more intense	Washington — Hurricane Helene's torrential rain and powerful winds were made about 10% more intense due to climate change, according to a study published Wednesday by the World Weather Attribution (WWA) group. Although a 10% increase 'might seem relatively small... that small change in the hazard really leads to big change in impacts and damage,' said climate scientist Friederike Otto, who heads the research organization. The study also found that fossil fuels — the primary cause of climate change — have made hurricanes like Helene 2.5 times more likely to occur. In other words, storms of Helene's magnitude were formerly anticipated once every 130 years, but now the probability is closer to once every 53 years, on average. To conduct the study, researchers focused on three aspects of Hurricane Helene: precipitation, winds and the water temperature of the Gulf of Mexico — a key factor in its formation. 'All aspects of this event were amplified by climate change to different degrees,' Ben Clarke, a co-author of the study and researcher at Imperial College London, told a press conference. 'And we'll see more of the same as the world continues to warm,' he continued. The research by WWA, an international group of scientists and meteorologists who study the role of climate change in extreme weather events, comes as the southeastern US state of Florida prepares for the arrival of another major hurricane, Milton, just 10 days after it was hit by Helene. Destruction Helene made landfall in northwestern Florida on September 26 as a Category 4 hurricane with winds up to 140 mph (225 kph). The storm then moved north, causing heavy rain and devastating floods in several states, including North Carolina, where it claimed the highest death toll. The authors of the study emphasized that the risk posed by hurricanes has increased in scope beyond coastal areas. Bernadette Woods Placky, chief meteorologist at NGO Climate Central, said Helene 'had so much intensity' that it would take time for it to lose strength, but the 'storm was moving fast... so it could go farther inland pretty quickly.' This study utilized three methodologies to examine the three aspects of the storm, and was conducted by researchers from the US, the UK, Sweden and the Netherlands. To study its rainfall, researchers used an approach based on both observation and climate models, depending on the two regions involved: one for coastal areas like Florida, and another for inland areas like the Appalachian mountains. In both cases, the study found precipitation had increased by 10 percent because of global warming, which is currently at 1.3 degrees Celsius above pre-industrial levels. To study Helene's winds, scientists looked at hurricane data dating back as far as 1900. They determined Helene's winds were 11 percent stronger, or 13 mph (21 kph), as a result of climate change. Lastly, the researchers examined the water temperature in the Gulf of Mexico, where Helene formed, finding it was around 2 degrees Celsius above normal. This record temperature was made 200 to 500 times more likely due to climate change, the study asserts. Warmer oceans release more water vapor, providing more energy for storms as they form. 'If humans continue to burn fossil fuels, the US will face even more destructive hurricanes,' Clarke warned in a statement.	https://www.voanews.com/a/study-climate-change-made-deadly-hurricane-helene-more-intense/7815932.html	2024-10-09T04:33:35-07:00

China says Taiwan president increasing 'hostility'	BEIJING — China has accused Taiwanese President Lai Ching-te of escalating 'hostility' and pursuing independence, as the self-ruled island prepared to celebrate its National Day. China, which split with Taiwan at the end of a civil war in 1949, regards the island as part of its territory that must eventually be reunified, by force if necessary. Lai, who took power in May after his Democratic Progressive Party won a record third term, has been a vocal defender of Taiwan's sovereignty, angering Beijing. Zhu Fenglian, a spokeswoman for a Chinese body in charge of Taiwan affairs, said Lai had 'recycled the 'Taiwan independence' fallacy once again' and exposed 'his malicious intent to escalate hostility and confrontation.' Zhu's remarks, reported by state media late Tuesday, were in response to Lai saying it was 'impossible' for China to be the 'motherland' of Taiwan. 'One of the most important meanings of these celebrations is that we must remember that we are a sovereign and independent country, and we must always cherish and love our country,' Lai said Saturday ahead of Taiwan's National Day. Three members of the U.S. Congress will be among the foreign guests in attendance when Lai delivers his National Day speech on Thursday, which will likely touch on the island's China policies. China's defense spokesman Wu Qian said Wednesday that the United States was 'adding fuel to the fire on the Taiwan issue' by providing arms to Taipei, and 'pushing Taiwan step by step into a dangerous situation of war.' Taiwan was on alert for Chinese military drills near the island on National Day after observing 'some maritime deployments,' a senior security official told AFP on Wednesday. Beijing maintains a near-daily military presence around Taiwan and in the past two years China has held three rounds of large-scale war games, deploying aircraft and ships to encircle the island. Chinese President Xi Jinping recently used his country's national day celebrations to reiterate his call for the reunification of China and Taiwan. 'Achieving complete national reunification is the common aspiration of the Chinese people,' Xi said. 'It is an irreversible trend, a matter of justice, and it is in accordance with the popular will. No one can stop the march of history,' he said.	https://www.voanews.com/a/china-says-taiwan-president-increasing-hostility-/7815846.html	2024-10-09T02:41:05-07:00

China says anti-dumping move on EU brandy is legitimate trade measure	BEIJING — China's anti-dumping measures against brandies imported from the European Union are 'legitimate trade remedy measures,' the commerce ministry said on Wednesday, a day after imposing the temporary curb. French brands such as Hennessy and Remy Martin will face the strictures, adopted just days after the 27-nation bloc voted for tariffs on Chinese-made electric vehicles (EVs), sparking its biggest trade row with Beijing in a decade. China's commerce ministry said preliminary findings of an investigation showed that dumping of brandy from the European Union threatened 'substantial damage' to domestic industry. On Wednesday the ministry said the EU's actions against Chinese EVs 'seriously lack a factual and legal basis' and 'clearly violate' World Trade Organization (WTO) rules. China has protested strongly to the WTO, it added. Trade tensions have surged since the European Commission said last week it would press ahead with tariffs on China-made EVs, even after Germany, the bloc's largest economy, rejected them. Another sign of rising trade tension was the ministry's remarks on Tuesday that an anti-dumping and anti-subsidy investigation into EU pork products would deliver 'objective and fair' decisions when it wraps up. It also said it was considering a hike in tariffs on imports of large-engine vehicles, which would hit German producers hardest. German exports to China of vehicles with engines 2.5 liters in size, or larger, reached $1.2 billion last year.	https://www.voanews.com/a/china-says-anti-dumping-move-on-eu-brandy-is-legitimate-trade-measure/7815829.html	2024-10-09T01:45:11-07:00	
British Foreign Secretary Lammy to visit China in bid to reset ties, sources say	BEIJING — Britain's Foreign Secretary David Lammy will visit China next week, sources familiar with the plan said, as the new Labor government seeks less confrontational ties with the world's second-largest economy and to resume trade and investment talks. British officials have said they want to recalibrate many of the previous Conservative Party-led government's positions on China, which it described as an 'epoch-defining challenge,' particularly around accepting Chinese job-creating investment. But Britain is unlikely to budge on issues such as Chinese firms' involvement in providing key infrastructure, human rights and restoring the license of state broadcaster CGTN, as it is controlled by China's ruling Communist Party. Lammy, who has vowed to overhaul Britain's ties with China, will meet Chinese officials in Beijing and representatives of British firms in Shanghai, two of the four sources, who all spoke on condition of anonymity, told Reuters. His itinerary has not yet been finalized, however, another person familiar with the planning said. A Foreign Office spokesperson said ministerial travel would be announced in the usual way. China's foreign ministry did not respond to a request for comment. During a telephone call in August, British Prime Minister Keir Starmer, who took office the previous month, told Chinese President Xi Jinping their countries must be able to talk frankly about disagreements while pursuing closer economic ties and co-operation on global issues. British finance minister Rachel Reeves is also considering traveling to China in the near future, said two sources. Her visit will aim to revive trade and investment talks that are supposed to take place annually. The last round of the UK-China Economic and Financial Dialogue, as it is called, was held in 2019. China is Britain's sixth largest trading partner, accounting for 5% of total trade, British government figures show. But questions on Hong Kong, espionage accusations, and plans for a new Chinese embassy in London await resolution and may slow plans to resume talks and promises of fresh investment. Last week, two Britons, including a former researcher for a senior British lawmaker, pleaded not guilty to a charge of spying for China. That followed China's accusation in June that British foreign intelligence service MI6 recruited two staff members from unnamed state bodies to act as spies. Beijing is also waiting for a go-ahead on plans to build a new embassy in London after they were thrown out on security grounds in December 2022. In recent years, the two countries have also traded barbs on Hong Kong, a former British colony handed back to Beijing in 1997. More than 180,000 people have moved to Britain from Hong Kong under a special visa program set up in response to a crackdown on dissent in the Asian financial hub. In September, a senior Labor lawmaker said Britain should outlaw imports of products made by forced labor in China's northwestern region of Xinjiang.	https://www.voanews.com/a/british-foreign-secretary-lammy-to-visit-china-in-bid-to-reset-ties-sources-say/7815825.html	2024-10-09T01:36:36-07:00

US considers breakup of Google in landmark search case	NEW YORK — The U.S. said on Tuesday it may ask a judge to force Alphabet's Google to divest parts of its business, such as its Chrome browser and Android operating system, that it says are used to maintain an illegal monopoly in online search. In a landmark case, a judge in August found that Google, which processes 90% of U.S. internet searches, had built an illegal monopoly. The Justice Department's proposed remedies have the potential to reshape how Americans find information on the internet while shrinking Google's revenues and giving its competitors more room to grow. 'Fully remedying these harms requires not only ending Google's control of distribution today, but also ensuring Google cannot control the distribution of tomorrow,' the Justice Department said. The proposed fixes will also aim to keep Google's past dominance from extending to the burgeoning business of artificial intelligence, prosecutors said. The Justice Department might also ask the court to end Google's payments to have its search engine pre-installed or set as the default on new devices. Google has made annual payments - $26.3 billion in 2021 - to companies including Apple and other device manufacturers to ensure that its search engine remained the default on smartphones and browsers, keeping its market share strong. Google, which plans to appeal, said in a corporate blog post that the proposals were 'radical' and said they 'go far beyond the specific legal issues in this case.' Google maintains that its search engine has won users with its quality, adding that it faces robust competition from Amazon and other sites, and that users can choose other search engines as their default. The world's fourth-largest company with a market capitalization of over $2 trillion, Alphabet is under mounting legal pressure from competitors and antitrust authorities. A U.S. judge ruled on Monday in a separate case, that Google must open up its lucrative app store, Play, to greater competition, including making Android apps available from rival sources. Google is also fighting a Justice Department case that seeks the breakup of its web advertising business. As part of its efforts to prevent Google's dominance from extending into AI, the Justice Department said it may seek to make available to rivals the indexes, data and models it uses for Google search and AI-assisted search features. Other orders prosecutors may seek include restricting Google from entering agreements that limit other AI competitors' access to web content and letting websites opt out of Google using their content to train AI models. Google said the AI-related proposals could stifle the sector. 'There are enormous risks to the government putting its thumb on the scale of this vital industry — skewing investment, distorting incentives, hobbling emerging business models — all at precisely the moment that we need to encourage investment,' Google said. The Justice Department is expected to file a more detailed proposal with the court by Nov. 20. Google will have a chance to propose its own remedies by Dec. 20. U.S. District Judge Amit Mehta's ruling in Washington was a major win for antitrust enforcers who have brought an ambitious set of cases against Big Tech companies over the past four years. The U.S. has also sued Meta Platforms, Amazon.com and Apple claiming they illegally maintain monopolies. Some of the ideas in the Justice Department's proposals to break up Google had previously garnered support from Google's smaller competitors such as reviews site Yelp and rival search engine company DuckDuckGo. Yelp, which sued Google over search in August, says spinning off Google's Chrome browser and AI services should be on the table. Yelp also wants Google to be prohibited from giving preference to Google's local business pages in search results.	https://www.voanews.com/a/us-considers-breakup-of-google-in-landmark-search-case/7815797.html	2024-10-09T00:44:25-07:00	
Grazer beats the behemoth that killed her cub to win Alaska's Fat Bear Contest	ANCHORAGE, Alaska — In a storyline better befitting a melodrama than a popularity vote, Grazer won her second Fat Bear Contest Tuesday by defeating the male behemoth that killed her cub this summer. Grazer beat Chunk by more than 40,000 votes cast by fans watching live cameras at explore.org of Alaska’s Katmai National Park and Preserve. Fans cast votes online for their favorite chunky competitor in tournament-style brackets that begins with 12 bears. They picked the bear they believe best exemplifies winter preparedness by the fat they have accumulated over the summer feeding on the sockeye salmon that return to Brooks River. The bears often perch at the top of a falls in the river, grabbing leaping salmon out of the air as the fish attempt to hurdle the waterfall to spawn upstream. This is where Grazer’s cub died after it slipped over the waterfall and was killed by Chunk, perhaps the most dominant brown bear on the river. Grazer fought Chunk in an effort to save the cub, but it later died. The death was captured on the live cameras. Another death was captured live by the cameras just last week, delaying the release of the tournament bracket for a day. Bear 402, a female bear that was supposed to be a contestant in this year’s contest, was killed by a male brown bear the day the brackets were expected to be released. Grazer has conspicuously blond ears and a long, straight muzzle, according to her bio page at explore.org. 'She is a formidable presence on Brooks River. Her fearlessness and strength have earned her respect, with most bears avoiding confrontation,' it says. Her other surviving cub from her third litter placed second two weeks ago in the Fat Bear Junior contest. Chunk is perhaps the largest bear on the river, with narrow-set eyes, dark brown fur and a distinctive scar across his muzzle, his bio says. He used his size to rise to the top of the river hierarchy this year and secured the prime fishing spots. 'Chunk’s confidence and aggression paid off, allowing him to feast on 42 salmon in 10 hours,' it says. 'His physical success is evident in his bulky form.' Adult male brown bears typically weigh 270 to 410 kilograms in mid-summer. By the time they are ready to hibernate after feasting on migrating and spawning salmon — each eats as many as 30 fish per day — large males can weigh well over 454 kilograms. Females are about one-third smaller. The annual contest, which drew more than 1.3 million votes last year, is a way to celebrate the resiliency of the 2,200 brown bears that live in the preserve on the Alaska Peninsula, which extends from the state’s southwest corner toward the Aleutian Islands. In addition to the live cameras, Katmai has become a bucket list tourist destination and viewing stands have been built on the river to allow people to watch the brown bears fish for salmon.	https://www.voanews.com/a/grazer-beats-the-behemoth-that-killed-her-cub-to-win-alaska-s-fat-bear-contest-/7815789.html	2024-10-09T00:31:44-07:00	
Brazilian nun awarded UN refugee prize for work with migrants	BRASILIA, Brazil — A Brazilian nun who has helped refugees and migrants for 40 years on Wednesday won the Nansen prize awarded every year by the U.N. High Commission for Refugees for outstanding work to protect internally displaced and stateless people. Sister Rosita Milesi, 79, is a member of the Catholic order of the Scalabrini nuns, who are renowned for their service to refugees worldwide. Her parents were poor farmers from an Italian background in southern Brazil, and she became a nun at 19. As a lawyer, social worker and activist, Milesi championed the rights and dignity of refugees and migrants of different nationalities in Brazil for four decades. The UNHCR Nansen Refugee Award was established in 1954 in honor of Norwegian humanitarian, scientist, explorer, and diplomat Fridtjof Nansen. UNHCR announced the award in Geneva. Milesi joins a long list of distinguished global laureates, including former U.S. first lady Eleanor Roosevelt, the first person to receive the award when it was set up in 1954, the charity Medecins Sans Frontières (Doctors Without Borders) and Germany's former chancellor Angela Merkel. She is the second Brazilian to receive the award. Former Sao Paulo Archbishop Dom Paulo Evaristo Arns won the prize in 1985. Milesi leads the Migration and Human Rights Institute (IMDH) in Brasilia, through which she has helped thousands of forced migrants and displaced people access essential services such as shelter, healthcare, education and legal assistance. She coordinates RedeMIR, a national network of 60 organizations that operates throughout Brazil, including in remote border regions, to support refugees and migrants. Her work has had a significant impact on Brazil's legal landscape, including the shaping of its 1997 refugee law and the 2017 migration law, which enshrined critical protections for displaced people and reduced the risk of statelessness, UNHCR said in a statement.	https://www.voanews.com/a/brazilian-nun-awarded-un-refugee-prize-for-work-with-migrants/7815775.html	2024-10-09T00:04:01-07:00

Renewable energy to fall short of UN goal to triple by 2030, IEA says	LONDON — Renewable energy sources are set to meet nearly half of all electricity demand by the end of the decade, but to fall short of a U.N. goal to triple capacity to reduce carbon emissions, an International Energy Agency (IEA) report showed on Wednesday. The world is set to add more than 5,500 gigawatts (GW) of renewable energy capacity between now and 2030, almost three times the increase between 2017 and 2023, the IEA Renewables 2024 report said. It said the increase is equivalent to the current power capacity of China, the European Union, India and the United States combined, but not enough to meet a target set at the COP28 U.N. climate conference. For the world to triple capacity, governments need to intensify efforts to integrate renewables into power grids. This requires the building and modernizing of 25 million kilometers of electricity grids and reaching 1,500 GW of storage capacity by 2030, the IEA said. Solar photovoltaic (PV) is set to account for 80% of the growth in renewable energy capacity to 2030. The wind sector is also forecast to recover and double its rate of expansion to 2030 compared with 2017-2023. Global solar manufacturing capacity is expected to be more than 1,100 GW by the end of 2024, more than double the estimated demand by then. This supply glut has helped to cheapen solar module prices but also means many manufacturers are experiencing large financial losses, the report added. While the U.N. target is a challenge, national governments are hitting their goals, with 70 countries, accounting for 80% of global renewable power capacity, estimated to reach or surpass their renewable energy targets for 2030. 'Renewables are moving faster than national governments can set targets for,' IEA Executive Director Fatih Birol said. 'This is mainly driven not just by efforts to lower emissions or boost energy security: it's increasingly because renewables today offer the cheapest option to add new power plants in almost all countries around the world.'	https://www.voanews.com/a/renewable-energy-to-fall-short-of-un-goal-to-triple-by-2030-iea-says/7815765.html	2024-10-08T23:29:40-07:00	
ASEAN holds summit in Laos as Thailand floats new plan for Myanmar	Vientiane, Laos — Southeast Asian leaders met in Laos on Wednesday for a summit expected to find ways of tackling a worsening civil war in Myanmar, with Thailand set to propose a new path for a political solution after a regional peace effort made scant progress. Chaos has prevailed in Myanmar since a 2021 military coup sparked a nationwide rebellion and a civil war that has ravaged the nation of 55 million. The ruling junta has so far refused to hold talks with its opponents, whom it calls terrorists. Thailand offered this week to host an 'informal consultation' of the 10 members of the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN) in December to try to find a way out of the intractable conflict that has displaced millions of people. 'We want to see a political solution,' Nikorndej Balankura, a spokesperson of Thailand's foreign ministry, told reporters. 'Thailand is ready to coordinate with all other member countries so there would be a concerted ASEAN effort that could lead to peace in Myanmar.' Thailand's initiative would complement existing ASEAN peace efforts, but may not immediately involve countries beyond the region, he added. The proposal, floated at Tuesday's meeting of ASEAN foreign ministers, comes as the bloc runs low on options to tackle the Myanmar crisis. There has been no progress on its 'Five-Point Consensus' peace plan unveiled months after the coup, or a drive by Indonesia to persuade anti-junta groups to start dialog. In previous months, Thailand has suggested that Myanmar's other influential neighbors, China and India, might play a role in the peace effort, but the latest plan is limited to the ASEAN bloc. Any decision on whether Myanmar's ruling generals or their opponents would be invited to the informal talks would be up to ASEAN chair Laos and the other member states, Nikorndej added. Myanmar's civil war and troubles in the disputed South China Sea are key issues set to dominate the ASEAN leaders' meeting in Vientiane, which will be followed by two days of summits with premiers and top diplomats from regional and world powers. U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken, Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi, Japanese premier Shigeru Ishiba, Chinese premier Li Qiang and Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov are among those set to attend. Opening Wednesday's summit, Laos Prime Minister Sonexay Siphandone said ASEAN faced many challenges and had its own ways to tackle them. 'Laos deems that ASEAN's past successes are due to our understanding of each other,' he said. 'We help each other, and co-operate with each other, with an ASEAN way and principles. ' Ahead of Blinken's trip, the United States' top diplomat for East Asia, Daniel Kritenbrink, told reporters there had been 'virtually zero progress' in efforts to get Myanmar's junta to reduce violence, free political prisoners and talk to the democratic opposition. 'The secretary will continue to emphasize to partners in the region that we must keep up pressure on the regime,' he said, of Blinken's visit. Since ASEAN has barred the Myanmar generals from its summits until they can meet requirements of the peace plan, the country is represented in Laos by a senior foreign ministry official. Nikorndej said Myanmar's representative urged ASEAN foreign ministers on Tuesday to understand and sympathize with the military government and use more 'moderate language' in discussing the crisis. ASEAN must not bend to accommodate the junta's demands, including recognizing its own five-step 'roadmap' for what is expected to be a one-sided election, however, former Thai diplomat Korbsak Chutikul warned. 'Care must be exercised not to be roped into going along with Myanmar's own five-point plan, like to hold elections next year for a semblance of legitimacy,' Korbsak said.	https://www.voanews.com/a/asean-holds-summit-in-laos-as-thailand-floats-new-plan-for-myanmar-/7815760.html	2024-10-08T23:16:28-07:00	
Daughter of Singapore's founding father dies at 69	SINGAPORE — The estranged sister of Singapore's former Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong died on Wednesday at 69, after being diagnosed with progressive supranuclear palsy in 2020. The death of Lee Wei Ling, a doctor, was announced by her younger brother Lee Hsien Yang on Facebook. The siblings are the children of Singapore's founding Prime Minister Lee Kuan Yew and have been embroiled in a public dispute around what to do with their late father's house after the elder Lee died in 2015. The former PM Lee, now a senior minister in the cabinet, wrote on Facebook that despite the rift between him and his siblings, 'I held nothing against Ling, and continued to do whatever I could to ensure her welfare.' He described his sister as a fighter who was 'fiercely loyal to friends, sympathized instinctively with the underdog, and would mobilize actively to do something when she saw unfairness, or suspected wrongdoing.' The late doctor earned the prestigious President's scholarship and topped her cohort in medical school. Lee never married and stayed with her parents until their deaths. She helped set up Singapore's National Neuroscience Institute and served as its director for 11 years. She also regularly contributed columns to the national newspaper, The Straits Times. Senior minister Lee said his sister had diagnosed herself before the doctors did. 'She took it with her usual fortitude and stoicism and posted about it as one of those things in life to be borne and endured. She knew what it meant, and made the most of the time she had, even as her health declined,' he wrote. When announcing her illness, Wei Ling wrote: 'My immediate reaction to the news was 'ren', or endure in Chinese, of which the traditional character has a knife above a heart. I have been practicing 'ren' since I was in Chinese school, recognizing that life has many unpleasant, unavoidable situations.'	https://www.voanews.com/a/daughter-of-singapore-s-founding-father-dies-at-69/7815752.html	2024-10-08T22:39:39-07:00

Cameroon citizens want proof their 91-year-old president is alive	Yaounde, Cameroon — Cameroon government officials said the central African state’s 91-year-old president, Paul Biya, is in good health, contrary to information circulating on social and mainstream media. Biya has not been seen in public since his official visit to China more than 1 month ago. Citizens say they want proof that their longtime leader is well. Biya is in excellent health, according to a statement issued Tuesday by Samuel Mvondo Ayolo, director of the Civil Cabinet. Ayolo said Biya is in Geneva, Switzerland, where he has been granting audiences and working for the development of Cameroon. The statement comes after social media reports on Tuesday said Biya was dead but gave no details as to where and when the long-serving leader had died. Biya was last seen in Beijing over a month ago during a China-Africa leaders forum. In the meantime, some citizens said they do not believe Biya is alive. One of those is Gloria Wirkom, a businessperson in Cameroon's capital, Yaounde. 'He is our president, and if there is something wrong with him, we have the right to know,' she said. 'So we are pleading with the government of Cameroon to let us know the health state [state of health] of our president.' Wirkom said she does not trust government officials' declarations that Biya is in good health. Wirkom said she will believe Biya is alive only when she sees him. On Cameroon State TV, government spokesperson Rene Emmanuel Sadi said he unequivocally affirms that the rumors of Biya’s death are pure imagination. Sadi said the day after the China-Africa summit, Biya stayed briefly in Europe, and that wherever he might be, Biya is attentive to the well-being of Cameroonians. Akongnwi Neba, a merchant, said it is wrong for the government to wait until a rumor spreads before explaining where Biya is. 'We are asking the government to prove to us where he [Biya] is,' said Neba. 'We need to know his whereabouts, whether he is alive or dead. It is our right as citizens of the country to know where our president is.' Cameroon officials have not said whether Biya will appear in public in Geneva. VOA could not independently confirm whether Biya was in the Swiss city. Biya is the oldest leader in the world. He has ruled Cameroon for more than four decades, and his supporters have been holding public rallies asking him to be a candidate in elections expected in October 2025. Biya has not said whether he will run for president again.	https://www.voanews.com/a/cameroon-citizens-want-proof-their-91-year-old-president-is-alive-/7815653.html	2024-10-08T20:06:27-07:00	
China stock market stalls for lack of further stimulus measures	TAIPEI, Taiwan — China's stock rally resumed Tuesday after the weeklong National Day holiday but lost some steam on mainland markets after a press conference by the country’s economic planning agency disappointed hopes for more fiscal stimulus measures. In Hong Kong, the day ended with chunky losses of nearly 10%. Early in the day, the Shanghai Composite Index rose more than 10%, the Shenzhen Component Index was up more than 12%, and the ChiNext Index rose 18%, continuing a rise that began late last month with the announcement of stimulus measures, ranging from rate cuts to looser curbs on house buying. The rally stalled, however, as the National Development and Reform Commission, at a press conference intended to further boost market confidence, failed to announce any specific stimulus measures. By day’s end, the Shanghai Composite Index rose 4.59%, the Shenzhen Component Index was up 9.17%, and the ChiNext Index rose 17.25% to mark its largest-ever, single-day increase. But in Hong Kong, the Hang Seng index traded low throughout the day, returning the gains registered before the National Day holiday and closing down 9.41%. Investors hoped the National Development and Reform Commission, China’s state economic planning body, would roll out more detailed stimulus measures at the Tuesday briefing. Chairman Zheng Shanjie told reporters that he had 'full confidence' the economy would reach its official full-year growth target of about 5%. He said China will introduce policies to specifically strengthen or stabilize five aspects in the early stage, including the economic downturn, insufficient domestic demand, the difficulties of some enterprises, the continued weakness of the property market and the capital markets. Chin-Yoong Wong, a professor of economics at Universiti Tunku Abdul Rahman in Malaysia, said the NDRC's target issues are 'very to the point but insufficient in implementation,' because the NDRC has not proposed precise and feasible countermeasures, and the scale of implementation is unclear. Wong said much of what has been promised by the NDRC includes spending plans that were already in place 'rather than additional fiscal stimulus for China's economic downturn.' He said the NDRC has talked a lot about boosting consumer confidence but has not issued any specific practical policies to achieve that, leaving shareholders to question whether the talk will be backed with action. Liu Meng-Chuh, director of the First Research Division at the Chung-Hua Institution for Economic Research in Taipei, said external factors are contributing to the volatility of China's stock markets. He told VOA, 'On the one hand, China's [favorable policies] are not so strong; [on the other hand], the U.S. economy is not so bad, so maybe much international hot money has begun to flow back [to the U.S.].' However, Liu believes that there is still room for development in green industries and infrastructure for an aging society. He said that China's urban population is about 60% to 70% of its entire population, which is lower than the average of about 80% in mature economies, meaning that the dividends of China's 'urbanization' have not yet been exhausted. But he stressed that the feasibility has to be well-assessed to avoid repeating mistakes made in the past. Tsai Ming-Fang, a professor of industrial economics at Tamkang University, said China's foreign relations are not improving, causing foreign trade issues that are difficult to solve, such as the new tariffs imposed by Canada and the European Union on Chinese electric vehicles. Tsai said the stimulus measures in the past two weeks are not designed to revive the economy but to beautify the data to achieve the economic growth target of 5% this year, which may allow some shareholders and even foreign investors to liquidate their positions and take profits. 'China's only goal now is to reach the economic growth rate of 5%,' Tsai said. 'Many problems arise from the drastic changes in Chinese laws [in recent years], which have led to a lack of confidence of manufacturers in China.' Adrianna Zhang contributed to this report.	https://www.voanews.com/a/china-stock-market-stalls-for-lack-of-further-stimulus-measures/7815706.html	2024-10-08T19:52:42-07:00

FBI arrests Afghan man officials say plotted Election Day attack in US	washington — The FBI has arrested an Afghan man who officials say was inspired by the Islamic State militant organization and was plotting an Election Day attack targeting large crowds in the United States, the Justice Department said Tuesday. Nasir Ahmad Tawhedi, 27, of Oklahoma City, Oklahoma, told investigators after his arrest Monday that he had planned his attack to coincide with Election Day next month and that he and a juvenile co-conspirator expected to die as martyrs, according to charging documents. Tawhedi, who entered the U.S. in 2021 on a special immigrant visa, had taken steps in recent weeks to advance his attack plans, including by ordering AK-47 rifles, liquidating his family's assets, and buying one-way tickets for his wife and child to travel home to Afghanistan. 'Terrorism is still the FBI's number one priority, and we will use every resource to protect the American people,' FBI Director Christopher Wray said in a statement. After he was arrested, the Justice Department said, Tawhedi told investigators he had planned an attack for Election Day that would target large gatherings of people. Tawhedi was charged with conspiring and attempting to provide material support to the Islamic State group, which is designated by the U.S. as a foreign terrorist organization. It was not immediately clear if he had a lawyer who could speak on his behalf.	https://www.voanews.com/a/fbi-arrests-afghan-man-officials-say-plotted-election-day-attack-in-us-/7815360.html	2024-10-08T16:49:00-07:00

Religious education surges under Taliban as secular schooling languishes	Washington — The number of madrassas, or religious schools, has increased fourfold under the Taliban in Afghanistan as experts worry that the rise could fuel extremism in the country and limit opportunities for younger Afghans, particularly girls. 'In the past year, at least 1 million children have been enrolled in madrassas for religious education,' said Karamatullah Akhundzada, the deputy minister of education, in a September news conference. The year’s new enrollments brought the total to 3.6 million students at more than about 21,000 madrassas registered in the country, This shift marks a change in the educational landscape in Afghanistan, where madrassas now outnumber the more than 18,000 public and private schools. Jennifer Brick Murtazashvili, founding director of the Center for Governance and Markets at the University of Pittsburgh, told VOA that the increase in the number of madrassas is part of the Taliban's effort to establish control. 'It's important to look at madrassas together with local governance. Under the republic [former Afghan government], there was no formal village governance, but the Taliban have replaced that with religious leaders who now hold local power,' Murtazashvili said. Before the Taliban seized power in 2021, there were about 5,000 madrassas registered across Afghanistan. After returning to power, the Taliban aimed to transform the education system. Officials at the Taliban Ministry of Education said they have taken steps to 'revise and reform' textbooks and curricula in the schools in the past three years. Before the Taliban, more than 9 million students were enrolled in all types of schools, with 39% of them girls. Following the Taliban's return to power, the group imposed a ban on girls' secondary education, making Afghanistan the only country in the world to restrict girls from attending secondary school. The Taliban ban on secondary education deprived about 1.5 million girls of going to school. Murtazashvili sees the ban on girls attending school beyond the sixth grade as a clear sign of extremism. 'By robbing girls of education, they are robbing the country of its future,' Murtazashvili said, adding that 'you're not going to have a future of women nurses and doctors. You're going to see mortality increase.' One young woman who spoke to VOA but did not want her name used was in 11th grade when the Taliban took power in 2021 and banned secondary education for girls. She said she enrolled in a madrassa in Herat City, hoping to continue her education, but was 'disappointed.' 'At first, I thought I could learn and reconnect with friends, but it felt more like brainwashing,' she said, adding that 'they kept telling us education wasn't for us. We should become good housewives and give birth to future Islamic leaders.' After three months, 'disheartened with the restrictive environment,' she quit the madrassa. Mohammad Moheq, former Afghan ambassador to Egypt and author of many books on Islam and Afghanistan, told VOA the Taliban push their strict interpretation of Islam through these madrassas. 'Their goal is to stop people from thinking for themselves and push their strict version of Islam that fits their political agenda,' Moheq said. Madrassas played an important role in the Taliban's rise to power in the late 1990s as many of the Taliban were graduates of madrassas in neighboring Pakistan. In April 2022, the Taliban announced their plan to open three to 10 new madrassas in every district in Afghanistan. 'Religious sciences should be further taught throughout Afghan society,' said Noorullah Mounir, the then-minister of education, as he urged Afghan teachers to instill an 'Islamic belief' in their students. Saba Hanif, a professor at the University of Education in Lahore, Pakistan, told VOA that there is a need for the international community to talk to the Taliban to find 'a middle ground' and blend religious and 'worldly' education. 'They should agree on certain terms and show the Taliban how purely religious education could harm the country's future, particularly in terms of job opportunities and economic growth,' Hanif said. She added that if children are exposed to 'only one way of thinking and one way of living life,' it will perpetuate extremism. 'This will be quite obvious. And it could be very dangerous for the region because, you know, of their past practices. They try to force it on others, and they also don't hesitate in using power to control others,' Hanif said.	https://www.voanews.com/a/religious-education-surges-under-taliban-as-secular-schooling-languishes/7815283.html	2024-10-08T15:49:05-07:00

Burkina Faso suspends VOA broadcasts	washington — Authorities in Burkina Faso on Monday suspended Voice of America for three months over comments made by one of the network's journalists. The junta also temporarily banned local news outlets from using any international media reports, the reports said. Burkina Faso's superior council for communication, also known as CSC, accused VOA of demoralizing troops in Burkina Faso and nearby Mali in a broadcast on September 19, according to media reports. The interview was later aired by a privately owned local radio station, according to Reuters. In the communique that banned local news outlets from using any international media reports, the CSC said it noted the 'dissemination of information of a malicious and biased nature' by national outlets using international media reports. In the communique, which did not specifically mention VOA, the CSC said such reports tend to 'insidiously apologize for terrorism.' The phone number listed online for the CSC was not working. VOA attempted to request comment via an online form on the CSC website, but it returned an error message. VOA and its parent organization, the U.S. Agency for Global Media, did not immediately reply to requests for comment. Burkina Faso's Foreign Ministry did not reply to VOA's email requesting comment for this story. Earlier suspension This would not be the first time VOA has been suspended in Burkina Faso. Authorities suspended VOA and the BBC in April following the broadcast of news stories about a Human Rights Watch report accusing the Burkinabe army of abuses against civilian populations. 'VOA stands by its reporting about Burkina Faso and intends to continue to fully and fairly cover events in that country,' VOA's then-acting director John Lippman said in a statement about the April suspension. Military leaders in Burkina Faso seized power in a coup in September 2022. Since then, media watchdogs have documented a decline in media freedoms, with media outlets suspended and foreign correspondents expelled. In 2021, Burkina Faso ranked 37 out of 180 countries on the World Press Freedom Index, where 1 shows the best media environment. This year, Burkina Faso ranked 86.	https://www.voanews.com/a/burkina-faso-suspends-voa-broadcasts-/7815277.html	2024-10-08T14:58:42-07:00	
US stresses desire for peaceful resolution of Taiwan disputes	WASHINGTON — A top U.S. official said the United States expects differences across the Taiwan Strait to be resolved peacefully and opposes any unilateral changes to the status quo as Taiwan prepares to celebrate the founding of the Republic of China on Thursday. The People's Republic of China, or PRC, celebrates its national day on October 1, marking the founding of the country in 1949. Taiwan chooses October 10, known as Double Ten Day, to celebrate the founding of the ROC in 1912, just months after an uprising that began on October 10, 1911. The PRC typically closely monitors speeches from Taiwan’s leaders during Double Ten Day celebrations. Since Taiwan’s democratically elected President Lai Ching-te took office in May, Beijing has increased military pressure on Taiwan, deeming Lai a 'separatist.' On Tuesday, Assistant Secretary of State for East Asian and Pacific Affairs Daniel Kritenbrink said that the U.S.'s 'fundamental interest is in the maintenance of peace and stability across the Taiwan Strait,' reiterating that Washington’s longstanding One China policy remains unchanged, 'guided by the Taiwan Relations Act, the three Joint Communiques and the Six Assurances.' 'We oppose unilateral changes to the status quo by either side. We do not support Taiwan independence, and we expect cross-strait differences to be resolved peacefully,' Kritenbrink told VOA during a briefing. Speaking at an event Saturday, Lai noted that the PRC celebrated its 75th anniversary on October 1, and in a few days, it would be the ROC’s 113th birthday. 'In terms of age, it is absolutely impossible for the People’s Republic of China to be considered the motherland of the people of the Republic of China. On the contrary, the ROC may be the motherland of the people of the PRC who are over 75 years old,' Lai told an audience in Taipei. PRC officials have remained largely muted on Lai’s remarks, but some analysts say that could be because Beijing is preparing to launch another round of military exercises after Lai delivers his Double Ten Day speech. U.S. officials have referred inquiries to 'President Lai’s office for any commentary on his specific comments.' European visit Meanwhile, former Taiwanese President Tsai Ing-wen will visit the Czech Republic this month, a visit seen as sensitive since Beijing has repeatedly denounced the democratic leader as a 'separatist.' In Beijing on Tuesday, a spokesperson from the PRC’s Ministry of Foreign Affairs was asked to comment on Tsai’s planned visit to Prague. 'We firmly oppose anyone who seeks 'Taiwan independence' visiting countries with diplomatic ties with China under any pretext. We urge the Czech Republic and relevant countries to earnestly abide by the One China principle and respect China’s sovereignty and territorial integrity,' Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesperson Mao Ning told reporters Tuesday. Taiwan has been self-ruled since 1949, when Mao Zedong's communists took power in Beijing after defeating Chiang Kai-shek's Kuomintang nationalists in a civil war, prompting the nationalists' relocation to the island. The U.S. does not maintain an official relationship with Taiwan but provides defense equipment to the self-ruled democracy under the Taiwan Relations Act. Treaty of Aigun In a TV interview in September, Lai remarked that if China's claims over Taiwan are genuinely rooted in concerns about territorial integrity, it should also seek to reclaim the land it ceded to Russia in the 19th century. He referenced the 1858 Treaty of Aigun, through which China, under the Qing dynasty, gave up a vast area of land — now part of Russia’s Far East — to the Russian Empire, establishing much of the modern border along the Amur River. The Treaty of Aigun, along with the 1860 Convention of Peking, saw China relinquish 600,000 square kilometers — an area almost the size of Ukraine — to the Russian Empire, enabling Russia to establish a naval base at Vladivostok. Many Chinese people still brood over this period of history, harboring lingering resentment over the fact that the land once belonged to China before being annexed by Russia. In 2023, China’s Ministry of Natural Resources mandated that new maps use Chinese names for Vladivostok — Haishenwai — as well as several other cities in the region.	https://www.voanews.com/a/us-stresses-desire-for-peaceful-resolution-of-taiwan-disputes/7815248.html	2024-10-08T14:26:30-07:00	
UN Rights Council says human rights in DR Congo on a downward spiral	GENEVA — Human rights experts warn the human rights situation in the Democratic Republic of Congo, already troubled for decades, is on a downward spiral again as armed clashes, attacks on schools and hospitals, sexual violence and other forms of abuse escalate. Kicking off a discussion of the DRC at the U.N. Human Rights Council in Geneva, U.N. High Commissioner for Human Rights Volker Türk urged the international community to pay more attention to the plight of Congolese civilians victimized by a 'volatile mix of escalating violence, regional and international interests, exploitative businesses and weak rule of law.' He said the number of victims of human rights violations is growing, with armed groups fighting in the eastern provinces responsible for most of these violations, including 'deadly attacks against civilians and civilian infrastructure, including schools and hospitals.' He said sexual violence is spreading despite efforts to prevent and investigate cases. 'The armed groups take people prisoners, subject women and girls to sexual slavery. Many of them have been killed after being raped. These cases, of course, have not all been reported. This is atrocious,' he said. 'Human rights violations committed by the defense and security forces during their military operations against armed groups, also remain of concern,' he said noting that hate speech and other incitement to discrimination and violence 'are fueling the conflict and increasing political tensions across the country.' Türk appealed to countries of influence to use their power to ensure the fighting stops, stating that 'any role played by Rwanda in supporting the M23 in North Kivu, and by any other country supporting armed groups active in the DRC, must end.' Responding to Türk's comments, DRC Minister of Human Rights Chantal Shambu Mwavita said her government has made great progress in protecting human rights, in spite of challenges posed by the war in the east. Alluding to Rwanda, she pointed her finger at so-called 'negative forces' supporting the armed groups from the outside. She 'called on the international community to condemn these actions strongly and to impose targeted sanctions on Rwanda for its destabilizing role.' Mwavita said the war in the eastern provinces is closely linked to the seizure and illegal exploitation of her country's natural resources by Rwanda and other countries. She also demanded the immediate and unconditional withdrawal of Rwandan troops from DRC territory. North Kivu and surrounding provinces of the eastern DRC have been wracked by violence for decades, as armed groups battle for control of the region's rich natural resources. Rwanda has denied supporting the M23 rebels, with Foreign Minister Olivier Nduhungirehe renewing that denial on Saturday. The minister, who was attending a two-day 'Francophonie' summit in Paris, accused his Congolese counterpart of refusing to sign 'an agreed deal' to resolve the M23 rebel conflict in the DRC. On Tuesday, Rwanda's ambassador to the U.N. in Geneva, James Ngango, also expressed concern about the escalation of abuse and human rights violations in the eastern DRC, 'particularly sexual violation and violation against children in the region affected by armed conflict and inter community conflicts,' he said. He said Rwanda remains committed to dialogue and the regional peace processes. He said, 'No military solution can address the root causes of the conflict in eastern DRC.' It is unclear whether the DRC's demand for the withdrawal of Rwandan forces will be met, nor is it clear if and when MONUSCO, the U.N.'s peacekeeping force, will withdraw from the country as demanded by the government of Felix Tshisekedi. The U.N. says the peacekeepers, who were supposed to leave by the end of the year, apparently have been given a reprieve. Several thousand soldiers remain in North and South Kivu and Ituri provinces. Bintou Keita, special representative of the secretary-general in the DRC and head of MONUSCO, made little reference to the potential consequences for the stability of the DRC once U.N. peacekeepers leave the country. However, she painted a worrying picture of human rights in the DRC due to 'the deteriorating security situation' in the eastern provinces from attacks on civilians, 'causing loss of human lives and mass displacements of peoples towards Kinshasa and Kisangani.' 'The M23, in the quest for territorial gains, extended its hold on territories towards Lubero Kanyabayonga, which was captured in late June after intense fighting. Hospitals and IDP sites were deliberately targeted by M23. Several civilians fled their homes, further exacerbating the humanitarian crisis,' she said. She affirmed that MONUSCO 'will continue to provide its support to the DRC … in strict conformity with the U.N. human rights due diligence policy, including support for the establishment of the human rights compliance framework.' Keita added, 'The return of peace to the DRC will come about through pooled military and non-military efforts to find lasting solutions, both national and regional.' Conflict in the DRC has come at a high price. The United Nations said the country is struggling with twin humanitarian crises — an internal displacement crisis and a food crisis. It reports that 7.2 million people currently are internally displaced, and nearly 26 million face acute hunger.	https://www.voanews.com/a/un-rights-council-says-human-rights-in-dr-congo-on-a-downward-spiral/7815258.html	2024-10-08T14:20:39-07:00	
US looks to resurrect more nuclear reactors, White House adviser says	NEW YORK — The Biden administration is working on plans to bring additional decommissioned nuclear power reactors back online to help meet soaring demand for emissions-free electricity, White House climate adviser Ali Zaidi said Monday. Two such projects are already under way, including the planned recommissioning of Holtec's Palisades nuclear plant in Michigan and the potential restart of a unit at Constellation Energy's Three Mile Island plant in Pennsylvania, near the site of the worst nuclear accident in U.S. history. Asked if additional shuttered plants could be restarted, Zaidi said, 'We're working on it in a very concrete way. There are two that I can think of.' He declined to identify the power plants or provide further details about the effort. Speaking at the Reuters IMPACT conference in New York, Zaidi said repowering existing dormant nuclear plants was part of a three-pronged strategy of President Joe Biden's administration to bring more nuclear power online to fight climate change and boost production. The other two prongs include development of small modular reactors (SMRs) for certain applications, and continuing development of next generation, advanced nuclear reactors. Biden has called for a tripling of U.S. nuclear power capacity to fuel energy demand that is accelerating in part due to expansion of power-hungry technologies like artificial intelligence and cloud computing. Last week, the Biden administration said it closed a $1.52 billion loan to resurrect the Palisades nuclear plant in Michigan, which would take two years to reopen. Constellation and Microsoft, meanwhile, signed a power deal last month to help resurrect a unit of the Pennsylvania plant, which Constellation hopes will also receive government support. Zaidi told the conference that the U.S. Navy on Monday had requested information to build SMRs on a six bases. 'SMR is a technology that is not a decades-away play. It's one that companies in the United States are looking to deploy in this decade,' he said. Zaidi also addressed the woes that have beset a separate Biden clean energy goal, to bring 30 gigawatts of offshore wind capacity online by the end of the decade. The administration shelved offshore wind lease sales this year in both Oregon and the Gulf of Mexico due to low demand from companies, as high costs, equipment issues and supply chain challenges hit other projects. Zaidi said at least half of the 30GW goal is already under construction and that some of the early snags provide helpful learning for future projects. 'I am pretty optimistic about the next wave of projects where we will have a domestic supply chain and hopefully better cost to capital relative to what projects are facing right now,' he said.	https://www.voanews.com/a/us-looks-to-resurrect-more-nuclear-reactors-white-house-adviser-says-/7815232.html	2024-10-08T13:54:32-07:00

Kenya's parliament overwhelmingly votes to impeach deputy president	NAIROBI, Kenya — Kenya's lawmakers approved a motion Tuesday to impeach the country's deputy president, following daylong discussions and after Rigathi Gachagua appeared in parliament to defend himself against several charges, including allegations that he supported anti-government protests in June. The motion was approved by a 281-44 vote in favor of impeachment, well above the 117 votes constitutionally required. The motion now goes to the parliament's upper house, which will debate the matter and also hold a vote. For impeachment to be final, it will need the additional backing of two-thirds of senators in the upper house. It's not clear when that vote will take place. Under Kenya's constitution, the removal from office is automatic if approved by both chambers, though Gachagua can challenge the action in court — something he has said he would do. The deputy president is also accused of being involved in corruption and other irregularities. He denies all the charges against him. The debate surrounding his fate has extended beyond parliament — supporters and opponents of the motion clashed last week in public forums after the ruling alliance brought the motion before parliament. In his speech, Gachagua declared that he was 'undergoing a political process' and asked legislators to make their decision 'without intimidation and coercion.' On Monday, the deputy president had said he believed the motion had the president's blessings. President William Ruto has yet to publicly comment about the impeachment but is on record in the earlier days of his presidency saying he would not publicly humiliate his deputy, alluding to the troubled relationship he had with his predecessor, Uhuru Kenyatta, during their second term in office. On Sunday during a prayer meeting at his residence, Gachagua implored Ruto, legislators and Kenyans to forgive him for any wrongdoing during his tenure. He clarified that statement on Monday, saying it was not an admission of guilt and dismissed rumors that he would resign. Gachagua told lawmakers Tuesday that some of the properties listed in the impeachment motion as his belonged to his late brother. He also defended renovation expenditures for his official residence, saying it was in a state of disrepair and needed to be 'dignified.'	https://www.voanews.com/a/kenya-s-parliament-overwhelmingly-votes-to-impeach-deputy-president-/7815216.html	2024-10-08T13:49:23-07:00	
Officials: Voting to go ahead in Mozambique's volatile Cabo Delgado	Maputo. Mozambique — Election officials in Mozambique say voting will take place Wednesday in volatile Cabo Delgado province, despite threats from Islamic State militants who are active in the region. Regina Matsinhe, the spokesperson for Mozambique’s Technical Secretariat for Electoral Administration, or STAE, told VOA that plans have been made to ensure voting goes well in Cabo Delgado. She said authorities are working with Cabo Delgado officials to ensure the safety of election workers, who are using several transportation options to make sure voting materials reach their intended destinations. Matsinhe said aerial means, sea boats, cattle-drawn carts, motorbikes and people will be used to carry materials from one point to another. Cabo Delgado province has 1.4 million registered voters, nearly one-tenth of Mozambique’s 17 million voters. Those voters head to the polls Wednesday to elect the next president, parliament and provincial assemblies. Last Friday, President Phillip Nyusi said tensions in Cabo Delgado province have eased in recent weeks after security forces carried out operations against insurgents, which included destroying camps and capturing propaganda equipment. There were security concerns after the 16-member Southern African Development Community Mission in Mozambique (SAMIM) withdrew its 3,000-person force from Cabo Delgado in July, marking the end of its peacekeeping mission in the country. However, Tanzanian troops remained and are fighting alongside Rwandan soldiers and Mozambican defense and security forces to contain the violence in Cabo Delgado. This will be Mozambique’s seventh general election since a multiparty democracy was introduced in 1994, two years after the ruling Frelimo party signed a peace deal with Renamo rebels in Rome to end a 16-year civil war that killed approximately one million people. Renamo has not won a national election since then, and Frelimo has ruled Mozambique since 1975, when the country won independence from Portugal. The chairman of Mozambique’s National Election Commission, Carlos Matsinhe, told VOA in an exclusive interview that he is optimistic the election will proceed as planned throughout Cabo Delgado. There are no signs that violence will prevent elections in any areas, Matsinhe said, 'so we are just praying that the election takes place complete in Cabo Delgado, [and] the conditions are very promising.' The election will be observed by several international organizations such as the European Union — which has sent a team of 150 — and a 52-member team from the Southern African Development Community that arrived in Maputo last Friday. Counting will begin immediately after polling stations close Wednesday evening.	https://www.voanews.com/a/officials-voting-to-proceed-in-mozambique-s-volatile-cabo-delgado/7815191.html	2024-10-08T13:28:47-07:00	
Cholera cases, deaths surge more than 200% in Nigeria	Abuja, Nigeria — Cholera is surging in Nigeria, health officials said this week, with the number of cases and deaths increasing by more than 200% this year. The Nigerian Center for Disease Control said in this week's epidemiological report that the country has recorded nearly 11,000 cases of cholera this year — a 220% increase compared with the same point in 2023. The report said fatalities over the same periods have increased from 106 to 359 — a rise of 239%. The state of Lagos accounted for 43% of the nation's cases, while Kano, Katsina, Jigawa and Borno also recorded significant numbers. Last month, the worst flooding in 30 years ravaged conflict-ridden Borno state, worsening an already dire humanitarian situation there. Hundreds of thousands of people were displaced and moved to overcrowded camps. 'We're now facing a significant public health challenge that demands urgent attention and action,' Borno Health Commissioner Baba Mallam Gana said. 'This outbreak is concerning, especially in the aftermath of a flooding incident. 'The floods have created ideal conditions for the spread of waterborne diseases like cholera by contaminating water sources and disrupting sanitation systems,' he said. Cholera is a bacterial disease, usually spread by contaminated food or water. It causes severe diarrhea and dehydration. The Nigerian CDC launched a national emergency response along with state authorities to bring numbers down, but the number of cases is surging, Gana said. 'We must now act swiftly to prevent further spread of this disease,' he said. As part of the flood intervention responses, Gana said, the Borno public health emergency center was converted into a control center to coordinate surveillance, risk communication and community engagement, as well as essential health services, infection prevention, water sanitation and hygiene. Nigeria's Health Ministry is sending hundreds of thousands of doses of cholera vaccine to the affected areas. Borno alone received 300,000 doses, and state authorities say the vaccine has been distributed to camps for those displaced by the floods.	https://www.voanews.com/a/cholera-cases-deaths-surge-more-than-200-in-nigeria/7815158.html	2024-10-08T13:28:31-07:00	
Jailed Chinese businessman’s daughter asks Xi Jinping to release her father	Washington — The daughter of imprisoned Chinese real estate tycoon Ren Zhiqiang has issued a public appeal to China’s leader, Xi Jinping, asking him to allow her father to seek medical care he needs after his health reportedly deteriorated during his time in jail. Ren, 73, is a former member of the Chinese Communist Party and chairman of the state-owned Huayuan real estate group. He was jailed after publishing an essay online in March 2020 that criticized the government’s handling of the COVID-19 pandemic. In an open letter posted on the social media platform WeChat on October 2, Ren Xinyi appealed to the president’s 'humanitarian principles,' requesting that Xi release her father so that he may access treatment for his failing health and spend the last part of his life with his family. Ren Xinyi described her father as a dangerously ill, old man at risk of dying in jail. She wrote that he had long been suffering from a prostate ailment and was prescribed surgical treatment before his imprisonment. Despite previous requests that her father be allowed to undergo surgery, Ren has not yet been permitted the care his family seeks. 'I am willing to promise that my father will never make any public remarks or content after he goes abroad for treatment. He is over 70 years old and seriously ill. He has no ability to cause trouble to you and the country,' Ren Xinyi told Xi in the letter. Before his incarceration and in his prime, the former businessman was nicknamed 'Cannon Ren,' a name he gained for how frequently, and publicly, he called party policy into question. But for his release, Ren’s daughter writes that her father won’t go back to his old ways. In a translated version of the essay that prompted his arrest, Ren wrote: 'The reality shown by this epidemic is that the party defends its own interests, the government officials defend their own interests, and the monarch only defends the status and interests of the core.' The businessman also called for freedom of speech so that citizens could better protect themselves through open discourse. In a secretive trial, Ren was sentenced to 18 years in jail on counts of corruption, bribery and embezzlement of public funds. He was also fined about $600,000. His daughter’s letter was initially published to a WeChat group that included friends of Ren. One of the group’s members, political commentator and U.S. resident Cai Shenkun, confirmed to VOA that pictures released of the letter were genuine. 'In the past few years, some friends and people from all walks of life have tried to help Ren, because after all, Ren was a bold and outspoken person in the past,' said Cai. Anna Wang, founder of Photon Media and a former business owner in China, also confirmed the authenticity of the letter with several friends in Beijing familiar with Ren Zhiqiang. 'This letter is very powerful, and it’s also a call to action,' Wang said. 'I think this daughter is also very brave.' 'In China, if you want to live a life of despicable behavior, you can live well,' she continued. 'But if you want to engage in any activities that promote national progress and democracy, it will come at a painful and huge price.' In a final plea for Xi’s kindness, the letter concluded, 'President Xi Jinping, we have previously raised the above request several times through normal channels but have never received a good response. We have no choice but to use this method to reflect our desperate request to you.' The Chinese government has not publicly commented on the open petition from Ren's daughter. When asked by VOA to comment on the letter, a spokesperson for the Chinese embassy in Washington D.C. said: 'the Chinese government protects the lawful rights of every citizen in accordance with the law.'

France's minority government survives no-confidence vote, 2 weeks after taking office	PARIS — France's minority government survived a no-confidence vote on Tuesday, two weeks after taking office, getting over the first hurdle placed by left-wing lawmakers to bring down new conservative Prime Minister Michel Barnier. The vote was a key test for Barnier, whose Cabinet is forced to rely on the far right's good will to be able to stay in power. The no-confidence motion was brought by a left-wing coalition, the New Popular Front. It received 197 votes, far from the 289 votes needed to pass. The far-right National Rally group, which counts 125 lawmakers, abstained from voting. Following June-July parliamentary elections, the National Assembly, France's powerful lower house of parliament, is divided into three major blocs: the New Popular Front, French President Emmanuel Macron's centrist allies and the far-right National Rally party. None of them won an outright majority. The no-confidence motion was brought by 192 lawmakers of the New Popular Front, composed of the hard-left France Unbowed, Socialists, Greens and Communists. Barnier's cabinet is mostly composed of members of his Republicans party and centrists from Macron's alliance who altogether count just over 200 lawmakers. Left-wing lawmakers denounced the choice of Barnier as prime minister as they were not given a chance to form a minority government, despite securing the most seats at the National Assembly. This government 'is a denial of the result of the most recent legislative elections,' the motion read.	https://www.voanews.com/a/france-s-minority-government-survives-no-confidence-vote-2-weeks-after-taking-office-/7815033.html	2024-10-08T11:19:03-07:00	
New book says Trump secretly sent COVID tests to Putin	Washington — Then-president Donald Trump secretly sent COVID test kits to Vladimir Putin despite a U.S. shortage during the pandemic, and spoke multiple times with the Russian leader after leaving office, says an explosive new book by Bob Woodward. The upcoming opus, War, also chronicles some of President Joe Biden's own acknowledged missteps and his struggle to prevent escalation of conflict in the Middle East, including exasperation with Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu over futile efforts to get Israel and Hamas to reach a cease-fire. In excerpts published Tuesday by The Washington Post, where he is an associate editor, Woodward lays out damning details and actions by Trump, who the writer says has retained a personal relationship with Putin even as Trump campaigns for another presidential term and the Russian president conducts a war against Ukraine, a U.S. ally. With the coronavirus ravaging the world in 2020, Trump sent a batch of test kits to his counterpart in Moscow. Putin accepted the supplies but sought to avoid political fallout for Trump, urging that he not reveal the dispatch of medical equipment, this book says. According to Woodward, Putin told Trump: 'I don't want you to tell anybody because people will get mad at you, not me.' Woodward also cites an unnamed Trump aide in the book who indicated the Republican flag bearer may have spoken to Putin up to seven times since leaving the White House in 2021. The Post, reporting Woodward's account, said that at one point in early 2024, Trump ordered an aide out of his office in his Mar-a-Lago residence in Florida so he could hold a private call with Putin. War is set for publication on Oct. 15, just three weeks before a critical U.S. election in which Trump is locked in a tight race against Vice President Kamala Harris, the Democratic nominee. While Harris does make appearances in the book, she is seen in a supporting role to Biden 'and hardly determining foreign policy herself,' the Post reported. Woodward has chronicled American presidencies for 50 years, and this is his fourth book since Trump's upset victory in 2016. He began his presidential reportages with Richard Nixon, who was undone by the 1970s Watergate scandal exposed by Woodward and Post colleague Carl Bernstein. Woodward concluded that Trump's interactions, detailed in the book, with an authoritarian president at war with a U.S. ally make him more unfit to be president than Nixon. 'Trump was the most reckless and impulsive president in American history and is demonstrating the very same character as a presidential candidate in 2024,' Woodward wrote. The Trump campaign blasted the book as 'trash' and 'made up stories.' They are 'the work of a truly demented and deranged man who suffers from a debilitating case of Trump Derangement Syndrome,' campaign communications director Steven Cheung told AFP. According to CNN, which obtained a pre-release book copy, Woodward repeatedly quotes Biden dropping F bombs as he discusses his personal and political challenges. Biden called Putin 'the epitome of evil,' blasted Netanyahu as a 'liar' and said he 'should never have picked' Merrick Garland as U.S. attorney general. According to the book, during an April phone call Biden turned testy with Netanyahu. 'What's your strategy, man?' Biden asked the Israeli leader, according to Woodward. 'We have to go into Rafah,' Netanyahu said, referring to a city in southern Gaza. 'Bibi, you've got no strategy,' Biden responded.	https://www.voanews.com/a/new-book-says-trump-secretly-sent-covid-tests-to-putin/7814888.html	2024-10-08T09:53:10-07:00	
Hungary’s Sovereignty Protection law a threat to independent media, analysts say	The European Commission has filed a lawsuit over Hungary’s Sovereignty Protection legislation, saying it violates EU law.

US states sue TikTok, saying it harms young users	NEW YORK/WASHINGTON — TikTok faces new lawsuits filed by 13 U.S. states and the District of Columbia on Tuesday, accusing the popular social media platform of harming and failing to protect young people. The lawsuits, filed separately in New York, California, the District of Columbia and 11 other states, expand Chinese-owned TikTok's legal fight with U.S. regulators and seek new financial penalties against the company. Washington is located in the District of Columbia. The states accuse TikTok of using intentionally addictive software designed to keep children watching as long and often as possible and misrepresenting its content moderation effectiveness. 'TikTok cultivates social media addiction to boost corporate profits,' California Attorney General Rob Bonta said in a statement. 'TikTok intentionally targets children because they know kids do not yet have the defenses or capacity to create healthy boundaries around addictive content.' TikTok seeks to maximize the amount of time users spend on the app in order to target them with ads, the states said. 'Young people are struggling with their mental health because of addictive social media platforms like TikTok,' said New York Attorney General Letitia James. TikTok said on Tuesday that it strongly disagreed with the claims, 'many of which we believe to be inaccurate and misleading,' and that it was disappointed the states chose to sue 'rather than work with us on constructive solutions to industrywide challenges.' TikTok provides safety features that include default screentime limits and privacy defaults for minors under 16, the company said. Washington, D.C., Attorney General Brian Schwalb alleged that TikTok operates an unlicensed money transmission business through its livestreaming and virtual currency features. 'TikTok's platform is dangerous by design. It's an intentionally addictive product that is designed to get young people addicted to their screens,' Schwalb said in an interview. Washington's lawsuit accused TikTok of facilitating sexual exploitation of underage users, saying TikTok's livestreaming and virtual currency 'operate like a virtual strip club with no age restrictions.' Illinois, Kentucky, Louisiana, Massachusetts, Mississippi, New Jersey, North Carolina, Oregon, South Carolina, Vermont and Washington state also sued on Tuesday. In March 2022, eight states, including California and Massachusetts, said they launched a nationwide probe of TikTok impacts on young people. The U.S. Justice Department sued TikTok in August for allegedly failing to protect children's privacy on the app. Other states, including Utah and Texas, previously sued TikTok for failing to protect children from harm. TikTok on Monday rejected the allegations in a court filing. TikTok's Chinese parent company, ByteDance, is battling a U.S. law that could ban the app in the United States.	https://www.voanews.com/a/us-states-sue-tiktok-saying-it-harms-young-users/7814857.html	2024-10-08T09:29:16-07:00	
US slaps sanctions on Sudan paramilitary leader	Washington — The United States on Tuesday announced sanctions against a senior leader in war-torn Sudan's Rapid Support Forces (RSF) for his role in obtaining weapons for the paramilitary organization. Tens of thousands of people have died and millions have been displaced since war broke out in April 2023 between Sudan's army and the RSF after their head generals refused a plan to integrate. Algoney Hamdan Daglo Musa was sanctioned 'for his involvement in RSF efforts to procure weapons and other military materiel that have enabled the RSF's ongoing operations in Sudan,' State Department spokesman Matthew Miller said in a statement. His actions have fueled war in Sudan 'and brutal RSF atrocities against civilians, which have included war crimes, crimes against humanity, and ethnic cleansing,' Miller said. The U.S. Treasury said that as a result of such sanctions 'all property and interests in property of the designated persons... that are in the United States or in the possession or control of US persons are blocked and must be reported.' The United States has led diplomatic efforts to stop the fighting in Sudan but has seen limited success and leverage, with RSF commanders unlikely to hold major assets in the West that would be affected by sanctions.	https://www.voanews.com/a/us-slaps-sanctions-on-sudan-paramilitary-leader/7814825.html	2024-10-08T09:13:10-07:00	
Biden postpones trip to Germany and Angola because of Hurricane Milton	Washington — President Joe Biden is postponing a planned trip to Germany and Angola to remain at the White House to monitor Hurricane Milton, which is bearing down on Florida's Gulf Coast, the White House announced on Tuesday. Press secretary Karine Jean-Pierre said the change was necessary 'given the projected trajectory and strength' of the storm. It was not clear when the trip might be rescheduled. Biden had promised to go to Africa during his term in office, which ends in January. Hurricane Milton weakened slightly Tuesday but remained a ferocious storm that could land a once-in-a-century direct hit on the populous Tampa Bay region with towering storm surges and turn debris from Helene's devastation 12 days ago into projectiles. Most of Florida's west coast was under a hurricane or tropical storm warning as the storm and its 145 mph (230 kph) winds spun just off Mexico's Yucatan peninsula, creeping toward the state. With the storm expected to remain fairly strong as it crosses Florida, parts of the eastern coast were put under hurricane warnings early Tuesday. Milton's center could come ashore Wednesday night in the Tampa Bay area, which has a population of more than 3.3 million people.	https://www.voanews.com/a/biden-postpones-trip-to-germany-and-angola-because-of-hurricane-milton-/7814785.html	2024-10-08T09:07:54-07:00

Eswatini groups call for 'hit list' of game rangers accused of shooting poaching suspects with impunity	Mbabane, Eswatini — The main opposition party in Eswatini is compiling a 'hit list' of game rangers in response to what it says are state-sanctioned murders of suspected poachers. Communities have been urged to assist in identifying rangers involved in the killings. As tensions mount over poaching-related deaths in Eswatini, the fear of violence looms large. Although there is no definitive count of suspected poachers killed in Eswatini's game parks, the Ministry of Tourism and Environmental Affairs estimates that dozens are slain each year. However, Eswatini's opposition parties allege hundreds of families have been impacted by these deaths and have called for a compilation of a game ranger 'hit list.' Velephi Mamba, treasurer general of main opposition party PUDEMO, one of the groups calling for possible violence against the rangers, said the news of the list of game rangers that was announced a week ago still stands. In fact, he said, it’s an ongoing issue. Mamba said his party request that all Swazis compile a list of the names of game rangers that are killing our people. Amid the growing controversy, legislators and human rights activists in Eswatini recently demanded an urgent review of the Game Act of 1991. They say the law allows game rangers in the southern African kingdom to shoot suspected poachers in national parks with little or no consequence. Human rights lawyer Sibusiso Nhlabatsi is among those calling for revision of the law. He said game rangers need to make greater efforts to arrest suspected poachers and bring them to court, rather than killing or torturing them. 'The game rangers themselves should understand that they should prioritize the use of non-lethal methods for the apprehension when dealing with suspected poachers,' Nhlabatsi said. 'The use of excessive force, in my view, does not only violate human rights but also undermines the credibility of the conservation efforts.' Mandla Motsa, a game ranger in Eswatini, defended his colleagues’ actions, saying there is an urgent need to protect endangered species in the parks from extinction, and that rangers face a formidable threat from well-armed poachers. There have been multiple reported incidents of rangers and poachers exchanging gunfire. 'We are getting a lot of pressure from poachers who are always armed and attacking the rangers on duty, while we have got organizations who feel like the poachers should be allowed to do whatever they are doing, which is against the work the rangers are doing,' Motsa said. Meanwhile, Eswatini government spokesperson Alpheous Nxumalo condemned the calls for a 'hit list' and urged citizens to shun requests to provide names. He emphasized the importance of following due process and the rule of law for achieving justice. 'Nobody should heed to such calls because they are going to lead into an escalation of violence in our communities around the country, and we know that that is the kind of atmosphere they want to create around the kingdom of Eswatini,' Nxumalo said. Legislators have begun discussing reforms to the Game Act of 1991 but so far there have been no amendments proposed, and no votes scheduled as of yet.	https://www.voanews.com/a/eswatini-groups-call-for-hit-list-of-game-rangers-accused-of-shooting-poaching-suspects-with-impunity/7814647.html	2024-10-08T07:47:19-07:00	
Biggest Kashmir party opposed to India's stripping of region's autonomy wins most seats in election	SRINAGAR, India — Kashmir's biggest political party opposed to India's stripping of the region's semi-autonomy won the most seats in a local election, official data showed Tuesday, in a vote seen as a referendum against the move by Prime Minister Narendra Modi's government. National Conference, or NC, won 42 seats, mainly from the Kashmir Valley, the heartland of the anti-India rebellion, according to the data. Modi's Bharatiya Janata Party secured 29 seats, all from the Hindu-dominated areas of Jammu. India's main opposition Congress party, which fought the election in alliance with the NC, succeeded in six constituencies. 'People have supported us more than our expectations. Now our efforts will be to prove that we are worth these votes,' Omar Abdullah, the NC leader and the region's former chief minister, told reporters in the main city of Srinagar. His father and president of the party, Farooq Abdullah, said that the mandate was to run the region without 'police raj [rule]' and try freeing people from jails. 'Media will be free,' he said. 'People have given their mandate, they have proven that they don't accept the decision that was taken on August 5,' he added referring to India's move in August 2019. The vote will allow Kashmir to have its own truncated government and a regional legislature, called an assembly, rather than being directly under New Delhi's rule. However, there will be a limited transition of power from New Delhi to the assembly as Kashmir will remain a 'union territory' — directly controlled by the federal government — with India's Parliament as its main legislator. Kashmir's statehood must be restored for the new government to have powers similar to other states of India. Hundreds of the NC workers gathered outside counting centers and at the homes of the winning candidates to celebrate the party's victory. It was the first such vote in a decade and the first since Modi's Hindu nationalist government scrapped the Muslim-majority region's long-held semi-autonomy in 2019. The unprecedented move downgraded and divided the former state into two centrally governed union territories, Ladakh and Jammu-Kashmir. Both are ruled directly by New Delhi through its appointed administrators along with unelected bureaucrats and security setup. The move — which largely resonated in India and among Modi supporters — was mostly opposed in Kashmir as an assault on its identity and autonomy amid fears that it would pave the way for demographic changes in the region. The region has since been on edge with civil liberties curbed and media gagged. India and Pakistan each administer a part of Kashmir, but both claim the territory in its entirety. The nuclear-armed rivals have fought two of their three wars over the territory since they gained independence from British colonial rule in 1947. Authorities tallied votes as thousands of additional police and paramilitary soldiers patrolled roads and guarded 28 counting centers. Nearly 8.9 million people were eligible to vote in the election, which began on Sept. 18 and concluded on Oct. 1. The overall turnout was 64% across the three phases, according to official data. In the region's legislature, five seats are appointed and 90 elected, so a party or coalition would need at least 48 of the 95 total seats to form a government. The alliance of the National Conference and the Congress have 48 seats combined. Authorities have said the election will bring democracy to the region after decades of strife, but many locals viewed the vote as an opportunity not only to elect their own representatives but also to register their protest against the 2019 changes. Except for the BJP, most parties who contested the election campaigned on promises to reverse the 2019 changes and address key issues like rising unemployment and inflation. The Congress party favored restoring the region's statehood. The BJP has also stated that it will restore statehood, but has not told when it would do. The BJP has vowed to block any move aimed at undoing most of the 2019 changes but promised to help in the region's economic development. Meanwhile, Modi's BJP appears to be heading for a victory in the northern state of Haryana, bordering New Delhi, which it has ruled for 10 years, leading in 50 constituencies and the Congress in 35 out of 90. The BJP has so far won 18 seats and is leading in 32 constituencies while the Congress has won 15 seats and is leading in 20, according to the Election Commission of India. A victory would give the BJP a record third five-year term in the state. The voting trend in Haryana state is a surprise since most exit polls had predicted an easy victory for the Congress party. Kashmir's last assembly election was held in 2014, after which the BJP for the first time ruled in a coalition with the local Peoples Democratic Party. But the government collapsed in 2018 after the BJP withdrew from the coalition. Polls in the past have been marked with violence, boycotts and vote-rigging, even though India called them a victory over separatism. Militants in the Indian-controlled portion of Kashmir have been fighting New Delhi's rule since 1989. Many Muslim Kashmiris support the rebels' goal of uniting the territory, either under Pakistani rule or as an independent country. India insists the Kashmir militancy is Pakistan-sponsored terrorism. Pakistan denies the charge, and many Kashmiris consider it a legitimate freedom struggle. Tens of thousands of civilians, rebels and government forces have been killed in the conflict.	https://www.voanews.com/a/biggest-kashmir-party-opposed-to-india-s-stripping-of-region-s-autonomy-wins-most-seats-in-election-/7814622.html	2024-10-08T07:24:11-07:00	
Blinken heads to Laos for ASEAN and East Asia Summit	State Department — U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken is set to visit Vientiane, Laos, later this week for meetings with the Association of Southeast Asian Nations, or ASEAN, where he is expected to engage directly with newly elected leaders from the Indo-Pacific. Blinken will represent President Joe Biden at this year’s ASEAN-U.S. Summit and participate in the East Asia Summit, where leaders and senior officials from India, Japan, South Korea, and the People’s Republic of China are also expected to attend. This week's ASEAN summits will feature the debut of Paetongtarn Shinawatra, 38, who became Thailand’s prime minister in mid-August. She will make her first bilateral visit to Laos on Tuesday and will be the youngest Southeast Asian leader at the summit. Singapore has also seen a generational shift with Lawrence Wong succeeding longtime Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong in May. Japan's new Prime Minister Shigeru Ishiba took office on October 1. He has pledged to strengthen his country’s alliance with the U.S. during a call with President Biden last Wednesday. 'I am grateful for the prime minister’s commitment to the U.S.-Japan Alliance and look forward to working with his government to reinforce the enduring partnership between our two nations,' Blinken said in a statement last week. Ishiba is also in discussions with South Korean President Yoon Suk Yeol about holding a meeting on the sidelines of the ASEAN summit. Regional security, development and trade — including the creation of resilient semiconductor supply chains — are expected to be top priorities on the U.S. agenda. In 2023, total two-way merchandise trade between the United States and ASEAN reached $395.9 billion, making the U.S. the second-largest trading partner after China. Additionally, the U.S. is ASEAN’s largest source of foreign direct investment, which amounted to $74.3 billion last year. Susannah Patton, director of the Southeast Asia Program at the Sydney-based think tank Lowy Institute, said that this year’s East Asia Summit must address contentious global issues such as the conflict in the Middle East and Russia’s invasion of Ukraine. The East Asia Summit comprises ASEAN’s 10 member countries and eight major dialogue partners, including the United States, China typically represented by Premier Li Qiang, and Russia represented by Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov. In a recent analysis published by the Lowy Institute, Patton noted that it is likely that the 'ASEAN show will come to Laos and then roll on again,' adding that 'concrete progress on pressing issues will be sorely lacking.' 'While the EAS is still likely to issue at least one jointly negotiated statement in 2024,' Patton wrote, 'it is a reflection of global political polarization that ASEAN’s dialogue partners are no longer able to propose their own dueling statements to advance their preferred language on international issues.'	https://www.voanews.com/a/blinken-heads-to-laos-for-asean-and-east-asia-summit/7814614.html	2024-10-08T07:04:40-07:00	
Pioneers in artificial intelligence win the Nobel Prize in physics	STOCKHOLM — Two pioneers of artificial intelligence — John Hopfield and Geoffrey Hinton — won the Nobel Prize in physics Tuesday for helping create the building blocks of machine learning that is revolutionizing the way we work and live but also creates new threats to humanity, one of the winners said. Hinton, who is known as the 'godfather of artificial intelligence,' is a citizen of Canada and Britain who works at the University of Toronto. Hopfield is an American working at Princeton. 'This year's two Nobel Laureates in physics have used tools from physics to develop methods that are the foundation of today's powerful machine learning,' the Nobel committee said in a press release. Ellen Moons, a member of the Nobel committee at the Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences, said the two laureates 'used fundamental concepts from statistical physics to design artificial neural networks that function as associative memories and find patterns in large data sets.' She said that such networks have been used to advance research in physics and 'have also become part of our daily lives, for instance in facial recognition and language translation.' Hinton predicted that AI will end up having a 'huge influence' on civilization, bringing improvements in productivity and health care. 'It would be comparable with the Industrial Revolution,' he said in the open call with reporters and the officials from the Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences. 'Instead of exceeding people in physical strength, it's going to exceed people in intellectual ability. We have no experience of what it's like to have things smarter than us. And it's going to be wonderful in many respects,' Hinton said. 'But we also have to worry about a number of possible bad consequences, particularly the threat of these things getting out of control.' The Nobel committee that honored the science behind machine learning and AI also mentioned fears about its possible flipside. Moon said that while it has 'enormous benefits, its rapid development has also raised concerns about our future. Collectively, humans carry the responsibility for using this new technology in a safe and ethical way for the greatest benefit of humankind.' Hinton shares those concerns. He quit a role at Google so he could more freely speak about the dangers of the technology he helped create. On Tuesday, he said he was shocked at the honor. 'I'm flabbergasted. I had, no idea this would happen,' he said when reached by the Nobel committee on the phone. There was no immediate reaction from Hopfield. Hinton, now 76, in the 1980s helped develop a technique known as backpropagation that has been instrumental in training machines how to 'learn.' His team at the University of Toronto later wowed peers by using a neural network to win the prestigious ImageNet computer vision competition in 2012. That win spawned a flurry of copycats, giving birth to the rise of modern AI. Hopfield, 91, created an associative memory that can store and reconstruct images and other types of patterns in data, the Nobel committee said. Hinton used Hopfield's network as the foundation for a new network that uses a different method, known as the Boltzmann machine, that the committee said can learn to recognize characteristic elements in a given type of data. Six days of Nobel announcements opened Monday with Americans Victor Ambros and Gary Ruvkun winning the medicine prize for their discovery of tiny bits of genetic material that serve as on and off switches inside cells that help control what the cells do and when they do it. If scientists can better understand how they work and how to manipulate them, it could one day lead to powerful treatments for diseases like cancer. The physics prize carries a cash award of 11 million Swedish kronor ($1 million) from a bequest left by the award's creator, Swedish inventor Alfred Nobel. The laureates are invited to receive their awards at ceremonies on Dec. 10, the anniversary of Nobel's death. Nobel announcements continue with the chemistry physics prize on Wednesday and literature on Thursday. The Nobel Peace Prize will be announced Friday and the economics award on Oct. 14.	https://www.voanews.com/a/pioneers-in-artificial-intelligence-win-the-nobel-prize-in-physics-/7814611.html	2024-10-08T06:45:07-07:00	
China targets brandy in EU trade tit-for-tat after EV tariff move	Beijing/Paris — China imposed temporary anti-dumping measures on imports of brandy from the EU on Tuesday, hitting French brands including Hennessy and Remy Martin, days after the 27-state bloc voted for tariffs on Chinese-made electric vehicles, or EVs. China's commerce ministry said preliminary findings of an investigation had determined that dumping of brandy from the European Union threatens 'substantial damage' to its own sector. France's trade ministry said the temporary Chinese measures were 'incomprehensible' and violated free trade, and that it would work with the European Commission to challenge the move at the World Trade Organization. In a sign of the rising trade tensions, China's ministry added in another statement on Tuesday that an ongoing anti-dumping and anti-subsidy investigation into EU pork products would make 'objective and fair' decisions when it concludes. It also said that it was considering a hike in tariffs on imports of large-engine vehicles, which would hit German producers hardest. German exports of vehicles with engines of 2.5 liters or larger to China reached $1.2 billion last year. France was seen as the target of Beijing's brandy probe due to its support of tariffs on China-made EVs. French brandy shipments to China reached $1.7 billion last year and accounted for 99% of the country's imports of the spirit. As of Oct. 11, importers of brandy originating in the EU will have to put down security deposits mostly ranging from 34.8% to 39.0% of the import value, the ministry said. 'This announcement clearly shows that China is determined to tax us in response to European decisions on Chinese electric vehicles,' French cognac producers group BNIC said in an email. French President Emmanuel Macron said last week that China's brandy probe was 'pure retaliation,' while EV tariffs were needed to preserve a level playing field. Shares tumble LVMH-owned Hennessy and Remy Martin were among the brands hardest hit by the measures, with importers having to pay security deposits of 39.0% and 38.1%, respectively. The deposits would make it more costly upfront to import brandy from the EU. However they could be returned if a deal is eventually reached before definitive tariffs are imposed. Both the investigation and negotiations remain ongoing, said an executive at a leading cognac company, who declined to be identified due to the sensitivity of the matter. Chinese investigators visited producers in France last month and were due to make further site visits, the executive said, while Chinese and EU officials held negotiations on Monday. The outcome was unclear, however, and doubts around the EU's willingness to make a deal were emerging, they added. Shares in Pernod Ricard were down 4.2% at 0839 GMT, while Remy Cointreau's dropped 8.7% and shares in LVMH fell 4.9%. Companies that cooperated with China's investigation were hit with security deposit rates of 34.8%, with that imposed on Martell the lowest at 30.6%. Pernod Ricard, Remy Cointreau and LVMH did not immediately respond to requests for comment. The measures could mean a 20% price rise for consumers in China, said Jefferies analysts, reducing sales volumes by 20%. Remy, with the greatest exposure to the Chinese market, could see its sales decline by 6%, with Pernod group sales seeing a 1.6% impact, they said. China is the second largest export market for cognac after the United States but is the industry's most profitable territory. Difficult economic conditions in both markets have already prompted a sharp decline in cognac sales. James Sym, fund manager at Remy investor River Global, said despite this, there was no sign that demand for cognac had fundamentally changed, pointing to an uptick in cognac sales in Japan driven by Chinese tourists when the yen was weak. 'That's obviously a sign that cognac is not out of fashion,' he said, adding volumes – and the companies' share prices – should recover long-term, although the tariffs would likely hit volumes and margins while in place. Talks continue Luxury goods shares fell by as much as 7% on Tuesday, with one trader attributing this to fears that the sector, which is heavily reliant on China, could be next to see trade measures. The brandy measures follow a vote by the EU to adopt tariffs on China-made EVs by the end of October. Before the vote in late August, China had suspended its planned anti-dumping measures on EU brandy, in an apparent goodwill gesture, despite determining it had been sold in China at below-market prices. At the time, the commerce ministry said its probe would end before Jan. 5, 2025, but that it could be extended. China's commerce ministry previously said it had found that European distillers had been selling brandy in its 1.4 billion-strong consumer market at a dumping margin in the range of 30.6% to 39% and that its domestic industry had been damaged. In the EU's decision to impose tariffs on China-made EVs, the bloc set tariff rates on top of the 10% car import duty ranging from 7.8% for Tesla to 35.3% for SAIC and other producers deemed not to have cooperated with its investigation.

China is oversupplying lithium to eliminate rivals, US official says	LISBON — Chinese lithium producers are flooding the global market with the critical metal and causing a 'predatory' price drop as they seek to eliminate competing projects, a senior U.S. official said on a visit to Portugal that has ample lithium reserves. Jose Fernandez, undersecretary for economic growth, energy and the environment at the U.S. Department of State, told a briefing late on Monday that China was producing much more lithium 'than the world needs today, by far.' 'That is an intentional response by the People's Republic of China to what we are trying to do' with the Inflation Reduction Act - the largest climate and energy investment package in U.S. history valued at over $400 billion, Fernandez said. 'They engage in predatory pricing... [they] lower the price until competition disappears,’’ Fernandez said. ‘’That is what is happening.' China accounts for about two-thirds of the world's lithium chemical output, which is mainly used in battery technologies including for electric cars. Prices of lithium have fallen more than 80% in the past year largely due to overproduction from China and a drop in demand for electric vehicles. However, the price collapse is also affecting China as it has forced Chinese companies like battery giant CATL to suspend production at certain mines. Job cuts Europe aims to reduce its dependence on imports from China and other countries of lithium and other materials essential to the green transition. Fernandez said the low price 'constrains our ability to diversify our supply chains on a broad, global scale' and also hurts countries such as Portugal that need investment to develop these industries. Falling prices have forced many global lithium producers to scale back production and cut jobs. Portugal, with some 60,000 tons of known reserves, is already Europe's biggest producer of lithium, traditionally mined for ceramics. Along with neighboring Spain, the country wants to take advantage of local lithium deposits, aiming to cover the entire value chain from mining and refining to cell and battery manufacturing to battery recycling. Several mining companies in Portugal have been looking for financing, customers and suppliers to crank up projects. 'We want to help them, and we think we can... lithium mining companies, everywhere, have to survive this difficult phase that was created by predatory pricing,' Fernandez said. China's Premier Li Qiang in June used his address at a World Economic Forum meeting in Dalian to hit back at accusations from the United States and E.U. that Chinese firms benefit from unfair subsidies and are poised to flood their markets with cheap green technologies. Trade tensions intensified last Friday when the European Union said it would press ahead with hefty tariffs on China-made electric vehicles to counter what it sees as unfair Chinese subsidies, after a year-long anti-subsidy investigation. China on Tuesday imposed temporary anti-dumping measures on imports of brandy from the E.U.	https://www.voanews.com/a/china-is-oversupplying-lithium-to-eliminate-rivals-us-official-says-/7814452.html	2024-10-08T04:28:34-07:00

Skechers opens store in Xinjiang amid scrutiny over Uyghur forced labor sanctions	Washington — Despite ongoing U.S. sanctions targeting Chinese companies linked to Uyghur forced labor in Xinjiang, United States-based footwear and apparel company Skechers opened a new outlet in Urumqi, the region's capital. The store opened on September 28, days before Chinese national holiday week, one of the country's busiest shopping periods. Its opening has drawn criticism from human rights advocates who question Skechers' decision to expand its presence in a region under international scrutiny and subject to U.S. import bans on goods tied to forced labor. Jewher Ilham, forced labor project coordinator at the Worker Rights Consortium, expressed concern over Skechers' decision. 'By opening a store in the Uyghur region, Skechers is making a shocking statement that it does not care about human rights,' she said. Skechers did not respond to multiple requests for comment from VOA. Xinjiang, in northwest China, has been at the center of international controversy over allegations of human rights abuses against Uyghurs and other Turkic Muslim minorities, including forced labor, mass incarceration and repression — claims Chinese authorities have consistently denied. Xinjiang produces one-fifth of the world’s cotton. In response, the United States passed the Uyghur Forced Labor Prevention Act in 2022, which bars goods from Xinjiang unless proven to be free of forced labor. Skechers promoted its Urumqi store opening heavily on Chinese social media, with actor and brand ambassador Donnie Yen encouraging his nearly 130 million followers on Weibo to visit the outlet and explore its 'comfortable treasures.' Yen did not respond to multiple media inquiries from VOA regarding his visit to Xinjiang or his views on the treatment of Uyghurs by Chinese authorities. Timothy Grose, an associate professor of China studies at Rose-Hulman Institute of Technology, pointed out that 'from a profit-seeking perspective, of course, Donnie Yen makes sense, especially since nearly 75% of Urumqi’s population is Han Chinese.' 'Unfortunately, few Han are either fully aware or are concerned about state violence against the Uyghurs, so I doubt they will be judging Donnie Yen’s appearance with their moral compasses,' he told VOA. Corporate responsibility This isn’t the first time Skechers has faced scrutiny over alleged ties to forced labor in Xinjiang. In response to a 2020 report by the Australian Strategic Policy Institute alleging its supplier employed Uyghur workers under coercive conditions, Skechers denied the allegations. The company said audits of its supplier, Dong Guan Lu Zhou Shoes, found no evidence of forced labor, and that Uyghur workers were employed under the same terms as other employees. Skechers’ recent move comes as the U.S. continues to intensify its efforts to eliminate forced labor from global supply chains. On October 2, the U.S. Department of Homeland Security added two more Chinese companies to the Uyghur Forced Labor Prevention Act Entity List, bringing the total number of restricted entities to 75. 'Today’s actions reaffirm our commitment to eliminating forced labor from U.S. supply chains and upholding our values of human rights for all,' DHS undersecretary for policy Robert Silvers said in a statement on the DHS website. 'No sector is off-limits. We will continue to identify entities across industries and hold accountable those who seek to profit from exploitation and abuse.' Chinese pushback In China, Western companies that publicly declared a break from sourcing products from Xinjiang have long faced backlash from Chinese consumers. In September, PVH, parent company of Calvin Klein and Tommy Hilfiger, became the first Western firm investigated by Chinese authorities, who accused the company of violating Chinese law by allegedly halting the purchase of cotton and garments from Xinjiang. Corporate responsibility in Xinjiang has become a contentious issue. Grose pointed out that companies like Skechers may view doing business in Xinjiang and China as a safe financial bet, despite human rights concerns. The company’s actions are a stark reminder that companies should be held accountable not just by governments but by consumers, as well, said Adrian Zenz, a senior fellow and director in China studies at the Victims of Communism Memorial Foundation. '[B]rands are simply out for profit, with no regard to human rights,' he said. 'Western consumers are not showing much outrage over this. There is little backlash, so they will do it,' Zenz said.	https://www.voanews.com/a/skechers-opens-store-in-xinjiang-amid-scrutiny-over-uyghur-forced-labor-sanctions-/7814393.html	2024-10-08T03:44:09-07:00

Mozambique election winner faces tough financial squeeze	JOHANNESBURG — Whoever wins Mozambique's presidential election on Wednesday will face an economy battered by worsening cyclones, insecurity, delays to planned gas projects and high levels of debt. Ruling party candidate Daniel Chapo is the frontrunner, though there are three other candidates vying to replace Felipe Nyusi as president of the southeast African nation. Rising borrowing costs are putting pressure on Mozambique to embrace fiscal discipline, particularly as delayed gas revenues mean it is running out of options to refinance its debt - which is nearly as big as its annual GDP. 'Debt in the country is rocketing,' Gabriel Muthisse, a former transport and communications minister, told Reuters. 'Debt servicing is (diverting)...resources that could be used to finance the real economy.' The yield on Mozambique's international bond due 2031 stands at close to 13%. The country of 34 million people is still trying to shake off a decade-old 'tuna bonds' scandal involving Credit Suisse, in which loans for a fishing fleet went missing, leading Mozambique to default on its debt and the International Monetary Fund to suspend lending. Last year, the Swiss bank settled out of court. 'Financing options for the deficit are limited,' said Kevin Daly, portfolio manager at Abrdn, which holds Mozambique's 2031 international bond. Mozambique struck a $456 million deal with the IMF in May 2022, but its program expires next year and will have to be renegotiated. 'The future of the economy is really based on the development of these oil and gas...(fields),' said Thys Louw, portfolio manager at global asset manager, Ninety One. Yet Islamist violence has delayed TotalEnergies and ExxonMobil's development of some of Africa's biggest gas fields. Total says it is still committed to them, but investor enthusiasm is waning. 'There was a time where everyone was excited and waiting to go into Mozambique,' said Tshepo Ncube, head of International Coverage at Absa Corporate and Investment Bank. 'Now it is all about: 'let's see how it plays out'.'	https://www.voanews.com/a/mozambique-election-winner-faces-tough-financial-squeeze/7814320.html	2024-10-08T00:14:34-07:00

China state planner is 'fully confident' of achieving 2024 economic goals	BEIJING — China is 'fully confident' of achieving its full-year economic and social development targets, with some funds from 2025's budget being brought forward to support projects, chairman of the country's economic planner Zheng Shanjie said on Tuesday. China stocks blasted to two-year highs after a slew of stimulus steps announced in recent weeks supported sentiment in early trade, but later retreated. Hong Kong shares also slid as investors walked back some of the stimulus excitement. Zheng, chairman of the National Development and Reform Commission (NDRC), told a press conference China's economy remains largely stable but is facing more complex internal and external environments. 'The international market is volatile, global trade protectionism has intensified, and uncertain and unstable factors have increased. These will have an adverse impact on my country through trade, investment, finance and other channels,' Zheng said. Downward pressure on the domestic economy has increased, he added. To support local governments, China will issue $14.12 billion from next year's central government budget and another $14.12 billion for key investment projects by the end of this year, Zheng said. The country will also quicken fiscal spending and 'all sides should keep making efforts more forcefully' to strengthen macroeconomic policies, he added. Investors and economists expect more policy support on the fiscal side to sustain the market's optimism. They said it will take time to restore consumer and business confidence and get the economy back on more solid footing. A housing market recovery, in particular, could be a long slog. 'We anticipate that the government will arrange 1-3 trillion yuan of additional fiscal support this year and next to boost the real economy, recapitalise banks, and stabilize the property market,' said Yue Su, principal China economist at the Economist Intelligence Unit. 'This, along with investments from special long-term bonds planned for next year, is expected to primarily impact 2025's economic growth.' The government set a growth target of around 5% this year, but economic indicators showed growth momentum waned since the second quarter, weighing on households spending and business sentiment amid a severe property downturn. A private report by recruiting platform Zhaopin showed on Tuesday that average pay offered by recruiters in China's 38 major cities fell 2.5% in the third quarter from the second, and down 0.6% from a year earlier. In an effort to reverse the economic downturn, China unveiled in late September its most aggressive monetary stimulus package since the COVID-19 pandemic, coupled with extensive property market support. Zheng said that to address insufficient domestic demand, policymakers will focus on enhancing people's livelihood to stimulate consumption and investment, such as supporting disadvantaged people, consumer goods trade-ins, elderly care and births. No further details were announced. Vice Chairman of the NDRC, Liu Sushe, stated that most of the 6 trillion yuan in government investment this year was allocated to specific projects, with 90% of local government special bonds used for project construction issued by September. At the same press conference, another vice chairman of the NDRC, Zhao Chenxin, said that China's economic growth remained 'generally stable' over the first three quarters.	https://www.voanews.com/a/china-state-planner-is-fully-confident-of-achieving-2024-economic-goals/7814307.html	2024-10-07T23:20:25-07:00	
Milton could strike Florida Wednesday	FORT MYERS BEACH, Fla. — Florida's Gulf Coast braced Tuesday for the impact of Hurricane Milton's near-record winds and expected massive storm surge, which could bring destruction to areas already reeling from Helene's devastation 12 days ago and still recovering from Ian's wrath two years ago. Almost the entirety of Florida's west coast was under a hurricane warning early Tuesday as the Category 5 storm and its 265 kph winds crept toward the state at 14 kph, sucking energy from the Gulf of Mexico's warm water. The strongest Atlantic hurricane on record is 1980's Allen, which reached wind speeds of 306 kph as it moved through the Caribbean and Gulf before striking Texas and Mexico. Milton's center could come ashore Wednesday in the Tampa Bay region, which has not endured a direct hit by a major hurricane in more than a century. Scientists expect the system to weaken slightly before landfall, though it could retain hurricane strength as it churns across central Florida toward the Atlantic Ocean. That would largely spare other states ravaged by Helene, which killed at least 230 people on its path from Florida to the Appalachian Mountains. Tampa Bay has not been hit directly by a major hurricane since 1921, and authorities fear luck is about to run out for the region and its 3.3 million residents. President Joe Biden approved an emergency declaration for Florida, and U.S. Rep. Kathy Castor said 7,000 federal workers were mobilized to help in one of the largest mobilizations of federal personnel in history. 'This is the real deal here with Milton,' Tampa Mayor Jane Castor told a Monday news conference. 'If you want to take on Mother Nature, she wins 100% of the time.' The Tampa Bay area is still rebounding from Helene and its powerful surge — a wall of water up to 2.4 meters it created even though its eye was 160 kilometers offshore. Twelve people died there, with the worst damage along a string of barrier islands from St. Petersburg to Clearwater. Forecasters warned that Milton could bring a possible 2.4- to 3.6-meter storm surge, leading to evacuation orders being issued for beach communities all along the Gulf coast. In Florida, that means anyone who stays is on their own and first responders are not expected to risk their lives to rescue them at the height of the storm. Stragglers were a problem during Helene and 2022's Ian. Many residents failed to heed ample warnings, saying they evacuated during previous storms only to have major surges not materialize. But there was evidence Monday that people were getting out before Milton arrives. A steady stream of vehicles headed north toward the Florida Panhandle on Interstate 75, the main highway on the west side of the peninsula, as residents heeded evacuation orders. Traffic clogged the southbound lanes of the highway for miles as other residents headed for the relative safety of Fort Lauderdale and Miami on the other side of the state. About 240 kilometers south of Tampa, Fort Myers Beach was nearly a ghost town by Monday afternoon as an evacuation order took effect. Ian devastated the 5,000-resident community two years ago, its 4.5-meter storm surge destroying or severely damaging 400 homes and businesses. Fourteen people died there as they tried to ride out the storm, and dozens had to be rescued. On Monday, the few residents who could be found were racing against the clock to safeguard their buildings and belongings. None said they were staying. The signs of Ian's devastation remain visible everywhere. Rebuilt homes stand next to others in various states of construction. There are numerous vacant lots, which were once rare. 'This whole street used to be filled out with houses,' said Mike Sandell, owner of Pool-Rific Services. His workers were removing and storing pumps and heaters Monday from his clients' pools so they wouldn't get destroyed. Home construction supplies like bricks, piping and even workers' outhouses lined the streets, potential projectiles that could do further damage if a surge hits. At the beach Monday afternoon, workers busily emptied the triple-wide trailer that houses The Goodz, a combined hardware, convenience, fishing supply, ice cream and beach goods store. Owner Graham Belger said he moved his 'Your Island Everything Store' into the trailer after Ian destroyed his permanent building across the street. 'We’ll rebuild, but it is going to be bad,' he said. Nearby, Don Girard and his son Dominic worked to batten down the family’s three-story combination rental and vacation home that’s about 30.5 meters from the water. It’s first-floor garage and entranceway were flooded by Helene last month, Hurricane Debby in August, and a tide brought by a recent supermoon. Ian was by far the worst. Its waves crashed into the 14-year-old home’s second floor, destroying the flooring. Girard repaired the damage, and his aqua-blue and white home stands in contrast to the older, single-story house across the street. It was submerged by Ian, never repaired and remains vacant. Its once-off-white walls are now tinged with brown. Plywood covers the holes that once contained windows and doors. Girard, who owns a banner and flag company in Texas, said that while his feelings about owning his home are mostly positive, they are becoming mixed. He said every December, his extended family gathers there for the holidays. At that time of year, temperatures in southwest Florida are usually in the low 20s Celsius with little rain or humidity. The area and its beaches fill with tourists. 'At Christmas, there is no better place in the world,' Girard said. But flooding from Ian, the other storms and now Milton is leaving him frustrated. 'It’s been difficult, I’m not going to lie to you,' Girard said. 'The last couple years have been pretty bad.'	https://www.voanews.com/a/florida-braces-for-hurricane-milton-/7814306.html	2024-10-07T22:58:23-07:00	
Sentence for Belarusian-American extended as Belarus cracks down on dissent	TALLINN, Estonia — A Belarusian-American has had his prison term extended to a total of 13 1/2 years in the latest move in a relentless crackdown on dissent by Belarus' repressive government, rights activists said Monday. Yuras Zyankovich, a lawyer who has dual Belarusian and U.S. citizenship, has been held behind bars since 2021. He was convicted on accusations of plotting to assassinate Belarus' authoritarian President Alexander Lukashenko and seize power and given an 11-year sentence in September 2022. He then had six months added to his sentence later that year. In August, a court in Belarus handed Zyankovich, 46, an additional two-year sentence on charges of 'malicious disobedience to the prison administration,' according to the Viasna human rights group, a ruling that became known only now. The authorities have denied Zyankovich access to a lawyer since March. Zyankovich repeatedly went on hunger strike and his health has seriously deteriorated in custody, according to Viasna, which said that he faced harassment and intimidation by prison authorities. Last month, Zyankovich featured in a propaganda film aired by state television that described the purported plot he was convicted of. The U.S. Embassy in Belarus condemned airing the documentary and rejected the 'baseless claims' it contained in a statement in September. It emphasized that it will 'continue to advocate for the improved welfare of this detained American.' In 2020, Belarus was rocked by its largest-ever protests following an election that gave Lukashenko a sixth term in office but was condemned by the opposition and the West as fraudulent. According to Viasna, 65,000 people have been arrested since the protests began and hundreds of thousands have fled Belarus. Belarus has more than 1,300 political prisoners in Belarus, according to Viasna, including the group’s founder and Nobel Peace Prize laureate Ales Bialiatski.	https://www.voanews.com/a/sentence-for-belarusian-american-extended-as-belarus-cracks-down-on-dissent/7814275.html	2024-10-07T20:37:37-07:00	
Tunisia's Kais Saied wins landslide reelection	TUNIS, Tunisia — President Kais Saied won a landslide victory in Tunisia's election Monday, keeping his grip on power after a first term in which opponents were imprisoned and the country's institutions overhauled to give him more authority. The North African country's Independent High Authority for Elections said Saied received 90.7% of the vote, a day after exit polls showed him with an insurmountable lead in the country known as the birthplace of the Arab Spring more than a decade ago. 'We're going to cleanse the country of all the corrupt and schemers,' the 66-year-old populist said in a speech at campaign headquarters. He pledged to defend Tunisia against threats foreign and domestic. That raised alarm among the president's critics including University of Tunis law professor Sghayer Zakraoui, who said Tunisian politics were once again about 'the absolute power of a single man who places himself above everyone else and believes himself to be invested with a messianic message.' Zakraoui said the election results were reminiscent of Tunisia under President Zine El Abidine Ben Ali, who ruled for more than 20 years before becoming the first dictator toppled in the Arab Spring uprisings. Saied received a larger vote share than Ben Ali did in 2009, two years before fleeing the country amid protests. The closest challenger, businessman Ayachi Zammel, won 7.4% of the vote after sitting in prison for the majority of the campaign while facing multiple sentences for election-related crimes. Yet Saied's win was marred by low voter turnout. Election officials reported 28.8% of voters participated on Oct. 6 — a significantly smaller showing than in the first round of the country's two other post-Arab Spring elections and an indication of apathy plaguing the country's 9.7 million eligible voters. Saied's most prominent challengers — imprisoned since last year — were prevented from running, and lesser-known candidates were jailed or kept off the ballot. Opposition parties boycotted the contest, calling it a sham amid Tunisia's deteriorating political climate and authoritarian drift. Over the weekend, there was little sign of an election underway in Tunisia apart from an anti-Saied protest on Friday and celebrations in the capital on Sunday evening. 'He will re-enter office undermined rather than empowered by these elections,' Tarek Megerisi, a senior policy fellow at the European Council on Foreign Relations, wrote on X. Saied's critics pledged to keep opposing his rule. 'It's possible that after 20 years our kids will protest on Avenue Habib Bourguiba to tell him to get out,' said Amri Sofien, a freelance filmmaker, referring to the capital's main thoroughfare. 'There is no hope in this country.' Such despair is a far cry from the Tunisia of 2011, when protesters took to the streets demanding 'bread, freedom and dignity,' ousted the president and paved the way for the country's transition into a multiparty democracy. Tunisia in the following years enshrined a new constitution, created a Truth and Dignity Commission to bring justice to citizens tortured under the former regime and saw its leading civil society groups win the Nobel Peace Prize for brokering political compromise. But its new leaders were unable to buoy the country's flailing economy and quickly became unpopular amid constant political infighting and episodes of terrorism and political violence. Against that backdrop, Saied — then a political outsider — won his first term in 2019 promising to combat corruption. To the satisfaction of his supporters, in 2021 he declared a state of emergency, suspended parliament and rewrote the constitution to consolidate the power of the presidency — a series of actions his critics likened to a coup. Tunisians in a referendum approved the president's proposed constitution a year later, although voter turnout plummeted. Authorities subsequently began to unleash a wave of repression on the once-vibrant civil society. In 2023, some of Saied's most prominent opponents from across the political spectrum were thrown in prison, including right-wing leader Abir Moussi and Islamist Rached Ghannouchi, the co-founder of the party Ennahda and former speaker of Tunisia's parliament. Dozens of others were imprisoned on charges including inciting disorder, undermining state security and violating a controversial anti-fake news law critics say has been used to stifle dissent. The pace of the arrests picked up earlier this year, when authorities began targeting additional lawyers, journalists, activists, migrants from sub-Saharan Africa and the former head of the post-Arab Spring Truth and Dignity Commission. 'The authorities seemed to see subversion everywhere,' said Michael Ayari, senior analyst for Algeria & Tunisia at the International Crisis Group. Dozens of candidates had expressed interest in challenging the president, and 17 submitted preliminary paperwork to run in Sunday's race. However, members of the election commission approved only three. The role of the commission and its members, all of them appointed by the president under his new constitution, came under scrutiny. They defied court rulings ordering them to reinstate three candidates they had rejected. The parliament subsequently passed a law stripping power from the administrative courts. Such moves sparked international concern, including from Europe, which relies on partnership with Tunisia to police the central Mediterranean, where migrants attempt to cross in from North Africa to Europe. European Commission Foreign Affairs spokeswoman Nabila Massrali said Monday the EU 'takes note of the position expressed by many Tunisian social and political actors regarding the integrity of the electoral process.'	https://www.voanews.com/a/tunisia-s-kais-saied-wins-landslide-reelection/7814272.html	2024-10-07T20:22:26-07:00

US warns voters of disinformation deluge	WASHINGTON — American voters are likely about to be swamped by a flood of misinformation and influence campaigns engineered by U.S. adversaries aiming, according to senior U.S. intelligence officials, to sway the results of the upcoming presidential election and cast doubt on the process itself. The latest assessment from the Office of the Director of National Intelligence, issued Monday, comes just 29 days before the November 5 election that will see U.S. voters choose the country's next president and cast ballots in hundreds of other state and local races. 'We've continued to see actors ramp up their activities as we get closer to Election Day,' said a senior U.S. intelligence official, briefing reporters on the condition of anonymity. 'They recognize that individuals are already voting, and operations can have a greater impact as we get closer to Election Day,' the official said, noting that the election itself may just be a starting point. 'The intelligence community expects foreign influence actors to continue their campaigns by calling into question the validity of the election results after the polls close,' the official added. A second U.S. intelligence official warned the pace of such influence efforts, especially those targeting specific races or political campaigns, has also picked up. 'We have had more than a threefold increase,' the official said, explaining that the number of private briefings to candidates and campaigns has likewise jumped. Intelligence agencies also cautioned that U.S. adversaries will likely seize upon the damage done by Hurricane Helene and potential damage from Hurricane Milton as it strengthens off the U.S. coastline to further amplify and manufacture narratives meant to undermine confidence in the election results. 'It does take time for those types of narratives to be formed and put out into the wild, so to speak,' the first intelligence official said. 'But we certainly expect foreign countries to take advantage of such situations and promote further divisive rhetoric.' Monday's assessment follows a series of earlier public warnings about foreign efforts to meddle in the U.S. election. U.S. officials said Monday that Russia, Iran and China continue to be responsible for most of the influence efforts targeting U.S. voters. And, they said, there have been no indications that any of those countries have changed their goals. Russia, they said, continues to run influence campaigns aimed at boosting the chances of former U.S. President and Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump, while seeking to hurt the campaign of Vice President Kamala Harris, the Democratic nominee. Iran's efforts remain focused on helping Harris by hurting Trump, they said, pointing to the ongoing hack-and-leak operation against the Trump campaign, which has been traced to three operatives working for Iran's Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps. Targeting state, local races U.S. intelligence agencies assess that China has yet to wade into the U.S. presidential campaign, focusing instead on persuading American voters to reject state and local candidates perceived as detrimental to Beijing's interests, especially those voicing support for Taiwan. But the latest public assessment pointed to some changes. U.S. intelligence officials on Monday warned that Russia and Cuba have joined China, in targeting congressional, state and local races. 'Moscow is leveraging a wide range of influence actors in an effort to influence congressional races, particularly to encourage the U.S. public to oppose pro-Ukraine policies and politicians,' the intelligence official said. 'Havana almost certainly has considered influence efforts targeting some candidates,' the official added. 'This is consistent with what they've done in past cycles.' Russia, China and Iran have all rejected previous U.S. accusations of election meddling. Russia, Iran and Cuba have yet to respond to requests from VOA for comment on the latest U.S. findings. China late Monday again dismissed the U.S. concerns. 'China is not interested in the U.S. congressional election, and we have no intention and will not interfere in it,' Liu Pengyu, the spokesperson for the Chinese Embassy in Washington, told VOA in an email. 'Some U.S. congressmen stick to their wrong positions on the Taiwan question,' Liu added. 'China firmly defends its national sovereignty and territorial integrity, but this does not lead to the conclusion that China has interfered in the congressional elections.' But the U.S. intelligence assessments align with concerns voiced by some lawmakers and private technology companies. 'The 48 hours after the polls close, especially if we have as close an election as we anticipate, could be equally if not more significant in terms of spreading false information, disinformation and literally undermining the tenets of our democracy,' Mark Warner, chair of the Senate Intelligence Committee, said during a hearing last month. 'Vigorous activity' Microsoft President Brad Smith, who has warned that the most perilous moments could come in the 48 hours before the U.S. election, separately said the increase in malign cyber efforts by Russia and Iran, especially, is undeniable. 'We're seeing vigorous activity,' Smith told a cyber conference last month. 'We're seeing the Iranians really target the Republican Party in the Trump campaign,' he said. 'We're seeing the Russians target the Democratic Party and now the Harris campaign.' And it is unclear what impact the U.S. has made with its attempts to counter the growing number of foreign influence efforts. Last month, the U.S. Justice Department seized 32 internet domains used by companies linked to Moscow to spread disinformation. At the same time, the department indicted employees of the state-controlled media outlet RT in connection with a plot to launder Russian propaganda through a U.S.-based media company. U.S. intelligence officials on Monday, however, said such tactics are no longer unique to the Kremlin. 'Foreign influence actors are getting better at hiding their hand and using Americans to do it,' said one of the U.S. intelligence officials. 'Foreign countries calculate that Americans are more likely to believe other Americans compared to content with clear signs of foreign propaganda.' Arizona Democratic Senator Mark Kelly told CBS' 'Face the Nation' on Sunday that social media is rife with fake personas generated by U.S. adversaries. 'If you're looking at stuff on Twitter, on TikTok, on Facebook, on Instagram, and it's political in nature … there is a very reasonable chance — I would put it in the 20 to 30% range — that the content you are seeing, the comments you are seeing, are coming from one of those three countries: Russia, Iran, China,' he said. 'It's not going to stop on November 5.'	https://www.voanews.com/a/us-warns-voters-of-disinformation-deluge/7814263.html	2024-10-07T19:50:11-07:00

Mexico's Sheinbaum sends secondary legislation on judicial reform implementation	MEXICO CITY — Mexican President Claudia Sheinbaum sent two proposals to Congress to reform electoral laws and implement a sweeping reform of the judiciary, her government said in a statement on Monday. Congress passed the constitutional reform, which stipulates that all judges be elected by popular vote over the next three years, in September. The ruling Morena party and its allies have championed the reform as an improvement on the current judicial system, arguing it is needed to root out corruption in the judiciary. 'The judicial reform has already been approved, it is constitutional, and in a few days, after the approval of these two laws, the electoral process will begin,' Sheinbaum said during her morning press conference. The government's statement said that the two reforms proposed on Monday aim to ensure certainty around the process for electing judges, justices and magistrates. An election to replace all Supreme Court judges, while reducing their number from 11 to nine, as well as to vote in members of an electoral tribunal and half the country's magistrates and district judges, is scheduled for June 1. Mexico's Supreme Court last week voted to consider a constitutional challenge to the judicial overhaul and is expected to rule on whether the reform affects the independence of the courts.	https://www.voanews.com/a/mexico-s-sheinbaum-sends-secondary-legislation-on-judicial-reform-implementation/7814236.html	2024-10-07T18:38:14-07:00	
On October 7 terrorist attack anniversary, Israel-Hamas war still rages	Monday marked the first anniversary of the October 7 terrorist attack that Hamas perpetrated on Israel.

Haiti's divided transition council picks new president	port-au-prince, haiti — Haiti's transitional presidential council transferred the rotating presidency on Monday to architect Leslie Voltaire despite opposition from outgoing president Edgard Leblanc Fils, who refused to sign a decree ratifying the move. Leblanc Fils had opposed the move citing unresolved corruption accusations against three other councilors who remain voting members and signed off on the transition. 'Under my presidency the transitional presidential council will consolidate its gains and structures to work with more efficiency and transparency,' said Voltaire, who represents the party of former President Jean-Bertrand Aristide. 'Haitian people have enough of violence, of lies and of corruption,' he said. 'We must forget our personal interests and prioritize those of the nation.' The rift at the council creates fresh uncertainty in a country still reeling from the gang massacre of at least 70 people last week, with Prime Minister Garry Conille seeking security assistance abroad. Haiti named the transition council in April after arduous negotiations between various sectors of the Caribbean nation's political and civil alliances. It was empowered with choosing a prime minister and wielding certain presidential powers until conditions are considered secure enough for a new election. But this month, Haiti's anti-corruption unit recommended legal action against three council members it said had accepted credit cards and asked for nearly $770,000 from the chairman of a state-run bank. The three remain on the council, though they are excluded from the current presidential succession plan, which sees economist Fritz Alphonse Jean taking over in March and businessman Laurent Saint-Cyr in August. 'I cannot participate in any process that will further weaken and devalue the country's justice system,' Leblanc Fils said in a video message late on Sunday, saying the decision of the council's majority would aggravate the instability. The January 30 Collective of political parties, which nominated Leblanc Fils to the council, called for the three members accused of bribery to be put aside pending a judicial ruling. The accused are diplomat Smith Augustin, politician Louis Gerald Gilles and former judge Emmanuel Vertilaire. All three have rejected the charges. Augustin was initially slated to succeed Leblanc Fils as the council's president. The council was formed to replace the government of Prime Minister Ariel Henry, who was forced to step down amid a gang conflict that has killed thousands and forced over 700,000 people from their homes. The new administration has said it hopes the country's first elections since 2016 can be held next year providing sufficient security is restored. However, gangs have in recent months expanded their territories, pushing hundreds of thousands more people from their homes and worsening a hunger crisis while long-delayed international support continues to lag.	https://www.voanews.com/a/haiti-s-divided-transition-council-picks-new-president-/7813913.html	2024-10-07T17:41:04-07:00

Trump, Harris mark somber anniversary of Hamas' Oct. 7 attack on Israel	FORT LAUDERDALE, Fla. — Former President Donald Trump and Vice President Kamala Harris are marking the anniversary of the deadliest attack on Jews since the Holocaust as the presidential candidates approach the final weeks of the campaign during a widening conflict in the Middle East. Political leaders across the spectrum were marking the killing of about 1,200 people, including 46 U.S. citizens, by Hamas-led militants in the October 7 attack last year, and the taking of about 250 hostages. A year later, about 100 people, including several Americans, remain in captivity, as U.S.-led efforts to negotiate a cease-fire and hostage release deal have sputtered out. Trump visited the New York City gravesite of Rabbi Menachem Mendel Schneerson, who led the Chabad-Lubavitch movement of Orthodox Judaism from 1951 until his death in 1994. Schneerson was the movement's seventh leader, known as Lubavitcher Rebbe. Trump then will speak before Jewish community leaders at one of his Florida resorts in the Miami suburb of Doral. Harris and her husband planted a pomegranate tree on the grounds of the vice president's residence in honor of the those killed a year ago. Earlier Monday, Harris' husband, Doug Emhoff, who is Jewish, recited a prayer for peace at an event to commemorate the anniversary hosted by the American Jewish Committee in Washington. President Joe Biden and first lady Jill Biden also hosted a somber memorial ceremony at the White House Monday to mark the anniversary of the attack. The Bidens looked on as Rabbi Aaron Alexander of Washington's Adas Israel Congregation recited the Jewish remembrance prayer for the more than 1,200 people, including dozens of Americans, killed that day, listing the towns, villages and festival site that were the scenes of the deadliest day for Jews since the Holocaust. The president then lit a lone memorial candle placed on a small table at the center of the Blue Room, before they observed a moment of silence. Earlier in the day, Biden spoke with Israeli President Isaac Herzog, the White House said. The attack sparked a deadly war in Gaza, as Israel moved to root out Hamas' control over the territory and try to return those taken captive. Israel's military campaign has killed more than 41,000 Palestinians, including many women and children, according to the Hamas-run health ministry, which does not distinguish between militants and civilians. Another Iran-backed group, Hezbollah, has fired thousands of rockets at Israeli territory in the same period from Lebanon, and Israel last month expanded a campaign of sabotage and assassination and launched a ground incursion into Lebanon to combat the threat from the group. In 1997, the U.S. State Department designated both Hezbollah and Hamas as foreign terrorist organizations. Many other countries also label them as terrorist groups, although some apply the designation only to their military wings.	https://www.voanews.com/a/trump-harris-mark-somber-anniversary-of-hamas-oct-7-attack-on-israel/7814206.html	2024-10-07T17:24:18-07:00	
Putin to meet Iran president Friday in Turkmenistan	moscow — Russian President Vladimir Putin is to meet Iran's President Masoud Pezeshkian for talks Friday at a forum in the Central Asian country of Turkmenistan, a senior aide said Monday. Yury Ushakov, Putin's aide on foreign policy, told journalists the leaders would meet in Ashgabat while attending an event celebrating a Turkmen poet. 'This meeting has great significance both for discussing bilateral issues as well as, of course, discussing the sharply escalated situation in the Middle East,' Ushakov said. Leaders of Central Asian countries are meeting to commemorate the 300th anniversary of the birth of 18th-century poet Magtymguly Pyragy. Putin's attendance had not been previously announced. Russian Prime Minister Mikhail Mishustin visited Iran last week for talks with Pezeshkian and First Vice President Mohammad Reza Aref. The talks come as Israel intensively bombs Lebanon, targeting Iran-backed Hezbollah, and Russia has evacuated some citizens. Russia has close relations with Iran, and Western governments have accused Tehran of supplying Moscow with drones and missiles, which it has repeatedly denied. Pezeshkian will also hold talks with Putin during a visit to Russia this month to participate in a BRICS summit of emerging economies.	https://www.voanews.com/a/putin-to-meet-iran-president-friday-in-turkmenistan-/7814199.html	2024-10-07T17:19:21-07:00	
Clashes erupt at Albania anti-government protest	Tirana, Albania — Clashes broke out late Monday in Tirana between police and opposition protesters seeking that longtime leftist Prime Minister Edi Rama resign, leaving 10 officers injured police said. A few thousand people gathered in the Albanian capital at demonstrations organized by the country's right-wing opposition. Scuffles first broke out in front of the government building when demonstrators tried to break through a police cordon and some of them threw Molotov cocktails. The crowd moved toward the headquarters of Rama's Socialist Party where more Molotov cocktails were thrown, setting on fire the entrance door and a banner with the prime minister's image, an AFP journalist reported. The protesters, who want Rama to step down and a caretaker government to take over until next year's parliamentary elections, also targeted the interior ministry headquarters and the city hall with Molotov cocktails. A bus station and several garbage containers were set on fire. Police, deployed in large numbers, used teargas in a bid to disperse the crowd moving towards the parliament. 'So far 10 police officers have been injured in the attacks with Molotov cocktails, pyrotechnics and solid objects,' a police statement said. Police urged the demonstrators to stop attacking them and state institutions, warning that measures were being taken to identify those involved in the attacks. 'This is the first step towards civil disobedience,' Flamur Noka, an official of the main opposition Democratic Party, told reporters in front of the party's headquarters. 'We will continue our battle of civil disobedience until Rama resigns and a caretaker government is formed,' he said. The protest was held a week after opposition lawmakers threw their chairs out of parliament and set them on fire in protest at a prison sentence handed to one of their peers. Ervin Salianji, an official of the Democratic Party, in September was found guilty of 'giving false testimony' in a drug trafficking case that targeted the brother of a lawmaker of the ruling Socialist Party. The opposition described the MP's arrest and conviction as a 'blind act of revenge and political terror against the Democratic Party,',= accusing Rama of being behind it. Democratic Party leader and former prime minister Sali Berisha said earlier that Monday's protests would be the 'battle of our lives'. Berisha has been under house arrest since December last year on charges of 'passive corruption.' He has rejected the accusations against him as politically motivated.	https://www.voanews.com/a/clashes-erupt-at-albania-anti-government-protest/7814197.html	2024-10-07T17:15:06-07:00

Iran's Quds Force Commander is 'in good health', deputy commander says	DUBAI, United Arab Emirates — The top commander of Iran's Quds Force, Esmail Qaani, is in 'good health,' the force's deputy commander Iraj Masjedi said Monday, after two Iranian security sources told Reuters he had been out of contact since strikes on Beirut last week. 'He is in good health and is carrying out his activities. Some ask us to issue a statement... there is no need for this,' Masjedi was quoted as saying by Iranian state media in reference to Qaani. The Iranian Students' News Agency reported that a message from Qaani was conveyed to a conference in solidarity with Palestinian children held Monday in Tehran, adding that the commander could not attend 'due to his being in another important meeting.' One of the security officials told Reuters that Qaani was in Beirut's southern suburbs, known as the Dahiyeh, during a strike last week that was reported to have targeted senior Hezbollah official Hashem Safieddine. The official said he was not meeting with Safieddine. Israel has been hitting multiple targets in Dahiyeh as it pursues a campaign against Iran-backed Lebanese group Hezbollah. Tehran named Qaani the head of the Revolutionary Guards Corps' overseas military-intelligence service after the United States assassinated his powerful predecessor Qassem Soleimani in a drone strike in Baghdad in 2020. The Quds Force heavily influences its allied armed groups across the Middle East.	https://www.voanews.com/a/iran-s-quds-force-commander-is-in-good-health-deputy-commander-says/7813955.html	2024-10-07T17:00:02-07:00	
North Korea's Kim says he will speed up steps to become a nuclear superpower	SEOUL, SOUTH KOREA — North Korean leader Kim Jong Un said his country will speed up steps toward becoming a military superpower with nuclear weapons and would not rule out using them if enemies attacked it, state media KCNA said on Tuesday. Kim made the comments in a speech on Monday at a university, which was printed in full by KCNA. He said he has no intention of attacking South Korea, but 'if the enemy attempts to use force against our country' North Korea's military will use all aggression without hesitation, which 'does not preclude the use of nuclear weapons.'.= Kim also called for extensive strengthening of North Korea's defenses, according to KCNA. He also sent a birthday message to Russian President Vladimir Putin, KCNA said. Kim called Putin his 'closest Comrade', saying 'strategic and cooperative relations' between the two countries will be raised to a new level to work on 'defending regional and global peace and international justice.'	https://www.voanews.com/a/north-korea-s-kim-says-he-will-speed-up-steps-to-become-a-nuclear-superpower/7813918.html	2024-10-07T16:54:37-07:00	
Philippines launches naval drills with allies as regional tensions simmer	SUBIC, Philippines — The armed forces of the Philippines, the United States and four other countries began joint naval exercises off the coast of the Philippines' northern Luzon island facing Taiwan in a display of naval strength amid rising tensions with China. Called 'Sama Sama,' which means togetherness, this year's drills, which involve almost 1,000 sailors and personnel from Australia, Canada, France, Japan, the United States and the Philippines, are high-intensity exercises focusing on anti-submarine, anti-surface and anti-air warfare. U.S. Navy Rear Admiral Todd Cimicata told reporters in the port of Subic, to the west of Manila, that building partnerships with key allies created a 'deterrent effect,' though he added that the exercises were not targeted at any country. 'The intent of these exercises is not to ruffle feathers. It's tailored for interoperability,' Cimicata said. 'Across the gamut, there are people that don't follow those rules so we have to agree so that we can set those standards.' The nine-day exercises will bring together the U.S. Navy's Arleigh Burke-class guided-missile destroyer USS Howard, Canada's Halifax-class frigate HMCS Vancouver and a CH-148 Cyclone helicopter, while Japan's Force ShinMaywa US-2 amphibious aircraft and Kawasaki P-1 maritime patrol aircraft are also participating, along with warships from the Philippines. The drills come more than a week after the Chinese military said its air and naval forces conducted maneuvers in a disputed area of the South China Sea, fanning tensions in a waterway that remains a volatile flashpoint in the region. Cimicata said the exercises were planned months in advance. China claims nearly all the South China Sea, but those claims overlap with those of Brunei, Malaysia, the Philippines and Vietnam, angering its neighbors and the United States, which has stepped up its security engagements in the region. Last month, the United States carried out joint maritime exercises with Australia, Japan, Philippines and for the first time New Zealand in Manila's exclusive economic zone to improve the militaries' interoperability. Washington's Marine Rotational Forces - Southeast Asia (MRF-SEA) will participate in at least eight exercises this year and next in their third deployment in the region, including assignments in Malaysia, Brunei and Indonesia. 'This is the most robust formation that we've had. And it is also conducting the most exercises since the inception of MRF-SEA,' its commander Col. Stuart Glenn told reporters.	https://www.voanews.com/a/philippines-launches-naval-drills-with-allies-as-regional-tensions-simmer/7813871.html	2024-10-07T15:36:03-07:00	
Philippines, South Korea agree to deepen maritime cooperation	Manila, Philippines — The Philippines and South Korea committed Monday to deepening maritime cooperation, their presidents said, in the face of China's assertion of its claims over the South China Sea. South Korean President Yoon Suk Yeol and his Philippine counterpart Ferdinand Marcos met in Manila and agreed to closer ties between their coast guards. Yoon said they will strengthen 'tackling transnational crime, information sharing and conducting search and rescue missions.' 'We shared a common understanding about the importance of peace, stability and safety in the South China Sea,' Yoon told reporters after the bilateral meeting. 'Our two countries will continue to work together in order to establish a rules-based maritime order and for the freedom of navigation and overflight pursuant to the principles of international law in the South China Sea,' he added. South Korea has repeatedly commented on tensions in the disputed waters. In March, Seoul expressed its 'grave concern' over China's 'repeated use of water cannons against the Philippine vessels' in the area. China has for years sought to expand its presence in contested areas of the South China Sea, brushing aside an international ruling that its claim to most of the waterway has no legal basis. It has built artificial islands armed with missile systems and runways for fighter jets, and deployed vessels that the Philippines says harass its ships and block fishing. Cooperation agreements signed in the bilateral meeting Monday cover areas such as critical raw material supply chains, as well as a feasibility study on reviving the Philippines' mothballed Bataan Nuclear Power Plant. 'As the geopolitical environment is only becoming more complex, we must work together to achieve prosperity for our peoples and to promote a rules-based order,' the Philippines' leader Marcos said ahead of the meeting.	https://www.voanews.com/a/philippines-south-korea-agree-to-deepen-maritime-cooperation-/7813867.html	2024-10-07T15:33:32-07:00	
China to flesh out economic stimulus plans after bumper rally	beijing — Top Chinese economic policymakers are expected to flesh out a raft of growth-boosting policies Tuesday, after the announcement of long-awaited stimulus measures last month sparked a blistering stock market rally. Beijing has struggled to kick-start the economy as officials hope to achieve about 5% growth this year — a goal analysts say is optimistic given the numerous headwinds, from a prolonged housing crisis to sluggish consumption. After months of piecemeal tinkering that did little to reverse the malaise, officials have unveiled a raft of measures, from rate cuts to looser curbs on house buying, aimed at getting money flowing again. Hopes of that long-awaited 'bazooka stimulus' have lit up stock markets, sending foreign-language markets in mainland China and Hong Kong surging more than 20%. And with all eyes on the reopening of mainland markets following the Golden Week public holiday, officials from the National Development and Reform Commission will hold a news briefing at 10 a.m. (0200 GMT) Tuesday. Chairman Zheng Shanjie and others will discuss the rollout of 'a package of incremental policies to solidly promote economic growth,' Beijing has said. Analysts said they hoped officials would unveil further fiscal support measures such as trillions of yuan in bond issuances and policies to boost consumption. But they cautioned that deep reforms to the economic system to relieve the debt crisis in the property sector and boost domestic demand are needed if Beijing is serious about resolving the fundamental obstacles to growth. 'Unless China introduces structural reforms to really jump-start consumption — from unemployment benefits to real pensions — I just don't think that we will see a major change,' said Alicia Garcia Herrero, chief economist for the Asia-Pacific region at investment manager Natixis. The market rally risked becoming a 'mirage,' she warned, as policymakers propped up stocks without properly tackling the underlying issues in the real economy. 'If the measures are not proven to be effective ... it will be even worse, because it means that not even the stimulus works,' she said. Rate cuts, cash, credit Hong Kong's benchmark Hang Seng Index closed up 1.6% Monday, while mainland markets reopen Tuesday after a surge led by technology and property firms was interrupted by the public holiday. Many of the measures unveiled so far have been aimed at the flagging housing market, long a key driver of growth but now mired in a prolonged debt crisis exemplified by the fates of developers like Evergrande. To that end, Beijing's central bank has slashed interest for one-year loans to financial institutions, cut the amount of cash lenders must keep on hand, and pushed to lower rates on existing mortgages. Several cities — including the financial crucibles of Shanghai, Guangzhou and Shenzhen — have also further eased restrictions on buying homes. Gene Ma, the head of China research at the Institute of International Finance, said the market reaction to stimulus was 'totally normal.' But, he warned, 'sustained economic recovery and reflation require more forceful demand-side fiscal stimuli.'	https://www.voanews.com/a/china-to-flesh-out-economic-stimulus-plans-after-bumper-rally-/7813852.html	2024-10-07T15:08:20-07:00

Europe braces for Chinese retaliation over EV import tariffs	The European Union is braced for retaliation from China after the bloc voted Friday to impose tariffs on the import of Chinese electric vehicles, which Brussels says receive unfair state subsidies. As Henry Ridgwell reports, there’s speculation that Beijing could target individual European countries that voted for the measures.	https://www.voanews.com/a/europe-braces-for-chinese-retaliation-over-ev-import-tariffs/7813827.html	2024-10-07T14:46:24-07:00	
Europe braces for Chinese retaliation over EV import tariffs	London — The European Union is bracing for retaliation from China after the bloc voted last week to impose tariffs on the import of Chinese electric vehicles, or EVs, amid speculation that Beijing could seek to target individual European countries that voted for the measures. The EU is divided on the issue, with 10 member states in favor in Friday’s vote, five countries voting against the measures and 12 abstaining. After the vote, China's Commerce Ministry said it opposed the planned tariffs, calling them 'unfair, non-compliant and unreasonable.' Cognac France is among the countries that pushed for the EU to adopt the tariffs. Makers of French cognac, a type of brandy, fear that Beijing will now seek to target their product, after China launched an anti-dumping probe earlier this year. That investigation concluded in August that dumping had occurred on the Chinese market, but Beijing chose not to impose any tariffs at that stage, a decision widely seen as an attempt to defuse tensions with Europe. The EU’s decision to impose EV tariffs could provoke China into reversing its decision, according to Anthony Brun, president of General Union of Cognac Producers. 'We are of course quite worried, because today, China is our second-biggest market. It represents more than one-third of our volumes that are exported for more than 250 years now. Knowing that we will potentially be imposed with a tax of around 40% tomorrow — that would potentially mean the disappearance of this market, because our competitors will not be targeted with the same tax,' Brun told the Reuters news agency, adding that the French government had seemingly chosen to sacrifice his industry. 'Because France is leading the way on this policy, they will seek to target a product that concerns France exclusively,' he said. German cars Germany, the EU’s biggest economy, voted against the tariffs. German carmakers also fear Beijing’s retaliation. 'The European automotive industry — and especially Germany’s — lives from exports. Seventy percent of our jobs depend on it. The current decision could lead to new trade conflicts, to a spiral of protectionism, with tariffs being responded to with further tariffs. And that is a disadvantage for us,' said Hildegard Mueller, president of the German Association of the Automotive Industry, in an interview with Reuters. China has already opened investigations into the import of European pork and dairy products, which could disproportionately hit some EU member states that voted in favor of the electric vehicle tariffs. 'No right to retaliate’ Beijing’s intentions aren’t yet clear, according to Sander Tordoir, a senior economist at the Centre for European Reform. 'The European Commission followed the World Trade Organization’s rules in designing the countervailing duties on Chinese electric vehicles,' Tordoir wrote in an email to VOA. 'As a result, China in principle has no right to retaliate, but that does not mean Beijing won’t anyway. Berlin’s very visible opposition to the tariffs means Beijing may target its retaliation on exports of, say, French brandy or Spanish pork, not German cars. But one cannot exclude that China will anyway discriminate against EU or German-built cars.' In a statement issued after Friday’s EU vote, the Chinese Ministry of Commerce pledged to 'take all measures' to safeguard Chinese companies — but added that negotiations would continue. Negotiations Both Brussels and Beijing are keen to find a compromise — and both want to avoid a trade war, according to Julia Poliscanova of the Transport and Environment policy research group in Brussels, which advocates for greener transport. 'We shouldn’t underestimate how important the European market is also for China. Ultimately, the EU market provides the opportunity for the bulk of Chinese EV exports,' Poliscanova said. 'So, China needs the EU as much as we need China. And that's why I think there will be some sort of ‘friendlier’ retaliation or friendlier actions as such. 'Given the huge oversupply or overcapacity in China and the desire and the need for a lot of Chinese companies — battery makers, EV makers — to go global, I believe the European market will still be very attractive to them,' she said. Economist Tordoir is less optimistic. 'It is hard to judge how likely negotiations will succeed. By pressing ahead with the EV tariffs in the interim, the EU has shown that it is serious,' he said. 'Reportedly under discussion is an idea to set voluntary minimum prices — a kind of surcharge — to offset the market-distorting Chinese subsidies on electric vehicles. But it is not clear how these would be monitored, enforced or how the scheme would be made WTO-compliant, which the EU clearly cares about.' WTO rules The EU argues that the EV tariffs will protect the European car industry, which it says employs 14 million people across the bloc. 'The purpose has been to establish, or rather re-establish, a level playing field so that the goals pertaining to electric vehicles and overall green goals, let's say for the EU, can be achieved in a fair way,' European Commission spokesperson Olof Gill told reporters Friday. 'We do not and we never have wanted to impose tariffs in this case for the sake of imposing tariffs. What we want is to remove the injurious subsidization.' Brussels believes the EV tariffs don’t breach World Trade Organization or WTO rules. 'The tariffs are very differentiated [according] to the company and based on the individual levels of subsidization,' auto industry analyst Poliscanova said. 'I think that is what makes those tariffs actually quite compatible from what I understand with WTO rules.' US tariffs The United States in August quadrupled its tariff on Chinese electric vehicle imports to 100%. U.S. Trade Representative Katherine Tai said such measures are sometimes necessary. 'The goals that we're trying to accomplish: One is to level the playing field for our industries and our workers. The second one is to ensure that the United States economy, for our workers and our producers, can stay vibrant, that especially when it comes to critical industries that we know are strategic for our collective future, that the United States can continue to be a producer, a player, and that the jobs in these industries will be good jobs,' Tai told Agence France-Presse on October 3. Canada also imposed a 100% tariff on Chinese EVs from the beginning of October, alongside 25% import tariffs on steel and aluminum. Beijing has filed an ongoing appeal against the Canadian measures at the World Trade Organization.	https://www.voanews.com/a/europe-braces-for-chinese-retaliation-over-ev-import-tariffs-/7813804.html	2024-10-07T14:17:26-07:00	
Senior member of Myanmar's former ruling party dies	Bangkok — Zaw Myint Maung, a senior member of Myanmar’s former ruling party arrested during the 2021 military takeover, died Monday while serving a prison sentence that was considered politically motivated. He was 72. He was a close colleague of ousted leader Aung San Suu Kyi and spokesperson of her National League for Democracy party. He had been a second vice president and chief minister of the central Mandalay region before the army seized control of the government in 2021, arresting him, Suu Kyi and many top members of her NLD party and government. Zaw Myint Maung had been jailed at least twice under previous governments for his political activities. He had had leukemia since 2019. His death was confirmed by Tun Kyi, a party colleague from Mandalay, and another friend, who insisted on anonymity for fear of being punished by the authorities. In a statement expressing condolences, the National Unity Government, the main shadow opposition group organizing against army rule, lauded Zaw Myint Maung for being 'unwaveringly committed to the democratic cause, fighting alongside the people and other democratic forces to dismantle military dictatorship.' The NLD won a landslide victory in Myanmar's 2020 election, but the army seized power Feb. 1, 2021, the day it was supposed to begin a second five-year term in office. The country now is enmeshed in civil war between the military and pro-democracy forces allied with armed ethnic minority groups. Zaw Myint Maung was serving a prison sentence of 29 years after being convicted in closed court in 2021 and 2022 on charges of violating coronavirus restrictions, corruption, sedition and election fraud. The charges are similar to those against other NLD members, including Suu Kyi, and are widely regarded as having been fabricated to sideline the party and legitimize the military's takeover. Zaw Myint Maung often was transferred to Mandalay General Hospital from Obo prison to be treated for his condition. The friends who confirmed his death said prison officials came to the hospital Sunday to read Zaw Myint Maung an official letter saying the military had granted him amnesty. A copy of the purported letter posted on social media said the amnesty was granted as an act of leniency and compassion. He was not the first senior NLD member to die after being imprisoned by the military government. Nyan Win, who had been a member of the NLD central executive committee as well as a confidante of Suu Kyi, died in July 2021 after getting COVID-19 in Insein prison in Yangon. The NLD was dissolved along with 39 other political parties in 2023 for failing to reapply under a new party registration law. The military has said there will be an election next year but has not set a date.	https://www.voanews.com/a/senior-member-of-myanmar-s-former-ruling-party-dies/7813802.html	2024-10-07T14:14:44-07:00	
Watchdogs: Sentencing of jihadi linked to Charlie Hebdo attack 'important verdict'	washington — Media groups have welcomed the life sentence handed to a French jihadi linked to the 2015 Charlie Hebdo attack. A French court last week found Peter Cherif guilty of 'belonging to a criminal organization' in connection to his work with al-Qaida in the Arabian Peninsula, according to AFP. Cherif, 42, is suspected of training Chérif Kouachi, one of the people who carried out a deadly attack on staff at the French satirical magazine on Jan. 7, 2015. 'This is a very important verdict on the global level,' Pavol Szalai, of media watchdog Reporters Without Borders, or RSF, told VOA. 'It shows that not only the justice for assassination of media professionals can be served, but that it can also go beyond the sentencing of the direct perpetrators.' Szalai told VOA that Cherif was in the 'middle of the chain of command' in planning the attacks. In the trial, prosecutors called Cherif a 'jihadist through and through' and a 'cornerstone of planning' for the attacks. Cherif was not charged with complicity in the Charlie Hebdo attack. Instead, prosecutors used a broader terrorism claim, according to AFP. 'I feel like I've taken part in a rigged match,' Nabil El Ouchikli, Cherif's defense lawyer, was cited as saying. The decision to sentence Cherif to life in prison was made 'in view of the seriousness of the acts,' the president of the court said at the sentencing. Eight members of Charlie Hebdo’s editorial staff, along with a former journalist visiting their office, a maintenance worker, a police officer and a police bodyguard died in the attack. Kouachi and his brother stormed an editorial meeting and opened fire on the media outlet’s Paris office. It was the largest massacre of media professionals in France since World War II, according to Szalai. The assailants were killed during a gunfight with police on January 9. The 2015 attack stemmed from 'religious intolerance' of journalists and Charlie Hebdo’s work, Szalai said. Attila Mong, from the Committee to Protect Journalists, said that all perpetrators, no matter their level of involvement, should be brought to justice. 'This latest verdict sends an important message to violent extremists that they will not have the last word and their attempts to silence free speech will not prevail,' Mong told VOA in an email. More than 1,600 journalists have been killed since 1993, according to the UNESCO observatory of killed journalists. However, only one in 10 of such cases result in a conviction. Although Szalai called France’s verdict 'good news for press freedom,' he said in most cases of slain journalists they have yet to secure justice. Many times, an intermediary is punished but those higher up in the chain of command are not, he told VOA. He cited the case of Daphne Caruana Galizia, an anti-corruption reporter murdered seven years ago in Malta. In that case, several people have been charged but there has yet to be a trial for the alleged mastermind. Similarly, after the 2018 Slovakia murder of an investigative journalist and his fiancée, those who carried out the attack are in prison but the suspected mastermind has been acquitted twice. The second acquittal is still awaiting a Supreme Court appeal. 'In none of those cases has complete justice been served,' Szalai said.	https://www.voanews.com/a/watchdogs-sentencing-of-jihadi-linked-to-charlie-hebdo-attack-important-verdict-/7813732.html	2024-10-07T13:14:32-07:00	
UN warns of growing tech threat from Southeast Asia’s cyber scam gangs	Bangkok — An ever-expanding array of underground services and the deft uptake of new technologies including artificial intelligence are fueling the continued growth of Southeast Asia’s cyber scam gangs and helping them stay a step ahead of law enforcement, the United Nations said in a new report released Monday. The report said most of the estimated $18 billion to $37 billion lost to cyber scam syndicates last year across East and Southeast Asia were stolen by groups based in the countries of the lower Mekong River. The U.N. calls these countries 'a key testing ground' for cyberfraud groups with a growing global reach in the victims they scam out of their money and the workers they lure into prison-like compounds as forced labor to run their cons. Last year, the U.N. estimated that more than 200,000 people were forced to work in 'scam centers' in Myanmar and Cambodia alone. 'This is ground zero for the scamming industry in terms of innovation, in terms of the way that things develop,' Benedikt Hofmann, the U.N. Office on Drugs and Crime’s deputy representative for Southeast Asia and the Pacific, told VOA ahead of the report’s release. The report details the ways in which the syndicates adopt cryptocurrencies and other new technologies to run their scams and integrate them with the region’s casinos to move their criminal profits around. 'All of this is coming together in basically what is a criminal service economy that’s grown around these scam centers and casinos in the Mekong region. And that’s really been at the core of the growth in this industry that we’ve been seeing,' Hofmann said. Erin West, a deputy district attorney for Santa Clara County, California, agreed. 'Southeast Asia is absolutely the heart of the massive international threat that is coming from scamming worldwide right now,' she said. As part of a task force of local law enforcement agencies focused on advanced tech crime, West has become a leading figure in the fight against cyber scammers. The Mekong countries, she told VOA, are 'where the organized crime syndicates have deliberately placed their compounds and their casino towers because … there are places where they know they can conduct this dirty business without much interference from government.' Besides merely using cryptocurrencies to hide their money moves, the UNODC says the syndicates have a growing and increasingly sophisticated choice of 'high-risk virtual asset service providers' — essentially cryptocurrency exchanges operating with little to no rules on reviewing, recording or reporting who is using them. Perhaps the largest of the syndicates, the UNODC adds, is Huione Guarantee, an online marketplace run by the Huione Group, a sprawling Cambodian conglomerate with ties to the country’s ruling Hun family. Huione Pay, a subsidiary of the group providing a host of currency services, lists Hun To, a cousin of Prime Minister Hun Manet, as a director. Chainalysis, a blockchain analytics firm, recently estimated that Huione Guarantee has processed more than $49 billion in cryptocurrency transactions since 2021. While much of it may be legal, Chainalysis and others have linked millions of dollars worth of transfers to known criminal syndicates including the Lazarus Group, a hacking collective the U.S. says is helping fund North Korea’s weapons program. These analytics firms say many of the merchants using Huione Guarantee make thinly veiled offers of services ripe for criminal exploitation, from mule accounts to digital face altering programs and electric shackles for binding 'runaway dogs,' a reference to scam center workers who try to escape. Huione Group did not immediately reply to VOA’s request for comment on the allegations. Another emerging threat is the scammers’ uptake of artificial intelligence to help write malware programs or generate increasingly convincing deepfakes for video calls. 'It makes things much more complicated for both the law enforcement side but especially the consumer side,' Hofmann said. 'If you receive a video call from someone who you think might be either some official or family member or someone, that’s so many more times more convincing than if you just receive it like a WhatsApp message or some other messenger message out of the blue,' he added. West says she also has seen Southeast Asia’s scammers using more AI to help them do 'exponentially' more with less. 'We’ve seen them using technology to be able to conduct multiple conversations at a time using AI, which limits the need for as many people,' she said. 'It’s scary to realize the access that they have to that kind of technology,' she added. 'They’re consistently way ahead of us in a lot of their craft. They’re just very good at it, and things that we used to be able to exploit, we’re no longer able to exploit because they’ve adapted and gotten better, smarter, faster.' In Southeast Asia, the UNODC report also describes what it calls a 'breakdown' in cooperation among law enforcement agencies across some borders, another weak spot it says the cyberfraud syndicates are exploiting. Despite some successful cases of cross-border cooperation, Hofmann said it remains piecemeal. Colonel Jessada Burinsuchat, superintendent of the Cyber Crime Investigation Bureau of the Royal Thai Police, echoed that view at a forum on cyberfraud in Bangkok last week, organized by the UNODC. 'We have cooperation with all the neighboring countries, but it’s very little when comparing with Thai police [and] USA, China, Japan or Russia. I can say that around Thailand, maybe we have the very least cooperation. It’s not systematic; it’s very individual, and it’s very … inconsistent,' he said. At the same event, Hofmann called out a particularly 'weak link' in Myanmar, where non-state armed groups have for decades controlled autonomous and often crime-riddled enclaves along the country’s porous border with Thailand. Many of those groups have only grown stronger since Myanmar’s military seized control from the country’s elected government in 2021, setting off a civil war that shows no sign of letting up. Given the trends, analysts and experts say the region’s cyberfraud epidemic is likely to worsen before it gets better. 'It’s very clear that an ecosystem has been created that fosters innovation,' said Hofmann, making it ever easier for the scammers to work and harder for law enforcement to fight. 'Based on that,' he added, 'you can just see the scale of this continuing to expand going forward.'	https://www.voanews.com/a/un-warns-of-growing-tech-threat-from-southeast-asia-s-cyber-scam-gangs/7813703.html	2024-10-07T12:48:17-07:00	
Understanding the Mideast conflict: A historical primer	Washington — The Middle East is on the brink. Just days after a massive missile attack on Israel, Iran is threatening more strikes. Israel, already battling Iranian-backed militias on two fronts, is vowing retaliation. The U.S. has deployed thousands of troops to the region. While no one is expecting all-out war, fears of a broader conflict are rising, keeping the region and the world on edge. How did we get here and what happens next? To understand the current crisis, some historical perspective is in order. The roots of the conflict The current confrontation may be between Iran and Israel, but it is part of a much older conflict in the region, with its roots going back to the establishment of the Jewish state in 1948. While historians trace the conflict’s origins even further back, the creation of Israel catalyzed a conflict that still reverberates across the region. Israel emerged from a 1947 U.N. plan to partition then British-controlled Palestine into Jewish and Arab states, with Jerusalem under U.N. administration. The Jewish minority, promised 56% of the land, accepted the plan, but the Arab majority opposed it. And when Israel declared independence the following year, Arab armies from Egypt to Jordan attacked. But Arab hopes of stopping Israel were dashed. Months of fighting led to Israeli victory, enabling it to further expand its control of Palestine. In an historically resonant episode known as 'nakbah,' or catastrophe, some 750,000 Palestinians were displaced, fleeing to Gaza, the West Bank and several Arab countries. An armistice restored peace but the larger conflict remained unresolved. In the decades that followed, the Arabs and Israelis engaged in period clashes and fought three major wars — in 1956, 1967 and 1973. The 1967 Six-Day War changed the region’s map. Israel occupied the remaining Arab territories, including East Jerusalem, the West Bank, and the Gaza Strip, deepening the conflict and leading to decades of fraught negotiations over their status. The 1973 Yom Kippur War began with Egypt and Syria launching a surprise attack on Israel to recover lost territories, drawing in the United States and the Soviet Union. Despite early Arab advances, Israel scored another victory, but the conflict’s dynamics were left unaltered. Changing character of the conflict The Yom Kippur War marked the last battlefield confrontation between Israeli and Arab armies. In 1979, Egypt became the first Arab state to sign a peace treaty with Israel, followed by Jordan in the 1990s and other Arab states followed in recent years through the Abraham Accords negotiated by the former Trump administration. Meanwhile, the nature of the conflict changed. As historian Eugene Rogan has noted, what was once primarily an Israeli-Arab conflict has evolved into more of an Israeli-Palestinian conflict. In the 1970s and early 1980s, Palestinian groups based in Lebanon, primarily the Palestinian Liberation Organization, staged frequent attacks on Israel, prompting Israel's 1982 invasion of Lebanon. The PLO was expelled from the country, but tensions flared up in the West Bank and Gaza, sparking the first Palestinian intifada, or uprising, in 1987. Hamas, an Islamist militant group, emerged out of the uprising. The first intifada culminated in the 1993 Oslo Accords between PLO and Israel. A second intifada broke out in 2000 following the collapse of Camp David peace talks, lasting until 2005 when Israel withdrew from Gaza. Since 2006, Hamas has ruled Gaza, while the Palestinian Authority has governed the West Bank, its influence shrinking in the face of frequent Israeli raids and settler violence. Iran’s regional ambitions Meanwhile, Iran, led by Islamist clerics since 1979, emerged as Israel’s biggest foe, supporting Hamas, Hezbollah and other proxies as part of a so-called 'axis of resistance' designed to counter U.S. and Israeli influence in the region. Except for Hamas and the Palestinian Islamic Jihad, members of the network — armed, trained and funded by the foreign arm of Iran’s Revolutionary Guard Corps — are all Shiite. While sharing Iran’s ideological goals, each pursues its own interests and maintains a degree of autonomy. Hezbollah, which emerged in response to the 1982 Israeli invasion of Lebanon and operates as something of a 'state within a state,' is considered the 'crown jewel' of the proxy network. Both Hamas and Hezbollah have been deeply in politics, with Hezbollah boasting 13 members in Lebanon’s parliament. Nevertheless, in 1997, the U.S. State Department designated both Hezbollah and Hamas as foreign terrorist organizations. Many other countries also label them as terrorist groups, although some apply the designation only to their military wings. Houthi insurgents, another Iranian proxy locked in a decade-long civil war in Yemen, have engaged in missile and drone attacks against U.S. ships and Israel. Washington relisted the Houthis as a Specially Designated Global Terrorist Group in January of this year. Other proxy groups were recruited from outside the region. In Syria, Iran’s Quds Force — a branch of its Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps — operates the Fatemiyoun, a group made up of Afghan refugees, and the Zainebiyoun brigade, made up of Pakistani refugees. James Jeffrey, chair of the Middle East program at the Wilson Center in Washington, holds that a turning point in Iran’s drive for regional influence came after al-Qaida’s Sept. 11, 2001, attacks on the United States. With the U.S. diplomatic and military position in the region weakened, an increasingly bold Iran expanded its influence into four Arab states — Syria, Yemen, Iraq and Lebanon — plus Gaza. October 7 All that changed last October 7 when Hamas launched a surprise terrorist attack on Israel, killing more than 1,200 Israelis and foreign residents and taking hostage more than 200 others. It was the deadliest attack in Israel’s 75-year history. Hamas had crossed a red line. In response, Israel launched a devastating military campaign in Gaza that has so far left more than 40,000 Palestinians dead and nearly 100,000 injured, according to the Gaza Health Ministry, leading to charges of genocide that Israel denies. But Israel didn’t stop there. Under incessant fire from Hezbollah and Houthi rebels as well as some militias in Iraq, Israel began taking the fight to its enemies, targeting Iranian proxies across the region. In April, it bombed an Iranian diplomatic compound in Damascus, killing a top Quds Force commander who served as a liaison between Iran and Hezbollah. In July, Ismail Haniyeh, head of the Hamas political bureau, was killed in a suspected Israeli bombing in Tehran. Then last month Israel ratcheted up its campaign against Hezbollah. First, thousands of hand-held pagers and hundreds of walkie-talkies used by Hezbollah exploded across Lebanon and Syria in two separate attacks, killing dozens and injuring thousands. Then, a massive bombing of a Hezbollah hub south of Beirut that killed Hezbollah leader Hassan Nasrallah and other top leaders. With Hamas and Hezbollah reeling and Iran seen reluctant to take on Israel, the tide seemed to have turned in Israel’s favor. What’s next? Then came Iran’s missile attack on Tuesday, just hours after Israel’s invasion of southern Lebanon. Iran fired nearly 200 ballistic missiles towards Israel and warned of 'crushing' attacks if Israel responded. Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said Iran had made 'a big mistake' and would pay a price. What comes next is anyone’s guess. How Israel responds to the latest Iranian attack and how Iran in turn responds to that will offer clues. A narrowly targeted Israeli attack, like the one in April, could end the exchange. On the other hand, a larger response could trigger a tit for tat, potentially leading to a shooting war. Israel’s stated goal in Lebanon is to push Hezbollah away from the border region so that displaced Israelis can return to their homes. But experts say Israel seems to have a larger goal of neutralizing Hezbollah and other proxies in the region. If Israel succeeds in that, it could enhance its security. But as long as the conflict at the heart of the current crisis — the Palestinian quest for statehood — remains unresolved, peace will be elusive, some experts say. 'This is a mowing the lawn operation, which is Israel’s tactic and it has worked so far except that it doesn’t bring peace,' said Joshua Landis, professor of Middle Eastern studies at the University of Oklahoma.	https://www.voanews.com/a/understanding-the-mideast-conflict-a-historical-primer-/7813577.html	2024-10-07T11:05:08-07:00	
Georgia Supreme Court halts ruling striking down state's near-ban on abortions	savannah, georgia — The Georgia Supreme Court on Monday halted a ruling striking down the state's near-ban on abortions while it considers the state's appeal. The high court's order came a week after a judge found that Georgia unconstitutionally prohibits abortions beyond about six weeks of pregnancy, often before women realize they're pregnant. Fulton County Superior Court Judge Robert McBurney ruled Sept. 30 that privacy rights under Georgia's state constitution include the right to make personal health care decisions. It was one of a wave of restrictive abortion laws passed in Republican-controlled states after the U.S. Supreme Court overturned Roe v. Wade in 2022 and ended a national right to abortion. It prohibited most abortions once a 'detectable human heartbeat' was present. At around six weeks into a pregnancy, cardiac activity can be detected by ultrasound in an embryo's cells that will eventually become the heart. Republican Governor Brian Kemp signed it in 2019, but it didn't take effect until Roe v. Wade fell. McBurney wrote in his ruling that 'liberty in Georgia includes in its meaning, in its protections, and in its bundle of rights the power of a woman to control her own body, to decide what happens to it and in it, and to reject state interference with her healthcare choices.' 'When a fetus growing inside a woman reaches viability, when society can assume care and responsibility for that separate life, then — and only then — may society intervene,' McBurney wrote. The judge's decision rolled back abortion limits in Georgia to a prior law allowing abortions until viability, roughly 22 to 24 weeks into a pregnancy. 'Once again, the will of Georgians and their representatives has been overruled by the personal beliefs of one judge,' Kemp said in a statement in response to McBurney's decision. 'Protecting the lives of the most vulnerable among us is one of our most sacred responsibilities, and Georgia will continue to be a place where we fight for the lives of the unborn.' Abortion providers and advocates in Georgia had applauded McBurney's ruling but expressed concern that it would soon be overturned.	https://www.voanews.com/a/georgia-supreme-court-halts-ruling-striking-down-state-s-near-ban-on-abortions-as-the-state-appeals-/7813565.html	2024-10-07T11:03:33-07:00	
Albanian opposition rallies, seeking technocratic Cabinet before election	Tirana, Albania — Opposition forces in Albania on Monday were holding a nationwide protest in the country's capital demanding that the government be replaced by a technocratic caretaker Cabinet before next year’s parliamentary election. The conservative opposition accuses the leftist government of manipulating earlier voting and of usurping powers, including that of the judiciary. The Democratic Party of former Prime Minister Sali Berisha has been holding protests at the parliament in the last week after one of their colleagues was convicted of slander and imprisoned, which they considered as being politically motivated. Ervin Salianji in 2018 demanded the resignation of the then interior minister over allegations of his brother’s illegal activity that later proved to be fabricated. Salianji, who began serving a one-year sentence more than a week ago, has appealed his conviction to the Supreme Court. The Democrats are asking for a Cabinet made up of technocrats and blaming Prime Minister Edi Rama of the governing leftist Socialist Party of manipulating earlier voting. They have long accused Rama’s Socialists of usurping power, including the judiciary, and have staged violent protests against the government since 2013. The Democrats also call for Berisha’s release from house arrest which he was put under during an investigation of alleged corruption. The opposition has called for civil disobedience, starting the protest with a gathering in front of the main government building, where there will be no speeches, and then extending it by blocking traffic at Tirana’s main intersections. A vehicle tire was burned in front of the presidential office, not far from the main government offices. Hundreds of police officers, equipped with anti-gas masks, have taken up positions to protect the government's main institutions. Police have said that traffic is blocked on many streets in downtown Tirana. The U.S. Embassy in Tirana has warned its citizens to stay away from the protest. Albania holds a parliamentary election next year. The European Union and the United States have urged the opposition to resume dialogue with the government, saying violence won't help the country integrate into the 27-nation bloc. In 2020, the EU decided to launch full membership negotiations with Albania, and later this month Tirana will start discussions with the bloc on how it aligns with the rule of law, functioning of democratic institutions and the fight against corruption.	https://www.voanews.com/a/albanian-opposition-rallies-seeking-technocratic-cabinet-before-election/7813550.html	2024-10-07T11:02:25-07:00	
UN food program helps fight rising cases of malnutrition in Malawi	Chikwawa, Malawi — In Malawi, the U.N.’s World Food Program (WFP) is working to address a rising number of malnourished children amid an ongoing drought, the worst to hit southern Africa in decades. The WFP’s efforts include providing supplementary feeding for children in health facilities and distributing emergency food items to affected households. Malawi has faced food insecurity for the past three years because of natural disasters that also affected other parts of southern Africa. These include Tropical Storm Ana in 2022, Tropical Cyclone Freddy in 2023 and the El Nino weather phenomenon this year, which has led to severe drought in the region. Climate change is also believed to play a part. The WFP says in Malawi, the drought has damaged 44% of crops leaving 5.7 million people without food. This is over a quarter of Malawi’s population. Gertrude Chasafali is among those affected. She said she grows various types of crops including some vegetables but now struggles to find something to eat. Sometimes she eats one meal a day, or none at all. Health experts say the food shortage situation has increased malnutrition cases among vulnerable groups such as pregnant and lactating women, and children under 5 years of age. Feston Katundu is a nutrition officer in the Chikwawa district of southern Malawi, one of the hardest hit areas. 'The prevalence of underweight children is 18%, which is high compared to Malawi as a nation because Malawi is at 13%,' Katundu said. 'For wasting we are also at 5%, while Malawi is [usually] at 3%, meaning that we are not doing well.' Katundu also said 34% of children under the age of 5 in Chikwawa are suffering stunted growth. The situation has forced the WFP to provide supplementary feeding to malnourished children. Paul Turnbull, WFP country director in Malawi, said in recent years the country could manage the situation but now needs help. 'In the last few years, the level of moderate acute malnutrition were possible by the Ministry of Health to manage by itself,' Turnbull said. 'But with [the] increase in number[s] now, we want to be able to ensure that the capacity is there in the Ministry of Health. So, we are supplying additional products and doing training so that children who have got acute moderate malnutrition won’t deteriorate further.' Charles Kalemba, commissioner for the Department of Disaster Management Affairs in Malawi, said another reason the country faces food shortages is because of its dependence on rain-fed agriculture. 'If we can put our act together by moving away from rain-fed agriculture to irrigated agriculture we may solve this problem once and for all,' Kalemba said. In the meantime, the WFP and Malawi’s government are delivering emergency food assistance to millions of Malawians impacted by the drought.	https://www.voanews.com/a/un-food-program-helps-fight-rising-cases-of-malnutrition-in-malawi-/7813508.html	2024-10-07T10:38:57-07:00	
World water resources decreasing as global rivers dry up	GENEVA — Billions of people are facing a future of water scarcity as global rivers dry up, glaciers melt, and intense heat and other extreme weather events caused by climate change create critical changes in water availability around the world, according to the State of Global Water Resources report issued Monday by the World Meteorological Organization. 'Water is the canary in the coal mine of climate change,' said Celeste Saulo, WMO secretary-general. 'Water is the basis of life on this planet, but it can also be a force of destruction.' She told journalists at a briefing in Geneva that 'water is becoming increasingly unpredictable, what we call an erratic hydrological cycle, leading to extreme rainfall, sudden floods, and severe droughts.' 'Climate change is one of the causes of these extreme behaviors,' she said, noting that these extreme events 'wreak a heavy toll on lives, ecosystems and economies.' 'Melting ice and glaciers threaten long-term water security for many millions of people. And yet we are not taking the necessary urgent action,' she warned. 'To mitigate the impact of such potential catastrophes, we must gather reliable data. After all, we cannot appropriately manage what we do not measure,' she said, adding that scientific data gathered by WMO 'indicates the situation will worsen over the coming years.' The report finds 2023 was the driest year for global rivers in 33 years, marking the last of five consecutive years of widespread below-normal conditions for river flows, thereby reducing 'the amount of water available for communities, agriculture and ecosystems, further stressing global water supplies.' It notes that 2023 was also the second consecutive year in which all regions in the world with glaciers reported ice loss, the year in which 'glaciers suffered the largest mass loss ever registered in 50 years.' 'The glaciers are retreating rapidly,' said Stefan Uhlenbrook, WMO director of hydrology, water and cryosphere. 'The latest data for this year actually shows that in the Swiss Alps, at least, it has been continuing and more glaciers have been reduced. 'If a glacier is melting more and more, that means more water becomes available downstream,' he said. 'However, if the glacier is gone in a few more decades, it will be very dramatic because then the summer high flows from the melting glaciers will disappear because there is no storage anymore. 'If the glacier disappears, that changes completely the hydrological regime. It changes completely the conditions for ecosystems. It changes completely the availability of water for farmers. So, it has really severe consequences,' he said. One manifestation of this was seen last week when Switzerland and Italy redrew part of their shared border in the Alps because melting glaciers due to climate change had moved their long-defined national border. The report says 3.6 billion people currently face inadequate access to water at least one month a year, and this is expected to increase to more than 5 billion by 2050. While no region is spared from disastrous hydrological extreme events, it says floods and droughts affected Africa most in terms of human casualties. The report says major flooding in Libya due to two collapsed dams, triggered by Storm Daniel, killed more than 11,000 people. Floods also impacted the Greater Horn of Africa, Democratic Republic of Congo, Rwanda, Mozambique and Malawi. 'Jordan is one of the most water scarce countries because of the high population density and the very arid conditions,' Uhlenbrook observed, adding that many parts of Asia, North and South America, and Russia among other regions are 'very vulnerable to the changes we see from climate change.' 'We see the increasing variability of the hydrological cycle causing tension and stress and providing the source of conflict in many parts of the world,' he said. The WMO report is calling for urgent action and international cooperation to address the scarce water issues. It says cooperation through data sharing and building of trust between nations is critical for managing shared water resources. 'We must fill the gaps in our understanding. We need to expand our hydrological monitoring, especially in regions where data is scarce. We cannot afford blind spots when it comes to our water resources,' WMO chief Saulo said. 'I urge nations to invest in hydrological monitoring and commit to sharing this critical data, because without it, we are navigating without a map.' She underscored the importance of early warning systems in addressing climate-induced disasters such as floods and extreme weather events. 'These global challenges transcend borders and conflicts because water is once again the basis of life on Earth, so we must work together to address the water issues,' she said.	https://www.voanews.com/a/world-water-resources-decreasing-as-global-rivers-dry-up/7813494.html	2024-10-07T10:29:07-07:00	
Laos ASEAN summit to focus on Myanmar crisis	Vientiane, Laos — The failure of Myanmar’s junta to end the country’s violence, allow humanitarian assistance and implement other elements of the Association of Southeast Asian Nations’ 'Five-Point Consensus' will be the focus of ASEAN’s summit this week in Laos. For the first time since the junta seized power three years ago, Myanmar will send a Foreign Ministry official to the summit. But that move has drawn criticism from some human rights groups, NGOs and opponents of the junta inside the country, who have said allowing Myanmar to participate legitimizes the regime. ASEAN’s highest profile 2024 gathering is set for Oct. 8-11 in Vientiane, the capital of Laos. Neither Myanmar’s junta nor Laos’ Ministry of Foreign Affairs would name the junta’s representative to the summit. Myanmar’s shadow government, the National Unity Government (NUG), has called for the junta's exclusion from ASEAN meetings and praised the creation of a group of three countries, consisting of Indonesia, which chaired the bloc last year, Laos and Malaysia, to address the crisis. 'The military council does not represent Myanmar, and no one appointed by them should be invited,' NUG spokesperson, Kyaw Zaw told VOA on Sunday from an undisclosed location due to security concerns. 'If anyone represents Myanmar, it must be the people’s true voice. Over 200 civil organizations have demanded an end to the conflict, and while we’ve supported the Five-Point Consensus, lack of cooperation has blocked progress.' Kyaw Zaw also emphasized the need for urgent international action, including from ASEAN, to hold the junta accountable. 'Myanmar is in a humanitarian crisis with 4 million war refugees and over a million flood victims. ASEAN and the global community must step in effectively,' he said. The Five-Point Consensus is an ASEAN peace plan from 2021 aimed at resolving Myanmar’s crisis, calling for an end to violence, dialogue, and humanitarian aid. However, the junta’s non-compliance has stalled progress, limiting ASEAN’s ability to influence the situation. Civil society demands junta exclusion In an open letter, 237 organizations, consisting of human rights and public-interest and civil society groups across the region, urged ASEAN to exclude Myanmar’s military junta from future meetings, noting the junta’s attendance at over 500 ASEAN meetings since 2021, with little progress toward peace. These groups, led by Defend Myanmar Democracy, a Myanmar human rights international advocacy group, argued that allowing the junta to participate damages ASEAN’s credibility and helps legitimize the regime. Defend Myanmar Democracy spokesperson Naw Aung condemned the decision to allow Myanmar to host a series of ASEAN meetings this month. 'Rewarding the junta disregards the suffering of Myanmar’s people, who are being murdered, raped, and tortured by the regime,' the group said in a statement released on October 3. 'ASEAN is not relevant in this picture because it has yet to establish a clear position,' said Debbie Stothard, founder of the Alternative ASEAN Network on Burma, Altsean, by phone to VOA. Stothard, a human rights advocate in Burma and the ASEAN region for over three decades, has been at the forefront of promoting democracy and accountability in the region. 'We are now witnessing what could be called a second wave of genocide against the Rohingya,' Stothard said. 'Myanmar’s military airstrikes have surged to over 100 per month, yet ASEAN continues to shield an illegal regime.' 'The Five-Point Consensus is no longer relevant,' Stothard added, calling for a focus on the banking system and long-term planning for post-coup in Myanmar. 'We already know from [U.N. special Rapporteur] Tom Andrews’ reports that Thai and Singaporean banks have been involved in transactions which fund war crimes, crimes against humanity, and genocide in Myanmar,' says Stothard. 'If ASEAN banks are found to have done nothing to prevent these activities, they will be in serious trouble.' 'Additionally,' Stothard continued, 'The organization must plan how it will participate in the post-junta transition: how will ASEAN support the resistance to restore the rule of law and help rebuild the economic and social institutions that the junta has destroyed in just under four years?' ASEAN has planned 19 official meetings in Myanmar this month, covering topics from women’s rights to tourism, hosted by junta-controlled ministries in Naypyitaw, the junta’s administrative headquarters. As of now, ASEAN has not provided a specific public explanation for why they are holding 19 meetings in Myanmar. The meetings were announced on ASEAN’s official website as part of the standard procedure for member countries. Broader summit discussions Beyond Myanmar, the summit will include wider, global issues, including the Ukraine-Russia war and the Israel-Hamas conflict. These global tensions are directly affecting ASEAN member states, some of which report citizens caught in the conflicts. On Oct. 11, Laos will pass the ASEAN chairmanship to Malaysia. The new leadership will play a key role in shaping the region’s future, especially with long-term goals such as the ASEAN Community Vision 2045, which prioritizes digital transformation and sustainability.	https://www.voanews.com/a/laos-asean-summit-to-focus-on-myanmar-crisis/7813461.html	2024-10-07T10:15:30-07:00	
Former Taiwan president Tsai Ing-wen heads to Europe this week	Taipei, Taiwan — Taiwan’s former president Tsai Ing-wen kicks off an eight-day trip to the Czech Republic and two other European countries on October 12 – her first international tour since leaving office in May. While China is likely to voice its opposition to the trip, analysts say it highlights the close ties that Taipei has forged with European countries in recent years. China says democratically ruled Taiwan is part of its territory and opposes any formal contacts between Taiwan officials and other nations. In a statement released Monday, Taiwan’s presidential office said current President Lai Ching-te has delegated the National Security Council and Foreign Ministry to carefully plan Tsai’s trip to Europe. Lai also said he hopes her trip will continue to deepen Taiwan’s friendship with Europe and make bilateral relations closer and more solid. In the Czech Republic, Tsai is expected to attend the Forum 2000 and deliver a 10- to 15-minute speech. In addition to Prague, Reuters news agency reported that the former Taiwanese president will also visit France and Belgium, citing anonymous diplomatic sources. The trip will mark a former Taiwanese leader’s first trip to Europe. In response to media reports of her trip, Tsai’s office said her team would publicize her itinerary once it is finalized. The Chinese Foreign Ministry and China’s Taiwan Affairs Office, which handles relations with Taiwan, did not respond to requests for comment on the trip from VOA. Analysts say Tsai’s trip highlights how Europe remains a key focus of Taiwan’s diplomatic efforts. 'Tsai Ing-wen has pursued a strategy of diversification of Taiwan's foreign relations during her eight years of presidency and some of the most tangible results of the strategy are visible in the relations between Taiwan and Europe,' said Marcin Jerzewski, the head of Taiwan Office at the European Values Center for Security Policy. In his view, Tsai’s trip sends a strong signal to European countries that 'Taiwan wants to be seen as a consistent partner for Europe as a whole as well as for individual European countries.' Tsai’s trip follows Taiwanese Vice President Hsiao Bi-Khim’s trip to Europe in March, during which she met with lawmakers from the Czech Republic, Poland, Lithuania, and the European Parliament. It also comes on the heels of renewed trade tensions between the European Union and China, after EU member states backed a proposal to impose tariffs of up to 45% on electric vehicles imported from China. During Tsai’s second term in office, between 2020 and 2024, Taiwan opened an office in Lithuania that used the name 'Taiwanese Representative Office' instead of 'Taipei Economic and Cultural Representative Office' that the democratically ruled island uses in other places. Taiwan deepened trade and investment exchanges with several Central and Eastern European countries, and sent a former foreign minister, Joseph Wu, to the region on several high-profile trips. The Czech Republic is one of the European countries that has significantly deepened its engagement with Taiwan during Tsai’s time in office. Czech President Petre Pavel had a phone call with Tsai after winning the presidential election in January 2023, and Prague has increased the frequency of its parliamentary diplomatic engagement with Taiwan since 2020. Taiwan and the Czech Republic have also collaborated in the efforts to rebuild basic infrastructure in Ukraine since the Russian invasion in 2022, rebuilding schools and basic health care systems across Ukraine. Experts say the fact that Tsai’s stop in Prague has been made public reflects the Czech Republic’s willingness to make its engagement with Taiwan more visible. 'The Czech Republic is the country that’s been the most willing to be loud about their relationship with Taiwan in ways that other European countries probably are not, but that doesn’t mean other countries aren’t willing to maintain good relations with Taiwan,' Lev Nachman, a political scientist at National Taiwan University, told VOA by phone. Some Taiwanese analysts say Tsai’s decision not to disclose the full itinerary of her trip reflects the precaution that current and former Taiwanese officials often have to exercise when planning overseas trips. 'Since China will use different ways to obstruct most Taiwanese politicians’ overseas trips, I think Tsai’s decision not to publicize certain parts of her trip may be a way to reduce the chance of Beijing complicating her trip to Europe,' said Chen Fang-yu, a political scientist at Soochow University in Taiwan. In his view, keeping her itinerary low-key may allow Tsai to have more constructive meetings with European politicians and officials in private. 'Judging from Taiwan’s situation, keeping overseas trips low profile may allow current or former Taiwanese officials to achieve more concrete goals while reducing the chances of the host countries experiencing Chinese retaliation,' Chen told VOA by phone. Despite Tsai’s cautionary approach to planning the trip, Chen still expects Beijing to retaliate against countries that host the former Taiwanese leader. 'Since Beijing often imposes economic sanctions against countries that have friendly interactions with Taiwan or introduce Taiwan-friendly policies, I expect them to respond to Tsai’s Europe trip in similar ways,' he added. Following Taiwanese Vice President Hsiao’s trip to the Czech Republic in March, the Chinese Foreign Ministry said it opposes any official exchanges between Taiwan and its diplomatic allies and urged Prague to 'take effective measures to eliminate the negative impact' of Hsiao’s trip. Since Tsai is no longer in office, Nachman said Tsai’s trip to Europe carries more symbolic importance and won’t deliver too many substantive results. 'Her trip is about reassuring Central and Eastern European countries that Taiwan wants to continue these strong, unofficial relations with them,' he told VOA. While Tsai’s trip is mainly about signaling Taiwan’s desire to prioritize engagement with European countries, Jerzewski said he expects the current Taiwanese government under Tsai’s successor Lai Ching-te to focus on deepening trade and economic relations with Central and Eastern European countries. 'Taiwan’s Foreign Ministry has already begun to recalibrate Taipei’s approach to Europe and since some of the first special industrial zones that the ministry has announced will be in the Czech Republic, this reflects the current Taiwanese government’s approach to prioritize substance in developing relations with European countries,' he told VOA.	https://www.voanews.com/a/former-taiwan-president-tsai-ing-wen-heads-to-europe-this-week/7813427.html	2024-10-07T10:15:06-07:00	
Cameroon says homeless flood victims escaped to Chad as fresh floods ravage camps	Yaounde — Officials in Cameroon say fresh flooding has forced at least 70,000 people out of temporary camps that were set up for flood victims along the country’s northern border with Chad and Nigeria. Some of the displaced flood victims have now moved to neighboring Chad, where at least two million people have been rendered homeless by this year's ceaseless floods according to Chad's government. Kamsouloum Abba Kabir urged flood victims in Kousseri, a town on Cameroon's northern border with Chad, to rush to safety in surrounding schools, mosques and churches. Kamsouloum is a lawmaker representing Kousseri civilians in Cameroon's lower house of parliament. He told civilians in several villages that waters from the Lake Chad basin are overflowing and causing havoc to civilians, animals and the environment. In a video, broadcast on Cameroon state TV on Monday, Kamsouloum, accompanied by Cameroon government officials, said the lives of over 70,000 civilians rendered homeless by recent floods are again threatened by fresh floods sweeping through more villages and camps. Thirty-nine-year old farmer Nogoue Shivom is among the flood victims chased by fresh floods from a camp constructed by the government to temporarily host flood victims. Shivom said floods woke her from her bed in the Kousseri camp for flood victims at about 10 pm on Sunday. She said she was able to save the lives of her three children, but books, food and clothes she was given by a charity organization after the first floods swept through her village were carried away by last night's floods. In September, Cameroon reported that floods had affected over 2 million civilians on its northern border with Chad and rendered over two hundred thousand homeless. The central African state said farm plantations were devastated and cattle, goats, fouls and sheep either killed or swept away by the floods. Cameroon warned of a looming famine and began transferring civilians rendered homeless by floods to several camps including Kousseri. Rebeka, who goes by only one name, is the highest government official in Kousseri. He said by Sunday night, several thousand flood victims fled from their camp and surrounding villages and are seeking refuge in safer places. He said a greater portion of the victims who left the camp have crossed over to Chad's capital N'djamena where they hope to find safety. The Cameroon government reports that about 70,000 flood victims have either crossed into Chad or are seeking refuge in border villages. The government says scores of people have died in the floods but gives no further details. The report comes when Chad's government says it is pleading for international support after floods caused by severe rainfall since July of this year have killed at least 500 people and displaced about 2 million civilians. Chad has not commented on the influx of Cameroon flood victims. It is not the first time Cameroonians have sought refuge in Chad. In 2021, Cameroon reported that at least a hundred thousand civilians fled its northern border to Chad after conflicts over water between cattle ranchers and fishermen killed 40 people and wounded 70. Last month Doctors Without Borders reported that a coordinated and rapid international response is needed to save the lives of thousands of people who have fled floodwaters and are seeking refuge with desperate shortages of food, shelter, drinking water and health care. Cameroon and Chad said last August that the lives of more than 5 million people in the two countries were threatened by a severe humanitarian crisis triggered by climate shocks. The two countries also said the floods will lead to famine and conflicts over food and drinkable water.	https://www.voanews.com/a/cameroon-says-homeless-flood-victims-escape-to-chad-as-fresh-floods-ravage-camps/7813420.html	2024-10-07T09:34:51-07:00	
US targets Hamas with sanctions on anniversary of Gaza war	WASHINGTON — The United States on Monday imposed sanctions on an international Hamas fundraising network, accusing it of playing a critical role in external fundraising for the Palestinian militant group, in action marking the first anniversary of the Gaza war. The U.S. Treasury Department in a statement said it imposed sanctions on three people and what it called a 'sham charity' that it accused of being prominent international financial supporters of Hamas, as well as on the Al-Intaj Bank in Gaza that it said was controlled by the group. Also targeted was a longstanding Hamas supporter, a Yemeni national living in Turkey, and nine of his businesses, Treasury said. 'As we mark one year since Hamas’s brutal terrorist attack, Treasury will continue relentlessly degrading the ability of Hamas and other destabilizing Iranian proxies to finance their operations and carry out additional violent acts,' Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen said in the statement. 'The Treasury Department will use all available tools at our disposal to hold Hamas and its enablers accountable, including those who seek to exploit the situation to secure additional sources of revenue.' In their rampage through Israeli towns and kibbutz villages near the Gaza border a year ago, Hamas-led militants killed some 1,200 people and took about 250 hostages back to Gaza, according to Israeli figures. The huge Israeli security lapse led to the single deadliest day for Jews since the Nazi Holocaust, shattered many citizens' sense of security and sent their faith in its leaders to new lows. The Hamas assault unleashed an Israeli offensive on Gaza that has largely flattened the densely populated enclave and killed almost 42,000 people, Palestinian health authorities say. The Treasury on Monday said: 'Hamas has exploited the suffering in Gaza to solicit funds through sham and front charities that falsely claim to help civilians in Gaza,' adding that as of early this year, the group may have received as much as $10 million a month through such donations. The Treasury said Hamas considers Europe to be a key source of fundraising. Monday's action targeted an Italy-based Hamas member the Treasury said established the sham Charity Association of Solidarity with the Palestinian People, which it accused of helping bankroll Hamas' military wing. Also targeted was a senior Hamas representative in Germany and a Hamas representative in charge of the group's activity in Austria. Hamas is a U.S. designated terrorist group.	https://www.voanews.com/a/us-targets-hamas-with-sanctions-on-anniversary-of-gaza-war-/7813383.html	2024-10-07T09:04:40-07:00	
Spacecraft headed to harmless asteroid slammed by NASA in previous save-the-Earth test	CAPE CANAVERAL, Fla. — A spacecraft blasted off Monday to investigate the scene of a cosmic crash. The European Space Agency's Hera spacecraft rocketed away on a two-year journey to the small, harmless asteroid rammed by NASA two years ago in a dress rehearsal for the day a killer space rock threatens Earth. Launched by SpaceX from Cape Canaveral, it's the second part of a planetary defense test that could one day help save the planet. The 2022 crash by NASA's Dart spacecraft shortened Dimorphos' orbit around its bigger companion, demonstrating that if a dangerous rock was headed our way, there's a chance it could be knocked off course with enough advance notice. Scientists are eager to examine the impact's aftermath up close to know exactly how effective Dart was and what changes might be needed to safeguard Earth in the future. 'The more detail we can glean the better as it may be important for planning a future deflection mission should one be needed,' University of Maryland astronomer Derek Richardson said before launch. Researchers want to know whether Dart — short for Double Asteroid Redirection Test — left a crater or perhaps reshaped the 150-meter (500-foot) asteroid more dramatically. It looked something like a flying saucer before Dart's blow and may now resemble a kidney bean, said Richardson, who took part in the Dart mission and is helping with Hera. Dart's wallop sent rubble and even boulders flying off Dimorphos, providing an extra kick to the impact's momentum. The debris trail extended more than 10,000 kilometers (6,200 miles) into space for months. Some boulders and other debris could still be hanging around the asteroid, posing a potential threat to Hera, said flight director Ignacio Tanco. 'We don't really know very well the environment in which we are going to operate,' said Tanco. 'But that's the whole point of the mission is to go there and find out.' European officials describe the $400 million (363 million euro) mission as a 'crash scene investigation.' Hera 'is going back to the crime site and getting all the scientific and technical information,' said project manager Ian Carnelli. Carrying a dozen science instruments, the small car-sized Hera will need to swing past Mars in 2025 for a gravity boost, before arriving at Dimorphos by the end of 2026. It's a moonlet of Didymos, Greek for twin, a fast-spinning asteroid that's five times bigger. At that time, the asteroids will be 195 million kilometers (120 million miles) from Earth. Controlled by a flight team in Darmstadt, Germany, Hera will attempt to go into orbit around the rocky pair, with the flyby distances gradually dropping from 30 kilometers (18 miles) all the way down to 1 kilometer (a half-mile). The spacecraft will survey the moonlet for at least six months to ascertain its mass, shape and composition, as well as its orbit around Didymos. Before the impact, Dimorphos circled its larger companion from 1,189 meters out. Scientists believe the orbit is now tighter and oval-shaped, and that the moonlet may even be tumbling. Two shoebox-sized Cubesats will pop off Hera for even closer drone-like inspections, with one of them using radar to peer beneath the moonlet's boulder-strewn surface. Scientists suspect Dimorphos was formed from material shed from Didymos. The radar observations should help confirm whether Didymos is indeed the little moon's parent. The Cubesats will attempt to land on the moonlet once their survey is complete. If the moonlet is tumbling, that will complicate the endeavor. Hera may also end its mission with a precarious touchdown, but on the larger Didymos. Neither asteroid poses any threat to Earth — before or after Dart showed up. That's why NASA picked the pair for humanity's first asteroid-deflecting demo. Leftovers from the solar system's formation 4.6 billion years ago, asteroids primarily orbit the sun between Mars and Jupiter in what's known as the main asteroid belt, where millions of them reside. They become near-Earth objects when they're knocked out of the belt and into our neck of the woods. NASA's near-Earth object count currently tops 36,000, almost all asteroids but also some comets. More than 2,400 of them are considered potentially hazardous to Earth.	https://www.voanews.com/a/spacecraft-headed-to-harmless-asteroid-slammed-by-nasa-in-previous-save-the-earth-test/7813346.html	2024-10-07T08:47:52-07:00	
Kosovo lifts ban on entry of products from Serbia at border	PRISTINA, Kosovo — Kosovo's government said Monday it would lift a ban on the entry of products from Serbia at one border crossing, 16 months after it halted imports to prevent what it said could be hidden shipments of weapons for Serb separatists. The reopening is in line with efforts by Western partners to promote reconciliation and cooperation between the two neighboring Balkan nations. Tensions between them flared in May 2023 when Kosovo police seized municipal buildings in Serb-majority communities in northern Kosovo where residents rejected the ethnic Albanian mayors elected in a vote boycotted by Serbs. Kosovo Prime Minister Albin Kurti said the Merdare border crossing would reopen with stepped-up, hands-on monitoring of goods by customs agents at a location just 300 meters from the border. The other five border crossings would open once they can be equipped with new scanners, he said. Kosovo has cited the seizure of four large caches of weapons that Kurti says could have been brought through the border disguised as trade, as well as the movements of troops by Serbia near the border, as reasons for its move in June 2023 to curb cross-border trade. 'These were steps of security, never commercial ones,' Kurti told journalists Monday. Local media in Kosovo have reported that Germany warned Kosovo that unless it reestablished trade it could be excluded from the Central European Free Trade Agreement and the Berlin Process, aimed at boosting cooperation among six western Balkan nations and the European Union. Kosovo was a Serbian province until NATO's 78-day bombing campaign in 1999 ended a war between Serbian government forces and ethnic Albanian separatists in Kosovo, which left about 13,000 dead, mainly ethnic Albanians, and pushed Serbian forces out. Kosovo proclaimed independence in 2008, which Serbia doesn't recognize. The European Union and the United States are pressing both sides to implement agreements that Serbian President Aleksandar Vucic and Kurti reached in February and March last year. They include a commitment by Kosovo to establish an Association of the Serb-Majority Municipalities. Serbia is also expected to deliver on the de-facto recognition of Kosovo, which Belgrade still considers its province. The NATO-led international peacekeepers known as KFOR have increased their presence in Kosovo after last year's tense moments.	https://www.voanews.com/a/kosovo-lifts-ban-on-entry-of-products-from-serbia-at-border-/7813341.html	2024-10-07T08:40:48-07:00	
For US adversaries, Election Day won't mean end to efforts to influence Americans	Washington — Soon, the ballots will be cast, the polls will close and a campaign marked by assassination attempts, animosity and anxiety will come to an end. But for U.S. adversaries, the work to meddle with American democracy may be entering its most critical phase. Despite all the attention on efforts to spread disinformation in the months before the Nov. 5 election, the hours and days immediately after voting ends could offer foreign adversaries like Russia, Iran and China or domestic extremist groups the best chance to mess with America's decision. That's when Americans will go online to see the latest results or share their opinions as the votes are tabulated. And that's when a fuzzy photo or AI-generated video of supposed vote tampering could do its most damage, potentially transforming online outrage into real-world action before authorities have time to investigate the facts. It's a threat taken seriously by intelligence analysts, elected officials and tech executives, who say that while there's already been a steady buildup of disinformation and influence operations, the worst may be yet to come. 'It's not like at the end of election night, particularly assuming how close this election will be, that this will be over,' said Sen. Mark Warner, a Virginia Democrat who chairs the Senate Intelligence Committee. 'One of my greatest concerns is the level of misinformation, disinformation that may come from our adversaries after the polls close could actually be as significant as anything that happens up to the closing of the polls.' Analysts are blunter, warning that a particularly effective piece of disinformation could be devastating to public confidence in the election if spread in the hours after the polls close, and if the group behind the campaign knows to target a particularly important swing state or voting bloc. Possible scenarios include out-of-context footage of election workers repurposed to show supposed fraud, a deepfake video of a presidential candidate admitting to cheating or a robocall directed at non-English speakers warning them not to vote. When a false or misleading claim circulates weeks before the election, there's time for local election officials, law enforcement or news organizations to gather the facts, correct any falsehoods and get the word out. But if someone spreads a deceptive video or photo designed to make a big chunk of the electorate distrust the results the day after the election, it can be hard or even impossible for the truth to catch up. It happened four years ago, when a drumbeat of lies about the 2020 results spurred the Jan. 6, 2021, attack on the U.S. Capitol. Often, those arrested on accusations of trying to interfere with the transfer of power have cited debunked election fraud narratives that circulated shortly after Election Day. An especially close election decided in a handful of swing states could heighten that risk even further, making it more likely that a rumor about suitcases of illegal ballots in Georgia, to cite an example from 2020, could have a big impact on perceptions. President Joe Biden's victory over Donald Trump in 2020 wasn't especially close, and no irregularities big enough to affect the result were found — and yet false claims about vote-rigging were still widely believed by many supporters of the Republican, who's running for president again. The relatively long run-up to Inauguration Day on Jan. 20 gives those looking to sow doubt about the results ample time to do so, whether they are propaganda agencies in Moscow or extremist groups in the U.S. like the Proud Boys. Ryan LaSalle, CEO of the cybersecurity firm Nisos, said he won't feel relief until a new president is sworn in without any serious problems. 'The time to stay most focused is right now through the peaceful transfer of power,' LaSalle said. 'That's when real-life activities could happen, and that's when they would have the greatest chance of having an impact on that peaceful transfer.' Another risk, according to officials and tech companies, is that Russia or another adversary would try to hack into a local or state election system — not necessarily to change votes, but as a way of making voters question the security of the system. 'The most perilous time I think will come 48 hours before the election,' Microsoft President Brad Smith told lawmakers on the Senate Intelligence Committee last month. The hearing focused on American tech companies' efforts to safeguard the election from foreign disinformation and cyberattacks. Election disinformation first emerged as a potent threat in 2016, when Russia hacked into the campaign of Democrat Hillary Clinton and created networks of fake social media accounts to pump out disinformation. The threat has only grown as social media has become a leading source of information and news for many voters. Content designed to divide Americans and make them mistrust their own institutions is no longer tied only to election seasons. Intelligence officials say Russia, China and other countries will only expand their use of online disinformation and propaganda going forward, a long-range strategy that looks beyond any one election or candidate. Despite the challenges, election security officials are quick to reassure Americans that the U.S. election system is impervious to any attack that could alter the outcome of the vote. While influence operations may seek to spread distrust about the results, improvements to the system make it stronger than ever when it comes to efforts to change votes. 'Malicious actors, even if they tried, could not have an impact at scale such that there would be a material effect on the outcome of the election,' Jen Easterly, director of the U.S. Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency, told The Associated Press.	https://www.voanews.com/a/for-us-adversaries-election-day-won-t-mean-end-to-efforts-to-influence-americans-/7813334.html	2024-10-07T08:40:28-07:00	
US Supreme Court rebuffs Biden administration on emergency abortions in Texas	Washington — The U.S. Supreme Court declined on Monday to hear a bid by President Joe Biden's administration to enforce in Texas federal guidance requiring hospitals to perform abortions if needed to stabilize a patient's emergency medical condition. The justices turned away the Justice Department's appeal of a lower court's decision that halted enforcement of the guidance in Texas, where a Republican-backed near-total ban on abortion is in effect, and against members of two anti-abortion medical associations. The Biden administration issued the guidance in July 2022 to protect access to abortion after the Supreme Court's conservative majority the previous month overturned the landmark 1973 Roe v. Wade ruling that had legalized abortion nationwide. The guidance reminded healthcare providers across the country of their obligations under a 1986 federal law called the Emergency Medical Treatment and Labor Act (EMTALA) to ensure Medicare-participating hospitals offer emergency care stabilizing patients regardless of their ability to pay. Medicare is the government healthcare program for the elderly. Hospitals that violate EMTALA risk losing Medicare funding. The guidance made clear that under that law physicians must provide a woman an abortion if needed to resolve a medical emergency and stabilize the patient even in states where the procedure is banned, and that the measure preempts state bans that offer no exceptions for medical emergencies or with exceptions that are too narrow. Texas law prohibits abortions unless the pregnancy places the woman at risk of death or 'substantial impairment of a major bodily function.' Republican-governed Texas and two anti-abortion medical associations - the American Association of Pro-Life Obstetricians & Gynecologists and the Christian Medical & Dental Associations, sued the administration, arguing that the guidance unlawfully purports to compel healthcare providers to perform abortions. U.S. District Judge James Wesley Hendrix in 2022 blocked enforcement of the guidance, finding that it is an unlawful interpretation of the EMTALA statute, and would allow abortions beyond what is permitted by Texas law. The New Orleans-based 5th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals on Jan. 2 upheld Hendrix's decision, ruling that 'EMTALA does not mandate any specific type of medical treatment, let alone abortion.' The 5th Circuit's decision came a month after the top court in Texas ruled against a woman who was seeking an emergency abortion of her non-viable pregnancy. Abortion rights advocates have challenged the scope of abortion ban exceptions in several states due to uncertainty, including among physicians, about what medical emergencies during pregnancy would permit health providers to perform the procedure. In a similar case in June, the Supreme Court permitted, for the time being, abortions to be performed in Idaho when pregnant women are facing medical emergencies. The Supreme Court's 6-3 ruling in the Idaho case revived a federal judge's decision that EMTALA takes precedence over Idaho's Republican-backed near-total abortion ban when the two conflict. While the justices lifted a block they had placed on the judge's ruling in the case, they did not resolve the dispute on its merits, opting instead to dismiss it as 'improvidently granted.'	https://www.voanews.com/a/us-supreme-court-rebuffs-biden-administration-on-emergency-abortions-in-texas/7813261.html	2024-10-07T08:23:22-07:00	
A journey of death': How journalists have spent year covering Israel-Hamas war	Washington/New York — One year has passed since Hamas launched a violent attack on southern Israel, triggering a deadly conflict and an unprecedented number of journalist deaths. Twelve months on, journalists are continuing to navigate how to cover the conflict. When Tareq Hajjaj, a Gaza correspondent for the news website Mondoweiss, ventured into the field to report, he said he sometimes saw Israeli warplanes and drones circling above and worried that he would be killed. 'Every time I was going to do a story to report something, I was feeling that death is so close, like in any second I can be killed,' Hajjaj told VOA from Cairo. The journalist was permitted to leave Gaza for Egypt in April, but he still reports on the war from afar. Founded as a progressive news site, Mondoweiss has faced criticism for what some say are anti-Israel views and an activist approach. 'That was really dangerous to go in the field to report. It was a journey of death every day,' he added. Figures from the Committee to Protect Journalists, or CPJ, reflect that danger. As of October 4, at least 128 journalists and media workers have been killed since the war began on October 7 last year,making the war the deadliest conflict on record for journalists. Journalists in Gaza have borne the brunt of the violence. Of the journalists killed, 123 of them — or about 96% — were Palestinian, according to CPJ. 'They bear the full weight of responsibility of reporting on the impact of the war on Gaza,' CPJ CEO Jodie Ginsberg told VOA in New York. The high rate of killed journalists has raised concerns that the Israeli military is deliberately targeting the media, according to Ginsberg. 'That is particularly worrying because journalists are civilians and must never be targeted in war, and that would constitute a war crime,' she said. Two Israeli journalists and three Lebanese journalists have also been killed since the war began, according to CPJ. The two Israeli journalists were among about 1,200 people killed by Hamas militants in the initial October 7 attack. Hamas also captured about 250 hostages. Israel's counteroffensive in Gaza, meanwhile, has killed more than 41,600 Palestinians, according to Gaza's Health Ministry, which does not distinguish between civilians and combatants. More than 95,000 others have been injured in Israel's bombardments, which have all but reduced the small enclave of Gaza to rubble. In response to a request for comment, Israel's Foreign Ministry referred VOA to the Israel Defense Forces, or IDF. The IDF did not reply to VOA's email requesting comment. Threats to journalist safety — particularly in Gaza — are among the most pressing issues facing reporters as they cover the war, according to media experts. While those in Gaza have found themselves preoccupied with survival, journalists are also tasked with the additional duty of covering and explaining what is happening to local and international audiences. In the past, Hamas has harassed and arrested journalists in Gaza over their reporting, but CPJ has not received any reports of the U.S.-designated terrorist group targeting journalists since the war began. Last year, the Israeli military said it could not guarantee the safety of journalists in Gaza. The military has also said it does not target journalists. But press freedom groups and other analysts aren't convinced. 'It used to be that if you wore an insignia saying you were with the press or you're with television that that would protect you. I think we understand now that wearing that kind of insignia makes you a target,' John Daniszewski, standards editor at The Associated Press, told VOA from New York. Daniszewski added that the war is the most polarizing issue he has covered in his career. 'One side or the other is very concerned that their victimhood is not being centered,' he said. Another issue that makes covering the war more difficult is lack of access, since Israel tightly restricts media access to Gaza. The only way for journalists to enter Gaza is by embedding with the IDF, but those infrequent trips are highly controlled, with journalists seeing only what the Israeli military permits them to see. In early September, the Foreign Press Association, or FPA, in Israel reiterated its calls for the Israeli government to allow increased independent access for journalists in Gaza. 'This is a highly excessive measure that is unprecedented in scale and scope and duration and runs counter to the tenets of democracy and freedom of the press,' former FPA chairperson Dan Perry told VOA about the tight restrictions. Now a Tel Aviv-based columnist, Perry previously worked as the Jerusalem bureau chief for The Associated Press. Restricted media access to Gaza risks hampering international audiences' understanding of what's happening in the territory, according to Ginsberg, and increases the space for misinformation and disinformation to flourish. 'It means that we are not able to necessarily get a full picture of what's happening in Gaza,' she said. A throughline over the past year has also been the Israeli government's targeting of the Qatari news outlet Al Jazeera. In May, the Israeli government shut down the outlet over alleged national security concerns in a move that press freedom groups condemned. Al Jazeera reporters still cannot report from inside Israel. Then in late September, the Israeli military raided Al Jazeera's bureau in the city of Ramallah in the occupied West Bank and forced the bureau to cease operations for at least 45 days. The closure order accuses Al Jazeera of incitement and supporting 'terrorism.' 'The raid on the office and seizure of our equipment is not only an attack on Al Jazeera, but an affront to press freedom and the very principles of journalism,' Al Jazeera said in a statement. During the raid, Israeli soldiers tore down a poster of U.S.-Palestinian Al Jazeera journalist Shireen Abu Akleh, who was shot in the head and killed in 2022 while covering an Israeli army operation in the occupied West Bank. The Israeli military has said the journalist was likely, but unintentionally, shot by an Israeli soldier. No one has been held accountable for her killing. 'The shutdown of Al Jazeera is part and parcel of a much broader attempt by Israel to censor the media,' Ginsberg said. Back in Gaza, one of the biggest challenges that journalists face is the abundance of stories there are to tell, according to Hajjaj. 'There always are more stories that need to be done,' he said. Although about half a year has passed since Hajjaj managed to leave Gaza for Egypt, he says his home never feels that far away. 'Even if my body left Gaza, all my senses are still there,' he said.	https://www.voanews.com/a/a-journey-of-death-how-journalists-have-spent-year-covering-israel-hamas-war/7813161.html	2024-10-07T07:02:39-07:00

Russian court sentences 72-year-old American to nearly 7 years in prison for fighting in Ukraine	MOSCOW — A Russian court on Monday sentenced a 72-year-old American in a closed trial to nearly seven years in prison for allegedly fighting as a mercenary in Ukraine. Prosecutors said Stephen Hubbard signed a contract with the Ukrainian military after Russia sent troops into Ukraine in February 2022 and he fought alongside them until being captured two months later. He was sentenced to six years and 10 months in a general-security prison. Prosecutors had called for a sentence of seven years in a maximum-security prison. Hubbard, from the state of Michigan, is the first American known to have been convicted on charges of fighting as a mercenary in the Ukrainian conflict. The charges carried a potential sentence of 15 years, but prosecutors asked that his age be taken into account along with his admission of guilt, Russian news reports said. Arrests of Americans have become increasingly common in Russia in recent years. Concern has risen that Russia could be targeting U.S. nationals for arrest to use later as bargaining chips in talks to bring back Russians convicted of crimes in the U.S. and Europe. Also on Monday, a court in the city of Voronezh sentenced American Robert Gilman to seven years and 1 month for allegedly assaulting law enforcement officers while serving a sentence for another assault. According to Russian news reports, Gilman was arrested in 2022 for causing a disturbance while intoxicated on a passenger train and then assaulted a police officer while in custody. He is serving a 3 1/2-year sentence on that charge. Last year, he assaulted a prison inspector during a cell check, then hit an official of the Investigative Committee, resulting in the new sentence, state news agency RIA-Novosti said. The U.S. and Russia in August completed their largest prisoner swap in post-Soviet history, a deal involving 24 people, many months of negotiations and concessions from other European countries, which released Russians in their custody as part of the exchange. Several U.S. citizens remain behind bars in Russia following the swap.	https://www.voanews.com/a/russian-court-sentences-a-72-year-old-american-to-nearly-7-years-in-prison-for-fighting-in-ukraine-/7813005.html	2024-10-07T04:31:51-07:00	
US Supreme Court taking the bench with ghost guns, a capital case and transgender rights on the docket	Washington — The U.S Supreme Court is taking the bench again on Monday, ready to hear cases on ghost guns, a death sentence and transgender rights. The docket doesn't have quite as many blockbuster cases as it did last term, when its rulings included an opinion granting broad immunity to former President Donald Trump. Still, it's possible that the conservative-majority court could yet be asked to intervene in election disputes after the ballots are cast in November. The justices also stayed relatively busy during their summer break. The orders they issued on emergency appeals included a refusal to restore President Joe Biden's student loan plan and a partial approval of an Arizona law requiring proof of citizenship to vote. The new term also opens against the backdrop of low public trust in the Supreme Court, and continued debate about whether their newly adopted code of ethics should have an enforcement mechanism. Here's a look at some of the cases coming up: Ghost gun regulations The justices will hear a case Tuesday on regulations for ghost guns, privately made weapons that are hard for police to track because they don't have a serial number. The number of the firearms found at crime scenes has soared in recent years, from fewer than 4,000 in 2018 to nearly 20,000 recovered by law enforcement in 2021, according to Justice Department data. The numbers have been declining in multiple cities since the Biden administration began requiring background checks and age verification for ghost gun kits that can be bought online. But manufacturers and gun rights groups argue that the administration overstepped and the rule should be overturned. Doubts about a death sentence In the decades since Richard Glossip was sentenced to die over a 1997 murder-for-hire scheme, the case has become a rare one where prosecutors are conceding mistakes. Oklahoma's Republican attorney general has joined with Glossip in seeking to overturn his murder conviction and death sentence. Despite those doubts, an Oklahoma appeals court has upheld Glossip's conviction, and the state's pardon and parole board deadlocked in a vote to grant him clemency. The court will hear arguments in his case on Wednesday. Transgender rights Perhaps the court's most closely watched case so far this year is a fight over transgender rights. The case over state bans on gender-affirming care comes as Republican-led states enact a variety of restrictions, including school sports participation, bathroom usage and drag shows. The administration and Democratic-led states have extended protections for transgender people, though Supreme Court has separately prohibited the administration from enforcing a new federal regulation that seeks to protect transgender students. The justices will weigh a Tennessee law that restrict puberty blockers and hormone therapy for transgender minors. The case does not yet have a hearing date, but will likely be argued in December.	https://www.voanews.com/a/us-supreme-court-taking-the-bench-with-ghost-guns-a-capital-case-and-transgender-rights-on-the-docket-/7813001.html	2024-10-07T04:21:55-07:00	
Nobel Prize in medicine honors American duo for their discovery of microRNA	STOCKHOLM — The Nobel Prize in physiology or medicine was awarded Monday to Americans Victor Ambros and Gary Ruvkun for their discovery of microRNA, tiny pieces of genetic material that alter how genes work at the cellular level and could lead to new ways of treating cancer. The Nobel Assembly at the Karolinska Institute, which awarded the prize, said the duo's discovery is 'proving to be fundamentally important' in understanding how organisms develop and function. MicroRNA have opened up scientists' approaches to treating diseases like cancer by helping to regulate how genes work at the cellular level, according to Dr. Claire Fletcher, a lecturer in molecular oncology at Imperial College London. Fletcher said microRNA provide genetic instructions to tell cells to make new proteins and that there were two main areas where microRNA could be helpful: in developing drugs to treat diseases and in serving as biomarkers. 'MicroRNA alters how genes in the cell work,' said Fletcher, who is an outside expert not associated with the Nobel prize. 'If we take the example of cancer, we'll have a particular gene working overtime, it might be mutated and working in overdrive,' she said. 'We can take a microRNA that we know alters the activity of that gene and we can deliver that particular microRNA to cancer cells to stop that mutated gene from having its effect.' Ambros performed the research that led to his prize at Harvard University. He is currently a professor of natural science at the University of Massachusetts Medical School. Ruvkun's research was performed at Massachusetts General Hospital and the Harvard Medical School, where he's a professor of genetics, said Thomas Perlmann, Secretary-General of the Nobel Committee. Perlmann said he spoke to Ruvkun by phone shortly before the announcement. 'It took a long time before he came to the phone and sounded very tired, but he quite rapidly was quite excited and happy, when he understood what it was all about,' Perlmann said. Last year, the Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine went to Hungarian-American Katalin Karikó and American Drew Weissman for discoveries that enabled the creation of mRNA vaccines against COVID-19 that were critical in slowing the pandemic. The prize carries a cash award of ($1 million from a bequest left by the prize's creator, Swedish inventor Alfred Nobel. The announcement launched this year's Nobel prizes award season. Nobel announcements continue with the physics prize on Tuesday, chemistry on Wednesday and literature on Thursday. The Nobel Peace Prize will be announced Friday and the Nobel Memorial Prize in Economic Sciences on Oct. 14. The laureates are invited to receive their awards at ceremonies on Dec. 10, the anniversary of Nobel's death. Fletcher said there are clinical trials ongoing to see how microRNA approaches might help treat skin cancer, but that there aren't yet any drug treatments approved by drug regulators. She expected that might happen in the next five to 10 years. She said microRNA represent another way of being able to control the behavior of genes to treat and track various diseases. 'The majority of therapies we have at the moment are targeting proteins in cells,' she said. 'If we can intervene at the microRNA level, it opens up a whole new way of us developing medicines and us controlling the activity of genes whose levels might be altered in diseases.'	https://www.voanews.com/a/nobel-prize-in-medicine-honors-american-duo-for-their-discovery-of-microrna-/7812998.html	2024-10-07T04:13:11-07:00

Indonesia's Prabowo wants gradual increase in debt-to-GDP, adviser says	Jakarta, Indonesia — Indonesia's President-elect Prabowo Subianto will increase the country's debt-to-GDP ratio level gradually, alongside efforts to boost tax revenues, his top adviser and brother Hashim Djojohadikusumo told a seminar on Monday. The increase may be within a range of 1 to 2 percentage points per year, he said, describing Indonesia's current debt-to-GDP level of under 40% as 'underleveraged.' Investors and rating agencies are closely monitoring Prabowo's fiscal plans after his earlier comments suggesting an appetite for higher debt levels to fund his costly campaign promises triggered concern about potential fiscal slippage. In June, capital outflows hit the rupiah after Bloomberg News reported Prabowo planned to boost the debt-to-GDP ratio to 50% within his five-year term. His advisers subsequently denied this and repeatedly promised Prabowo will comply with Indonesia's fiscal laws limiting the annual budget deficit to a maximum 3% of GDP and debt-to-GDP at 60%. 'Prabowo will not add to national public debt abruptly, [and] not drastically,' Hashim said. 'We will remain prudent, but we will be daring, more aggressive, so we can fulfill our (campaign) promises,' he added. Prabowo's key campaign pledge is to provide free meals to more than 80 million children and pregnant mothers across Indonesia, which is estimated to cost $28.73 billion to implement.	https://www.voanews.com/a/indonesia-s-prabowo-wants-gradual-increase-in-debt-to-gdp-adviser-says/7812882.html	2024-10-06T23:30:58-07:00	
Mexican mayor assassinated days after taking office	MEXICO CITY — The mayor of the capital of Mexico's violence-plagued state of Guerrero was killed on Sunday less than a week after he took office, the state's governor confirmed. Alejandro Arcos was killed just six days after he took office as mayor of the city of Chilpancingo, a city of around 280,000 people in southwestern Mexico. 'His loss mourns the entire Guerrero society and fills us with indignation,' Guerrero Governor Evelyn Salgado said in a statement shared on social media. Guerrero's state attorney general's office said it was investigating his murder. The official confirmation came after photos circulated on the messaging app WhatsApp depicting a severed head on top of a pick-up truck, appearing to be that of Arcos. Reuters could not independently verify the photos' authenticity. Arcos' death comes just three days after the new city government's secretary, Francisco Tapia, was shot to death. 'They were young and honest officials who sought progress for their community,' Senator Alejandro Moreno wrote on social media. Moreno, who is the head of Mexico's PRI political party, called on the federal attorney general's office to lead the investigation into Arcos and Tapia's murders, given 'the situation of ungovernability in Guerrero.' Guerrero has become one of the deadliest states for aspiring and elected public officials, as well as for journalists. At least six candidates for public office were killed in the state in the run-up to Mexico's June 2 elections. Arcos' social media posts show the mayor in recent days had been supervising disaster relief efforts following the impact of Hurricane John last month, which caused severe flooding in the beach resort of Acapulco and surrounding towns.	https://www.voanews.com/a/mexican-mayor-assassinated-days-after-taking-office/7812871.html	2024-10-06T22:50:43-07:00	
Philippines, South Korea upgrade ties to strategic partnership	Manila, Philippines — Philippine President Ferdinand Marcos said on Monday his country and South Korea have upgraded bilateral ties to a strategic partnership, as he met visiting counterpart Yoon Suk Yeol for talks. The two leaders discussed various issues including the South China Sea and situation on the Korean peninsula, as well as signing memorandum of understanding agreements on coast guard cooperation and nuclear energy. Yoon said the two countries would strengthen their partnership on the security front, with South Korea taking part in the modernization program of the Philippine military. The two leaders agreed to uphold an international rules-based order, including on safety of navigation in the South China Sea, Yoon said, adding they agreed that the international community would never condone North Korea's nuclear program or what he called 'reckless provocations.' Yoon will visit Singapore on Oct. 8-9 before heading to Laos the following day, where he will attend the regional summit of leaders of the Association of Southeast Asian Nations and several other Asian countries.	https://www.voanews.com/a/philippines-south-korea-upgrade-ties-to-strategic-partnership/7812868.html	2024-10-06T22:34:05-07:00	
Sao Paulo mayoral vote goes to runoff between center-right incumbent, leftist challenger	SAO PAULO — The race for mayor of Sao Paulo, Latin America's biggest city, will be decided in an Oct. 27 runoff between the center-right incumbent and a leftist lawmaker after they won the top two spots in closely divided voting on Sunday. Despite polls that suggested he lost momentum late in the campaign, Mayor Ricardo Nunes led the first round with 29.5% of the votes in the city of 11.5 million people. In the runoff, he will face federal legislator Guilherme Boulos, who got 29%, official results showed. To avoid a runoff, a candidate would have needed to win more than 50% of the vote. Brazilians on Sunday voted for mayors and city councilors in more than 5,500 municipal elections, shaping the country's political landscape ahead of a 2026 presidential race. The Sao Paulo mayoral race dominated the spotlight after polls showed three candidates virtually tied on the eve of the election. Far-right political novice Pablo Marçal rose from obscurity and got 28.1% of votes. While not enough to make the runoff, the anti-establishment digital influencer surged in the polls with vitriolic attacks on adversaries and divided the conservative vote despite a campaign with little funding and no TV ads. He headlined the news for weeks after a furious fifth-placed candidate hit him with a chair during a debate. 'Watching the debates, there were often things that I didn't expect to happen, like the chair-throwing or the name-calling. I found it a little disrespectful to the public,' voter Joao Victor Caputo said after casting his vote in Sao Paulo. Nunes had the support of former hard-right President Jair Bolsonaro, while Boulos was backed by President Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva. But both national figures were largely absent from the campaign. Candidates close to Lula faced trouble overall as the president's popularity has slipped, but got strong results in the country's two largest cities, Sao Paulo and Rio de Janeiro. Conservatives performed strongly in several major towns. 'As long as democracy exists, the people's right to choose will exist, for better or for worse,' Lula said after casting his vote. 'What we cannot allow to happen is that people vote uninformed.' Lula largely avoided taking to the campaign trail for mayoral candidates, although their success would boost his chances in 2026, when he is expected to run for re-election. Overall, center-right parties fared best along with Bolsonaro's Liberal Party, which attracted support even though the former president was banned from seeking office until 2030 for unfounded attacks on Brazil's voting system. 'The anti-establishment views of the right have become the trend,' said political risk expert Creomar de Souza, noting that Lula likely kept his campaigning to a minimum to avoid being associated with losing candidates. While Bolsonaro endorsed Nunes, the Sao Paulo race posed complicated dynamics for him. The former president appeared to distance himself from Nunes as Marçal grew in the polls. Bolsonaro voted in Rio de Janeiro, where he began his political career. But his favored mayoral candidate Alexandre Ramagem, who led Brazil's spy agency under Bolsonaro, suffered a major defeat. Rio Mayor Eduardo Paes, a Lula ally, won re-election in a landslide, securing 60% of the votes against Ramagem's 31%. 'We had support from people from right to left, progressives and conservatives. This is an example for Brazil,' said centrist Paes, who will take office for his fourth non-consecutive term in January. To win outright in the first round, candidates for mayor of cities of 200,000 voters or more had to gain more than 50% of valid votes.	https://www.voanews.com/a/sao-paulo-mayoral-vote-goes-to-runoff-between-center-right-incumbent-leftist-challenger/7812853.html	2024-10-06T21:12:01-07:00

Massive blast outside Karachi Airport in Pakistan kills 2, injures at least 8	Karachi, Pakistan — A massive blast outside Karachi Airport in Pakistan on Sunday killed two people and injured at least eight, officials said. Police and the provincial government said a tanker exploded outside the airport, which is Pakistan's biggest. But the provincial home minister, Zia Ul Hassan, told local TV station Geo that it was an attack targeting foreigners. A Home Ministry official told The Associated Press that it was an attack on Chinese nationals, one of whom was injured. He spoke on condition of anonymity because he was not authorized to talk to the media. Thousands of Chinese workers are in Pakistan, most of them involved in Beijing's multibillion-dollar Belt and Road Initiative that connects south and central Asia with the Chinese capital. Videos showed flames engulfing cars and a thick column of smoke rising from the scene. There was a heavy military deployment at the site, which was cordoned off. Deputy Inspector General East Azfar Mahesar told media that it seemed like it was an oil tanker explosion. 'We are determining the nature and reasons for the blast. It takes time.' Police officers were among the injured, he added. The home minister and inspector general also visited the blast site, but they did not talk to the press. Rahat Hussain, who works in the civil aviation department, said the blast was so big that it shook the airport's buildings.	https://www.voanews.com/a/massive-blast-outside-karachi-airport-in-pakistan/7812504.html	2024-10-06T15:52:36-07:00

US aviation authority OKs SpaceX Falcon 9 vehicle for Monday flight	Washington — SpaceX's workhorse Falcon 9 rocket can return to flight for a mission planned for Monday to launch the European Space Agency's Hera spacecraft from Florida, the U.S. Federal Aviation Administration said Sunday. Elon Musk's company, which has engaged in a public quarrel with the FAA in recent weeks, said Sunday it is planning the liftoff for 10:52 a.m. ET (1452 GMT) from Cape Canaveral. 'The SpaceX Falcon 9 vehicle is authorized to return to flight only for the planned Hera mission scheduled to launch on Oct. 7 from Cape Canaveral Space Force Station in Florida,' the FAA said Sunday. The agency said it has 'determined that the absence of a second stage reentry for this mission adequately mitigates the primary risk to the public in the event of a recurrence of the mishap experienced with the Crew-9 mission.' The FAA on Sept. 30 said SpaceX must investigate why the second stage of its Falcon 9 malfunctioned after a NASA astronaut mission, grounding the launch vehicle for the third time in three months. The malfunction caused the booster to fall into a region of the Pacific Ocean outside of the designated safety zone that the FAA approved for the mission. Hera is set to study the effects of the 2022 impact that NASA's DART spacecraft had with the asteroid Dimorphos in a test of a planetary defense system — the first time a spacecraft managed to alter the motion of any celestial body. Dimorphos is a moonlet of Didymos, which is defined as a near-Earth asteroid. The Hera mission is expected to provide data for future asteroid deflection missions with an eye toward redirecting objects that could pose a future collision threat for Earth. Falcon 9 launched DART in 2021. The FAA on Sept. 17 proposed fining SpaceX $633,000 for violating agency rules ahead of two 2023 Falcon 9 launches. 'They've been around 20 years, and I think they need to operate at the highest level of safety,' FAA Administrator Mike Whitaker said on Sept. 24. SpaceX took issue with Whitaker's comments, saying the company is the 'safest, most reliable launch provider in the world, and is absolutely committed to safety in all operations.' Whitaker defended the FAA's decision to delay a planned September Starship 5 launch, noting that SpaceX failed to complete a timely sonic boom analysis as required. The FAA has said it does not expect a license determination before late November for that launch. Musk has criticized FAA leaders over the agency's proposed fine and called for Whitaker's resignation. In February 2023, the FAA proposed a $175,000 penalty against SpaceX for failing to submit some safety data to the agency prior to an August 2022 launch of Starlink satellites. The company paid that penalty.	https://www.voanews.com/a/us-aviation-authority-oks-spacex-falcon-9-vehicle-for-monday-flight/7812489.html	2024-10-06T14:43:00-07:00	
Minnesota man arrested after allegedly threatening to 'shoot up' synagogue	Minneapolis, Minnesota — A Minnesota man was arrested after allegedly threatening to 'shoot up' a Minneapolis synagogue, officials announced Saturday. Staff at Temple Israel reported to the Minneapolis Police Department on Sept. 11 that they had received several phone calls from a person threatening to 'shoot up' the synagogue. Then Thursday, a special police detail assigned to provide extra patrols around Temple Israel ahead of the Jewish new year and the one-year anniversary of the Oct. 7 Hamas attack on Israel were notified of a man outside with a firearm. He fled the area, but officers arrested a 21-year-old man the next day. 'Everyone in Minneapolis has the right to feel safe in their communities, and we will ensure our Jewish neighbors are protected as they celebrate the holy days,' Minneapolis Police Chief Brian Chief O’Hara said at a news conference. 'We take all threats made against our religious institutions seriously and will continue to hold the individuals accountable who threaten any of our city’s houses of worship.' O'Hara said officers learned the man had used a phone app to mask his voice as he made repeated threats against the synagogue. Officers did not recover a gun. The man was arrested for making 'terroristic threats' and charges will be referred to the Hennepin County Attorney’s Office. O’Hara said officers had not found evidence the threat was motivated by antisemitism, but he said the timing of the threats was concerning. 'Since the Oct. 7 terrorist attacks, the worst terrorist attack on our Jewish community since the Holocaust, our police officers have been present where a whole lot of hateful rhetoric has been said against our residents, against members of our community, simply because they are Jewish,' O’Hara said.	https://www.voanews.com/a/minnesota-man-arrested-after-allegedly-threatening-to-shoot-up-synagogue/7812484.html	2024-10-06T14:24:08-07:00

Philadelphia Chinatown activists rally to stop development of 76ers arena	Philadelphia, Pennsylvania — Vivian Chang works on a narrow Philadelphia street that would have been consumed by a Phillies stadium had Chinatown activists not rallied to defeat the plan in the early 2000s. Instead of 40,000 cheering fans, the squeals of young children now fill the playground at Folk Arts-Cultural Treasures Charter School, which opened in 2007. 'We’re standing right where the baseball stadium would have been,' Chang said in late September. 'And now it’s 480 students — a lot of immigrants, a lot of students of color from across the city.' Chang, 33, leads Asian Americans United, which flexed its political muscle during the stadium fight and is now experiencing déjà vu as it tries to stop a planned $1.3 billion basketball arena for the Philadelphia 76ers at the other edge of Chinatown. Mayor Cherelle Parker hopes a glitzy, 18,500-seat arena can be the catalyst to revive a distressed retail corridor called Market East, which runs for eight blocks, from City Hall to the Liberty Bell. The plan now moves to city council for debate this fall. Team owners say they need the council’s approval for 76 Place by year’s end so they can move into their new home by 2031. 'I wholeheartedly believe this is the right deal for the people of Philadelphia,' Parker said in announcing her support in September, while pledging to protect what she called 'the best Chinatown in the United States.' Few would deny that Market East needs a savior. But some are less sure it should be the Sixers. Critics fear gridlock on game days and a dark arena at other times, along with gentrification, homogenization and rising rents. Chinatown sits just above Market East and the LGBTQ+ friendly 'Gayborhood' a few blocks below it. 'The arena is a uniquely bad use for that land,' said local activist Jackson Morgan, who fears the Gayborhood could lose its identity. 'It would make Center City virtually unlivable for hours at a time.' Victor Matheson, an economics professor at the College of the Holy Cross who studies stadium issues, said arenas can bring an economic bounce to downtown business districts, but only a limited one. 'They don’t have much of an effect once you get beyond a couple of blocks,' he said. Market East, a once-bustling stretch of historic Market Street, has withered over the last half-century amid a series of cultural shifts: the growth of suburban shopping malls in the 1960s and '70s, the financial crises that crippled U.S. cities in the 1980s, and, more recently, the twin blows of online shopping and the pandemic. And while much of Philadelphia is thriving as more young people settle downtown, Market East has resisted renewal efforts. All but one of its fabled department stores are long gone. Enter the 76ers, owned by Harris Blitzer Sports & Entertainment, who want to shed their Wells Fargo Center lease with Comcast Spectacor and move from the city’s South Philadelphia sports complex to their own facility. The partners, who also own the NHL's New Jersey Devils and have a controlling interest in the NFL’s Washington Commanders, say the project will be privately financed and bring thousands of jobs and more than $2 billion in economic growth to downtown. They also hope to build an adjacent $250 million apartment tower. 'I think the arena is a good thing,' said Dante Sisofo, 28, who lives nearby. 'I could see a lot of families gathering and getting a nice bowl of Vietnamese pho — my favorite dish — and then heading to the game.' Parker shares his optimism and has tried to address concerns by noting the $50 million in local benefits the team has promised, a sum that includes a $3 million loan fund for Chinatown businesses. But others wonder if sports fans would really patronize mom and pop stores. Arenas, they say, are designed to keep fans inside, spending their money on increasingly upscale dining and entertainment. 'The Sixers' owners, they don’t make money by people going to the quaint little sports bar across the street. They make money by having people buy those $14 beers inside the stadium,' Matheson said. The owners have pledged not to ask the city for any construction funding, although they are free to seek state and federal funds. Instead of property taxes, they would pay about $6 million in annual Payments in Lieu of Taxes. Over the 30-year agreement, the potential savings to the team — and loss to the city and its cash-strapped schools — could be tens of millions of dollars or more, by some economists' measure. 'Historically, city officials have been extremely poor poker players when it comes to staring down and bluffing billionaire sports owners,' Matheson said. 'And of course, that’s the exact reason why you have them playing footsie with Camden,' he said, referring to a last-minute flirtation from New Jersey to have the Sixers move across the Delaware River, where the team already has a practice facility, for $400 million in tax breaks. Still, Parker called the deal the best ever struck with a city sports team, given that the three venues in South Philadelphia — the Wells Fargo Center, Citizens Bank Park and Lincoln Financial Field — were all built with huge public subsidies.	https://www.voanews.com/a/chinatown-activists-rally-to-stop-development-of-philadelphia-76ers-arena/7812473.html	2024-10-06T14:00:24-07:00

973 migrants cross Channel into UK on same day 4 die	London — A record 973 migrants crossed the Channel on small boats on the same day in which four died while attempting the journey from France to England, U.K. Home Office figures showed Sunday. The figure for Saturday is the highest single-day number of migrants making the cross-Channel journey this year, surpassing the previous high of 882 set on June 18. On the same day, a two-year-old boy and three adults died after overloaded boats got into trouble during the dangerous crossing attempted by several thousand every year. The tragedies bring the number of migrants who have died attempting Channel crossings this year to 51, according to Jacques Billant, France's prefect for the Pas-de-Calais region. Over 26,600 migrants have crossed the Channel on small boats in 2024 according to U.K. Home Office figures. Saturday’s deaths were likely caused due to the victims being crushed in overloaded dinghies, according to authorities and prosecutors. U.K. Home Secretary Yvette Cooper said Saturday that it was 'appalling that more lives have been lost in the Channel.' 'Criminal smuggler gangs continue to organize these dangerous boat crossings,' she wrote on X, formerly Twitter. 'The gangs do not care if people live or die — this is a terrible trade in lives.' Keir Starmer's new Labour government has been at pains to reduce cross-Channel arrivals in small boats, a key issue in this year's general election in July. The government has repeatedly pledged to 'smash the gangs' of people smugglers who organize the perilous journeys.	https://www.voanews.com/a/record-number-of-migrants-cross-channel-into-uk-on-same-day-4-die/7812399.html	2024-10-06T11:30:24-07:00	
Dutch defense minister pledges $440M for drone action plan with Ukraine	Kyiv, Ukraine — Dutch Defense Minister Ruben Brekelmans said on a surprise visit to Kyiv on Sunday that his country will invest 400 million euros ($440 million) in advanced drone development with Ukraine and deliver more F-16s in the coming months. More than 2-1/2 years since the start of the Russian full-scale invasion, Ukraine is fighting to thwart Russia's troops as they inch forward in the east and attack critical infrastructure ahead of the winter months. 'The war, of course, is intensifying every day, and Ukraine is setting up more brigades who all need support, who all need military equipment. We need to have this continuous flow of support,' Brekelmans told Reuters in Kyiv. The drone action plan will combine Ukraine's innovation and Dutch knowledge to improve technology used on the battlefield, he said. 'We will focus on different types of drones, so both surveillance drones, more defensive drones, but also the attack drones, because we see that Ukraine needs those more offensive drones also to target military facilities,' Brekelmans said. Around half of the investment will be spent in the Netherlands, while the rest will be split between Ukraine and other countries, he added. If the developed drones are successful, more funding will be available to scale up production, according to the defense minister. The Netherlands has pledged 10 billion euros ($11 billion) in military support for Ukraine since the beginning of the Russian invasion and spent around 4 billion euros ($4.4 billion) so far. Air defense After visiting the city of Kharkiv, pummeled by Russian glide bombs Saturday, Brekelmans said attacking military targets in Russia was the only way to defend the city. Ukraine has asked its partners to give it permission to use their weapons to strike targets deep in Russia and provide it with more air defenses. The Netherlands has contributed to its air defense support by driving international partners to supply Ukraine with F-16 jets and pledging 24 of them. The first batch of planes from the Netherlands is already operating in Ukrainian airspace, according to the minister, while the others will be delivered 'in the upcoming months and maybe beginning of next year.' The country is also delivering reserve parts, ammunition and fuel for jets as it seeks to expand pilot training opportunities through meeting with partner countries and private sector players like Lockheed Martin to keep jets operational, he said. The Netherlands has also announced a plan to assemble a Patriot air-defense system for Ukraine relying on parts from different countries, but Brekelmans said it had struggled to source some parts. He said Ukraine was already using one Dutch-supplied Patriot radar and 'three launchers are going to be delivered very soon.'	https://www.voanews.com/a/dutch-defense-minister-pledges-440m-for-drone-action-plan-with-ukraine/7812394.html	2024-10-06T11:09:39-07:00	
Flights at some Iran airports suspended until Monday	Tehran — Iran 's aviation body announced Sunday the cancelation of flights at some of the country's airports, citing 'operational restrictions,' state media reported as Israel vows to retaliate for an Iranian missile strike. Because of those restrictions, 'the flights at some airports of the country will be canceled from 21:00 tonight (1730 GMT), Sunday, October 6, until 6:00 a.m. tomorrow, October 7,' according to IRNA state news agency citing Iran 's Civil Aviation Organization spokesperson, Jafar Yazarloo. Iran on Tuesday launched around 200 missiles in its second direct attack on Israel, in what it said was retaliation for the killing of Tehran-aligned militant leaders in the region, along with a general in Iran 's Revolutionary Guards. Ever since, Israel has said that it will respond to Iran's attack. On Tuesday night, Iran closed its airspace for less than two days until Thursday morning. The aviation body announced then that both domestic and international flights were grounded for security reasons until the reopening. The European Union Aviation Safety Agency has advised European airlines to avoid Iranian airspace until October 31, with the situation under ongoing review.	https://www.voanews.com/a/flights-at-some-iran-airports-suspended-until-monday-/7812374.html	2024-10-06T10:52:49-07:00	
Source: Myanmar junta frees ally of Suu Kyi on health grounds	Yangon — A close ally of detained Myanmar democracy leader Aung San Suu Kyi was granted amnesty by junta authorities as he battles cancer, a party source told AFP on Sunday. Zaw Myint Maung, 72, is a stalwart of Suu Kyi's National League for Democracy (NLD) party that has been a thorn in the side of the military during its decades of rule. He was arrested following the military's latest coup in 2021 and later jailed for corruption. 'He was pardoned because of his health situation today,' a senior NLD source told AFP, requesting anonymity for security reasons. Zaw Myint Maung was in an intensive care unit in Mandalay, where he was battling cancer, the source said. 'His condition is 50-50. We are trying to get more information,' they said. Zaw Myint Maung was a former chief minister of the Mandalay region and was detained shortly after the coup that upended a 10-year experiment with democracy in the Southeast Asian nation. The junta's subsequent crackdown on dissent has decimated the senior ranks of the NLD. Months after the coup Nyan Win, a former NLD spokesperson and Suu Kyi confidante died of COVID-19 while being held in military custody for sedition. In 2022 another former lawmaker was executed by the junta in Myanmar's first use of capital punishment in decades. In March last year the junta dissolved the NLD for failing to re-register under a tough new military-drafted electoral law, removing it from polls it has indicated it may hold in 2025. Suu Kyi, 79, is serving a 27-year prison sentence on charges ranging from corruption to not respecting COVID-19 pandemic restrictions. Rights groups say her closed-door trial was a sham designed to remove her from the political scene. Last month Italian media reported that Pope Francis has offered refuge on Vatican territory to Suu Kyi, who led the government ousted by the military in 2021.	https://www.voanews.com/a/source-myanmar-junta-frees-ally-of-suu-kyi-on-health-grounds/7812324.html	2024-10-06T09:15:23-07:00	
Chinese hackers breached US court wiretap systems, WSJ reports	Reuters — Chinese hackers accessed the networks of U.S. broadband providers and obtained information from systems the federal government uses for court-authorized wiretapping, The Wall Street Journal reported Saturday. Verizon Communications, AT&T and Lumen Technologies are among the telecoms companies whose networks were breached by the recently discovered intrusion, the newspaper said, citing people familiar with the matter. The hackers might have held access for months to network infrastructure used by the companies to cooperate with court-authorized U.S. requests for communications data, the Journal said. It added that the hackers had also accessed other tranches of internet traffic. China's foreign ministry responded Sunday that it was not aware of the attack described in the report but said the United States had 'concocted a false narrative' to 'frame' China in the past. 'At a time when cybersecurity has become a common challenge for all countries around the world, this erroneous approach will only hinder the efforts of the international community to jointly address the challenge through dialog and cooperation,' the ministry said in a statement to Reuters. Beijing has previously denied claims by the U.S. government and others that it has used hackers to break into foreign computer systems. Lumen Technologies declined to comment, while Verizon and AT&T did not immediately respond to requests for comment. The Journal said the attack was carried out by a Chinese hacking group with the aim of collecting intelligence. U.S. investigators have dubbed it 'Salt Typhoon.' Earlier this year, U.S. law enforcement disrupted a major Chinese hacking group nicknamed 'Flax Typhoon,' months after confronting Beijing about sweeping cyber espionage under a campaign named 'Volt Typhoon.' China’s foreign ministry said in its statement that Beijing’s cybersecurity agencies had found and published evidence to show Volt Typhoon was staged by 'an international ransomware organization.'	https://www.voanews.com/a/chinese-hackers-breached-us-court-wiretap-systems-wsj-reports-/7812295.html	2024-10-06T08:41:07-07:00	
Brazilians vote in tense local elections	RIO DE JANEIRO — Brazilians began voting in the first round of local elections Sunday for mayors, deputy mayors and councilors in the country’s 5,569 municipalities. In Sao Paulo, three mayoral candidates are running neck-and-neck, including incumbent Ricardo Nunes, left-wing lawmaker Guilherme Boulos and self-help guru turned far-right politician Pablo Marçal. A runoff is scheduled for Oct. 27. Much of the attention leading up to Sunday’s vote has been on Brazil’s biggest city, where the race has been marred by episodes of violence involving Marçal. Last month, José Luiz Datena, a former TV presenter turned candidate, slammed Marçal with a metal chair during a televised debate following references to allegations of sexual misconduct. In a later debate, an aide to Marçal thumped an adversary’s counterpart, resulting in a bloody face. Marçal sparked more controversy Friday, when he published on social media a falsified medical report indicating cocaine use by Boulos. The document was widely debunked by local media that pointed to inconsistencies including the fact that it was signed by a doctor who had passed away. Boulos, a longtime campaigner for housing rights who is backed by President Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva vehemently denied the veracity of the document. On Saturday, a judge sitting on Sao Paulo’s electoral court ordered the suspension of Marçal’s Instagram account for 48 hours and deemed that there are 'indications of various offenses under the Electoral Code.' Some of former President Jair Bolsonaro ’s political base has been drawn to Marçal, enthralled by his fiery rhetoric, although the far-right leader is supporting Nunes. In Rio de Janeiro, incumbent Eduardo Paes is hoping to avoid a second-round runoff. Polls indicated until recently that was possible. But his principal challenger Alexandre Ramagem has steadily climbed in the polls in recent weeks, rendering the outcome of Sunday’s vote uncertain. Ramagem, the former chief of Brazil’s intelligence agency under Bolsonaro, is being investigated as part of a wider probe into alleged spying on political opponents. He has denied the accusations. Bolsonaro is backing Ramagem, and his ascent in the polls is widely attributed to the former president's campaigning on his behalf. More than 155 million Brazilians are eligible to vote. Forty-three percent of the electorate is in the southeastern region, where Rio and Sao Paulo are located. Women make up around 52% of voters. Nearly 1,000 transgender politicians are running Sunday in every one of Brazil’s 26 states, according to the nation’s electoral court, which is tracking them for the first time. The number of candidacies has tripled since the last local elections four years ago, when trans rights group Antra mapped them. Polls opened at 8 a.m. Brasilia time and close at 5 p.m. (2000 GMT). A second round will be held in municipalities with more than 200,000 registered voters if none of the candidates for mayor obtains an absolute majority.	https://www.voanews.com/a/7812298.html	2024-10-06T08:37:22-07:00	
Pro-Palestinian, pro-Israeli crowds rally globally on eve of Oct. 7 anniversary	Paris — Crowds were participating in pro-Palestinian and pro-Israeli protests and memorial events across the world Sunday on the eve of the first anniversary of the Hamas attacks on Israel. Sunday’s events follow massive rallies that took place Saturday in several European cities, including London, Berlin, Paris and Rome. Other events are scheduled through the week, with an expected peak Monday, the date of the anniversary. In Australia, thousands of people protested Sunday in support of Palestinians and Lebanon in various cities, while a pro-Israeli rally also took place in Melbourne. Samantha Gazal, who came to the rally in Sydney, said she was there 'because I can’t believe our government is giving impunity to a violent extremist nation and has done nothing. ... We’re watching the violence play out on livestream, and they’re doing nothing.' In Melbourne, supporters of Israel held up posters showing Israeli hostages who are still missing. 'We feel like we didn’t do anything to deserve this,' said Jeremy Wenstein, one of the participants. 'We’re just supporting our brothers and sisters who are fighting a war that they didn’t invite.' At a rally in Berlin, near the Brandenburg Gate, hundreds of pro-Israeli demonstrators set off up the famed Unter den Linden behind a banner that read 'Against all antisemitism,' accompanied by a police escort. With many Israel flags waving overhead, some Jewish leaders led a song about 'shalom' — peace — while marchers chanted 'Free Gaza from Hamas!' and 'Bring them home,' referring to hostages still held in the Gaza strip. Some in the crowd held up photos of hostages still held by Hamas. Photos of several women featured the word 'Kidnapped' in German. Memorial events organized by the Jewish community for those killed in the Oct. 7 attack and prayers for those still in captivity were also to be held in Paris and London on Sunday afternoon. Security forces in several countries warned of heightened levels of alert in major cities, amid concerns that the escalating conflict in the Middle East could inspire new terror attacks in Europe or that some of the protests could turn violent. On Sunday, Italy’s Prime Minister Giorgia Meloni expressed her 'full solidarity' with police, the day after security forces used tear gas and water cannons to disperse violent demonstrators in Rome. Meloni firmly condemned clashes between a few pro-Palestinian demonstrators and law enforcement officers, saying it was 'intolerable that dozens of officers are injured during a demonstration.' Thirty police officers and four protesters were hurt in clashes at the pro-Palestinian march in Rome Saturday, local media said. In Rome’s central Piazzale Ostiense, hooded protesters threw stones, bottles and even a street sign at the police, who responded using water cannons and tear gas. Pope Francis, celebrating his Sunday Angelus prayer from the Vatican, issued a new appeal for peace 'on every front.' Francis also urged his audience not to forget the many hostages still held in Gaza, asking for 'their immediate liberation.' The pope called for a day of prayer and fasting for Monday, the first anniversary of the attack. On Oct. 7 last year, Hamas launched a surprise attack into Israel, killing 1,200 Israelis, taking 250 people hostage and setting off a war with Israel that has shattered much of the Hamas-controlled Gaza Strip. More than 41,000 Palestinians have been killed since then in Gaza, according to the Gaza health ministry, which does not differentiate between fighters and civilians. It says more than half were women and children. Nearly 100 Israeli hostages remain in Gaza, with fewer than 70 believed to be alive. Israelis have experienced attacks — missiles from Iran and Hezbollah, explosive drones from Yemen, fatal shootings and stabbings — as the region braces for further escalation. In late September, Israel shifted some of its focus to Hezbollah, which holds much of the power in parts of southern Lebanon and some other areas of the country, attacking the militants with exploding pagers, airstrikes and, eventually, incursions into Lebanon.	https://www.voanews.com/a/pro-palestinian-pro-israeli-crowds-rally-globally-on-eve-of-oct-7-anniversary-/7812257.html	2024-10-06T08:04:02-07:00	
Rwanda begins Marburg vaccinations to curb deadly outbreak	KIGALI — Rwanda said Sunday it had begun administering vaccine doses against the Marburg virus to try to combat an outbreak of the Ebola-like disease in the east African country, where it has so far killed 12 people. 'The vaccination is starting today immediately,' Health Minister Sabin Nsanzimana said at a news conference in the capital Kigali. He said the vaccinations would focus on those 'most at risk, most exposed health care workers working in treatment centers, in the hospitals, in ICU, in emergency, but also [in] the close contacts of the confirmed cases.' The country has already received shipments of the vaccines including from the Sabin Vaccine Institute. Rwanda's first outbreak of the viral hemorrhagic fever was detected in late September, with 46 cases and 12 deaths reported since then. Marburg has a fatality rate as high as 88%. Marburg symptoms include high fever, severe headaches and malaise within seven days of infection and later severe nausea, vomiting and diarrhea. It is transmitted to humans by fruit bats and then spreads through contact with the bodily fluids of those infected. Neighboring Uganda has suffered several outbreaks in the past. 'We believe that with vaccines, we have a powerful tool to stop the spread of this virus,' the minister said.	https://www.voanews.com/a/rwanda-begins-marburg-vaccinations-to-curb-deadly-outbreak/7812263.html	2024-10-06T07:59:07-07:00	
Coco Gauff wins China Open final in straightsets, Sinner rallies to advance in Shanghai	Beijing — Coco Gauff won her second title this season with a lopsided 6-1, 6-3 victory over Karolina Muchova in the final of the China Open on Sunday. Aged 20, the sixth-ranked U.S. player became the youngest China Open champion in 14 years. She is also the second American champion in Beijing, following Serena Williams’ title runs in 2004 and 2013. It was Gauff's eighth career title. She improved her record in tour finals to 8-1 and has a 7-0 record in hard-court finals. Gauff wasted no time and took the opening set in just 31 minutes. She dropped just five points on her first serve and broke Muchova five times. Shanghai Masters Top-ranked Jannik Sinner overcame a one set deficit to rally to a 6-7 (3), 6-4, 6-2 win against Tomas Martin Etcheverry at the Shanghai Masters. A night after winning his 250th career match with a straight-sets victory, the 23-year-old Italian faced a much sterner third-round examination against the No. 37-ranked Argentine under the roof inside Qizhong Forest Sports City Arena that hosted play due to rain. Sinner will next play either No. 16-ranked Ben Shelton, who beat the Italian here last year, or Roberto Carballes Baena of Spain. Etcheverry produced the shot of the night with a stunning drop volley to bring up set point in the first set tiebreak, which he converted to take the lead. Sinner began to better find his range in the second and after trading breaks midway through the set, the Italian found another opportunity to level the match. The momentum was all with Sinner in the third as he broke Etcheverry twice more to advance in 2 hours, 39 minutes. Fifth-ranked Daniil Medvedev also came from behind for a 5-7, 6-4, 6-4 victory against Matteo Arnaldi to book his fourth-round berth against either 12th-ranked Stefanos Tsitsipas or Alexandre Muller. The 28-year-old Medvedev was forced to dig deep to level the match after the Italian took a tight first set. In the deciding set, Medvedev's experience and composure came to the fore as he clinched a vital break in the ninth game and held firm to close out the match in 2 hours, 44 minutes. Second-ranked Carlos Alcaraz, who won the China Open on Wednesday for his fourth title of the year, plays his third round match against Chinese player, Wu Yibing.	https://www.voanews.com/a/coco-gauff-wins-china-open-final-in-straightsets-sinner-rallies-to-advance-in-shanghai/7812247.html	2024-10-06T07:31:54-07:00	
Kazakhstan faces legacy of Soviet weapons testing in nuclear power referendum	Moscow — Polls are open in Kazakhstan Sunday for a landmark referendum on building the country’s first nuclear power plant, confronting the country's painful legacy as a testing ground for Soviet nuclear weapons. The proposal is backed by the government and the country’s president, Kassym-Jomart Tokayev, who hopes to boost the country’s energy security. The plant, which is slated to be built close to Lake Balkhash in Kazakhstan’s southeast, would take pressure off the coal-powered power stations on which the country heavily relies. Although the use of renewable energy is growing, supporters believe Kazakhstan’s position as one of the world’s largest uranium producers makes nuclear energy a logical choice. However, the use of nuclear materials remains a controversial and often sensitive topic in Kazakhstan, which was used as a testing ground for the Soviet Union’s nuclear program. The weapon tests made large swaths of land in the country’s northeastern Semei region uninhabitable, devastating the local environment and affecting the health of nearby residents. In total, 456 tests were carried out between 1949 and 1989 at the Semipalatinsk test site. It was officially closed in August 1991. Critics have also drawn attention to the project’s high costs: The Kazakh government estimates that the nuclear power plant could cost up to $12 billion. Some Kazakhs have sought to protest but have been impeded by authorities. Several anti-nuclear protesters were arrested across Kazakhstan Sunday, while other activists said that permission to hold anti-nuclear rallies on the day of the vote had also been denied by officials in six Kazakh cities. Questions on Russian involvement There are also concerns that Russia’s state atomic agency, Rosatom, could be invited to take part in the plant’s construction at a time when an increasing number of Kazakhs wish to distance themselves from Moscow's influence. Rosatom had previously been named by the government as one of four companies whose reactors could be used for the plant, as well as companies from China, South Korea and France. Tokayev, who has maintained a delicate balancing act between Moscow and the West amid sanctions against Russia, has tried to allay such fears by suggesting that the plant could be built by a multinational team. 'The government must analyze and negotiate,' he told reporters after casting his referendum vote Sunday. 'But my personal vision is that an international consortium of companies with the most advanced technology possible should work together in Kazakhstan.' The result of the referendum is due to be announced Monday.	https://www.voanews.com/a/kazakhstan-faces-legacy-of-soviet-weapons-testing-in-nuclear-power-referendum/7812230.html	2024-10-06T07:01:14-07:00	
Iran's Khamenei decorates commander for Israel attack	Tehran — Iran's supreme leader has decorated the Revolutionary Guards aerospace commander for the Islamic Republic's missile attacks on arch-foe Israel, Ayatollah Ali Khamenei's website said Sunday. 'Ayatollah Khamenei presented the Order of Fath ('Conquest' in Farsi) to General Amir Ali Hajizadeh, commander of the Guards Aerospace Force,' it said. The decoration was bestowed because of what was described as 'the brilliant 'Honest Promise' operation,' according to the website. Hajizadeh, 62, has headed the Guards aerospace unit since its creation in 2009. On Tuesday, the Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps (IRGC) fired some 200 missiles at Israel in retaliation for an Israeli airstrike that killed Hezbollah chief Hassan Nasrallah and IRGC top general Abbas Nilforushan in Beirut. It was Iran's second direct attack on Israel in six months, after a missile and drone assault in April in retaliation for a deadly strike on Iran's consulate in Damascus, which Tehran blamed on Israel. Israel has vowed to respond after Tuesday's Iranian missile attack. The exact nature of that response is still to be determined or seen.	https://www.voanews.com/a/iran-s-khamenei-decorates-commander-for-israel-attack/7812209.html	2024-10-06T06:20:04-07:00	
International rescue teams arrive in Bosnia after devastating floods and landslides	SARAJEVO, Bosnia-Herzegovina — Rescue teams from Bosnia's neighbors and European Union countries on Sunday were joining efforts to clear the rubble and find people still missing from floods and landslides that devastated parts of the Balkan country. Bosnia sought EU help after a heavy rainstorm overnight on Friday left entire areas under water and debris destroyed roads and bridges, killing at least 18 people and wounding dozens. Officials said that at least 10 people are still unaccounted for, many of them in the village of Donja Jablanica, in southern Bosnia, which was almost completely buried in rocks and rubble from a quarry on a hill above. Residents there have said they heard a thundering rumble and saw houses disappear before their eyes. Luigi Soreca, who heads the EU mission in Bosnia, said on X that the EU stands with Bosnia and that teams are arriving to help. Bosnia is a candidate country for membership in the 27-nation bloc. Authorities said Croatian rescuers have already arrived while a team from Serbia is expected to be deployed in the afternoon, followed by a Slovenian team with dogs. Montenegro, North Macedonia, Poland, Czechia and Turkey have also offered help, a government statement said. Sunday is the date of a local election in Bosnia. Election authorities have postponed voting in the flood-hit regions, but the flooding has overshadowed the vote across the country. Ismeta Bucalovic, a resident of Sarajevo, Bosnia's capital, said, 'We are all overwhelmed by these flooding events. We all think only about that.' Impoverished and ethnically divided, Bosnia has struggled to recover after the brutal war in 1992-95. The country is plagued by political bickering and corruption, stalling its EU bid.	https://www.voanews.com/a/international-rescue-teams-arrive-in-bosnia-after-devastating-floods-and-landslides-/7812189.html	2024-10-06T05:52:16-07:00	
Iran's oil minister visits oil export terminal as Israeli strike feared	DUBAI — Iran's oil minister landed on Kharg Island, home to the country's main export terminal, and held talks with a naval commander Sunday, the oil ministry's news website Shana reported, amid concern Israel could attack energy facilities. An Israeli military spokesperson said Saturday that Israel would retaliate in response to last week's missile attack by Tehran 'when the time is right.' U.S. news website Axios cited Israeli officials as saying Iran's oil facilities could be hit, while U.S. President Joe Biden said Friday that he did not think Israel had yet concluded how to respond. Iran is a member of the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC) with production of around 3.2 million barrels per day (bpd), or 3% of global output. Iranian oil exports have climbed this year to near multi-year highs of 1.7 million bpd despite U.S. sanctions. Most of its oil and gas wealth is in the south of the country, where the Kharg Island terminal is situated and from which around 90% of Iranian oil exports are shipped. Oil Minister Mohsen Paknejad arrived Sunday 'to visit the oil facilities and meet operational staff located on Kharg Island,' Shana reported, adding that the oil terminal there has the capacity to store 23 million barrels of crude. State media reported Paknejad met with Mohammad Hossein Bargahi, a Revolutionary Guards Navy commander, to check the security of Iran's South Pars gas platforms and assess the effective actions of the Guards' 4th Naval Region. 'The Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps Navy plays an important role in the security of oil and gas facilities,' Paknejad was quoted as saying. China, which does not recognize U.S. sanctions, is Tehran's biggest oil customer and, according to analysts, imported 1.2 to 1.4 million barrels per day from Iran in the first half of 2024.	https://www.voanews.com/a/iran-s-oil-minister-visits-oil-export-terminal-as-israeli-strike-feared-/7812184.html	2024-10-06T05:45:12-07:00	
Central Thailand braces for inundation as rain stops in flooded Chiang Mai	CHIANG MAI, Thailand — Several provinces in central Thailand braced for floods Sunday after the Irrigation Department announced it was releasing water from a major dam after weeks of frequent heavy rain. The rain stopped in the northern city of Chiang Mai, but many people, especially the elderly, remained cut off by floodwaters that in some areas were waist-high or more. Volunteer rescue teams, often traveling by boat, worked to supply them with food or evacuate them. Further complicating the situation, electricity was cut off in some neighborhoods for safety reasons. Areas popular with tourists, such as the city’s Night Bazaar and Tha Pae Gate, were under as much as a meter of water. Central provinces, including the capital Bangkok, have been warned of possible flooding as the Irrigation Department plans to release water from the Chao Phraya Dam to keep it under capacity. The latest flooding in Chiang Mai began when the Ping River, which runs along the eastern edge of the city, began overrunning its banks on Friday. Flooding is an annual problem in many parts of Thailand during the monsoon season. Concern remained for animals that had been kept in parks and sanctuaries on the outskirts of Chiang Mai. Most of the 125 elephants held at the city's Elephant Nature Park have been led to safety, although some escaped on their own to seek higher ground. Photos in Thai media showed elephants in water so deep that they could barely keep their heads above it. Thai media reported that at least two elephants have been found dead and several more were unaccounted for.	https://www.voanews.com/a/central-thailand-braces-for-inundation-as-rain-stops-in-flooded-chiang-mai-/7812176.html	2024-10-06T05:28:35-07:00	
As affordable housing disappears, states scramble to shore up the losses	Los Angeles — For more than two decades, the low rent on Marina Maalouf’s apartment in a blocky affordable housing development in Los Angeles’ Chinatown was a saving grace for her family, including a granddaughter who has autism. But that grace had an expiration date. For Maalouf and her family it arrived in 2020. The landlord, no longer legally obligated to keep the building affordable, hiked rent from $1,100 to $2,660 in 2021 — out of reach for Maalouf and her family. Maalouf's nights are haunted by fears her yearslong eviction battle will end in sleeping bags on a friend's floor or worse. While Americans continue to struggle under unrelentingly high rents, as many as 223,0000 affordable housing units like Maalouf's across the U.S. could be yanked out from under them in the next five years alone. It leaves low-income tenants caught facing protracted eviction battles, scrambling to pay a two-fold rent increase or more, or shunted back into a housing market where costs can easily eat half a paycheck. Those affordable housing units were built with the Low-Income Housing Tax Credit, or LIHTC, a federal program established in 1986 that provides tax credits to developers in exchange for keeping rents low. It has pumped out 3.6 million units since then and boasts over half of all federally supported low-income housing nationwide. 'It’s the lifeblood of affordable housing development,' said Brian Rossbert, who runs Housing Colorado, an organization advocating for affordable homes. That lifeblood isn’t strictly red or blue. By combining social benefits with tax breaks and private ownership, LIHTC has enjoyed bipartisan support. Its expansion is now central to Democratic presidential candidate Kamala Harris’ housing plan to build 3 million new homes. The catch? The buildings typically only need to be kept affordable for a minimum of 30 years. For the wave of LIHTC construction in the 1990s, those deadlines are arriving now, threatening to hemorrhage affordable housing supply when Americans need it most. 'If we are losing the homes that are currently affordable and available to households, then we’re losing ground on the crisis,' said Sarah Saadian, vice president of public policy at the National Low Income Housing Coalition. 'It’s sort of like having a boat with a hole at the bottom,' she said. Not all units that expire out of LIHTC become market rate. Some are kept affordable by other government subsidies, by merciful landlords or by states, including California, Colorado and New York, that have worked to keep them low-cost by relying on several levers. Local governments and nonprofits can purchase expiring apartments, new tax credits can be applied that extend the affordability, or, as in Maalouf’s case, tenants can organize to try to force action from landlords and city officials. Those options face challenges. While new tax credits can reup a lapsing LIHTC property, they are limited, doled out to states by the Internal Revenue Service based on population. It's also a tall order for local governments and nonprofits to shell out enough money to purchase and keep expiring developments affordable. And there is little aggregated data on exactly when LIHTC units will lose their affordability, making it difficult for policymakers and activists to fully prepare. There also is less of a political incentive to preserve the units. 'Politically, you’re rewarded for an announcement, a groundbreaking, a ribbon-cutting,' said Vicki Been, a New York University professor who previously was New York City’s deputy mayor for housing and economic development. 'You’re not rewarded for being a good manager of your assets and keeping track of everything and making sure that you’re not losing a single affordable housing unit,' she said. Maalouf stood in her apartment courtyard on a recent warm day, chit-chatting and waving to neighbors, a bracelet with a photo of Che Guevarra dangling from her arm. 'Friendly,' is how Maalouf described her previous self, but not assertive. That is until the rent hikes pushed her in front of the Los Angeles City Council for the first time, sweat beading as she fought for her home. Now an organizer with the LA Tenants' Union, Maalouf isn’t afraid to speak up, but the angst over her home still keeps her up at night. Mornings she repeats a mantra: 'We still here. We still here.' But fighting day after day to make it true is exhausting. Maalouf's apartment was built before California made LIHTC contracts last 55 years instead of 30 in 1996. About 5,700 LIHTC units built around the time of Maalouf's are expiring in the next decade. In Texas, it’s 21,000 units. When California Treasurer Fiona Ma assumed office in 2019, she steered the program toward developers committed to affordable housing and not what she called 'churn and burn,' buying up LIHTC properties and flipping them onto the market as soon as possible. In California, landlords must notify state and local governments and tenants before their building expires. Housing organizations, nonprofits, and state or local governments then have first shot at buying the property to keep it affordable. Expiring developments also are prioritized for new tax credits, and the state essentially requires that all LIHTC applicants have experience owning and managing affordable housing. 'It kind of weeded out people who weren’t interested in affordable housing long term,' said Marina Wiant, executive director of California’s tax credit allocation committee. But unlike California, some states haven't extended LIHTC agreements beyond 30 years, let alone taken other measures to keep expiring housing affordable. Colorado, which has some 80,000 LIHTC units, passed a law this year giving local governments the right of first refusal in hopes of preserving 4,400 units set to lose affordability protections in the next six years. The law also requires landlords to give local and state governments a two-year heads-up before expiration. Still, local governments or nonprofits scraping together the funds to buy sizeable apartment buildings is far from a guarantee. Stories like Maalouf's will keep playing out as LIHTC units turn over, threatening to send families with meager means back into the housing market. The median income of Americans living in these units was just $18,600 in 2021, according to the Department of Housing and Urban Development. 'This is like a math problem,' said Rossbert of Housing Colorado. 'As soon as one of these units expires and converts to market rate and a household is displaced, they become a part of the need that’s driving the need for new construction.' 'It’s hard to get out of that cycle,' he said. Colorado's housing agency works with groups across the state on preservation and has a fund to help. Still, it's unclear how many LIHTC units can be saved, in Colorado or across the country. It's even hard to know how many units nationwide are expiring. An accurate accounting would require sorting through the constellation of municipal, state and federal subsidies, each with their own affordability requirements and end dates. That can throw a wrench into policymakers' and advocates' ability to fully understand where and when many units will lose affordability, and then funnel resources to the right places, said Kelly McElwain, who manages and oversees the National Housing Preservation Database. It's the most comprehensive aggregation of LIHTC data nationally, but with all the gaps, it remains a rough estimate. There also are fears that if states publicize their expiring LIHTC units, for-profit buyers without an interest in keeping them affordable would pounce. 'It's sort of this Catch-22 of trying to both understand the problem and not put out a big for-sale sign in front of a property right before its expiration,' Rossbert said. Meanwhile, Maalouf's tenant activism has helped move the needle in Los Angeles. The city has offered the landlord $15 million to keep her building affordable through 2034, but that deal wouldn't get rid of over 30 eviction cases still proceeding, including Maalouf's, or the $25,000 in back rent she owes. In her courtyard, Maalouf's granddaughter, Rubie Caceres, shuffled up with a glass of water. She is 5 years old, but with special needs, her speech is more disconnected words than sentences. 'That’s why I’ve been hoping everything becomes normal again, and she can be safe,' said Maalouf, her voice shaking with emotion. She has urged her son to start saving money for the worst. 'We'll keep fighting,' she said, 'but day by day it's hard.'	https://www.voanews.com/a/as-affordable-housing-disappears-states-scramble-to-shore-up-the-losses-/7812167.html	2024-10-06T05:17:27-07:00	
Pope Francis to appoint 21 new cardinals on Dec. 8	VATICAN CITY — Pope Francis on Sunday announced he will appoint 21 new cardinals of the global Catholic Church, in an unexpected push to influence the powerful group of churchmen that will one day choose his successor. The ceremony to install the new appointees, known as a consistory, will be held on December 8, the 87-year-old pope announced during his weekly noon-time prayer with pilgrims and tourists in St. Peter's Square. It will be the tenth consistory called by the pope since his election 11 years ago as the first pontiff from Latin America. Although popes may choose to appoint cardinals at any time, Francis's decision to make new appointments now comes as something of a surprise. As of the pope's announcement there were 122 cardinals under 80 and able to vote in a future conclave. Church law technically limits the number of such cardinals to 120, but recent popes have frequently gone above that number. Two of the cardinals currently able to vote in a conclave will age out by the end of the year. A further 13 will cross the threshold through the end of 2025. All cardinals, regardless of their age, are allowed to take part in pre-conclave meetings, known as General Congregations, giving them a say in the type of person they think the younger cardinals should choose. Cardinals rank second only to the pope in the Church hierarchy and serve as his closest advisers. Due to their historical power and influence, they are still called the princes of the Church, although Francis has told them not to live like royalty and to be close to the poor.	https://www.voanews.com/a/pope-francis-to-appoint-21-new-cardinals-on-dec-8/7812134.html	2024-10-06T03:55:28-07:00

Macron criticizes Israel on Gaza, Lebanon operations	paris — French President Emmanuel Macron called Saturday for a halt on arms deliveries to Israel for use in Gaza, provoking a sharp response from Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu. He also criticized Netanyahu's decision to send troops into ground operations in Lebanon. 'I think that today, the priority is that we return to a political solution, that we stop delivering weapons to fight in Gaza,' Macron told French broadcaster France Inter. 'France is not delivering any,' he added during the interview, which was recorded Tuesday. Macron reiterated his concern over the conflict in Gaza that is continuing despite repeated calls for a cease-fire. 'I think we are not being heard,' he said. 'I think it is a mistake, including for the security of Israel,' he said, adding that the conflict was leading to 'hatred.' His comments brought a swift response from Netanyahu. 'As Israel fights the forces of barbarism led by Iran, all civilized countries should be standing firmly by Israel's side,' Netanyahu said in a statement issued by his office. 'Yet, President Macron and other Western leaders are now calling for arms embargoes against Israel. Shame on them.' Israel was fighting a war on several fronts against groups backed by arch-foe Iran, the statement added. 'Is Iran imposing an arms embargo on Hezbollah, on the Houthis, on Hamas and on its other proxies? Of course not,' Netanyahu said. All three groups are backed by Tehran and form part of its 'axis of resistance' against Israel. 'This axis of terror stands together. But countries who supposedly oppose this terror axis call for an arms embargo on Israel. What a disgrace!' Netanyahu said Israel would win even without their support. 'But their shame will continue long after the war is won,' he said. 'Rest assured, Israel will fight until the battle is won — for our sake and for the sake of peace and security in the world.' Cease-fire call French President Macron said avoiding an escalation in Lebanon was a 'priority.' 'Lebanon cannot become a new Gaza,' he added. And he returned to the subject Saturday in a speech to a conference of French-speaking nations in Paris. While both Paris and Washington had called for a cease-fire, said Macron, 'I regret that Prime Minister Netanyahu has made another choice, has taken this responsibility, in particular, for ground operations on Lebanese soil.' The 88 members of the International Organization of La Francophonie (OIF), including France and Canada, have called for an 'immediate and lasting' cease-fire in Lebanon, he added. But Macron reaffirmed Israel's right to self-defense and said that Monday he would be meeting relatives of Franco-Israelis held hostage in Gaza. On Monday, Israel marks the first anniversary of the devastating October 7 Hamas attack that sparked the Gaza war and has now engulfed neighboring Lebanon, creating a perilous regional crisis. The attack resulted in the deaths of 1,205 people, mostly civilians, according to an AFP tally based on Israeli official figures. Israel's retaliatory offensive on Gaza has so far killed at least 41,825 people, most of them civilians, according to the health ministry in the Hamas-run Palestinian territory. The U.N. has said those figures are reliable.	https://www.voanews.com/a/macron-criticizes-israel-on-gaza-lebanon-operations-/7812116.html	2024-10-06T01:59:50-07:00

Prospects of peaceful resolution to Congo-Rwanda crisis dim	paris — They did not exchange a glance. Congolese Félix Tshisekedi and Rwandan Paul Kagame were nevertheless a few meters from each other, for the 'family photo' which opened the Francophonie summit, Friday in Villers-Cotterêts north of Paris. The heavy diplomatic and military dispute between their two countries in the east of the Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC), ravaged by decades of violence, remains alive, despite Paris' hopes of seeing them come closer. The DRC, as well as the U.N. group of experts, accuse Rwanda of having deployed troops in support of the M23 ('March 23 Movement'), a predominantly Tutsi rebellion that has seized large swathes of territory in this mineral-rich region since 2021. The idea of a Kagame-Tshisekedi meeting fizzled out. French President Emmanuel Macron, the summit's host, finally spoke separately with his two counterparts to 'encourage' them to conclude a peace agreement 'as soon as possible,' while Angola, the mediator appointed by the African Union, has been trying for months to make progress on this sensitive issue. And the summit almost ended in a clash. At the closing Saturday, Macron called for the 'withdrawal of the M23 and Rwandan troops' from Congolese soil, as Kinshasa is demanding. Tshisekedi had slammed the door of the plenary the day before, angry at the silence of the French president on the situation in the DRC, according to a Congolese government source to AFP. Harmonized plan On the Angolan mediation side, discussions are running into new blockages despite the 'important' compromises obtained recently with a view to a possible peace agreement, starting with the cease-fire agreement signed at the end of July, according to Rwandan and Congolese sources contacted by AFP. Alongside ongoing political discussions, intelligence officials from both countries met in secret several times in August to establish a 'harmonized plan' for ending the crisis, the sources said. This plan, which was spread over four months, consisted for the Congolese to launch operations to 'neutralize' the Democratic Forces for the Liberation of Rwanda (FDLR), to respond to the concerns of Kigali. This rebel group formed by former senior Hutu leaders of the genocide of the Tutsi in Rwanda in 1994, and who have since taken refuge in the DRC, constitutes a permanent threat in the eyes of Kigali. In return, Rwanda gave the green light to 'a disengagement of forces' deployed in the east of the DRC and hostile to Kinshasa. Alas. The progress of the negotiations finally came to a halt on September 14, at the end of yet another meeting between the Rwandan and Congolese foreign ministers Olivier Nduhungirehe and Thérèse Kayikwamba Wagner. Go further The first, questioned by AFP, accuses the DRC of having 'blocked everything' over a matter of timing, 'because the harmonized plan planned to launch operations to neutralize the FDLR on D+25', while the withdrawal of rebel and Rwandan 'forces' was to begin five days later, on D+30. 'The plan proposed was reasonable, it was a good plan,' Nduhungirehe assures. 'The principle that should have been enacted is that of the simultaneity of operations, because it is much more effective,' the Congolese government source told AFP. 'In any case, it is not the military and intelligence experts who ultimately decide, but the political leaders.' At the U.N. on September 25, President Tshisekedi unsurprisingly called on the international community to impose 'targeted sanctions' against Rwanda, insisting that its military presence on Congolese soil is an 'aggression (which) constitutes a major violation of our national sovereignty.' 'Approving this plan would have been politically risky for Tshisekedi, reelected a year ago on a belligerent program towards Kagame and it could have been interpreted by public opinion as a 180-degree turnaround,' explains Onesphore Sematumba, expert for the International Crisis Group (ICG). According to him, 'there will be no purely military solution to the current crisis which has caused a humanitarian catastrophe [with nearly 7 million internally displaced people], it is an illusion.' 'We will have to go much further than the 'harmonized plan,'' he said, and address the issue of mineral resources, the subject of fierce competition, but also political dialogue with the myriad of armed groups present on the ground. In the meantime, the Angolan mediator has proposed a new inter-ministerial meeting on October 12. Both parties assure AFP that they will go.	https://www.voanews.com/a/prospects-of-peaceful-resolution-to-congo-rwanda-crisis-dim/7812109.html	2024-10-06T01:35:52-07:00	
Impossible' for People's Republic of China to be our motherland, Taiwan president says	TAIPEI, Taiwan — It is 'impossible' for the People's Republic of China to become Taiwan's motherland because Taiwan has older political roots, the island's President Lai Ching-te said Saturday. Lai, who took office in May, is condemned by Beijing as a 'separatist.' He rejects Beijing's sovereignty claims, saying that the island is a country called the Republic of China, which traces its origins back to the 1911 revolution that overthrew the last imperial dynasty. The republican government fled to Taiwan in 1949 after losing a civil war with Mao Zedong's communists who set up the People's Republic of China, which continues to claim the island as its 'sacred' territory. Speaking at a concert ahead of Taiwan's national day celebrations on October 10, Lai noted that the People's Republic had celebrated its 75th anniversary on October 1, and in a few days it would be the Republic of China's 113th birthday. 'Therefore, in terms of age, it is absolutely impossible for the People's Republic of China to become the 'motherland' of the Republic of China's people. On the contrary, the Republic of China may be the motherland of the people of the People's Republic of China who are over 75 years old,' Lai added, to applause. 'One of the most important meanings of these celebrations is that we must remember that we are a sovereign and independent country,' he said. China's Taiwan Affairs Office did not answer calls seeking comment outside of office hours. Chinese President Xi Jinping, in a speech on the eve of his country's national day, reiterated his government's view that Taiwan was its territory. Lai, who will give his own keynote national day address on October 10, has needled Beijing before with historical references. Last month, Lai said that if China's claims on Taiwan were about territorial integrity, then it should also take back land from Russia signed over by the last Chinese dynasty in the 19th century.	https://www.voanews.com/a/impossible-for-china-to-be-our-motherland-taiwan-president-says/7812107.html	2024-10-06T01:26:48-07:00	
Tunisia votes with Saied set for reelection	Tunis, Tunisia — Voting began in Tunisia's presidential election on Sunday with no real opposition to incumbent Kais Saied, who is widely tipped to win as his most prominent critics are behind bars. Three years after Said staged a sweeping power grab, the election is seen as a closing chapter in Tunisia's experiment with democracy. The North African country had prided itself for more than a decade for being the birthplace of the Arab Spring uprisings against dictatorship. Polling opened at 8 a.m. and is set to end at 6 p.m. Electoral board ISIE has said preliminary results should come no later than Wednesday but may be known earlier. At one polling station in central Tunis, AFP reporters saw a group of mostly older men lining up to vote. Ahead of polling day, there were no campaign rallies or public debates, and nearly all of the campaign posters in city streets have been of Saied. With little hope for change in a country mired in economic crisis, the mood among much of the electorate has been one of resignation. 'We have nothing to do with politics,' Mohamed, a 22-year-old who gave only his first name for fear of retribution, told AFP in the capital. Neither he nor his friends planned to vote, he said, because they believed it was 'useless.' After rising to power in a landslide in 2019, Saied, now 66, led a sweeping power grab that saw him rewrite the constitution. A burgeoning crackdown on dissent ensued, and a number of Saied's critics across the political spectrum were jailed, sparking criticism both at home and abroad. New York-based Human Rights Watch has said that more than '170 people are detained in Tunisia on political grounds or for exercising their fundamental rights.' Jailed opposition figures include Rached Ghannouchi, head of the Islamist-inspired opposition party Ennahdha, which dominated political life after the revolution. Also detained is Abir Moussi, head of the Free Destourian Party, which critics accuse of wanting to bring back the regime that was ousted in 2011. Little enthusiasm ISIE said about 9.7 million people are expected to turn out, but the near certainty of a Saied win and the country's mounting hardships have inspired little to no eagerness to vote. The International Crisis Group think tank said on Friday that 'the president's nationalist discourse and economic hardship' have 'corroded any enthusiasm ordinary citizens might have felt about the election.' 'Many fear that a new mandate for Saied will only deepen the country's socio-economic woes, as well as hasten the regime's authoritarian drift,' it said. Voters are being presented with almost no alternative after ISIE barred 14 hopefuls from running in the race, citing insufficient endorsements among other technicalities. Hundreds of people protested in the capital on Friday, marching along a heavily policed Habib Bourguiba Avenue as some demonstrators bore signs denouncing Saied as a 'Pharaoh manipulating the law.' Running against him Sunday are former lawmaker Zouhair Maghzaoui, who backed Saied's power grab in 2021, and Ayachi Zammel, a little-known businessman who has been in jail since his bid was approved by ISIE last month. Zammel currently faces more than 14 years in prison on accusations of having forged endorsement signatures to enable him to run in the election. In a speech on Thursday, Saied called for a 'massive turnout to vote' and usher in what he called an era of 'reconstruction.' He cited 'a long war against conspiratorial forces linked to foreign circles,' accusing them of 'infiltrating many public services and disrupting hundreds of projects' under his tenure. The International Crisis Group said that while Saied 'enjoys significant support among the working classes, he has been criticized for failing to resolve the country's deep economic crisis.'	https://www.voanews.com/a/tunisia-votes-with-saied-set-for-reelection/7812102.html	2024-10-06T01:14:22-07:00

Congo starts mpox vaccinations in effort to slow outbreaks	GOMA, Congo — Congolese authorities on Saturday began vaccinations against mpox, nearly two months after the disease outbreak that spread from Congo to several African countries and beyond was declared a global emergency by the World Health Organization. The 265,000 doses donated to Congo by the European Union and the United States were rolled out in the eastern city of Goma in North Kivu province, where hospitals and health workers have been overstretched, struggling to contain the new and possibly more infectious strain of mpox. Congo, with about 30,000 suspected mpox cases and 859 deaths, accounts for more than 80% of all the cases and 99% of all the deaths reported in Africa this year. All the Central African nation's 26 provinces have recorded mpox cases. Although most mpox infections and deaths recorded in Congo are in children under age 15, the doses being administered are only meant for adults and will be given to at-risk populations and frontline workers, Health Minister Roger Kamba said this week. 'Strategies have been put in place by the services in order to vaccinate all targeted personnel,' Muboyayi ChikayaI, the minister's chief of staff, said as he kicked off the vaccination. At least 3 million doses of the vaccine approved for use in children are expected from Japan in the coming days, Kamba said. Mostly undetected for years Mpox, also known as monkeypox, had been spreading mostly undetected for years in Africa before the disease prompted the 2022 global outbreak that saw wealthy countries quickly respond with vaccines from their stockpiles while Africa received only a few doses despite pleas from its governments. However, unlike the global outbreak in 2022 that was overwhelmingly focused in gay and bisexual men, mpox in Africa is now being spread via sexual transmission as well as through close contact among children, pregnant women and other vulnerable groups, Dr. Dimie Ogoina, the chair of WHO's mpox emergency committee, recently told reporters. More than 34,000 suspected cases and 866 deaths from the virus have been recorded across 16 countries in Africa this year. That is a 200% increase compared to the same period last year, the Africa Centers for Disease Control and Prevention said. But access to vaccines remains a challenge. The continent of 1.4 billion people has only secured commitment for 5.9 million doses of mpox vaccines, expected to be available from October through December, Dr. Jean Kaseya, head of the Africa CDC, told reporters last week. Congo remains a priority, he said. Province at risk of outbreak At the vaccination drive in Goma, Dr. Jean Bruno Kibunda, the WHO representative, warned that North Kivu province is at a risk of a major outbreak due to the 'promiscuity observed in the camps' for displaced people, as one of the world's biggest humanitarian crises caused by armed violence unfolds there. The news of the vaccination program brought relief among many in Congo, especially in hospitals that had been struggling to manage the outbreak. 'If everyone could be vaccinated, it would be even better to stop the spread of the disease,' said Dr. Musole Mulambamunva Robert, the medical director of Kavumu Hospital, one of the mpox treatment centers in eastern Congo. Eastern Congo has been beset by conflict for years, with more than 100 armed groups vying for a foothold in the mineral-rich area near the border with Rwanda. Some have been accused of carrying out mass killings.	https://www.voanews.com/a/congo-starts-mpox-vaccinations-in-effort-to-slow-outbreaks/7812086.html	2024-10-06T00:11:34-07:00	
Italy targets climate activists in 'anti-Gandhi' demonstration clampdown	rome — Blocking a road to protest inaction against climate change could soon be punishable with prison in Italy as Prime Minister Giorgia Meloni's hard-right government cracks down on demonstrations, even peaceful ones. A new security law passed by MPs and facing final scrutiny in the Senate has been dubbed the 'anti-Gandhi' law — after pacifist Indian independence hero Mahatma Gandhi — by critics for taking aim at demonstrations by people ranging from prisoners to climate activists. It is specifically aimed at protests of two major infrastructure projects — a high-speed, cross-border Turin-Lyon railway to France and a mooted bridge over the Strait of Messina to Sicily — both championed by Deputy Prime Minister Matteo Salvini. Salvini, who also has responsibility for transport and infrastructure, is a defender of the combustion engine and crusades against 'climate terrorism,' particularly the young members of the Last Generation, a climate group known for headline-grabbing protests. Under the new law, blocking a road outside the authorized route of a demonstration could be punishable by up to two years in prison, up from the current penalty of a fine between 1,000 and 4,000 euros ($1,100 to $4,393). Critics see it as a deliberate attempt to silence dissent by Italy's most right-wing government since the end of World War II. But Salvini, head of the far-right League party, rejected accusations of a 'police state,' insisting: 'Good people have nothing to fear.' Ideological madness Meloni's post-fascist Brothers of Italy party took office in October 2022 after an election victory fueled by anti-immigration, nationalist and populist rhetoric, forming a coalition with the League and the right-wing Forza Italia party. The government has since passed numerous laws and measures designed to please their right-wing base, from legislation limiting the activities of charities that rescue migrants at sea to reinforcing an existing ban on surrogacy and clamping down on juvenile crime. With the security law, 'the government wants to charm the part of society that continues to vote mainly for far-right parties,' many of them older people 'who are much less sensitive to issues of civil rights, the labor crisis and climate change,' said Anna Bonalume, a journalist who closely follows Salvini. Opposition parties are up in arms. 'We have never faced such an attack on democratic civilization such as that brought by the Meloni government,' Giuseppe De Marzo, national coordinator of the Even Numbers Network of civil society groups, told AFP at a recent protest of the bill outside parliament. The opposition Five Star Movement condemned it as a 'deeply oppressive measure that has the explicit intention of intimidating... political and social dissent.' The bill also plans to lift a ban on jailing pregnant women or those with a child under one year old, and to penalize prisoners who protest their conditions. Italy is ranked the sixth-worst European country for prison overcrowding, with 109 inmates for every 100 places, according to the Council of Europe. But the law would make it an offense to demonstrate in a prison, even through 'passive resistance,' such as disobeying an order. On the flip side, the legislation proposes the filming of police interrogations. 'The security bill is a real attack on democracy and the rule of law,' said the Green and Left Alliance. The secretary-general of the center-left More Europe, MP Riccardo Magi, called it 'ideological madness.'	https://www.voanews.com/a/italy-targets-climate-activists-in-anti-gandhi-demonstration-clampdown/7812081.html	2024-10-05T23:54:12-07:00	
Peru celebrates 2 decades of a fast-growing breed of guinea pigs eaten as a delicacy	LIMA, Peru — Peru on Thursday celebrated two decades since the creation of a genetically modified breed of guinea pig, a rodent whose meat has formed a part of the diet of people in the Andean nation for thousands of years. The genetically modified breed of guinea pig — known as cuy locally — is called 'Peru.' It was created in 2004 at the National Institute of Agrarian Innovation, Juan Solórzano, a research zootechnician, said in the middle of one of the institute's farms where thousands of guinea pigs are raised for study. What characterizes the Peru breed is that grows faster, reaching a weight of 1 kilogram in 56 days, rather than the 160 days that was needed before, Solórzano said. 'It is a precocious breed,' said Solórzano. Guinea pigs are native to the Andes Mountains and are raised in Peru, Bolivia, Ecuador and Colombia, areas where the Inca Empire spread almost 500 years ago. There are more than 25 million guinea pigs in Peru, according to official figures. The rodent is so popular in the South American country that authorities have decreed the second Friday of October as National Guinea Pig Day to encourage its consumption. Internal migration from Peru's Andes in the 20th century brought the custom of eating guinea pigs to the country's Pacific coast. 'It is eaten at sporting events or religious festivals. Guinea pig is a festive dish,' Solórzano said. It is also used in ritual healing practices by being rubbed over the body of a sick person. Marina Isabel Briceño, an employee at an air conditioning supply company, said she has eaten guinea pigs since she was a child, calling them a delicacy served at 'special events.' Born in the Cajamarca region, Briceño said that at baptisms the parents often give the godfather and godmother a tray with more than a dozen guinea pigs that have been fried and are 'crispy and ready to eat.' 'I know it is a rodent, a distant relative of rats, but those animals eat garbage, whereas guinea pigs eat something else, tender corn leaves which is why they are tasty,' she said.	https://www.voanews.com/a/peru-celebrates-2-decades-of-a-fast-growing-breed-of-guinea-pigs-eaten-as-a-delicacy/7811313.html	2024-10-05T23:20:28-07:00	
German church is tallest in the world -- until Spain's La Sagrada Familia is done	ULM, Germany — The Ulmer Münster in southern Germany is the world's tallest church. For now, anyway. The Gothic-style Lutheran church's reign — begun in May 31, 1890 — could end in 2025, when La Sagrada Familia Basilica's 'Tower of Jesus Christ' in Spain is set to be completed. At an eventual 172.5 meters high, the Catholic basilica in Barcelona should inch out the Ulmer Münster by a mere 11 meters. But La Sagrada Familia 's construction has taken 142 years and counting. The ultimate completion could come in 2026, 100 years since the death of the original Catalan architect, Antoni Gaudí. Ironically, when the basilica reaches its final height, it will be thanks to a 17-meter cross that was made by a German company. Still, the Ulmer Münster's lead pastor isn't upset. 'I don't find it all that fascinating that it is the highest church tower in the world,' Dean Torsten Krannich told The Associated Press. 'The church also lifts my heart up to God. This is simply a wonderful church that invites you to pray and be thankful.' After all, Ulm will always have Albert Einstein. The physicist was born there in 1879 and lived in Ulm for the first 15 months of his life. His extended family remained, and he returned and climbed the church's tower in 1923. In addition to a stained glass window inside the Ulmer Münster that features Einstein and other famous scientists, the head of communications for Ulm's tourism board is quick to point out that the rest of the city has 'a very high density of art and culture.' 'We can inspire the guests who come here even when we no longer have the highest church in the world, but only have the second-highest,' Dirk Homburg said. The Ulmer Münster's history dates to 1377, when Ulm's citizens decided to demolish their old parish church. Located outside the city gates, it could be a perilous trek for congregants during the frequent wars of the Middle Ages. The residents chose to finance the building of a new one in the city's center themselves, and planned for it to have the highest spire in the world. Construction paused in 1543 when, in the wake of the Protestant Reformation, the city's leaders decided to stop the work amid political and economic turbulence. Building resumed in 1844 and by May 31, 1890, the church was complete. Reaching a record 161.5 meters high, the Ulmer Münster was built deliberately to be taller than the Cologne Cathedral in northwest Germany — which topped out at 157.2 meters in 1880. Although Ulm was destroyed by a World War II bombing raid in 1944, the church itself remained upright. But the Ulmer Münster's age, as well as weather impacts and some 1 million annual visitors, mean that construction and restoration occur constantly amid tourism and religious services. For example, visitors can currently climb 560 stairs to the viewing platform at 102 meters. The platform at 143 meters — 768 stairs — is closed due to stairwell repairs. Krannich said it remains special regardless. 'Whether the tower is now 5 meters higher or 5 meters lower, it doesn't matter to the quality of this church,' he said. Ursula Heckler, a two-time visitor to the church, said she initially journeyed to Ulm in 2019 because she, like many others who trek there, knew it was the world's tallest. She doesn't plan to visit La Sagrada Familia when it takes over. Christos Kalokerinos, a native Ulmer, is unruffled by the looming loss of status. 'There are so many other nice things about the Münster that it's not really relevant,' he said. 'I think most people think that way, too. But of course it was also great to brag a bit about the fact that we have the highest church tower — because many, many people don't necessarily know Ulm that way.' Indeed, there are few indications of the record in the city. The gift shop inside the church just has a fake fireplace labeled 'the world's tallest church,' and the only reference in a tourism store across the street appeared to be a postcard stacking the church's height up against the Great Pyramid of Giza, Big Ben and the Statue of Liberty. All are shorter than the Ulmer Münster. Apparently the region's residents, known as Swabians, 'prefer understatement.' 'They don't want to tell everyone that they're the greatest,' Krannich said. 'Not everyone needs to know. It's enough if we know it.' But next year? 'We're going to involve Albert Einstein a bit more in our marketing,' Homburg said.	https://www.voanews.com/a/german-church-is-tallest-in-the-world----until-spain-s-la-sagrada-familia-is-done/7810099.html	2024-10-05T23:19:53-07:00	
Grammys' revamped voting body is more diverse, with 66% new members	NEW YORK — For years, the Grammy Awards have been criticized over a lack of diversity — artists of color and women left out of top prizes; rap and contemporary R&B stars ignored — a reflection of the Recording Academy's electorate. An evolving voting body, 66% of whom have joined in the last five years, is working to remedy that. At last year's awards, women dominated the major categories; every televised competitive Grammy went to at least one woman. It stems from a commitment the Recording Academy made five years ago: In 2019, the Academy announced it would add 2,500 women to its voting body by 2025. Under the Grammys' new membership model, the Recording Academy has surpassed that figure ahead of the deadline: More than 3,000 female voting members have been added, it announced Thursday. 'It's definitely something that we're all very proud of,' Harvey Mason jr., academy president and CEO, told The Associated Press. 'It tells me that we were severely underrepresented in that area.' Reform at the Record Academy dates back to the creation of a task force focused on inclusion and diversity after a previous CEO, Neil Portnow, made comments belittling women at the height of the #MeToo movement. Since 2019, approximately 8,700 new members have been added to the voting body. In total, there are now more than 16,000 members and more than 13,000 of them are voting members, up from about 14,000 in 2023 (11,000 of which were voting members). In that time, the academy has increased its number of members who identify as people of color by 63%. 'It's not an all-new voting body,' Mason assures. 'We're very specific and intentional in who we asked to be a part of our academy by listening and learning from different genres and different groups that felt like they were being overlooked, or they weren't being heard.' Mason says that in the last five years, the Recording Academy has 'requalified 100% of our members, which is a huge step.' There are voters who have let their membership lapse — and those who no longer qualify to be a voting member have been removed. There have been renewal review processes in the past, but under the current model, becoming a voting member requires proof of a primary career in music, two recommendations from industry peers and 12 credits in a single creative profession, at least five of which must be from the last five years. Comparisons might be made to the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences, which announced in 2016 that it would restrict Oscars voting privileges to active members — ineligible parties included those who haven't worked in three decades since joining the Academy, unless they themselves are nominated — as a response to #OscarsSoWhite criticisms of its lack of diversity. As a result, some members protested that the new measures unjustly scapegoated older academy members. The film academy has also grown its membership, adding more women and people from underrepresented racial and ethnic communities. The Recording Academy sought to increase its voting body by reaching out to different, underrepresented communities, says Mason. 'Let's take the time to understand why those people aren't engaging with us, figure out how we can fix that,' he said. 'And once we fixed it, then let's invite them or ask them if they would like to be a part of our organization. So, it was a multi-step process.' Since 2019, the Recording Academy has also seen growth in voters across different racial backgrounds: 100% growth in AAPI voters, 90% growth in Black voters and 43% growth in Latino voters. Still, Mason sees room to grow. Of the current voting membership, 66% are men, 49% are white and 66% are over the age of 40. 'Going forward, we're going to continue the work. We're going to continue to grow,' he says. That might not look like a public commitment to a specific figure, but Mason promises 'that our goals will be to be the most relevant, the most reflective, the most accurately representative of the music community that is humanly possible.'	https://www.voanews.com/a/grammys-revamped-voting-body-is-more-diverse-with-66-new-members/7811335.html	2024-10-05T23:19:17-07:00	
With daily phone calls, pope offers Gazans encouragement	Rome — Pope Francis is calling for prayer and fasting on October 7, the first anniversary of the start of the ongoing conflict in Gaza. As the death and destruction continue, so too do the daily phone calls from the pope to the Catholic Holy Family Church parish in Gaza City, offering spiritual sustenance to the priests, nuns and parishioners seeking shelter there. At the start of a special synod on October 2 of Catholic clergy, nuns, and laity in Rome, Francis issued a call to prayer and fasting on the anniversary of the Gaza war as the conflict widens in the Middle East. Pope Francis said that the Church is always at the service of humanity 'especially in this dramatic hour of our history, as the winds of war and the fires of violence continue to ravage entire peoples and nations.' The pontiff asked everyone to take part in a day of prayer and fasting for peace in the world on October 7. The Rev. Gabriel Romanelli, the parish priest at the church in Gaza City, told Vatican Radio the pope calls every day to give the people there 'words of comfort and his blessing.' The priest said the pope 'asks us to protect the children and always encourages us to keep going.' Longtime Vatican watcher Francis X. Rocca has covered the Vatican since 2007, most recently for The Wall Street Journal. He told VOA Pope Francis’ daily phone calls to the Gaza parish are unique. 'It is an extraordinary thing to do, especially if you do it every day,' he said. 'For the start of his pontificate, we know that he was making these personal phone calls to various people, sometimes spontaneously, sort of by surprise. But to be doing this regularly, every day, certainly shows a great degree of concern. During the war in Ukraine, he’s also made comments and sent messages and so forth. But I’m not aware that he’s ever done anything like this.' The Holy Family Church is so named because it is believed that Mary, Joseph, and the infant Jesus passed through the coastal territory into Egypt to flee King Herod’s sword in the first century A.D. The church has not escaped the violence of this war between Israel and Hamas. Two Christian women, Nahida Khalil Anton and her daughter, Samar Kamal Anton, were killed last December as they walked to the convent on the parish’s complex. Seven more people were shot and wounded by Israeli gunfire as they 'tried to protect others inside the church compound,' the Latin Patriarchate in Jerusalem reported. Israel Defense Forces officials said they were investigating. Several hundred Palestinians, mainly Christians but also some Muslims, now shelter in the church compound. The Rev. Rifat Bader, director of the Catholic Center for Studies and Media in Jordan, said there are currently three priests and several nuns from both the late Mother Teresa’s order, The Missionaries of Charity, and Sisters of the Incarnate Word ministering in Gaza. He explained to VOA the importance of the pope’s personal calls. 'We cannot forget these personal, human initiatives every day that the pope is keeping— calling the priests and the nuns there to give a daily encouragement,' he said. 'When a priest receives a call from the pope, it is a big thing inside the Catholic Church. You are talking with the successor of Peter. But when this thing is becoming a daily initiative of the pope, really this is a very human touch that the pope is putting inside the minds, the memories, the spirits of these people: priests and community. This is a sign of encouragement, a sign of paternal care of the pope, besides all the diplomatic relations, initiatives.' Bader said that while the Vatican has sought diplomatic efforts for a cease-fire and an end to the conflict, Pope Francis' personal phone calls 'put this human touch in the hearts' of people who have experienced great suffering and are desperate for an end to the war.	https://www.voanews.com/a/with-daily-phone-calls-pope-offers-gazans-encouragement/7810163.html	2024-10-05T23:18:38-07:00

Trump points to new numbers on migrants with criminal pasts. Here's what they show	WASHINGTON — Republicans are pointing to newly released immigration enforcement data to bolster their argument that the Biden administration is letting migrants who have committed serious crimes go free in the U.S. But the numbers have been misconstrued without key context. Immigration and Customs Enforcement released data to Republican Rep. Tony Gonzales in response to a request he made for information about people under ICE supervision either convicted of crimes or facing criminal charges. Gonzales' Texas district includes an 800-mile stretch bordering Mexico. Gonzales posted the numbers online and they immediately became a flashpoint in the presidential campaign between former President Donald Trump, who has vowed to carry out mass deportations, and Vice President Kamala Harris. Immigration — and the Biden administration's record on border security — has become a key issue in the election. Here's a look at the data and what it does or doesn't show: What are the numbers? As of July 21, ICE said 662,556 people under its supervision were either convicted of crimes or face criminal charges. Nearly 15,000 were in its custody, but the vast majority — 647,572 — were not. Included in the figures of people not detained by ICE were people found guilty of very serious crimes: 13,099 for homicide, 15,811 for sexual assault, 13,423 for weapons offenses and 2,663 for stolen vehicles. The single biggest category was for traffic-related offenses at 77,074, followed by assault at 62,231 and dangerous drugs at 56,533. The Department of Homeland Security, which oversees ICE, later clarified that the numbers span decades — including the Trump administration and other presidencies — and that those not in its custody may be detained by a state or local agency. It's a distinction ICE didn't make in its report to Gonzales. 'When we speak of somebody who is not detained, we mean not detained in ICE custody. The individual could be in Folsom State Prison, for example,' Homeland Security Secretary Alejandro Mayorkas said Monday. Millions of people are on ICE's 'non-detained docket,' or people under the agency's supervision who aren't in its custody. Many are awaiting outcomes of their cases in immigration court, including some wearing monitoring devices. Others have been released after completing their prison sentences because their countries won't take them back. What do both sides say about the numbers? Republicans pointed to the data as proof that the Biden administration is letting immigrants with criminal records into the country and isn't doing enough to kick out those who commit crimes while they're here. 'The truth is clear — illegal immigrants with a criminal record are coming into our country. The data released by ICE is beyond disturbing, and it should be a wake-up call for the Biden-Harris administration and cities across the country that hide behind sanctuary policies,' Gonzales said in a news release, referring to pledges by local officials to limit their cooperation with federal immigration authorities. Trump, who has repeatedly portrayed immigrants as bringing lawlessness and crime to America, tweeted multiple screenshots of the data with the words: '13,000 CROSSED THE BORDER WITH MURDER CONVICTIONS.' He also asserted that the numbers correspond to Biden and Harris' time in office. The data was being misinterpreted, Homeland Security said in a statement Sunday. 'The data goes back decades; it includes individuals who entered the country over the past 40 years or more, the vast majority of whose custody determination was made long before this Administration,' the agency said. 'It also includes many who are under the jurisdiction or currently incarcerated by federal, state or local law enforcement partners.' Mayorkas said it was 'unfortunate' the information didn't come with proper explanation, saying that 'lends itself to misinterpretation, either deliberate or otherwise.' The department also stressed what it has done to deport those without the right to stay in America, saying it had removed or returned more than 700,000 people in the past year, which it said was the highest number since 2010. Homeland Security said it had removed 180,000 people with criminal convictions since President Joe Biden took office. What's behind the figures? The data isn't only listing people who entered the country during the Biden administration but includes people going back decades who came during previous administrations, said Doris Meissner, former commissioner of the Immigration and Naturalization Service, which was the predecessor to ICE. They're accused or convicted of committing crimes in America as opposed to committing crimes in other countries and then entering the U.S., said Meissner, who is now director of the U.S. Immigration Policy Program at the Migration Policy Institute. 'This is not something that is a function of what the Biden administration did,' she said. 'Certainly, this includes the Biden years, but this is an accumulation of many years, and certainly going back to at least 2010, 2011, 2012.' A 2017 report by Homeland Security's Office of Inspector General says that as of August 2016, ICE had about 368,574 people on its non-detained docket who were convicted criminals. By June 2021, shortly after Trump left office, that number was up to 405,786. Can't ICE just deport criminals? ICE has limited resources. The number of people it supervises has skyrocketed, while its staffing has not. As the agency noted in a 2023 end-of-year report, it often has to send staff to help at the border, taking them away from their normal duties. The number of people ICE supervises but who aren't in its custody has grown from 3.3 million a little before Biden took office to a little over 7 million last spring. 'The simple answer is that as a system, we haven't devoted enough resources to the parts of the government that deal with monitoring and ultimately removing people who are deportable,' Meissner said. ICE also has logistical and legal limits on who they can hold. Its budget allows the agency to hold 41,500 people at a time. John Sandweg, who was acting ICE director from 2013 to 2014 under then-President Barack Obama, said holding people accused or convicted of the most serious crimes is always the top priority. But once someone has a final order of removal — meaning a court has found that they don't have the right to stay in the country — they cannot be held in detention forever while ICE works out how to get them home. A 2001 Supreme Court ruling essentially prevented ICE from holding those people for more than six months if there is no reasonable chance to expect they can be sent back. Not every country is willing to take back their citizens, Sandweg said. He said he suspects that a large number of those convicted of homicide but not held by ICE are people who were ordered deported but the agency can't remove them because their home country won't take them back. 'It's a very common scenario. Even amongst the countries that take people back, they can be very selective about who they take back,' he said. The U.S. also could run into problems deporting people to countries with which it has tepid relations. Homeland Security did not respond to questions about how many countries won't take back their citizens. The 2017 watchdog report put the number at 23 countries, plus an additional 62 that were cooperative but where there were delays getting things like passports or travel documents.	https://www.voanews.com/a/trump-points-to-new-numbers-on-migrants-with-criminal-pasts-here-s-what-they-show-/7810034.html	2024-10-05T23:17:24-07:00	
In South Korea, deepfake porn wrecks women's lives, deepens gender conflict	SEOUL, South Korea — Three years after the 30-year-old South Korean woman received a barrage of online fake images that depicted her nude, she is still being treated for trauma. She struggles to talk with men. Using a mobile phone brings back the nightmare. 'It completely trampled me, even though it wasn't a direct physical attack on my body,' she said in a phone interview with The Associated Press. She didn't want her name revealed because of privacy concerns. Many other South Korean women recently have come forward to share similar stories as South Korea grapples with a deluge of non-consensual, explicit deepfake videos and images that have become much more accessible and easier to create. It was not until last week that parliament revised a law to make watching or possessing deepfake porn content illegal. Most suspected perpetrators in South Korea are teenage boys. Observers say the boys target female friends, relatives and acquaintances — also mostly minors — as a prank, out of curiosity or misogyny. The attacks raise serious questions about school programs but also threaten to worsen an already troubled divide between men and women. Deepfake porn in South Korea gained attention after unconfirmed lists of schools that had victims spread online in August. Many girls and women have hastily removed photos and videos from their Instagram, Facebook and other social media accounts. Thousands of young women have staged protests demanding stronger steps against deepfake porn. Politicians, academics and activists have held forums. 'Teenage (girls) must be feeling uneasy about whether their male classmates are okay. Their mutual trust has been completely shattered,' said Shin Kyung-ah, a sociology professor at South Korea's Hallym University. The school lists have not been formally verified, but officials including President Yoon Suk Yeol have confirmed a surge of explicit deepfake content on social media. Police have launched a seven-month crackdown. Recent attention to the problem has coincided with France's arrest in August of Pavel Durov, the founder of the messaging app Telegram, over allegations that his platform was used for illicit activities including the distribution of child sexual abuse. South Korea's telecommunications and broadcast watchdog said Monday that Telegram has pledged to enforce a zero-tolerance policy on illegal deepfake content. Police say they've detained 387 people over alleged deepfake crimes this year, more than 80% of them teenagers. Separately, the Education Ministry says about 800 students have informed authorities about intimate deepfake content involving them this year. Experts say the true scale of deepfake porn in the country is far bigger. The U.S. cybersecurity firm Security Hero called South Korea 'the country most targeted by deepfake pornography' last year. In a report, it said South Korean singers and actresses constitute more than half of the people featured in deepfake pornography worldwide. The prevalence of deepfake porn in South Korea reflects various factors including heavy use of smart phones; an absence of comprehensive sex and human rights education in schools and inadequate social media regulations for minors as well as a 'misogynic culture' and social norms that 'sexually objectify women,' according to Hong Nam-hee, a research professor at the Institute for Urban Humanities at the University of Seoul. Victims speak of intense suffering. In parliament, lawmaker Kim Nam Hee read a letter by an unidentified victim who she said tried to kill herself because she didn't want to suffer any longer from the explicit deepfake videos someone had made of her. Addressing a forum, former opposition party leader Park Ji-hyun read a letter from another victim who said she fainted and was taken to an emergency room after receiving sexually abusive deepfake images and being told by her perpetrators that they were stalking her. The 30-year-old woman interviewed by The AP said that her doctoral studies in the United States were disrupted for a year. She is receiving treatment after being diagnosed with panic disorder and post-traumatic stress disorder in 2022. Police said they've detained five men for allegedly producing and spreading fake explicit contents of about 20 women, including her. The victims are all graduates from Seoul National University, the country's top school. Two of the men, including one who allegedly sent her fake nude images in 2021, attended the same university, but she said has no meaningful memory of them. The woman said the images she received on Telegram used photos she had posted on the local messaging app Kakao Talk, combined with nude photos of strangers. There were also videos showing men masturbating and messages describing her as a promiscuous woman or prostitute. One photo shows a screen shot of a Telegram chatroom with 42 people where her fake images were posted. The fake images were very crudely made but the woman felt deeply humiliated and shocked because dozens of people — some of whom she likely knows — were sexually harassing her with those photos. Building trust with men is stressful, she said, because she worries that 'normal-looking people could do such things behind my back.' Using a smart phone sometimes revives memories of the fake images. 'These days, people spend more time on their mobile phones than talking face to face with others. So we can't really easily escape the traumatic experience of digital crimes if those happen on our phones,' she said. 'I was very sociable and really liked to meet new people, but my personality has totally changed since that incident. That made my life really difficult and I'm sad.' Critics say authorities haven't done enough to counter deepfake porn despite an epidemic of online sex crimes in recent years, such as spy cam videos of women in public toilets and other places. In 2020, members of a criminal ring were arrested and convicted of blackmailing dozens of women into filming sexually explicit videos for them to sell. 'The number of male juveniles consuming deepfake porn for fun has increased because authorities have overlooked the voices of women' demanding stronger punishment for digital sex crimes, the monitoring group ReSET said in comments sent to AP. South Korea has no official records on the extent of deepfake online porn. But ReSET said a recent random search of an online chatroom found more than 4,000 sexually exploitive images, videos and other items. Reviews of district court rulings showed less than a third of the 87 people indicted by prosecutors for deepfake crimes since 2021 were sent to prison. Nearly 60% avoided jail by receiving suspended terms, fines or not-guilty verdicts, according to lawmaker Kim's office. Judges tended to lighten sentences when those convicted repented for their crimes or were first time offenders. The deepfake problem has gained urgency given South Korea's serious rifts over gender roles, workplace discrimination facing women, mandatory military service for men and social burdens on men and women. Kim Chae-won, a 25-year-old office worker, said some of her male friends shunned her after she asked them what they thought about digital sex violence targeting women. 'I feel scared of living as a woman in South Korea,' said Kim Haeun, a 17-year-old high school student who recently removed all her photos on Instagram. She said she feels awkward when talking with male friends and tries to distance herself from boys she doesn't know well. 'Most sex crimes target women. And when they happen, I think we are often helpless,' she said.	https://www.voanews.com/a/in-south-korea-deepfake-porn-wrecks-women-s-lives-deepens-gender-conflict/7810018.html	2024-10-05T23:16:36-07:00	
North Korea and China mark their 75th anniversary of ties	SEOUL, South Korea — The leaders of North Korea and China marked the 75th anniversary of their diplomatic relations on Sunday by exchanging messages that expressed hopes for stronger ties, as outsiders raised questions about their relationship. The message exchange came as North Korea and Russia have been sharply expanding their cooperation while China apparently keeps its distance. Experts say that the level of exchanges and commemorative programs between North Korea and China in the coming months will provide a clue to the exact status of their ties. In a message sent to Chinese President Xi Jinping, North Korean leader Kim Jong Un said his government will 'steadily strive to consolidate and develop the friendly and cooperative relations' between the two countries, according to North Korea's official Korean Central News Agency. Xi, in his message to Kim, said that China is ready to jointly promote 'the stable and further advance of the socialist cause in the two countries,' KCNA said. Since North Korea and China established diplomatic ties on October 6, 1949, their relationship has often been described as being 'as close as lips and teeth.' China, North Korea's biggest trading partner and main aid provider, has been suspected of avoiding fully implementing U.N. sanctions on North Korea and sending clandestine aid shipments to help its impoverished neighbor stay afloat and continue to serve as a bulwark against U.S. influence on the Korean Peninsula. But many observers say China is reluctant to form a three-way, anti-West alliance with North Korea and Russia as it prefers a stable regional security environment to tackle numerous economic challenges and maintain relationships with Europe and its Asian neighbors. North Korea and Russia have moved significantly closer to each other amid widespread outside suspicions that North Korea has supplied conventional weapons to Russia for its war in Ukraine in return for military and economic assistance. During a meeting in Pyongyang in June, Kim and Russian President Vladimir Putin signed a pact stipulating mutual military assistance if either country is attacked, in what was considered the two countries' biggest defense deal since the end of the Cold War. North Korea is locked in confrontations with the U.S., South Korea and their partners over its advancing nuclear program. Kim has said he was forced to expand both nuclear and conventional capabilities to cope with U.S.-led security threats. On Sunday, KCNA reported that Kim oversaw a live artillery firing drill by cadets of a military academy. After watching the drill, Kim said training programs at the military academy must focus on 'the guerrilla war tactics to wipe out the enemies through rapid mobile and surprise operations,' according to KCNA.	https://www.voanews.com/a/north-korea-and-china-mark-their-75th-anniversary-of-ties/7812074.html	2024-10-05T23:13:50-07:00	
Trump returns to site of first assassination attempt for campaign rally	BUTLER, Pennsylvania — Donald Trump returned on Saturday to the Pennsylvania fairgrounds where he was nearly assassinated in July, holding a sprawling rally before a massive crowd in a critical swing state Trump hopes to return to his column in November's election. The former president and Republican nominee picked up where he left off in July when a gunman tried to assassinate him and struck his ear. He began his speech with, 'As I was saying,' and gestured toward an immigration chart he was looking at when the gunfire began. The Trump campaign worked to maximize the event's headline-grabbing potential with just 30 days to go and voting already underway in some states in his race against his Democratic opponent, Vice President Kamala Harris. Musician Lee Greenwood appeared on stage and serenaded him with God Bless the USA, frequently played at his rallies, and billionaire Elon Musk spoke for the first time at a Trump rally. 'We fought together. We have endured together. We have pushed onward together,' Trump said. 'And right here in Pennsylvania, we have bled together. We've bled.' 'This is a must-win' Trump needs to drive up voter turnout in conservative strongholds like Butler County, an overwhelmingly white, rural-suburban community, if he wants to win Pennsylvania in November. Harris, too, has targeted her campaign efforts at Pennsylvania, rallying there repeatedly as part of her aggressive outreach in critical swing states. At the beginning of the rally, Trump asked for a moment of silence to honor firefighter Corey Comperatore, who died as he shielded family members from gunfire. Opera singer Christopher Macchio sang Ave Maria after a bell rung at the same time that gunfire began on July 13. Standing behind protective glass that now encases the stage at his outdoor rallies, Trump called the would-be assassin 'a vicious monster' and said he did not succeed 'by the hand of providence and the grace of God.' There was a very visible heightened security presence, with armed law enforcers in camouflage uniforms on roofs. One of the most anticipated guests of the evening was Musk, who climbed onto the stage on Saturday jumping and pumping his fists in the air after Trump introduced him as a 'great gentleman' and said he 'saved free speech.' 'President Trump must win to preserve the Constitution. He must win to preserve democracy in America,' said Musk, who endorsed Trump after the assassination attempt. 'This is a must-win situation.' Musk, who bought Twitter and rebranded it as X and has embraced conservative politics, met with Trump and Vance backstage, donning a black 'Make America Great Again' hat. A billboard on the way into the rally said, 'IN MUSK WE TRUST,' and showed his photo. Earlier on Saturday, Trump's running mate, Ohio Senator JD Vance, got on stage and reflected on the events that day while criticizing Democrats for calling Trump 'a threat to democracy,' saying that kind of language is 'inflammatory.' 'You heard the shots. You saw the blood. We all feared the worst. But you knew everything would be OK when President Trump raised his fist high in the air and shouted, 'Fight, fight!'' said Vance. 'Now I believe it as sure as I'm standing here today that what happened was a true miracle.' Crowds pack stands Crowds were lined up as the sun rose Saturday. The crowd packed bleachers, folding chairs and the field stretching to the venue's edges. Area hotels, motels and inns were said to be full and some rallygoers arrived Friday. Much of the crowd waited several hours for Trump. About half an hour into his speech, Trump paused his speech for more than five minutes after an attendee had a medical issue and needed a medic. Trump used the event to remember Comperatore, the volunteer firefighter struck and killed at the July 13 rally, and to recognize the two other rallygoers injured, David Dutch and James Copenhaver. They and Trump were struck when 20-year-old shooter Thomas Matthew Crooks of Bethel Park, Pennsylvania, opened fire from an unsecured rooftop nearby before he was fatally shot by sharpshooters. The building from which Crooks fired was completely obscured by tractor-trailers, a large grassy perimeter and a fence. Most bleachers were now at the sides, rather than behind Trump. How Crooks managed to outmaneuver law enforcement that day and scramble on top of a building within easy shooting distance of the ex-president is among many questions that remain unanswered about the worst Secret Service security failure in decades. Another is his motive. Butler County District Attorney Rich Goldinger told WPXI-TV this week that 'everyone is doubling down on their efforts to make sure this is done safely and correctly.' Mike Slupe, the county sheriff, told the station he estimates the Secret Service, was deploying 'quadruple the assets' it did in July. The agency has undergone a painful reckoning over its handling of two attempts on Trump's life. ‘I believe God's got Trump’ Butler County, on the western edge of a coveted presidential swing state, is a Trump stronghold. He won the county with about 66% of the vote in both 2016 and 2020. About 57% of the county's 139,000 registered voters are Republicans, compared with about 29% who are Democrats and 14% something else. Chris Harpster, 30, of Tyrone, Pennsylvania, was accompanied by his girlfriend on Saturday as he returned to the scene. Of July 13, he said, 'I was afraid' — as were his parents, watching at home, who texted him immediately after the shots rang out. Heightened security measures were making him feel better now, as well as the presence of his girlfriend, a first-time rallygoer. Harpster said he will be a third-time Trump voter in November, based on the Republican nominee's stances on immigration, guns, abortion and energy. Harpster said he hopes Pennsylvania will go Republican, particularly out of concern over gas and oil industry jobs. Other townspeople were divided over the value of Trump's return. Heidi Priest, a Butler resident who started a Facebook group supporting Harris, said Trump's last visit fanned political tensions in the city. 'Whenever you see people supporting him and getting excited about him being here, it scares the people who don't want to see him reelected,' she said. Terri Palmquist came from Bakersfield, California, and said her 18-year-old daughter tried to dissuade her. 'I just figure we need to not let fear control us. That's what the other side wants is fear. If fear controls us, we lose,' she said. She said she was not worried about her own safety. 'Honesty, I believe God's got Trump, for some reason. I do. So we're rooting for him.'	https://www.voanews.com/a/trump-returns-to-site-of-first-assassination-attempt-for-campaign-rally/7812072.html	2024-10-05T23:00:44-07:00	
Thousands join pro-Palestinian rallies around the globe as Oct. 7 anniversary nears	rome — Police used tear gas and water cannons to disperse violent demonstrators in Rome as tens of thousands of pro-Palestinian protesters took to the streets in major European cities and around the globe Saturday to call for a cease-fire as the first anniversary of the Hamas attacks on Israel approached. Huge rallies were held in several European cities, with gatherings expected to continue over the weekend and peak on Monday, the date of the anniversary. In Rome, several thousand demonstrated peacefully Saturday afternoon until a smaller group tried to push the rally toward the center of the city, in spite of a ban by local authorities who refused to authorize protests, citing security concerns. Some protesters, dressed in black and with their faces covered threw stones, bottles and paper bombs at the police, who responded with tear gas and water cannons, eventually dispersing the crowd. At least 30 law enforcement officers and three demonstrators were injured in the clashes, local media reported. The rally in Rome had been calm earlier, with people chanting 'Free Palestine, Free Lebanon,' waving Palestinian flags and holding banners calling for an immediate stop to the conflict. In London, thousands marched through the capital to Downing Street amid a heavy police presence. The atmosphere was tense as pro-Palestinian protesters and counterdemonstrators, some holding Israeli flags, passed one another. Scuffles broke out as police officers pushed back activists trying to get past a cordon. At least 17 people were arrested on suspicion of public order offenses, supporting a proscribed organization and assault, London's Metropolitan Police said. In the northern German city of Hamburg, about 950 people staged a peaceful demonstration with many waving Palestinian and Lebanese flags or chanting 'Stop the Genocide,' the DPA news agency reported, citing a count by police. Two smaller pro-Israeli counterdemonstrations took place without incident, it said. Several thousand protesters gathered peacefully at Paris' Republique Plaza in a show of solidarity with the Palestinian and Lebanese people. Many were waving Palestinian flags while holding posters reading 'stop the genocide,' 'free Palestine,' and 'hands off Lebanon.' Pro-Palestinian demonstrators also gathered at New York's Times Square to call for a cease-fire, chanting 'Gaza!' to a drumbeat. Some wore keffiyeh scarfs, waved Palestinian and Lebanese flags and held a large cardboard image of Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu with red paint symbolizing blood across his face. Rallies were also planned in several other cities in the United States as well as in other parts of the world, including Denmark, Switzerland, South Africa and India. In the Philippines, dozens of left-wing activists protested near the U.S. Embassy in Manila, where police prevented them from getting closer to the seaside compound. In Indonesia's capital, Jakarta, thousands of pro-Palestinian protesters marched to the heavily guarded U.S. Embassy on Sunday. Authorities blocked roads leading to the embassy with razor wire and concrete barriers as more than 1,000 police were deployed around the compound. Pro-Israeli demonstrations are expected to be held Sunday because Jews across the world are still observing Rosh Hashana, or the Jewish new year. This year, emotions will be high for many given that the midpoint of the 10 days spanning Rosh Hashana and Yom Kippur is October 7 — the one-year anniversary of the Hamas attack that killed 1,200 Israelis and triggered the ongoing war in Gaza. High security alerts Security forces in several countries warned of heightened levels of alert in major cities, amid concerns that the escalating conflict in the Middle East could inspire new terror attacks in Europe or that the protests could turn violent. Pro-Palestinian protests calling for an immediate cease-fire have repeatedly taken place across Europe and around the globe in the past year and have often turned violent, with confrontations between demonstrators and law enforcement officers. Italian authorities believed that the timing of Saturday's rally in Rome risked the October 7 attack being 'glorified,' local media reported. Interior Minister Matteo Piantedosi also stressed that, ahead of the key anniversary, Europe is on high alert for potential terror attacks. 'This is not a normal situation. … We are already in a condition of maximum prevention,' he said. Ben Jamal, director of the Palestine Solidarity Campaign in Britain, said he and others will keep organizing marches until action against Israel is taken. 'We need to be out on the streets in even bigger numbers to stop this carnage and stop Britain being drawn into it,' Jamal said. In Berlin, a march is scheduled from the Brandenburg Gate to Bebelplatz on Sunday. Local media reported that security forces have warned of potential overload because of the scale of protests. German authorities pointed to increasing antisemitic and violent incidents in recent days. Earlier this week in France, Interior Minister Bruno Retailleau warned the country's regional prefects, expressing concern about possible tensions and saying that the terrorist threat was high. Thousands rally in Washington About 3,000 people demonstrated within sight of the White House. Amid a heavy police presence, the protesters gathered at Lafayette Park, the same site as 2020 protests against police brutality and the killing of George Floyd. 'Resistance is justified when people are occupied!' they chanted. One speaker on stage called October 7, 2023, 'the day that Gazans finally broke out of their prison.' The crowds then marched through downtown, with police closing streets ahead of them. Protesters carried signs criticizing the Biden-Harris administration's handling of the issue. One read: 'Abandon Harris '24.' Law student Annette Tunstall said she considered voting Democratic after Biden stepped down and Harris became the candidate. But she lost faith after pro-Palestinian voices were muzzled at the Democratic National Convention, she said. 'I really wanted to feel like I could vote for her in good conscience,' Tunstall said. 'I don't think it would have taken a lot for thousands of pro-Palestinian people to hold their nose and vote for Harris.' A tense and bloody year On October 7 last year, Hamas launched a surprise attack into Israel, killing 1,200 Israelis, taking 250 people hostage and setting off a war with Israel that has shattered much of the Hamas-controlled Gaza Strip. More than 41,000 Palestinians have been killed since then in Gaza, according to the Gaza Health Ministry, which does not differentiate between fighters and civilians. Nearly 100 Israeli hostages remain in Gaza, with fewer than 70 believed to be alive. Israelis have experienced attacks — missiles from Iran and Hezbollah, explosive drones from Yemen, fatal shootings and stabbings — as the region braces for further escalation. In late September, Israel shifted some of its focus to Hezbollah, which it seeks to push back from its border in parts of south Lebanon where the group is entrenched.	https://www.voanews.com/a/thousands-join-pro-palestinian-rallies-around-the-globe-as-oct-7-anniversary-nears/7812069.html	2024-10-05T22:50:55-07:00	
Apparent Israeli airstrike on Gaza mosque kills at least 18	DEIR AL-BALAH, Gaza Strip — An apparent Israeli airstrike early Sunday killed at least 18 people in central Gaza, Palestinian medical officials said. The strike hit a mosque sheltering displaced people near the al-Aqsa Martyrs hospital in the town of Deir al-Balah, the hospital said in a statement. An Associated Press journalist counted the bodies at the hospital morgue. Hospital records showed that the dead were all men. Another two men were critically wounded, the hospital said. The Israeli military did not immediately comment about the strike on the mosque. The latest strikes add to the mounting Palestinian death toll in Gaza, which is nearing 42,000, according to the Palestinian Health Ministry. The ministry does not differentiate between civilian and militant deaths, but many of the dead were women and children. The attack early Sunday came after Israel bombarded Lebanon on Saturday as it targeted both Hezbollah and Hamas fighters. Thousands of people in Lebanon, including Palestinian refugees, continued to flee the widening conflict in the region, while rallies were held around the world marking the approaching anniversary of the start of the war in Gaza. The strong explosions Saturday began near midnight and continued into Sunday after Israel's military urged residents to evacuate areas in Dahiyeh, the predominantly Shiite collection of suburbs on Beirut's southern edge. AP video showed the blasts illuminating the densely populated suburbs, where Hezbollah has a strong presence. They followed a day of sporadic strikes and the nearly continuous buzz of reconnaissance drones. Israel's military confirmed it was striking targets near Beirut and said about 30 projectiles had crossed from Lebanon into Israeli territory, with some intercepted. The strikes reportedly targeted a building near a road leading to Lebanon's only international airport, and another building formerly used by the Hezbollah-run broadcaster Al-Manar. Social media reports claimed that one of the strikes hit an oxygen tank storage facility, but this was later denied by the owner of the company. Shortly thereafter, Hezbollah claimed in a statement that it successfully targeted a group of Israeli soldiers near the Manara settlement in northern Israel 'with a large rocket salvo, hitting them accurately.' On Saturday, Israel's attack on the northern Beddawi camp killed an official with Hamas' military wing along with his wife and two young daughters, the Palestinian militant group said. Hamas later said another military wing member was killed in Israeli strikes in Lebanon's eastern Bekaa Valley. The aftermath showed smashed buildings, scattered bricks and stairways to nowhere. Israel has killed several Hamas officials in Lebanon since the Israel-Hamas war began , in addition to most of the top leadership of the Lebanon-based Hezbollah as fighting has sharply escalated. At least 1,400 Lebanese, including civilians, medics and Hezbollah fighters, have been killed and 1.2 million driven from their homes in less than two weeks. Israel says it aims to drive the militant group away from shared borders so displaced Israelis can return to their homes. Iranian-backed Hezbollah, the strongest armed force in Lebanon, began firing rockets into Israel almost immediately after Hamas' October 7 attack, calling it a show of support for the Palestinians. Hezbollah and Israel's military have traded fire almost daily. Last week, Israel launched what it called a limited ground operation into southern Lebanon after a series of attacks killed longtime Hezbollah leader Hassan Nasrallah and others. The fighting is the worst since Israel and Hezbollah fought a brief war in 2006. Nine Israeli soldiers have been killed in the ground clashes that Israel says have killed 440 Hezbollah fighters. Iran's foreign minister, Abbas Araghchi, told reporters in Damascus that 'we are trying to reach a cease-fire in Gaza and in Lebanon.' The minister said the unnamed countries putting forward initiatives include regional states and some outside the Middle East. Araghchi spoke a day after the supreme leader of Iran praised its recent missile strikes on Israel and said it was ready to do it again if necessary. On Saturday evening, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said 'Israel has the duty and the right to defend itself and respond to these attacks, and it will do so.' On Lebanon, he said 'we are not done yet.'	https://www.voanews.com/a/apparent-israeli-airstrike-on-gaza-mosque-kills-at-least-18-/7812066.html	2024-10-05T22:40:54-07:00	
Tropical Storm Milton forms in Gulf of Mexico, could become hurricane	miami — A storm system that was brewing in the Gulf of Mexico earlier Saturday has strengthened into Tropical Storm Milton, with forecasters warning it could intensify into a hurricane headed to Florida next week. Tropical Storm Milton is about 355 kilometers north-northeast of Veracruz, Mexico, the National Hurricane Center in Miami said in a 1:25 p.m. EDT advisory. Though no coastal watches or warnings were in effect, the hurricane center said the Florida Peninsula, the Florida Keys, Mexico's Yucatan peninsula and the northwestern Bahamas should monitor the system’s progress. The storm is forecast to strengthen and bring the risk of life-threatening impacts to portions of Florida's West Coast next week, with hurricane and storm-surge watches likely being in effect Sunday. Parts of Florida are expected to have heavy rainfall beginning Sunday. The rainfall will bring the risk of flash, urban, and areal flooding, along with some river flooding. 'There is an increasing risk of life-threatening storm surge and wind impacts for portions of the west coast of the Florida Peninsula beginning late Tuesday or Wednesday. Residents in these areas should ensure they have their hurricane plan in place, follow any advice given by local officials, and check back for updates to the forecast,' the center said. Looking farther east, Leslie has strengthened into a hurricane in the Atlantic Ocean but isn’t threatening land, forecasters said. The storm was located Saturday about 1,170 kilometers west-southwest of the southernmost Cabo Verde Islands and had maximum sustained winds of 120 kph. There were no coastal watches or warnings in effect. Meanwhile, Hurricane Kirk remained a Category 4 major hurricane, and waves from the system were affecting the Leeward Islands, Bermuda, and the Greater Antilles, forecasters said. The storm's swells were expected to spread to the East Coast of the United States, the Atlantic Coast of Canada and the Bahamas on Saturday night and Sunday. Forecasters warned the waves could cause life-threatening surf and rip current conditions. Kirk was expected to weaken starting Saturday, the center said. Though there were no coastal warnings or watches in effect for Kirk, the center said those in the Azores, where swells could hit Monday, should monitor the storm's progress. Kirk was about 1,570 kilometers east-northeast of the northern Leeward Islands with maximum sustained winds of 209 kph. The storms churned as rescuers in the U.S. Southeast searched for people unaccounted for after Hurricane Helene struck last week, leaving behind a trail of death and catastrophic damage.	https://www.voanews.com/a/tropical-storm-milton-forms-in-gulf-of-mexico-could-become-hurricane-/7812058.html	2024-10-05T21:54:16-07:00	
Hungarians protest state media 'propaganda factory,' demand unbiased press	budapest, hungary — Thousands of protesters gathered outside the headquarters of Hungary's public media corporation Saturday to demonstrate against what they say is an entrenched propaganda network operated by the nationalist government at taxpayer expense. The protest was organized by Hungary's most prominent opposition figure, Peter Magyar, and his upstart TISZA party, which has emerged in recent months as the most serious political challenge for Prime Minister Viktor Orban since he took power nearly 15 years ago. Magyar, whose party received nearly 30% of the vote in European Union elections this summer and is polling within a few points of the governing Fidesz party, has been outspoken about what he sees as the damage Orban's 'propaganda factory' has done to Hungary's democracy. 'What is happening here in Hungary in 2024, and calling itself 'public service' media, is a global scandal,' Magyar told the crowd in Budapest on Saturday. 'Enough of the nastiness, enough of the lies, enough of the propaganda. Our patience has run out. The time for confrontation has come.' Observers say press freedom under threat Both Hungarian and international observers have long warned that press freedom in the Central European country was under threat, and that Orban's party has used media buyouts by government-connected business tycoons to build a pro-government media empire. Media watchdog Reporters Without Borders estimates that such buyouts have given Orban's party control of some 80% of Hungary's media market resources. In 2021, the group put Orban on its list of media 'predators,' the first EU leader to earn the distinction. On Saturday, Balazs Tompe, a protester who traveled several hours to attend the demonstration, called the state media headquarters a 'factory of lies.' 'The propaganda goes out at such a level and is so unbalanced that it's blood boiling, and I think we need to raise our voices,' he said. 'It's nonsense that only government propaganda comes out in the media that is financed by the taxpayers.' 'Public only hears from one side' A retired teacher from southern Hungary, Agnes Gera, said dissenting voices were censored from the public media, limiting Hungarians' access to information about political alternatives. 'It's very burdensome and unfortunate that the system works this way where the public only hears from one side and don't even know about the other side,' she said. Magyar demanded the resignation of the public media director, and echoed complaints from many opposition politicians that they are not provided the opportunity to appear on public television to communicate with voters. He called his supporters to another demonstration on October 23, a national holiday commemorating Hungary's failed revolution against Soviet domination in 1956.	https://www.voanews.com/a/hungarians-protest-state-media-propaganda-factory-demand-unbiased-press-/7811812.html	2024-10-05T16:09:21-07:00

China says it evacuated 215 nationals from Lebanon	Beijing — China said Saturday that it has evacuated 215 of its nationals from Lebanon, where Israel has been carrying out intense bombardments since last month, resulting in more than 1,100 deaths. This week, Israel said its troops launched 'ground raids' into parts of southern Lebanon, a stronghold of Iran-backed Hezbollah, following days of heavy strikes on areas across the country where the group holds sway. Israel has recently shifted its focus to securing its northern border with Lebanon, where there have been near-daily clashes since Hezbollah launched strikes in support of its Palestinian ally Hamas, after that group's October 7 attack. Several countries have launched operations to remove their nationals from Lebanon in the wake of the ground raids, including Russia, France, Spain, Germany and the U.K. 'So far, 215 Chinese citizens have been safely evacuated from Lebanon in two batches under the organization and arrangement of the Chinese government,' Beijing's foreign ministry said in a statement given to Agence France-Presse. 'The Chinese Embassy in Lebanon continues to carry out its mission in Lebanon and will continue to assist the Chinese citizens there in taking security measures,' it added. The ministry did not say where the evacuated Chinese nationals had been taken. According to Lebanese authorities, more than 1,110 people have been killed in the country since the escalation in Israeli bombardment on September 23, while more than 1 million people have been forced to flee their homes. On Wednesday, China urged world powers to prevent the conflict from 'further deteriorating' after Iran fired a barrage of missiles at Israel, which warned it would make Tehran 'pay' for the attack.	https://www.voanews.com/a/china-says-it-evacuated-215-nationals-from-lebanon/7811787.html	2024-10-05T13:50:31-07:00

Floods inundate Thailand's tourist city of Chiang Mai, strand elephants	bangkok — Chiang Mai, Thailand's northern city popular with tourists, was inundated by widespread flooding Saturday as its main river overflowed its banks following heavy seasonal rainfall. Authorities ordered some evacuations and said they were working to pump water out of residential areas and clear obstructions from waterways and drains to help water recede faster. Dozens of shelters were set up across the city to accommodate residents whose homes were flooded. The Chiang Mai city government said the water level of the Ping River, which runs along the eastern edge of the city, was at critically high levels and was rising since Friday. However, the provincial irrigation office Saturday forecast that the water level was likely to remain stable and recede to normal in about five days. Elephants aid one another Thai media reported that efforts to evacuate elephants and other animals from several sanctuaries and parks on the outskirts of the city were continuing Saturday. About 125 elephants along with other animals were taken to safety from the Elephant Nature Park, from where some escaped on their own to seek higher ground. About 10 animal shelters in the area have been flooded. Video posted online by the park vividly illustrate that care and compassion are not solely human traits. The video shows several of the park’s resident elephants fleeing through rising, muddy water to ground less inundated. Three of them dash through the deluge with some ease but, according to the park, a fourth one is blind and was falling behind. It showed greater difficulty passing through wrecked fencing. Its fellows appear to call out to it, to guide it to their sides. High water hampers evacuation efforts Efforts to evacuate more animals were hampered by the high water, while more rain is forecast. Chiang Mai Governor Nirat Pongsitthavorn said that the latest flooding, the second in six weeks, exceeded expectations. Thailand's state railway suspended service to Chiang Mai, with trains on the northern line from Bangkok terminating at Lampang, about 1 1/2 hours ride to the south. Chiang Mai International Airport said Saturday it was operating as usual. Flooding was reported in 20 Thai provinces Saturday, mostly in the north. At least 49 people have died and 28 were injured in floods since August, the Department of Disaster Prevention and Mitigation said. In the Thai capital Bangkok, the government said Saturday it will let more water flow out of the Chao Phraya Dam in the central province of Chai Nat over the next seven days, as it risks exceeding it capacity. The release of the water may affect residents downstream who live near waterways in Thailand’s central region, including Bangkok and the surrounding areas.	https://www.voanews.com/a/floods-inundate-thailand-s-northern-tourist-city-of-chiang-mai-/7811772.html	2024-10-05T13:02:50-07:00	
Several die trying to cross English Channel, says French minister	paris — Several people, including a child, died while trying to cross the English Channel from France to England, French Interior Minister Bruno Retailleau said Saturday. Attempts to cross the channel in small, overloaded boats are frequent despite strong currents in what is one of the world's busiest shipping lanes. 'Smugglers have the blood of these people on their hands and our government will step up the fight against these mafias that organize these deadly crossings,' Retailleau said on social media platform X. Fourteen people were on the boat. One was flown by helicopter to a hospital after a search and rescue operation was conducted Saturday morning, local maritime authorities said. The incident was the latest in a series this year, including one last month in which 12 migrants died when their boat capsized in the channel.	https://www.voanews.com/a/several-dead-in-channel-crossing-attempt-french-minister-says-/7811764.html	2024-10-05T12:31:09-07:00	
Hacks against US campaign latest examples of Iran targeting adversaries	DUBAI, United Arab Emirates — Iran has emerged as a twofold concern for the United States as it nears the end of the presidential campaign. Prosecutors allege Tehran tried to hack figures associated with the election, stealing information from former President Donald Trump's campaign. And U.S. officials have accused it of plotting to kill Trump and other ex-officials. For Iran, assassination plots and hacking aren't new strategies. Iran saw the value and the danger of hacking in the early 2000s, when the Stuxnet virus, believed to have been deployed by Israel and the U.S., tried to damage Iran's nuclear program. Since then, hackers attributed to state-linked operations have targeted the Trump campaign, Iranian expatriates and government officials at home. Its history of assassinations goes back further. After the 1979 Islamic Revolution, Iran killed or abducted perceived enemies living abroad. A history of hacks For many, Iran's behavior can be traced to the emergence of the Stuxnet computer virus. Released in the 2000s, Stuxnet wormed its way into control units for uranium-enriching centrifuges at Iran's Natanz nuclear facility, causing them to speed up, ultimately destroying themselves. Iranian scientists initially believed mechanical errors caused the damage. Ultimately though, Iran removed the affected equipment and sought its own way of striking enemies online. 'Iran had an excellent teacher in the emerging art of cyberwarfare,' noted a 2020 report from the King Faisal Center for Research and Islamic Studies in Saudi Arabia. That was acknowledged by the National Security Agency in a document leaked by former NSA contractor Edward Snowden in 2015 to The Intercept, which examined a cyberattack that destroyed hard drives at Saudi Arabia's state oil company. Iran has been suspected of carrying out that attack, called Shamoon, in 2012 and again in 2017. There also were domestic considerations. In 2009, the disputed reelection of hard-line President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad sparked the Green Movement protests. Twitter, one source of news from the demonstrations, found its website defaced by the self-described 'Iranian Cyber Army.' There's been suspicion that the Revolutionary Guard, a major power base within Iran's theocracy, oversaw the 'Cyber Army' and other hackers. Meanwhile, Iran itself has been hacked repeatedly. They include the mass shutdown of gas stations across Iran, as well as surveillance cameras at Tehran's notorious Evin Prison and even state television broadcasts. Low costs, high rewards Iranian hacking attacks, given their low cost and high reward, likely will continue as Iran faces a tense international environment surrounding Israel's conflicts with Hamas and Hezbollah, Iran's enrichment of uranium to near weapons-grade levels, and the prospect of Trump becoming president again. The growth of 3G and 4G mobile internet services in Iran also made it easier for the public — and potential hackers — to access the internet. Iran has more than 50 major universities with computer science or information technology programs. At least three of Iran's top schools are thought to be affiliated with Iran's Defense Ministry and the Guard, providing potential hackers for security forces. Iranian hacking attempts on U.S. targets have included banks and even a small dam near New York City — attacks American prosecutors linked to the Guard. Hacking attempts rely on phishing While Russia is seen as the biggest foreign threat to U.S. elections, officials have been concerned about Iran. Its hacking attempts in the presidential campaign have relied on phishing — sending many misleading emails in hopes that some recipients will inadvertently provide access to sensitive information. Amin Sabeti, a digital security expert who focuses on Iran, said the tactic works. 'It's scalable, it's cheap and you don't need a skill set because you just put, I don't know, five crazy people who are hard line in an office in Tehran, then send tens of thousands of emails. If they get 10 of them, it's enough,' he said. For Iran, hacks targeting the U.S. offer the prospect of causing chaos, undermining Trump's campaign and obtaining secret information. 'I've lost count of how many attempts have been made on my emails and social media since it's been going on for over a decade,' said Holly Dagres, a nonresident senior fellow at the Atlantic Council who once had her email briefly hacked by Iran. 'The Iranians aren't targeting me because I have useful information swimming in my inbox or direct messages. Rather, they hope to use my name and think tank affiliation to target others and eventually make it up the chain to high-ranking U.S. government officials who would have useful information and intelligence related to Iran.' Iran's killings, abductions abroad Iran has vowed to exact revenge against Trump and others in his former administration over the 2020 drone strike that killed the prominent Revolutionary Guard General Qassem Soleimani in Baghdad. In July, authorities said they learned of an Iranian threat against Trump and boosted security. Iran has not been linked to the assassination attempts against Trump in Florida and Pennsylvania. A Pakistani man who spent time in Iran was recently charged by federal prosecutors for allegedly plotting to carry out assassinations in the U.S., including potentially of Trump. Officials take Iran's threat seriously given its history of targeting adversaries. Even before creating a network of allied militias in the Mideast, Iran is suspected of targeting opponents abroad, beginning with members of Shah Mohammad Reza Pahlavi's former government. The attention shifted to perceived opponents of the theocracy, both in the country with the mass executions of 1988 and abroad. Outside of Iran, the so-called 'chain murders' targeted activists, journalists and other critics. One prominent incident linked to Iran was a shooting at a restaurant in Germany that killed three Iranian-Kurdish figures and a translator. In 1997, a German court implicated Iran's top leaders in the shooting, sparking most European Union nations to withdraw their ambassadors. Iran's targeted killings slowed after that, but didn't stop. U.S. prosecutors link Iran's Revolutionary Guard to a 2011 plot to kill the Saudi ambassador to Washington.	https://www.voanews.com/a/hacks-against-us-campaign-latest-examples-of-iran-targeting-adversaries-/7811750.html	2024-10-05T12:16:51-07:00	
Magnitude 5.7 earthquake strikes near capital of New Zealand	wellington, new zealand — A magnitude 5.7 earthquake struck near New Zealand's capital city of Wellington, government seismic monitor GeoNet said on Sunday, but initial reports indicated there were no injuries or significant damage. The quake hit at 5:08 a.m. on Sunday (1608 GMT on Saturday) striking 25 kilometers (15.5 miles) west of Wellington at a focal depth of 30 km (19 miles). GeoNet said more than 37,000 people had reported feeling the shake, some as far north as Auckland in the North Island. GeoNet said there was no tsunami warning as a result of the quake. A spokesperson for Fire and Emergency New Zealand said the service had not received any calls for assistance. Government-owned Radio New Zealand said there were no reports of significant damage or reports of injury.	https://www.voanews.com/a/magnitude-5-7-earthquake-strikes-near-capital-of-new-zealand/7811739.html	2024-10-05T11:36:01-07:00	
Iran's foreign minister renews call for Gaza, Lebanon cease-fires on Syria visit	damascus, syria — Iran 's Foreign Minister Abbas Araghchi renewed his call for cease-fires in both Gaza and Lebanon on Saturday as he held talks with his country's Syrian allies. 'The most important issue today is the cease-fire, especially in Lebanon and in Gaza,' he told reporters. 'There are initiatives in this regard, there have been consultations that we hope will be successful.' Araghchi's visit to Damascus, his first since he took office in August, comes almost a year after the Iran-backed Palestinian militant group Hamas attacked Israel, triggering war in Gaza. The conflict has also drawn in Iran's Lebanese ally, Hezbollah and on September 23 Israel sharply intensified its campaign against the militant group. 'The purpose of my trip to Damascus is to continue consultations regarding the developments in the region,' Araghchi said. His meetings in the Syrian capital followed a visit to Beirut Friday during which he voiced support for a truce in Lebanon acceptable to Hezbollah 'simultaneously with a cease-fire in Gaza.' Araghchi traveled to Damascus by air after Lebanon said an Israeli airstrike Friday severed the main international highway linking the two countries. Israel said its strike was aimed at preventing the flow of weapons to Hezbollah from neighboring Syria. Iran has been a staunch ally of Syrian President Bashar al-Assad throughout the civil war that erupted in 2011 following the suppression of antigovernment protests.	https://www.voanews.com/a/iran-s-foreign-minister-renews-call-for-gaza-lebanon-cease-fires-on-syria-visit-/7811721.html	2024-10-05T10:51:40-07:00	
Lebanon displacement crisis deepens amid surging airstrikes	geneva — The United Nations warns Lebanon’s displacement crisis is deepening as aid agencies scramble to protect and assist tens of thousands of people fleeing for safety. The warning was made amid a surge in airstrikes as Israel’s 'limited, localized and targeted' operation against Hezbollah militants intensifies in scale and scope. 'As the humanitarian situation deteriorates, UNHCR is reinforcing supplies of core relief items to meet increasing needs and prepare for further escalation, said Rula Amin, the U.N. refugee agency’s senior communications advisor for the Middle East and North Africa. Speaking from the Jordanian capital, Amman, she told journalists in Geneva Friday that 'the volatile security situation and ongoing Israeli airstrikes are delaying relief supplies,' noting that an airlift carrying life-saving medical trauma kits and a shipment of over 20,000 thermal blankets was delayed. The Lebanese government estimates a million people have become displaced inside the country since Hamas militants attacked Israel on October 7, 2023, and war broke out in Gaza. According to the International Organization for Migration (IOM), 400,000 people have become displaced in the last two weeks. Of those, more than 165,000 are living in 800 collective shelters across the country. 'These are schools that the government has urgently opened,' Mathieu Luciano, the IOM’s head of office in Lebanon said. Speaking on a video link from Beirut, he said, 'The situation is really deteriorating rapidly. Hundreds of thousands of people have been forced to flee their homes in the past two weeks. The roads are jammed with traffic. People are sleeping in public parks, on the street and the beach.' He said the numbers of displaced 'continue to rise as heavy shelling continues in the South, in the Beqaa, in Beirut and other regions in the country. In addition to internal displacement, tens of thousands of Lebanese, but also Syrians, are leaving the country,' both through legal and irregular means.' The Syrian Arab Red Crescent says more than 185,000 people have fled to Syria. That number has markedly decreased since an Israeli airstrike Friday cut off vehicle access at the key Masnaa border crossing. 'A huge crater was created in the no man’s land between the Syrian and the Lebanese side, so it is very hard for vehicles, for people to go through this crossing,' the UNHCRs Amin said, adding that some people, 'determined to flee crossed on foot.' Israel said it targeted the border crossing with Syria to stop Hezbollah 'from smuggling weapons into Lebanon.' Despite the complexities, Amin said that Syrian authorities are keeping the border open as people continue to flee from Lebanon to Syria through Masnaa and three other border points. She observed that Syrian refugees are faced with the difficult decision of returning to the country they fled throughout the past 13 years or staying in Lebanon. 'Due to the bombings, lack of adequate shelters, lack of access to services,' she said, the Syrian refugees have to choose whether 'to stay in Lebanon with the growing risk on their life, or to go back and cross the border to Syria with all the other risks in mind.' 'It seems from the numbers of people we have been seeing is that at this point they felt that the risks from the bombings is high' and they are going back, said Amin. 'Some 60% of new arrivals are children and adolescents. Some of the children have arrived on their own, without family members,' she said. 'As they flee the bombings, families arrive with profound emotional fatigue, some requiring urgent medical care. The majority of new arrivals head to their towns and villages of origin to join relatives.' In its daily update on the humanitarian crisis in Lebanon, the Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs, OCHA, says over the past two weeks, 'conflict related deaths have increased by more than 200% to 1,699, with more than 9,781 injuries. At the same time, UNICEF says that more than 690 children have been injured in Lebanon 'as the conflict has dramatically escalated in recent weeks.' Aid agencies are scaling up their humanitarian operations to provide shelter for the homeless, food for the hungry and medical care for the sick and injured. The UNHCR and SARC are supporting authorities in transporting thousands of the most vulnerable from the borders to their final destinations. 'But the suffering of those who cross does not end at the border,' Amin stressed. 'After 13 years of crisis, many are going back to destroyed homes, damaged infrastructure and crippled basic services. They have arrived with no resources for their basic needs. 'Inside Syria, there are still more than 7.2 million people displaced internally and the country is going through a deep economic crisis.' IOM official Luciano said his agency has scaled up immediate lifesaving assistance, providing essential relief items as well as protection services and health support to the IDPs. He highlighted the plight of Lebanon’s 180,000 immigrant workers, many of whom are female domestic workers, coming from Ethiopia, Sri Lanka, Kenya, Sudan, Bangladesh and the Philippines. 'They have been deeply affected by violence in the country,' he said. 'We are receiving increasing reports of migrant domestic workers being abandoned by their Lebanese employer, either left on the streets or in the homes,' he said. 'We have received increased requests from migrants seeking assistance to return home, and from several member states to help evacuate their citizens from Lebanon.' 'This will require significant funding, which we currently do not have,' he said, noting that the IOM is appealing for $32.46 million to assist 400,000 people affected by the crisis over the next three months. That is apart from the U.N.’s inter-agency flash appeal for nearly $426 million to deliver lifesaving assistance to more than 1 million people directly affected and/or displaced by the crisis in Lebanon.	https://www.voanews.com/a/lebanon-displacement-crisis-deepens-amid-surging-airstrikes-/7811696.html	2024-10-05T10:22:10-07:00	
Ukraine shoots down Russian bomber in Donetsk	kyiv, ukraine — Ukrainian forces said they shot down a Russian fighter plane Saturday while Russia claimed it made gains in Ukraine’s east. The Russian bomber was shot down near the city of Kostiantynivka in the Donetsk province, head of the Kostiantynivka Military Administration Serhiy Horbunov was quoted as saying by Ukraine’s public broadcaster, Suspilne. Photos showed charred remains of an aircraft after it landed on a house that caught fire. Also in the partially occupied Donetsk province, Russia’s Defense Ministry claimed Saturday that it had taken control of the village of Zhelanne Druhe. If confirmed, the capture would come three days after Ukrainian forces said they were withdrawing from the front-line town of Vuhledar, some 33 kilometers (21 miles) from Zhelanne Druhe, following a hard-fought two-year defense. Although unlikely to change the course of the war, the loss of Vuhledar is indicative of Kyiv’s worsening position, in part the result of Washington's refusal to grant Ukraine permission to strike targets deep inside Russian territory and preventing Kyiv from degrading Moscow’s capabilities. Zelenskyy to present victory plan to allies Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy said Saturday that he will present his 'victory plan' at the Oct. 12 meeting of the Ramstein group of nations that supplies arms to Ukraine. 'We will present the victory plan — clear, concrete steps towards a just end to the war. The determination of our partners and the strengthening of Ukraine are what can stop Russian aggression,' he wrote on X, adding that the 25th Ramstein meeting would be the first to take place at the leaders’ level. Zelenskyy presented his plan to U.S. President Joe Biden in Washington last week. Its contents have not been made public but it is known that the plan includes Ukraine’s membership in NATO and the provision of long-range missiles to strike inside Russia. Russia shells southern Ukraine Meanwhile, two people died in Russian shelling in Ukraine’s southern Zaporizhzhia region, regional Governor Ivan Fedorov said. Ukraine’s air force said Russia had launched three guided missiles and 13 attack drones at Ukraine overnight into Saturday. It said the missiles were intercepted, three drones were shot down over the Odesa region and 10 others were lost. Nine people were wounded when a Ukrainian drone struck a passenger bus in the city of Horlivka in the partially occupied Donetsk region, the city’s Russian-installed Mayor Ivan Prikhodko said. Russia’s Defense Ministry said Saturday that air defenses shot down 10 Ukrainian drones overnight in three border regions, including seven over the Belgorod region, two over the Kursk region, and one over the Voronezh region.	https://www.voanews.com/a/ukraine-shoots-down-russian-bomber-in-donetsk/7811679.html	2024-10-05T09:49:25-07:00	
Huge crowd at South Korea fireworks amid safety concern after deadly 2022 crush	seoul, south korea — A large fireworks festival in South Korea drew a massive crowd Saturday, snarling traffic through its busy capital, prompting police to deploy 2,400 officers and sending hotel room rates above $7,400. The popular annual event has taken on a serious public safety dimension as memory is still fresh of a Halloween night disaster two years ago that killed 159 mostly young people in a crush of crowd packed in a dense entertainment district. Many of the more than 1 million spectators who were expected to watch the 90-minute show were camping out since midnight to secure a spot with a view of the event scheduled to start at 7:20 p.m. (1020 GMT) over the Han River that runs through Seoul. Oh Soo-taek, 64, who said he has been coming to the festival with his wife for three years, found the place already crowded when they got there at 2 p.m. but said it was exciting to be part of an event bringing so many families and friends together. 'We had that big accident two years ago so it's so good to see the organizers and the police and everyone helping each other and keeping order.' Many restaurants, bars and hotel rooms on Yeouido island on the river and on its banks with a view of the fireworks by teams from Japan, South Korea and the United States had been booked days ahead. High-floor suites at one luxury hotel on Yeouido were sold out Saturday at nearly double the normal rate, despite the less than perfect view of the fireworks they offered, a reservation official said. The event is hosted by the Hanwha conglomerate, which has grown from a dynamite maker to a global defense contractor. Its team participates in a fireworks performance as part of the festival. Authorities took no chances on security, as spectators poured into an area the size of several city blocks on and near Yeouido, the country's main financial center and a dense commercial and residential district. Prime Minister Han Duck-soo directed police, emergency services and the safety and health ministries to be on full alert with a focus on crowd control and also asked for spectator cooperation to ensure order. The precaution comes as the country still grapples with the 2022 Halloween disaster in Seoul's Itaewon nightlife district blamed on failed crowd control. On Monday, the police chief of that district was convicted of negligence and sentenced to three years in prison in the first such verdict against a senior public official over the disaster.	https://www.voanews.com/a/huge-crowd-at-south-korea-fireworks-amid-safety-concern-after-deadly-2022-crush-/7811593.html	2024-10-05T07:55:24-07:00	
Supreme Court opens new term with election disputes looming	washington — Transgender rights, the regulation of 'ghost guns' and the death penalty highlight the Supreme Court's election-season term that begins Monday, with the prospect of the court's intervention in voting disputes lurking in the background. The justices are returning to the bench at a time of waning public confidence in the court and calls to limit their terms to 18 years that have wide support, including the backing of Democratic President Joe Biden and Vice President Kamala Harris, the party's White House nominee. Whether by design or happenstance, the justices are hearing fewer high-profile cases than they did in recent terms that included far-reaching decisions by the 6-3 conservative majority on presidential immunity, abortion, guns and affirmative action. The lighter schedule would allow them to easily add election cases, if those make their way to the high court in the run-up to the Nov. 5 election between Republican Donald Trump and Harris, or its immediate aftermath. 'I think there are legal issues that arise out of the political process. And so, the Supreme Court has to be prepared to respond if that should be necessary,' Justice Ketanji Brown Jackson told CBS News last month in an interview to her promote new memoir Lovely One. The court's involvement in election disputes might depend on the closeness of the outcome and whether the justices' intervention would tip the outcome, David Cole, the outgoing legal director of the American Civil Liberties Union, said at a recent Washington event. 'I don’t think the court wants to get involved, but it may have to,' Cole said. The court turned away multiple challenges from Trump and his allies to the results of the 2020 election that he lost to Biden. It's been nearly a quarter-century since the Supreme Court effectively decided the 2000 presidential election, in which Republican George W. Bush edged Democrat Al Gore. When the justices gather Monday morning on a date set by federal law, they will shake hands with each other as they always do. Just after 10 o'clock, they will emerge from behind freshly cleaned heavy red drapery and take their seats on the curved mahogany bench, Chief Justice John Roberts in the center chair and his eight colleagues seated in order of seniority. There are likely to be smiles and shared private jokes. But the friendliness of that moment will not sweep away tensions that have barely been concealed. During the summer, two justices, Elena Kagan and Jackson, voiced support for toughening the new ethics code that so far lacks a means of enforcement. The leak to The New York Times of the contents of a memo Roberts wrote last winter that outlined his approach to the court's presidential immunity decision 'was nothing short of shocking,' Supreme Court lawyer Lisa Blatt said last week at a Washington preview of the coming term. Two years ago, Politico obtained the draft decision overturning Roe v. Wade, the landmark abortion case. 'Something does feel broken,' Blatt said. Describing her experience arguing before the court, she said, some justices 'just seem visibly frustrated.' Important cases dot the court's calendar, beginning Tuesday. The court will take up a challenge to a Biden administration attempt to regulate hard-to-trace 'ghost guns' that had been turning up at crime scenes in increasing numbers. The Supreme Court jumped into the case after the conservative 5th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals invalidated the regulation. Last term, conservatives voted 6-3 to strike down a gun regulation that had banned bump stocks, an accessory that allows some weapons to fire at a rate comparable to machine guns. Bump stocks were used in the nation’s deadliest modern mass shooting in Las Vegas. A day after the guns case, the justices will take up the latest twist in Oklahoma death row inmate Richard Glossip's long quest for freedom. His case is the rare instance in which prosecutors are conceding mistakes in the trial that led to Glossip’s conviction and death sentence. The highest-profile case on the agenda so far is a fight over transgender rights that is focused on state bans on gender-affirming care. It probably will be argued in December. Republican-led states have enacted a variety of restrictions on health care for transgender people, school sports participation, bathroom usage and drag shows. The administration and Democratic-led states have extended protections for transgender people. The Supreme Court has separately prohibited the administration from enforcing a new federal regulation that seeks to protect transgender students. The case before the high court involves a law in Tennessee that restricts puberty blockers and hormone therapy for transgender minors. About half the states have enacted similar restrictions. Also on tap for the late fall is an appeal from the adult entertainment industry to overturn a Texas law that requires pornographic websites to verify the age of their users. Only about half the court’s calendar for the term has been filled, and several big cases could be added. Among those is a push by Republican-led states and conservative legal outlets to further restrict federal agencies. The immediate target is the method the Federal Communications Commission has used to fund telephone service for rural and low-income people and broadband services for schools and libraries. The case, which the administration has appealed to the Supreme Court, could give the justices the opportunity to revive a legal doctrine known as nondelegation that has not been used to strike down legislation in nearly 90 years. Several conservative justices have expressed support for the idea of limiting the authority Congress can delegate to federal agencies.	https://www.voanews.com/a/supreme-court-opens-new-term-with-election-disputes-looming-/7811578.html	2024-10-05T07:29:05-07:00	
Christmas season starts in Venezuela, weeks before Halloween	caracas, venezuela — It doesn't feel like Christmas in Venezuela. At least not yet. Even if the president wants it to be. Residents of the capital Caracas woke up Tuesday to a towering Christmas tree standing in a popular public square, weeks after President Nicolas Maduro declared the jolly season would start earlier this year in the South American country. Workers rushed to set up decorations in neighborhoods, but the mood was far from festive. 'I think it's terrible because it's October,' said Desire Aguiar, 32, before setting up her jewelry and accessories booth in a local market. 'Halloween hasn't even passed, and it's already Christmas? Are we celebrating them together?' Venezuelans, particularly those who remember life at the turn of the century, have long associated Christmas with careless shopping and bulging wallets thanks to profit-sharing and holiday bonuses employers paid at the end of the year. Employees often received three times their monthly salary all at once. The smell of fresh paint even signaled the arrival of Christmas because so many put a new coat on their walls. These days, however, meager wages and bonuses resulting from the country's economic collapse have turned the season into a time of have and have-nots. And this year, the season arrived amid a collective pessimism that followed the July 28 election. 'If they start paying ... the Christmas bonus in advance, we won't have anything left in December,' Aguiar lamented. 'I think it's a really bad idea.' Few dare speak out It remains unclear whether public and private employers will make changes to bonus payments this year. Maduro, whom electoral authorities handed a third six-year term, surprised the country on September 2 when he declared on state television that the Christmas season would start earlier than ever. Mockery followed Maduro's decree across social media, but on the streets, few dared to say anything about the decision — another sign of the chilling effect resulting from the repression campaign unleashed by the government after the highly anticipated election. Thousands of people, including minors, took to the streets across Venezuela hours after ruling party-loyal electoral authorities declared Maduro the winner without showing any vote tallies. The protests were largely peaceful, but demonstrators also toppled statues of Maduro's predecessor, the late leader Hugo Chavez, threw rocks at law enforcement officers and buildings, and burned police motorcycles and government propaganda. Maduro and his ruling party allies, who control all aspects of government, responded to the demonstrations with full force. Security forces detained more than 2,000 people, including minors, and more than 20 protesters were killed. Maduro also called on Venezuelans to denounce election doubters via a government-run app originally created to report power outages and complaints about state-provided services. This prompted people to delete photos, videos, memes, messages and apps from their phones to avoid prosecution. 'Christmas is in December' On Tuesday, while some rejected Maduro's decree for economic or political reasons, others rejected it for puritanical reasons. 'Christmas is in December. We must be clear about that, we celebrate the birth of our Lord Jesus Christ,' Wilfredo Gutierrez, 61, said while observing a group of workers setting up decorative lights along a main avenue in Caracas. 'The one good thing is that they picked up the trash. Normally, this place is dirty.'	https://www.voanews.com/a/christmas-season-starts-in-venezuela-weeks-before-halloween/7811334.html	2024-10-05T05:04:50-07:00

China: EU plan to press ahead with Chinese EV tariffs bad for ties	beijing — The European Commission's decision to press ahead with tariffs on Chinese-made electric vehicles threatens to undermine decades of cooperation between China and the EU, and endangers climate-change goals, Xinhua news agency said on Saturday. On Friday, the EU said it would push forward with hefty tariffs on China-made EVs, even after the bloc's largest economy Germany rejected them. The dispute is its biggest trade row with Beijing in a decade. State-run Xinhua said the move revealed a 'deep-seated protectionist impulse.' 'Instead of fostering co-operation, these tariffs risk sparking a trade conflict that could harm not only China-EU relations but also Europe's own ambition for a green transition,' it said. 'The path forward is clear: Protectionist tariffs must be abandoned in favor of continued negotiations.' European imports of Chinese-made EVs have soared in recent years, raising concerns among some domestic EV producers that they could suffer significant losses from a wave of cheap Chinese electric vehicles. The proposed duties on EVs built in China of up to 45% would cost carmakers billions of extra dollars to bring cars into the bloc and are set to be imposed from next month for five years. The Commission, which oversees the bloc's trade policy, has said the tariffs would counter what it sees as unfair Chinese subsidies after a yearlong anti-subsidy investigation. It said on Friday, however, that it would continue talks with Beijing. A possible compromise could be to set minimum sales prices. China's Commerce Ministry has expressed strong opposition to the planned tariffs, calling them 'unfair, non-compliant and unreasonable.' It has launched a challenge to them at the World Trade Organization. In what has been seen as retaliatory moves, Beijing this year launched probes into imports of EU brandy, dairy and pork products. The U.S. imposes a 100% duty on imported Chinese EVs.	https://www.voanews.com/a/china-eu-plan-to-press-ahead-with-chinese-ev-tariffs-bad-for-ties/7811444.html	2024-10-05T02:49:52-07:00

Militant ambush kills 6 Pakistan soldiers near Afghan border	ISLAMABAD — Pakistan said Saturday that insurgents ambushed a military convoy overnight in a volatile district bordering Afghanistan, resulting in the deaths of at least six soldiers, including an officer. The ambush occurred in North Waziristan, a former stronghold of Tehrik-i-Taliban Pakistan or TTP, a globally designated terrorist organization. A brief military statement said that six assailants were killed in the ensuing exchange of fire. It identified the slain militants as 'Khwarij,' an official reference to TTP. Multiple area security sources confirmed to VOA that the gunfire had also injured at least 22 Pakistani soldiers. The Waziristan district is in the northwestern province of Khyber Pakhtunkhwa, which has experienced a dramatic surge in TTP bombings and gun raids since the Taliban regained power in Kabul three years ago. Separately, the military reported that an intelligence-driven security operation in the province’s Swat district late on Saturday killed two TTP militant commanders and captured another. Pakistan says TTP, also referred to as the Pakistani Taliban, is based in Afghanistan and stages cross-border attacks with the help of that country’s Taliban government. Islamabad alleges that insurgents active in its southwestern Balochistan border province are increasingly using Afghan sanctuaries to orchestrate deadly attacks against the country. A report this week by the Center for Research and Security Studies documented nearly 1,000 deaths of Pakistani civilians and security forces in the first nine months of this year. The Islamabad-based think tank reported that attacks by TTP and Baloch insurgents caused most of casualties in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa and Balochistan. The Taliban government, which is officially not recognized by any country, denies Pakistani allegations and insists that neither TTP nor other foreign militant groups are on Afghan soil. However, recent United Nations Security Council assessments have disputed the Taliban’s assertions and described TTP as 'the largest terrorist group' in Afghanistan. Taliban Foreign Minister Amir Khan Muttaqi again questioned U.N. security assessments Friday, claiming their government restored 'security and stability nationwide.' He emphasized, while addressing a Russian-hosted regional conference, that they are in control of the entire Afghan territory and that no one can use it to threaten regional security. 'Occasionally, representatives of some countries in the U.N. Security Council and the media express their concern about the existence of threats on Afghan soil,' Taliban Foreign Minister Amir Khan Muttaqi said. 'We believe that the information gap about Afghanistan or disinformation by antagonist circles has found its way to international organizations,' he said, without elaborating.	https://www.voanews.com/a/militant-ambush-kills-6-pakistan-soldiers-near-afghan-border/7811433.html	2024-10-05T02:27:12-07:00	
Israeli strike hits north Lebanon as raids pummel Beirut suburbs	BEIRUT/JERUSALEM — An Israeli strike hit Lebanon's northern city of Tripoli for the first time early on Saturday, a Lebanese security source said, after more bombardment hit Beirut's suburbs and Israeli troops sought to make new ground incursions into southern Lebanon. The source told Reuters a Hamas official, his wife and two children were killed in the strike on a Palestinian refugee camp in Tripoli. Hamas-affiliated media said the strike killed a leader of the group's armed wing. The Israeli military did not immediately comment on the strike on Tripoli, a Sunni-majority port city. Israel has sharply expanded its strikes on Lebanon in recent weeks after nearly a year of exchanging fire with Lebanon's Iran-backed armed group Hezbollah. Fighting had been mostly limited to the Israel-Lebanon border area, taking place in parallel to Israel's year-old war in Gaza against Hamas. Israel has been carrying out nightly bombardment of Beirut's once densely populated southern suburbs, a stronghold of Hezbollah. Overnight, a military spokesman issued three alerts for residents there to evacuate, and Reuters witnesses then heard at least one blast. On Friday, Israel said it had targeted Hezbollah's intelligence headquarters in the southern suburbs and was assessing the damage after a series of strikes on senior figures in the group. Israel has eliminated much of Hezbollah's senior military leadership, including Secretary General Sayyed Hassan Nasrallah in an air attack on September 27. Lebanon's government says more than 2,000 people have been killed there in the past year, most in the past two weeks. Strikes on medical teams and facilities, including the Lebanese Red Cross, Lebanese public hospitals and rescue workers affiliated to Hezbollah, have also increased. Lebanon's government says more than 1.2 million Lebanese have been forced from their homes, and the United Nations says most displacement shelters in the country are full. Many had gone north to Tripoli or to neighboring Syria, but an Israeli strike on Friday closed the main border crossing between Lebanon and Syria. U.N. spokesperson Stephane Dujarric called the toll on Lebanese civilians 'totally unacceptable.' Iran defiant, Israel weighs options Israel has been weighing options in its response to Iran's ballistic missile attack on Tuesday. Oil prices have risen on the possibility of an attack on Iran's oil facilities as Israel pursues its goals of pushing back Hezbollah militants in Lebanon and eliminating their Hamas allies, also backed by Tehran, in Gaza. U.S. President Joe Biden on Friday urged Israel to consider alternatives to striking Iranian oil fields, adding that he thinks Israel has not yet concluded how to respond to Iran. Iran's Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, in a rare appearance leading Friday prayers, told a huge crowd in Tehran that Iran and its regional allies would not back down. Iranian Foreign Minister Abbas Araqchi landed in Syria on Saturday for talks after a visit to Lebanon, in which he reiterated support for Lebanon and Hezbollah. In Hezbollah's stronghold in Beirut's southern suburbs, many buildings have been reduced to rubble. 'We're alive but don't know for how long,' said Nouhad Chaib, a 40-year-old man already displaced from the south. On Friday, Hezbollah fired more than 200 rockets into Israel, according to the Israeli military, and air raid sirens continued to sound in its north on Saturday. The latest bloodletting in the decades-old Israeli-Palestinian conflict was triggered by the Palestinian Hamas group's attack on October 7, 2023, that killed 1,200 and in which about 250 were taken as hostages, according to Israeli tallies. Israel's subsequent assault on Gaza has killed over 41,000 Palestinians, according to Gaza's health ministry, and displaced nearly all of Gaza's population. Ground operations The Lebanese government has accused Israel of targeting civilians, pointing to dozens of women and children killed. It has not broken its total death toll down between civilians and Hezbollah fighters. Israel says it targets military capabilities and takes steps to mitigate the risk of harm to civilians. It accuses Hezbollah and Hamas of hiding among civilians, which they deny. Israel, which began ground operations targeting southern Lebanon this week, says they are focused on villages near the border and has said Beirut 'was not on the table,' but has not specified how long the ground incursion would last. It says the operations aim to allow tens of thousands of its citizens to return home after Hezbollah bombardments, which began on October 8, 2023, forced them to evacuate from its north. Iran's missile salvo was partly in retaliation for Israel's killing of Nasrallah, a dominant figure who had turned the group into a powerful armed and political force with reach across the Middle East. Axios cited three Israeli officials as saying that Hashem Safieddine, rumored to be Nasrallah's successor, had been targeted in an underground bunker in Beirut on Thursday night, but his fate was not clear. Israeli Foreign Minister Israel Katz posted a photo of Safieddine and Nasrallah on X on Saturday and urged Khamenei to 'take your proxies and leave Lebanon.'	https://www.voanews.com/a/israeli-strike-hits-north-lebanon-as-raids-pummel-beirut-suburbs/7811405.html	2024-10-05T00:43:42-07:00	
Christmas season starts in Venezuela, weeks before Halloween	caracas, venezuela — It doesn't feel like Christmas in Venezuela. At least not yet. Even if the president wants it to be. Residents of the capital Caracas woke up Tuesday to a towering Christmas tree standing in a popular public square, weeks after President Nicolas Maduro declared the jolly season would start earlier this year in the South American country. Workers rushed to set up decorations in neighborhoods, but the mood was far from festive. 'I think it's terrible because it's October,' said Desire Aguiar, 32, before setting up her jewelry and accessories booth in a local market. 'Halloween hasn't even passed, and it's already Christmas? Are we celebrating them together?' Venezuelans, particularly those who remember life at the turn of the century, have long associated Christmas with careless shopping and bulging wallets thanks to profit-sharing and holiday bonuses employers paid at the end of the year. Employees often received three times their monthly salary all at once. The smell of fresh paint even signaled the arrival of Christmas because so many put a new coat on their walls. These days, however, meager wages and bonuses resulting from the country's economic collapse have turned the season into a time of have and have-nots. And this year, the season arrived amid a collective pessimism that followed the July 28 election. 'If they start paying ... the Christmas bonus in advance, we won't have anything left in December,' Aguiar lamented. 'I think it's a really bad idea.' Few dare speak out It remains unclear whether public and private employers will make changes to bonus payments this year. Maduro, whom electoral authorities handed a third six-year term, surprised the country on September 2 when he declared on state television that the Christmas season would start earlier than ever. Mockery followed Maduro's decree across social media, but on the streets, few dared to say anything about the decision — another sign of the chilling effect resulting from the repression campaign unleashed by the government after the highly anticipated election. Thousands of people, including minors, took to the streets across Venezuela hours after ruling party-loyal electoral authorities declared Maduro the winner without showing any vote tallies. The protests were largely peaceful, but demonstrators also toppled statues of Maduro's predecessor, the late leader Hugo Chavez, threw rocks at law enforcement officers and buildings, and burned police motorcycles and government propaganda. Maduro and his ruling party allies, who control all aspects of government, responded to the demonstrations with full force. Security forces detained more than 2,000 people, including minors, and more than 20 protesters were killed. Maduro also called on Venezuelans to denounce election doubters via a government-run app originally created to report power outages and complaints about state-provided services. This prompted people to delete photos, videos, memes, messages and apps from their phones to avoid prosecution. 'Christmas is in December' On Tuesday, while some rejected Maduro's decree for economic or political reasons, others rejected it for puritanical reasons. 'Christmas is in December. We must be clear about that, we celebrate the birth of our Lord Jesus Christ,' Wilfredo Gutierrez, 61, said while observing a group of workers setting up decorative lights along a main avenue in Caracas. 'The one good thing is that they picked up the trash. Normally, this place is dirty.'	https://www.voanews.com/a/hold-for-wknd---christmas-season-starts-in-venezuela-weeks-before-halloween/7811334.html	2024-10-04T23:53:31-07:00	
Sex workers find themselves at center of Congo's mpox outbreak	KAMITUGA, Congo — It's been four months since Sifa Kunguja recovered from mpox, but as a sex worker, she said, she's still struggling to regain clients, with fear and stigma driving away people who've heard she had the virus. 'It's risky work,' Kunguja, 40, said from her small home in eastern Congo. 'But if I don't work, I won't have money for my children.' Sex workers are among those hardest-hit by the mpox outbreak in Kamituga, where some 40,000 of them are estimated to reside — many single mothers driven by poverty to this mineral-rich commercial hub where gold miners comprise the majority of the clientele. Doctors estimate 80% of cases here have been contracted sexually, though the virus also spreads through other kinds of skin-to-skin contact. Sex workers say the situation threatens their health and livelihoods. Health officials warn that more must be done to stem the spread — with a focus on sex workers — or mpox will creep deeper through eastern Congo and the region. Mpox causes mostly mild symptoms such as fever and body aches, but serious cases can mean prominent, painful blisters on the face, hands, chest and genitals. Kunguja and other sex workers insist that despite risks of reinfection or spreading the virus, they have no choice but to keep working. Sex work isn't illegal in Congo, though related activities such as solicitation are. Rights groups say possible legal consequences and fear of retribution — sex workers are subject to high rates of violence including rape and abuse — prevent women from seeking medical care. That can be especially detrimental during a public health emergency, according to experts. Health officials in Kamituga are advocating for the government to shutter nightclubs and mines and compensate sex workers for lost business. Not everyone agrees. Local officials say they don't have resources to do more than care for those who are sick, and insist it's sex workers' responsibility to protect themselves. Kamituga Mayor Alexandre Bundya M'pila told The Associated Press that the government is creating awareness campaigns but lacks money to reach everyone. He also said sex workers should look for other jobs, without providing examples of what might be available. Sex work a big part of economy Miners stream into Kamituga by the tens of thousands. The economy is centered on the mines: Buyers line streets, traders travel to sell gold, small businesses and individuals provide food and lodging, and the sex industry flourishes. Nearly a dozen sex workers spoke to AP. They said well over half their clients are miners. The industry is well organized, according to the Kenyan-based African Sex Workers Alliance, composed of sex worker-led groups. The alliance estimates that 13% of Kamituga's 300,000 residents are sex workers. The town has 18 sex-worker committees, the alliance said, with a leadership that tries to work with government officials, protect and support colleagues, and advocate for their rights. But sex work in Congo is dangerous. Women face systematic violence that's tolerated by society, according to a report by UMANDE, a local sex-worker rights group. Many women are forced into the industry because of poverty or because, like Kunguja, they're single parents and must support their families. Getting mpox can put sex workers out of business The sex workers who spoke to AP described mpox as an added burden. Many are terrified of getting the virus — it means time away from work, lost income and perhaps losing business altogether. Those who recover are stigmatized, they said. Kamituga is a small place, where most everyone knows one another. Neighbors whisper and tell clients when someone is sick — people talk and point. Since contracting mpox in May, Kunguja said she's gone from about 20 clients daily to five. She's been supporting her 11 children through sex work for nearly a decade but said she now can't afford to send them to school. To compensate, she's selling alcohol by day, but it's not enough. Experts say information and awareness are key Disease experts say a lack of vaccines and information makes stemming the spread difficult. Some 250,000 vaccines have arrived in Congo, but it's unclear when any will get to Kamituga. Sex workers and miners are among those slated to receive them first. Community leaders and aid groups are trying to teach sex workers about protecting themselves and their clients via awareness sessions where they discuss signs and symptoms. They also press condom use, which they say isn't widespread enough in the industry. Sex workers told AP that they insist on using condoms when they have them, but that they simply don't have enough. Kamituga's general hospital gives them boxes of about 140 condoms every few months. Some sex workers see up to 60 clients a day — for less than $1 a person. Condoms run out, and workers say they can't afford more. Dr. Guy Mukari, an epidemiologist working with the National Institute of Biomedical Research in Congo, noted that the variant running rampant in Kamituga seems more susceptible to transmission via sex, making for a double whammy with the sex industry.	https://www.voanews.com/a/sex-workers-find-themselves-at-center-of-congo-s-mpox-outbreak/7811318.html	2024-10-04T23:52:58-07:00	
Portugal looks to put new twist on cork industry	Mozelos, Portugal — Portugal, the world's leading cork producer, is finding new uses for the material, from footwear to furniture, as demand for wine bottle stoppers wanes. Producers highlight the environmentally friendly properties of cork, which is lightweight, recyclable, waterproof and fire-resistant, to encourage its use in diverse settings. Cork is obtained by stripping the bark of cork oak trees every nine years in a careful process that allows the tree to regenerate and grow, making the industry naturally sustainable. The material has 'a negative carbon footprint because it comes from a tree that captures CO2 day and night', Antonio Rios de Amorim, the CEO of the world's largest cork producer Corticeira Amorim, told AFP. The push to diversify comes as global sales of wine decline, reducing demand for cork wine stoppers which have long faced competition from cheaper plastic stoppers and screw tops. 'Periods of slowdown must be used to question what we do,' said Amorim, whose ancestors founded Corticeira Amorim 154 years ago in the northern village of Mozelos, about 30 kilometers (18 miles) south of second city Porto. Booster rockets, metro seats Thanks to cork's cell-like structure, the material is elastic and highly impermeable, making it suitable to make shoes as well as ties, pants and other clothes. Furniture designers are also increasingly drawn to the material. British designer Tom Dixon has called it a 'dream material' and put out a range of dark cork furniture that includes tables, stools and shelves using cork from Portugal. The Lisbon metro in 2020 replaced the fabric lining on all seats of its train fleet with cork, an easier to maintain material. Builders have been drawn to the material because of its unique thermal insulation and sound absorption properties. Cork is also finding its way into space. It is used in thermal protection coating on booster rockets because of its resistance 'to strong variations in temperature', said Amorim. Making wine bottle stoppers, however, remains the main activity for Portugal's cork industry, which employs around 8,000 people. Corticeira Amorim makes some six billion cork wine bottle stoppers per year, almost all of them for export mainly to Chile, France and the United States. It accounts for 70 percent of the global market share for cork stoppers and posted sales of 985 million euros (one billion dollars) in 2023, slightly lower than in the previous year. Traditional methods Cork is made from the bark of the cork oak (Quercus suber) found in countries of the Mediterranean basin. Portugal is home to about a third of the world's total area dedicated to this tree — more than any other country — and accounts for nearly half the world's supply of cork. There are also plantations in France, Spain, Italy. Algeria, Morocco and Tunisia. In the province of Ribatejo around 80 kilometers east of Lisbon, cork oaks stretch as far as the eye can see. The bark is removed from the tree in summer using traditional methods handed down from generation to generation. It is a highly precise technique 'that takes several years to learn', said Nelson Ferreira, a 43-year-old cork bark harvester, adding he takes great care not to damage the tree. The bark is then taken to Corticeira Amorim's factories in the north of Portugal where it is steam-treated, cut into smaller pieces and then fed into machines that punch out stoppers. The preservation of cork oaks is crucial for Portugal, which has made them a protected species since it takes an average of 40 years for a tree to start producing cork that can be used by cork makers.	https://www.voanews.com/a/portugal-looks-to-put-new-twist-on-cork-industry-/7810370.html	2024-10-04T23:52:21-07:00	
South Korea adoptees endure emotional searches for their birth families	SEOUL, South Korea — They began a pilgrimage that thousands before them have done. They boarded long flights to their motherland, South Korea, to undertake an emotional, often frustrating, sometimes devastating search for their birth families. These adoptees are among the 200,000 sent from South Korea to Western nations as children. Many have grown up, searched for their origin story and discovered that their adoption paperwork was inaccurate or fabricated. They have only breadcrumbs to go on: grainy baby photos, names of orphanages and adoption agencies, the towns where they were said to have been abandoned. They don't speak the language. They're unfamiliar with the culture. Some never learn their truth. 'I want my mother to know I'm OK and that her sacrifice was not in vain,' says Kenneth Barthel, adopted in 1979 at 6 years old to Hawaii. He hung flyers all over Busan, where his mother abandoned him at a restaurant. She ordered him soup, went to the bathroom and never returned. Police found him wandering the streets and took him to an orphanage. He didn't think much about finding his birth family until he had his own son, imagined himself as a boy and yearned to understand where he came from. He has visited South Korea four times, without any luck. He says he'll keep coming back, and tears rolled down his cheeks. Some who make this trip learn things about themselves they'd thought were lost forever. In a small office at the Stars of the Sea orphanage in Incheon, South Korea, Maja Andersen sat holding Sister Christina Ahn's hands. Her eyes grew moist as the sister translated the few details available about her early life at the orphanage. She had loved being hugged, the orphanage documents said, and had sparkling eyes. 'Thank you so much, thank you so much,' Andersen repeated in a trembling voice. There was comfort in that — she had been hugged, she had smiled. She'd come here searching for her family. 'I just want to tell them I had a good life and I'm doing well,' Andersen said to Sister Ahn. Andersen had been admitted to the facility as a malnourished baby and was adopted at 7 months old to a family in Denmark, according to the documents. She says she's grateful for the love her adoptive family gave her, but has developed an unshakable need to know where she came from. She visited this orphanage, city hall and a police station, but found no new clues about her birth family. Still she remains hopeful, and plans to return to South Korea to keep trying. She posted a flyer on the wall of a police station not far from the orphanage, just above another left by an adoptee also searching for his roots. Korean adoptees have organized, and now they help those coming along behind them. Nonprofit groups conduct DNA testing. Sympathetic residents, police officers and city workers of the towns where they once lived often try to assist them. Sometimes adoption agencies are able to track down birth families. Nearly four decades after her adoption to the U.S., Nicole Motta in May sat across the table from a 70-year-old man her adoption agency had identified as her birth father. She typed 'thanks for meeting me today' into a translation program on her phone to show him. A social worker placed hair samples into plastic bags for DNA testing. But the moment they hugged, Motta, adopted to the United States in 1985, didn't need the results — she knew she'd come from this man. 'I am a sinner for not finding you,' he said. Motta's adoption documents say her father was away for work for long stretches and his wife struggled to raise three children alone. He told her she was gone when he came back from one trip, and claimed his brother gave her away. He hasn't spoken to the brother since, he said, and never knew she was adopted abroad. Motta's adoption file leaves it unclear whether the brother had a role in her adoption. It says she was under the care of unspecified neighbors before being sent to an orphanage that referred her to an adoption agency, which sent her abroad in 1985. She studied his face. She wondered if she looks like her siblings or her mother, who has since died. 'I think I have your nose,' Motta said softly. They both sobbed.	https://www.voanews.com/a/south-korea-adoptees-endure-emotional-searches-for-their-birth-families/7810108.html	2024-10-04T23:51:42-07:00	
Through music and dance, Sudanese performers transport refugee audiences home	cairo — As the performers took the stage and the traditional drum beat gained momentum, Sudanese refugees sitting in the audience were moved to tears. Hadia Moussa said the melody reminded her of the country's Nuba Mountains, her family's ancestral home. 'Performances like this help people mentally affected by the war. It reminds us of the Sudanese folklore and our culture,' she said. Sudan has been engulfed by violence since April 2023, when war between the Sudanese military and the paramilitary Rapid Support Forces broke out across the country. The conflict has turned the capital, Khartoum, into an urban battlefield and displaced 4.6 million people, according to the United Nations migration agency, including more than 419,000 people who fled to Egypt. A band with 12 Sudanese members now lives with thousands of refugees in Egypt. The troupe, called 'Camirata,' includes researchers, singers and poets who are determined to preserve the knowledge of traditional Sudanese folk music and dance to keep it from being lost in the ruinous war. Founded in 1997, the band rose to popularity in Khartoum before it began traveling to different states, enlisting diverse musicians, dancers and styles. They sing in 25 different Sudanese languages. Founder Dafallah el-Hag said the band's members started relocating to Egypt recently, as Sudan struggled through a difficult economic and political transition after a 2019 popular uprising unseated longtime ruler Omar al-Bashir. Others followed after the violence began. El-Hag arrived late last year. The band uses a variety of local musical instruments on stage. El-Hag says audiences are often surprised to see instruments such as the tanbour, a stringed instrument, being played with the nuggara drums, combined with tunes of the banimbo, a wooden xylophone. 'This combination of musical instruments helped promote some sort of forgiveness and togetherness among the Sudanese people,' el-Hag said, adding that he is eager to revive a museum in Khartoum that housed historic instruments and was reportedly looted and damaged. Fatma Farid, 21, a singer and dancer from Kordofan, moved to Egypt in 2021. Her aunt was killed in 2023 when an explosive fell on their house in al-Obeid, the capital of North Kordofan. 'The way I see art has changed a lot since the war began,' she said. 'You think of what you present as an artist. You can deliver a message.' Kawthar Osman, a native of Madani city who has been singing with the band since 1997, feels nostalgic when she sings about the Nile River, which forms in Sudan from two upper branches, the Blue and White Nile. 'It reminds me of what makes Sudan the way it is,' she said, adding that the war only 'pushed the band to sing more for peace.' More than 2 million Sudanese fled the country, mostly to neighboring Egypt and Chad, where the Global Hunger Index has reported a 'serious' level of hunger. Over half a million forcibly displaced Sudanese have sought refuge in Chad, mostly women and children. Living conditions for those who stayed in Sudan have worsened as the war spread beyond Khartoum. Many made hard decisions early in the war either to flee across frontlines or risk being caught in the middle of fighting. In Darfur, the war turned particularly brutal and created famine conditions, with militias attacking entire villages and burning them to the ground. Armed robberies, lootings and the seizure of homes for bases were some of the challenges faced by Sudanese who stayed in the country's urban areas. Others struggled to secure food and water, find sources for electricity, and obtain medical treatment since hospitals were raided by fighters or hit by airstrikes. Communications networks are often barely functional. The performers say they struggle to speak with family and friends still in the country, much less think about returning. 'We don't know if we'll return to Sudan again or will see Sudan again or walk in the same streets,' Farid said.	https://www.voanews.com/a/through-music-and-dance-sudanese-performers-transport-refugee-audiences-home-/7810054.html	2024-10-04T23:51:02-07:00	
After residents flee Israeli strikes, a man in Lebanon cares for pets left behind	beirut — A dog clings to Hussein Hamza inside a car as he pans his camera around to show the aftermath of an Israeli airstrike in southern Lebanon. 'Poor thing. Look at this, he's clinging to me out of fear,' Hamza says in the video he posted online. 'A missile hit here,' he said, his voice shaking. As Israel pummels southern Lebanon with airstrikes, tens of thousands of residents are fleeing their homes in fear. But Hamza is staying. His mission is to care for the dogs and other animals left behind. He runs an animal shelter that houses 200 dogs in the village of Kfour. Recently, he has also been driving around towns and villages in the south, looking for stray animals and abandoned pets to feed. 'I opened bags of food and left them water. I'm relying on God,' said Hamza as he spread food hundreds of meters away from the shelter he runs, in case the dogs need to escape the facility when airstrikes come too close. Israel has dramatically stepped up its airstrikes across many parts of Lebanon, which it says target Hezbollah and its weapons. However over 1,000 people have been killed in the country in the past two weeks, nearly a quarter of them women and children, according to the Lebanese Health Ministry. The Lebanese government said the fighting might have displaced up to 1 million people, although the United Nations estimate is around 200,000. With his town under constant bombardment, Hamza, 56, refused to abandon the animals in his care. Despite the danger, Hamza drives around looking for stray animals and pets left behind by families, many of them abandoned behind locked gates. He brings them food, and then posts the videos online. 'Come here, come here! I got you food,' Hamza called to a dog hiding behind a fence in one of his online videos. 'At least unleash your dogs,' he pleads with residents in his videos. 'The dog owners had to escape on foot and couldn't take them.' In the midst of the chaos, Hamza has become a lifeline for many who reach out to him, hoping he can get food to their pets. 'This nice man called me, crying. They (the family) left the dogs behind the fence, and they couldn't take them,' he said. 'I just got the dogs dry food.' Hamza's journey has been perilous. On more than one occasion, he's narrowly avoided airstrikes. His work extends beyond dogs. 'We found a chicken on the road,' Hamza explained in another clip. 'It flew from a pickup truck. I will take it home.' Hamza's shelter has attracted support online, allowing him to buy 200 bags of dog food to distribute to the dogs in the region. Even so, the danger keeps mounting. 'I hope someone can take some load off my shoulders,' Hamza said as he picked up an elderly stray dog off the street and into his car. 'God help people. At the time of a strike, people lose it and don't know what to do,' he said while dropping off food and water in remote areas. With an Israeli ground invasion of south Lebanon looking increasingly likely, Hamza worries about what comes next. But for now, his focus remains on the animals. 'As long as I can reach the dogs and leave them food and water, I will not leave,' he said. 'I have a responsibility. I can't leave them.'	https://www.voanews.com/a/after-residents-flee-israeli-strikes-a-man-in-lebanon-cares-for-pets-left-behind-/7810027.html	2024-10-04T23:50:26-07:00	
Tickets for 2026 Milan-Cortina Winter Olympics cost up to 3,000 euros	milan — Ticket prices for the 2026 Milan-Cortina Winter Olympics range from 30 euros (U.S. $33) for men's and women's preliminary hockey games all the way up to nearly 3,000 euros ($3,300) for the most costly seats at the closing ceremony inside Verona's Arena, a large Roman amphitheater. The most expensive sports event is the men's hockey final with prices ranging from 450 to 1,400 euros ($500 to $1,545). Local organizers announced Thursday that more than 20% of the tickets for the games in February, 2026, are available for under 40 euros ($44) and more than half are priced at under 100 euros ($110). Anyone interested in attending should register on the official ticketing platform to enter a draw that will allocate specific time slots for purchasing tickets in the first phase of sales. Ticket prices for the Winter Paralympics in March, 2026, start at 10 euros ($11) for children under 14, with more than 200,000 tickets — about 90% of the total — available for less than ($40) euros each. It's not necessary to register for a draw for Paralympics tickets, which will go on sale in March, 2025. Starting in April, 2025, both Olympic and Paralympic tickets will be available to the general public on a first-come, first-served basis, with no need to register in advance. The 2026 Games will be held across a large swath of northern Italy, with ice sports in Milan, Alpine skiing in Bormio and Cortina, snowboard and freestyle in Livigno, Nordic sports in Val di Fiemme and biathlon in Anterselva. Questions remain whether the sliding center in Cortina will be completed in time or if bobsled, luge and skeleton events will be moved to another track in Austria (Igls), Switzerland (St. Moritz) or New York (Lake Placid).	https://www.voanews.com/a/ticket-prices-for-2026-milan-cortina-winter-olympics-range-from-30-to-nearly-3-000-euros-/7810012.html	2024-10-04T23:49:50-07:00	
Israel's air defense passes another test in fending off Iranian missile strike	jerusalem — Israel's multilayered air-defense system appears to have passed another test after fending off Iran's latest missile barrage. In Tuesday's night's strike, Iran fired over 180 missiles toward Israel. The attack set off air raid sirens across the country and sent residents scrambling for shelter, but caused only a handful of minor injuries and limited damage, in large part because many were intercepted or landed in open areas. It was the latest success for an air-defense system that over the past year has intercepted projectiles fired from Gaza, Lebanon, Syria, Iraq, Yemen and Iran. They have ranged from short-range rockets to medium-range missiles to attack drones to long-range ballistic missiles like those fired Tuesday night. In Tuesday's attack, the U.S. and Britain said they assisted in shooting down the incoming missiles. Explosions also were seen over the skies of Jordan, though it remains unclear who carried out the interceptions. But the vast majority of Israel's air defense over the past year has been carried out by Israel itself. Over the decades, Israel has developed a sophisticated system capable of detecting incoming fire and deploying only if the projectile is headed toward a population center or sensitive military or civilian infrastructure. Israeli leaders say the system isn't 100% guaranteed, but they credit it with preventing serious damage and countless casualties. Here's a closer look at Israel's multilayered air-defense system: The Arrow This system developed with the U.S. is designed to intercept long-range missiles, including the types of ballistic missiles Iran launched on Tuesday. The Arrow, which operates outside the atmosphere, has also been used in the current war to intercept long-range missiles launched by Houthi militants in Yemen. David's Sling Also developed with the U.S., David's Sling is meant to intercept medium-range missiles, such as those possessed by Hezbollah in Lebanon. It has been deployed on multiple occasions throughout the war. Iron Dome This system, developed by Israel with U.S. backing, specializes in shooting down short-range rockets. It has intercepted thousands of rockets since it was activated early last decade – including thousands of interceptions during the current war against Hamas and Hezbollah. Israel says it has a success rate of over 90%. Iron Beam Israel is developing a new system to intercept incoming threats with laser technology. Israel has said this system will be a game changer because it would be much cheaper to operate than existing systems. According to Israeli media reports, the cost of a single Iron Dome interception is about $50,000, while the other systems can run more than $2 million per missile. Iron Beam interceptions, by contrast, would cost a few dollars apiece, according to Israeli officials — but the system is not yet operational.	https://www.voanews.com/a/israel-s-air-defense-passes-another-test-in-fending-off-iranian-missile-strike-/7809997.html	2024-10-04T23:49:14-07:00	
Envoy: 'Russian leadership’ decides to delist Taliban as terrorist group	ISLAMABAD — Russia reported Friday that a 'principal decision' had already been made to remove Afghanistan’s ruling Taliban from Moscow’s list of terrorist organizations. Zamir Kabulov, the Russian presidential envoy for the South Asian nation, was quoted by state-run TASS news agency as saying that the foreign ministry and national security agencies 'are putting finishing legal touches' on the Taliban's delisting in line with federal laws. 'A principal decision on this has already been made by the Russian leadership,' said Kabulov. 'Hopefully, the final decision will be announced soon.' The remarks were reported on the same day that Moscow hosted a conference of regional countries to discuss Afghanistan, with Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov presiding over the proceedings. Lavrov later held bilateral talks with Taliban Foreign Minister Amir Khan Muttaqi, who led his delegation at Friday’s multilateral event in the Russian capital, organized under the Moscow Format platform. 'We firmly believe in the importance of maintaining a pragmatic dialogue with the current Afghan government,' Lavrov said in his inaugural speech to delegates from countries such as China, India, Iran, Kazakhstan, Kyrgyzstan, Pakistan, and Uzbekistan. 'Moscow will continue to develop political, trade, and economic ties with Kabul,' Lavrov pledged. Russia launched the Moscow Format in 2017 and it has since become a regular platform for discussing challenges facing impoverished, war-torn Afghanistan. Muttaqi, in his broadcast address to Friday’s gathering, welcomed Kazakhstan and Kyrgyzstan's recent announcements that they will remove the Taliban from their lists of outlawed groups. 'We also appreciate the positive remarks [made] by the high-ranking officials of the Russian Federation in this regard and hope to see more effective steps soon,' said the Taliban chief diplomat. Russia's involvement in Afghanistan has been tumultuous. The Soviet army entered the country in 1979 to help a pro-Moscow government in Kabul but pulled out a decade later due to heavy losses inflicted by U.S.-backed Afghan insurgents, or mujahideen. Moscow has developed close informal ties with the Taliban since they regained power in Afghanistan three years ago after the United States and NATO forces withdrew ending 20 years of war. President Vladimir Putin stated in July that Russia considered the Taliban an ally in the fight against terrorism. The former Afghan insurgent group has been on the Russian list of terrorist organizations since 2003. Russian Foreign Minister Lavrov praised the Taliban for combating narcotics in Afghanistan and fighting a regional Islamic State affiliate known as IS-Khorasan (IS-K). 'We support the Afghan authorities’ resolve to combat the terrorist threat,' he told the conference Friday. Muttaqi called on all regional countries 'to cooperate in preventing the recruitment of their citizens by ISIS and then send them to Afghanistan and other countries to carry out subversive operations.' He used an acronym for IS-K, which the United Nations describes as the most significant terrorist regional threat emanating from Afghan soil. The Taliban foreign minister did not name any country, but Kabul formally alleged last week that the terrorist group is orchestrating attacks from bases in Pakistan, charges officials in Islamabad have refuted as unfounded. No country has officially recognized the de facto Taliban government, although China and the United Arab Emirates have formally accepted Taliban-appointed ambassadors. Washington remains opposed to any step toward easing sanctions or moving toward recognition of the Taliban as Afghanistan’s rightful government, saying Kabul must improve its human rights record to win international legitimacy and support. 'We will look for interest in any outcomes and deliverables from the upcoming Moscow Format meeting, but we do not participate,' Karen Decker, the head of the Doha-based U.S. diplomatic mission for Afghanistan, told reporters Thursday. The U.S. has never attended a Moscow Format meeting because it is seen as a regional conversation, said Decker, who has also been tasked with overseeing Afghan diplomacy.	https://www.voanews.com/a/envoy-russian-leadership-decides-to-delist-taliban-as-terrorist-group/7811394.html	2024-10-04T22:35:16-07:00	
A week after Helene hit, thousands still without water struggle to find enough	ASHEVILLE, North Carolina — Nearly a week after Hurricane Helene brought devastation to western North Carolina, a shiny stainless steel tanker truck in downtown Asheville attracted residents carrying 19-liter containers, milk jugs and buckets to fill with what has become a desperately scare resource — drinking water. Flooding tore through the city's water system, destroying so much infrastructure that officials said repairs could take weeks. To make do, Anna Ramsey arrived Wednesday with her two children, who each left carrying plastic bags filled with 7.6 liters of water. 'We have no water. We have no power. But I think it's also been humbling,' Ramsey said. Helene's path through the Southeast left a trail of power outages so large the darkness was visible from space. Tens of trillions of liters of rain fell and more than 200 people were killed, making Helene the deadliest hurricane to hit the mainland U.S. since Katrina in 2005. Hundreds of people are still unaccounted for, and search crews must trudge through knee-deep debris to learn whether residents are safe. It also damaged water utilities so severely and over such a wide inland area that one federal official said the toll 'could be considered unprecedented.' As of Thursday, about 136,000 people in the Southeast were served by a nonoperational water provider and more than 1.8 million were living under a boil water advisory, according to the Environmental Protection Agency. Western North Carolina was especially hard hit. Officials are facing a difficult rebuilding task made harder by the steep, narrow valleys of the Blue Ridge Mountains that during a more typical October would attract throngs of fall tourists. 'The challenges of the geography are just fewer roads, fewer access points, fewer areas of flat ground to stage resources' said Brian Smith, acting deputy division director for the EPA's water division in the Southeast. After days without water, people long for more than just a sponge bath. 'I would love a shower,' said Sue Riles in Asheville. 'Running water would be incredible.' The raging floodwaters of Helene destroyed crucial parts of Asheville's water system, scouring out the pipes that convey water from a reservoir in the mountains above town that is the largest of three water supplies for the system. To reach a second reservoir that was knocked offline, a road had to be rebuilt. Boosted output from the third source restored water flow in some southern Asheville neighborhoods Friday, but without full repairs schools may not be able to resume in-person classes, hospitals may not restore normal operations, and the city's hotels and restaurants may not fully reopen. Even water that's unfit to drink is scarce. Drew Reisinger, the elected Buncombe County register of deeds, worries about people in apartments who can't easily haul a bucket of water from a creek to flush their toilet. Officials are advising people to collect nondrinkable water for household needs from a local swimming pool. 'One thing no one is talking about is the amount of poop that exists in every toilet in Asheville,' he said. 'We're dealing with a public health emergency.' It's a situation that becomes more dangerous the longer it lasts. Even in communities fortunate enough to have running water, hundreds of providers have issued boil water notices indicating the water could be contaminated. But boiling water for cooking and drinking is time consuming and small mistakes can cause stomach illness, according to Natalie Exum, an assistant professor at Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health. 'Every day that goes by, you could be exposed to a pathogen,' Exum said. 'These basic services that we take for granted in our everyday lives actually do do a lot to prevent illness.' Travis Edwards' faucet worked immediately after the storm. He filled as many containers as he could for himself and his child, but it didn't take long for the flow to weaken, then stop. They rationed water, switching to hand sanitizer and barely putting any on toothbrushes. '(We) didn't realize how dehydrated we were getting,' he said. Federal officials have shipped millions of liters of water to areas where people also might not be able to make phone calls or switch on the lights. Power has been restored to about 62% of homes and businesses and 8,000 crews are out working to restore power in the hardest hit parts of North Carolina, federal officials said Thursday. In 10 counties, about half of the cell sites are still down. The first step for some utilities is simply figuring out how bad the damage is, a job that might require EPA expertise in extreme cases. Ruptured water pipes are a huge problem. They often run beneath roads, many of which were crumpled and twisted by floodwaters. 'Pretty much anytime you see a major road damaged, there's a very good chance that there's a pipe in there that's also gotten damaged,' said Mark White, drinking water global practice leader at the engineering firm CDM Smith. Generally, repairs start at the treatment plant and move outward, with fixes in nearby big pipes done first, according to the EPA. 'Over time, you'll gradually get water to more and more people,' White said. Many people are still missing, and water repair employees don't typically work around search and rescue operations. It takes a toll, according to Kevin Morley, manager of federal relations with the American Water Works Association. 'There's emotional support that is really important for all the people involved. You're seeing people's lives just wiped out,' he said. Even private well owners aren't immune. Pumps on private wells may have lost power and overtopping floodwaters can contaminate them. There's often a 'blind faith' assumption that drinking water won't fail. In this case, the technology was insufficient, according to Craig Colten. Before retiring to Asheville, he was a professor in Louisiana focused on resilience to extreme weather. He hopes Helene will prompt politicians to spend more to ensure infrastructure withstands destructive storms. And climate change will only make the problem more severe, said Erik Olson, a health and food expert at the nonprofit Natural Resources Defense Council. 'I think states and the federal government really need to step back and start looking at how we're going to prepare for these extreme weather events that are going to be occurring and recurring every single year,' he said. Edwards has developed a system to save water. He'll soap dirty dishes and rinse them with a trickle of water with bleach, which is caught and transferred to a bucket — useable for the toilet. Power and some cell service have returned for him. And water distribution sites have guaranteed some measure of normalcy: Edwards feels like he can start going out to see friends again. 'To not feel guilty about using more than a cup of water to, like, wash yourself … I'm really, really grateful,' he said.	https://www.voanews.com/a/a-week-after-helene-hit-thousands-still-without-water-struggle-to-find-enough/7811367.html	2024-10-04T19:52:02-07:00

China could wage economic war on Taiwan to force surrender, report says	washington — U.S. military officials and analysts have for years warned of possible armed attacks or blockades by China on Taiwan, but a report released Friday has raised a red flag about possible nonmilitary tactics that could be used effectively against the self-governed island. Beijing could wage an economic and cyber war to force a surrender from Taiwan without direct use of military power, the Foundation for Defense of Democracies, a Washington research institute, said in the report. Such a likely but overlooked scenario, it said, poses a challenge for the U.S., the island's biggest ally, and it suggested Washington make preparations for how best to respond. FDD researchers teamed up with banking and finance experts in Taiwan over two days earlier this year to simulate likely nonmilitary moves by Beijing, such as disinformation campaigns and cyberattacks on infrastructure. The exercise was the first of its kind and sought to fill an analytical gap, FDD said. 'Modern globalization has created more economic connections that China can exploit to achieve coercive aims,' the report said. 'Technological innovation created even more digital connections, offering more possibilities for coercion, including through the targeting of critical infrastructure.' Beijing has vowed to take Taiwan by force if necessary, although Chinese President Xi Jinping has promised to make 'utmost efforts' to do so peacefully. Taiwan split from the mainland in 1949 during a civil war when the defeated nationalist government fled to the island. Years of pressure Tensions have flared in the Taiwan Strait since 2016 when Beijing began to increase diplomatic and military pressure on the island, prompting the U.S. to step up its support. Washington, which is obligated under U.S. law to provide Taipei with sufficient military hardware for its defense, has argued that it is in the U.S. interest to keep peace in the strait and to stand with democracies such as Taiwan to maintain the rules-based world order. Beijing has demanded the U.S. stay out of Taiwan, arguing it is a purely domestic affair. President Joe Biden has indicated he would send troops to defend Taiwan in case of an armed attack from China, but the U.S. government has yet to formulate a plan to respond to nonmilitary tactics, giving Beijing flexibility in working to undermine Taiwan without triggering an outright response from Washington that a military invasion would, the FDD researchers said. Taiwan’s foreign and defense ministries had no immediate comment on the report. With an estimated 1 million Taiwanese living and working in China, economic ties have grown ever closer. That has made the possibility of economic coercion, boycotts and military blockades an even bigger threat. Possible moves In the simulation exercises, the experts from the U.S. and Taiwan studied possible moves by Beijing such as conducting psychological wars to erode public trust, banning imports of Taiwanese products or raising tariffs on them, short-selling Taiwanese stocks, freezing bank transfers across the strait, cutting fiber-optic cables, and targeting energy imports and storage. The report recommended that Taiwan diversify its energy imports, relocate businesses away from the mainland, develop new markets, and build alliances and partnerships. The report also suggested that the United States develop a playbook of options to counter China and improve coordination with allies. The Taiwan Academy of Banking and Finance, which worked with FDD on the simulation exercises, has argued that Taiwan must strengthen its financial resilience. 'China could destabilize Taiwan’s financial system to incite social unrest as a precursor to invasion,' the report said. Russell Hsiao, executive director of the Washington-based Global Taiwan Institute, said that Beijing has already been ramping up nonmilitary measures against Taiwan and that such efforts are expected to intensify in the coming years. 'It behooves the United States and Taiwan to work with allies and like-minded partners to strengthen our collective resilience to China’s weaponization of economic interdependence,' Hsiao said.	https://www.voanews.com/a/china-could-wage-economic-war-on-taiwan-to-force-surrender-report-says-/7811357.html	2024-10-04T18:57:14-07:00

Somalia-Ethiopia tensions escalate; UN urges diplomatic resolution	washington — In a crucial week for Somalia's security plan, discussions in Washington and New York have underscored the urgent need for preparation for the upcoming African Union Support Mission in Somalia (AUSSOM), as escalating tensions between Somalia and Ethiopia over a maritime agreement Ethiopia signed with Somaliland raised concerns among international stakeholders. Somalia is set to determine the composition of its upcoming AUSSOM following the expiration of the current AU mission. Hussein Moalim, Somalia's national security adviser, stated that Somalia is firm in its position on Ethiopian forces' participation in the new mission. 'Somalia would not consider Ethiopian troops to be part of the new mission unless it withdraws from the illegal memorandum of understanding signed with [Somalia's breakaway region of] Somaliland earlier this year,' Moalim said Thursday in an interview with VOA Somali. The controversial memorandum of understanding, also known as an MoU, has escalated tensions between the two neighboring nations, granting Ethiopia access to a 20-kilometer (12.4 mile) stretch of Red Sea coastline in return for potential recognition of Somaliland's independence. Somalia views the MoU, signed in January, as a violation of its sovereignty and territorial integrity, leading to a diplomatic rift that has included the expulsion of the Ethiopian ambassador from Mogadishu and threats to remove thousands of Ethiopian troops stationed in parts of south and central regions of the country. Despite two rounds of mediated talks by Turkey yielding no results, Somalia's State Minister of Foreign Affairs Ali Omar Balcad insists that effective dialogue hinges on addressing issues of Somalia's sovereignty infringement and restoring trust. 'First we need to solve the issue on our sovereignty infringement and second to restore the trust and the diplomatic relations between us, and then there comes the negotiation on the Ethiopia desire to access our sea and ports,' said Balcad in an interview with VOA Somali. UN urges diplomatic resolution In New York, the United Nations Security Council addressed the security situation in Somalia on Thursday, stressing the urgency of finalizing plans for the new AU stabilization mission. During the discussion, concerns were raised regarding escalating tensions between Somalia and Ethiopia, with James Swan, acting special representative of the secretary-general, urging both nations to seek a diplomatic solution within the framework of international law. Ambassador Robert Wood, the U.S. alternative representative for special political affairs, echoed these sentiments, highlighting the detrimental impact of rising tensions on regional security. 'Colleagues, we are deeply concerned about rising tension between Ethiopia and Somalia and the negative impact it is having on shared security interests,' Wood said. In discussions held in Washington this week, Somali officials, along with representatives from the U.S., Qatar, Turkey, the United Arab Emirates and the U.K., emphasized the urgency of finalizing funding options for the new peacekeeping mission. Somalia's Moalim reiterated the commitment of international partners to support Somalia's security, stability and sovereignty. 'The partners reaffirmed their unwavering support for the federal government of Somalia in its efforts to attain stability and security across the nation,' he said. Ethopia denies Somalia's allegations Briefing the U.N. Security Council, Somali Foreign Minister Ahmed Moalim Fiqi accused Ethiopia of using the fight against terrorism as a pretext for territorial expansion. 'Let me be clear. The claim that Ethiopia is in Somalia to fight terrorism is a pretext for annexation,' Fiqi asserted, adding that Somalia has intercepted three illegal arms shipments from Ethiopia in the past three months, fueling local conflicts and empowering extremist groups. 'We call these actions a clear violation of Somalia's sovereignty,' he said. Ethiopia has been constantly denying Somalia's accusations against Ethiopia, including its intention behind the MoU signed with Somaliland. During last month's meeting of U.N. General Assembly, Ethiopian Foreign Minister Taye Atske-Selassie said his country had nothing to do with Somalia's allegations. 'Ethiopia's memorandum of understanding with Somaliland is based on existing political dispensation in Somalia,' he said. 'Our objective is a shared growth and prosperity in the region. Similar agreements have been concluded by other states, and there is no reason for the government of Somalia to incite hostility that obviously intends to cover internal political tensions,' he added. 'I therefore reject the unfounded allegations leveled against my country.' Falastin Iman in Washington contributed to this report, which originated in VOA's Somali Service.	https://www.voanews.com/a/somalia-s-security-dilemma-ethiopia-tensions-dominate-discussions-on-au-peacekeeping/7811115.html	2024-10-04T17:42:50-07:00	
China's National Day holiday subdued amid sluggish economy	washington — China's weeklong celebration of its National Day, from October 1, is known as the 'golden week' because it's the Asian giant's biggest week for travel, tourism and leisure spending. However, some Chinese who spoke to VOA Mandarin described this year's National Day as a national day of mourning because of higher costs while the economy is struggling. All those interviewed by VOA asked that their names not be used out of fear of retaliation from the Chinese government for their negative comments. Despite returning from a holiday in Japan in September, a 37-year-old white-collar worker in Beijing chose to join the crowd of travelers during China's National Day holiday for a seven-day vacation in South Korea. 'Usually the ticket is only 2,000 yuan [about $284], but now it has risen to almost 4,000 [about $568] during the National Day holiday. But I still decided to go out and have fun. Otherwise, what are you doing in Beijing? It's so boring,' she told VOA. The well-off urban dweller said, 'I went to get a manicure today, and the lady said that all of her friends have lost their jobs. Now a lot of people don't have money. The domestic economy is not good. We just don't know how bad it is, and we can't see the truth.' She noticed that even though it is the 75th anniversary of the founding of the Communist Party of China, Beijing did not have many large-scale celebrations or a festive atmosphere, except for displays of national flags and flowerbeds. The Beijing resident thought the main reason was that the economy is suffering. 'Many people have lost their jobs, and if a grand National Day celebration were held, it would definitely be criticized. The government might not have the money to hold a celebration either,' she said. China also usually holds more elaborate celebrations when it hits a new decade for its founding anniversary. Not in 'mood' to celebrate A man who lives in Shanghai and works in the publishing industry said he believed that in today's China, national pride is becoming less and less marketable. He told VOA Mandarin, 'It's because the people's personal [economic] lives are not good. And now there is a bit of a difficult situation at home and abroad, and people are not in the mood for celebrations.' A middle-class translator who lives in Beijing told VOA Mandarin he and his friends thought that 'the national fortune is very gray' because the economy is unpredictable. 'Who would want to invest? So, are your economic fundamentals getting better? Is your business environment improving? Is your international environment improving? I think these are some of the basic questions,' he said. 'Not to mention the rule of law. So, we want it to get better, but you tell me, which aspect is getting better?' Li Yang, vice minister of transport, said at a press conference held by the State Council Information Office on September 27 that the cross-regional flow of people during this year's National Day holiday would reach 1.94 billion, with an average 277 million people traveling per day, and 80% of the trips by private vehicles. This would be an average daily increase of 0.7% over the same period last year and an average daily increase of 19.4% over the same period in 2019. The increase in travelers will give at least a temporary boost to domestic consumption, which China has been encouraging since the COVID-19 pandemic, especially as an overreliance on exports has fueled tariff retaliation from trade partners. But while stimulus measures last week boosted China's stock markets by the most since 2008, economists noted the fundamental reliance on exports has not changed and China's property market — a pillar of its domestic economy — is still struggling. 'Just a relative rebound' Despite jumps in markets, and travel for the golden week holiday, the translator and the white-collar worker said these did not signal a return to prosperity. 'It's not that your income is higher after three years of the pandemic, it's that you had spent less during the pandemic,' said the translator. 'It's just a relative rebound.' He continued, 'Generally speaking, the National Day has become a national mourning,' adding that if there is another pandemic or major upheaval, many people will not be able to maintain their standard of living. While China's middle class lamented the country's downturn, they noted the lives of people with limited skills are the most difficult. Meanwhile, taxi drivers are taking advantage of the temporary increase in passengers for the National Day holiday to earn as much as they can. The publisher told VOA he took a ride-hailing application taxi in Shanghai, and it was the driver's first week. 'He hadn't gotten out of the car for a week and even slept in the car,' he said. 'He slept in the car when he was tired and drove when he woke up.' He said, 'I asked the taxi driver today, 'How do you plan for the National Day? How many days a week do you work?' He said, 'If there were eight days in a week, I would work eight days and not think about vacation travel at all.' ' China's Transport Ministry described passenger transport since the beginning of this year as 'robust,' with nearly 44 billion passenger trips recorded during the first eight months, a 6% increase from the same period last year.	https://www.voanews.com/a/china-s-national-day-holiday-subdued-amid-sluggish-economy/7811095.html	2024-10-04T16:40:34-07:00

Belarus court sentences activists for attempted sabotage of Russian plane	moscow — A court in Minsk sentenced a dozen individuals to prison terms of between two and 25 years Friday for helping commit what Belarus has called an 'act of terrorism' at a military airfield outside the capital last year. A group of Belarusian anti-government activists said in February 2023 that they had blown up a sophisticated Russian military surveillance aircraft in a drone attack at the base. Russia and Belarus dismissed the assertion as fake, with Belarusian state television publishing footage showing what it said was the undamaged Beriev A-50 surveillance craft. About a week later, Minsk said it had detained a 'terrorist' and more than 20 accomplices over attempted sabotage at the airfield. Belarusian President Alexander Lukashenko, a close ally of Kremlin leader Vladimir Putin, alleged at the time that Ukrainian security services and the U.S. Central Intelligence agency were behind the operation. He said the aircraft had suffered only superficial damage in the attack, which was carried out using a 'small drone,' the Belta news agency reported. On Friday, Belarus' general prosecutor's office said the Minsk City Court had sentenced 12 individuals after finding them guilty of terrorism, extremism and other serious crimes. The main defendant, Ukrainian national Nikolai Shvets, was sentenced in absentia to 25 years in prison. Shvets, who gave an interview to Belarusian state television last April in which he detailed how he planned the attack, was released in a prisoner exchange with Ukraine in June, according to Belarusian rights group Viasna. It was not clear how many of the others were sentenced in absentia.	https://www.voanews.com/a/belarus-court-sentences-activists-for-attempted-sabotage-of-russian-plane-/7811091.html	2024-10-04T15:53:02-07:00	
China-connected spamouflage networks spread antisemitic disinformation	washington — Spamouflage networks with connections to China are posting antisemitic conspiracy theories on social media, casting doubt on Washington's independence from alleged Jewish influence and the integrity of the two U.S. presidential candidates, a joint investigation by VOA Mandarin and Taiwan's Doublethink Lab, a social media analytics firm, has found. The investigation has so far uncovered more than 30 such X posts, many of which claim or suggest that core American political institutions, including the White House and Congress, have pledged loyalty to or are controlled by Jewish elites and the Israeli government. One post shows a graphic of 18 U.S. officials of Jewish descent, including Secretary of State Antony Blinken, Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen, and the head of the Homeland Security Department, Alejandro Mayorkas, and asks: 'Jews only make up 2% of the U.S. population, so why do they have so many representatives in important government departments?!' Another post shows a cartoon depicting Vice President Kamala Harris, the Democratic candidate for president, and her opponent, Donald Trump, having their tongues tangled together and wrapped around an Israeli flagpole. The post proclaims that 'no matter who of them comes to power, they will not change their stance on Judaism.' Most of the 32 posts analyzed by VOA Mandarin and Doublethink Lab were posted during July and August. The posts came from three spamouflage accounts, two of which were previously reported by VOA. Each of the three accounts leads its own spamouflage network. The three networks consist of 140 accounts, which amplify content from the three main accounts, or seeders. A spamouflage network is a state-sponsored operation disguised as the work of authentic social media users to spread pro-government narratives and disinformation while discrediting criticism from adversaries. Jasper Hewitt, a digital intelligence analyst at Doublethink Lab, told VOA Mandarin that the impact of these antisemitic posts has been limited, as most of them failed to reach real users, despite having garnered over 160,000 views. U.S. officials have cast China as one of the major threats looking to disrupt this year's election. Beijing, however, has repeatedly denied these allegations and urged Washington to 'not make an issue of China in the election.' Tuvia Gering, a nonresident fellow at the Atlantic Council's Global China Hub, has closely followed antisemitic disinformation coming from China. He told VOA Mandarin that Beijing isn't necessarily hostile toward Jews, but anti-Semitic conspiracy theories have historically been a handy tool to be used against Western countries. 'You can trace its origins back to the Cold War, when the Soviet Union promoted antisemitic conspiracy theories all over the world just to instigate in Western societies,' Gering said, 'because it divides them from within and it casts the West in a bad light in a strategic competition. [It's] the same thing you see here [with China].' Anti-Semitic speech floods Chinese internet Similar antisemitic narratives about U.S. politics posted by the spamouflage accounts have long been flourishing on the Chinese internet. An article that received thousands of likes and reposts on Chinese social media app WeChat claims that 'Jewish capital' has completed its control of the American political sphere 'through infiltration, marriages, campaign funds and lobbying.' The article also brings up the Jewish heritage of many current and former U.S. officials and their families as evidence of the alleged Jewish takeover of America. 'The wife of the U.S. president is Jewish, the son-in-law of the former U.S. president is Jewish, the mother of the previous former U.S. president was Jewish, the U.S. Secretary of State is Jewish, the U.S. Secretary of Treasury is Jewish, the Deputy Secretary of State, the Attorney General … are all Jewish,' it wrote. In fact, first lady Jill Biden is Roman Catholic, and the mother of former President Barack Obama was raised as a Christian. The others named are Jewish. Conspiracy theories and misinformation abounded on the Chinese internet after the U.S. House of Representatives passed a bill in May that would empower the Department of Education to adopt a new set of standards when investigating antisemitism in educational programs. Articles and videos assert that the bill marks the death of America because it 'definitively solidifies the superior and unquestionable position of the Jews in America,' claiming falsely that anyone who's labeled an antisemite will be arrested. One video with more than 1 million views claimed that the New Testament of the Bible would be deemed illegal under the bill. And since all U.S. presidents took their inaugural oath with the Bible, the bill allegedly invalidates the legitimacy of the commander in chief. None of that is true. The Chinese public hasn't historically been hostile toward Jews. A 2014 survey published by the Anti-Defamation League, a U.S.-based group against antisemitism, found that only 20% of the participants from China harbored an antisemitic attitude. But when the Israel-Hamas conflict broke out a year ago, the otherwise heavily censored Chinese social media was flooded with antisemitic comments and praise for Nazi Germany leader Adolf Hitler. The Chinese government has dismissed criticism of antisemitism on its internet. When asked about it at a news conference last year, Wang Wenbin, then the spokesperson of the Foreign Ministry, said that 'China's laws unequivocally prohibit disseminating information on extremism, ethnic hatred, discrimination and violence via the internet.' But online hate speech against Jews has hardly disappeared. Eric Liu, a former censor for Chinese social media Weibo who now monitors online censorship, told VOA Mandarin that whenever Israel is in the news, there would be a surge in online antisemitism. Just last month, after dozens of members of the Lebanon-based militant group Hezbollah were killed by explosions of their pagers, Chinese online commentators acidly condemned Israel and Jews. The attack 'proves that Jews are the most terrifying and cowardly people,' one Weibo user wrote. 'They are self-centered and believe themselves to be superior, when in fact they are considered the most indecent and shameless. When the time comes, it's going to be blood for blood.'	https://www.voanews.com/a/china-connected-spamouflage-networks-spread-antisemitic-disinformation/7811033.html	2024-10-04T15:38:25-07:00

River level in Amazon rainforest hits 122-year low amid drought, wildfires	manaus, brazil — The river port in the Amazon rainforest's largest city of Manaus on Friday hit its lowest level since 1902, as a drought drains waterways and snarls transport of grain exports and essential supplies that are the region's lifeline. Below-average rainfall — even through the rainy season — has plagued the Amazon and much of South America since last year, also feeding the worst wildfires in more than a decade in Brazil and Bolivia. Millions of hectares of forest and farmland have burned in Argentina, Colombia, Ecuador, Paraguay and Peru as well. The same extreme heat and dryness that is driving the surging fires in the Amazon is impacting neighboring Pantanal, the world's largest wetlands. Bolivia is also on track to break a record for the most fires ever recorded, according to data from Brazil's space research agency. The Amazon basin, usually one of the wettest places on Earth, is experiencing its worst fires in nearly two decades, according to the European Union's Copernicus Observatory. And last week, satellite images from the National Institute for Space Research showed 80% of Brazil affected by smoke. Researchers say climate change is the main culprit behind wildfires and the drought. Scientists predict the Amazon region may not fully recover moisture levels until 2026. Last year, the drought became a humanitarian crisis, as people reliant on rivers were stranded without food, water or medicine. This year authorities are already on alert. In hard-hit Amazonas state, at least 62 municipalities are under states of emergency with more than half a million people affected, according to the state's civil defense corps. 'This is now the most severe drought in over 120 years of measurement at the Port of Manaus,' said Valmir Mendonca, the port's head of operations, who said the river level is likely to keep falling for another week or two. With the region never fully recovering because of weaker-than-usual seasonal rains, many of the impacts of the drought last year look set to repeat or reach new extremes. The Port of Manaus measured the Rio Negro at 12.66 meters Friday, according to its website, surpassing the previous all-time low recorded last year and still falling rapidly. The Rio Negro is a major tributary of the Amazon River, the world's largest river by volume. The port sits near the 'meeting of the waters' where the black water of the Negro meets the sandy-colored Solimoes, which also hit a record low this week. Grain shipments have been halted on the Madeira River, another tributary of the Amazon, because of low water levels, a port association said last month. Researchers are again finding the carcasses of Amazon freshwater river dolphins, which they blame on thinning waters driving the threatened species into closer contact with humans. National disaster monitoring agency Cemaden has already called the drought Brazil's worst such event since at least the 1950s. The drought has also sapped hydropower plants, Brazil's main source of electricity. Energy authorities have approved bringing back daylight saving time to conserve electricity, although the measure still requires presidential approval. The extreme weather and dryness are affecting much of South America, with the Paraguay River also at an all-time low. That river starts in Brazil and flows through Paraguay and Argentina to the Atlantic.	https://www.voanews.com/a/river-level-in-amazon-rainforest-hits-122-year-low-amid-drought-wildfires-/7811024.html	2024-10-04T14:33:43-07:00	
Despite obstacles, new NATO leader aims to increase support for Ukraine	london — With an escalating war in the Middle East, uncertainty over Western military aid for Ukraine, and the U.S. presidential election looming next month, new NATO Secretary-General Mark Rutte has no time to settle in. The former Dutch prime minister was appointed to the role at a ceremony at NATO headquarters in Brussels on Tuesday, where he told delegates that 'there can be no lasting security in Europe without a strong, independent Ukraine,' and affirmed that 'Ukraine's rightful place is in NATO.' On Thursday, Rutte was welcomed by Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy to Kyiv. Zelenskyy wasted no time in relaying his demands. 'We have discussed the most urgent needs of our troops, the weapons and the recruitment to the brigades,' Zelenskyy said at a news conference alongside Rutte on Thursday. 'We will have more time today to discuss more details on how to strengthen Ukraine's positions on the front so that we can exert more pressure on Russia in order to support just and realistic diplomacy. That is why we need sufficient quantity and quality of weapons, including long-range weapons, the decision on which, in my opinion, our Western partners are delaying,' he told reporters. Ukraine wants to use Western long-range missiles on targets inside Russia. The U.S. and other allies are holding back, fearing escalation with Moscow. NATO's new secretary-general made his position clear. 'Ukraine obviously has the right to defend itself and international law is on the side of Ukraine, meaning that this right does not end at the border. Russia is pursuing this illegal war … targeting Russian fighter jets and missiles before they can be used against Ukraine's civilian infrastructure can help save lives,' Rutte told reporters. Ukraine's president was asked whether he feared the world was forgetting about his country, amid the escalating conflict in the Middle East. 'I wish that Ukraine is not forgotten,' Zelenskyy said. 'And the best way to show this is by giving particular weapons, by giving particular permissions. And help to shoot down hostile drones — by the way, the same Iranian rockets and drones — to shoot them down the same way as they are shot down in the sky of Israel. Do the same over the skies of Ukraine.' Rutte is a longtime ally of Ukraine, noted analyst Armida van Rij, a senior research fellow at the London-based think tank Chatham House. 'While he was prime minister of the Netherlands, he was very supportive of Ukraine. He's the one who signed off on the F-16s [fighter jets] deal for Ukraine as well. So, there is that history of support,' van Rij told VOA. However, Rutte is facing headwinds as he tries to boost military support for Ukraine among NATO allies. Next month, U.S. voters will choose a new president: Donald Trump or Kamala Harris. Rutte said he would work with whoever is elected — but neither outcome will be straightforward, said van Rij. 'There is a real risk for Ukraine that Trump may try to force Ukraine's hand and force Ukraine to capitulate to Russia, which would be terrible for European security. That's the first challenge. But the second challenge is even if Vice President Harris were to win the U.S. elections, she may still face a divided Congress and she may still struggle to pass aid packages in support for Ukraine through Congress.' Either scenario would require European NATO allies to step up their military aid. 'And there again, there's challenges because many countries have depleted their stocks. They've given as much as they feel comfortable with at this point. What I would like to see is to think through some of the practical ways in which we can advance EU and NATO collaborations specifically on this issue of developing a European defense industrial base,' van Rij told VOA. There are fears in Europe that a victory for Trump could upend the United States' relationship with NATO. 'Like [former NATO Secretary-General Jens] Stoltenberg, Rutte is known as a 'Trump whisperer.' He is one of the few European politicians who developed a good working relationship with Donald Trump. However, a potential second Trump term could prove much more disruptive, with less U.S. aid to Ukraine, more concessions to Russia and further questioning of the value of NATO,' said Oana Lungescu, a distinguished fellow at Britain's Royal United Services Institute (RUSI) and a former NATO spokesperson, in an email to VOA. The Kremlin said this week that Russian President Vladimir Putin knew Rutte well from his time as Dutch prime minister. 'At that time there were hopes of building good pragmatic relations,' Kremlin spokesperson Dmitry Peskov told reporters in a phone call Tuesday. 'But we know what followed — the Netherlands adopted a rather defiant attitude to fully exclude all contacts with Russia. So, we don't think that anything new or significant will happen with the policy of the [NATO] alliance,' Peskov said. Meanwhile, Rutte takes the helm of NATO as it faces an increasingly assertive China. 'On Ukraine, everyone's very much on the same line. On China, there's still some allies saying, 'We're not sure we need to quite go into the Indo-Pacific theater.' In a scenario where U.S. resources and capabilities are drawn elsewhere, i.e., the Indo-Pacific, Europeans have to be able to fend for themselves — including look after Ukraine in the current short-term scenario,' van Rij told VOA. Rutte said another priority would be to strengthen NATO's partnerships with allies outside the alliance in an interconnected world. His primary focus must be on keeping NATO members safe, said Lungescu of RUSI. 'As NATO secretary-general, Rutte must take the lead in arguing for more defense spending across the alliance,' Lungescu said. 'He should make a strong case not just about figures and percentages, but about the concrete capabilities that are needed to keep NATO nations safe in a dangerous world.'	https://www.voanews.com/a/despite-obstacles-new-nato-leader-aims-to-boost-support-for-ukraine-/7810976.html	2024-10-04T14:28:16-07:00	
Uganda's military threatens US ambassador with expulsion	kampala, uganda — The chief of Uganda’s defense forces, General Muhoozi Kainerugaba, has given U.S. Ambassador William Popp until Monday morning to apologize or leave the country. It is not clear why Kainerugaba, who is President Yoweri Museveni’s son, issued the ultimatum to the ambassador, although this week the United States sanctioned four Ugandan police officers for human rights violations. On Friday, Kainerugaba took to X three times to say Uganda was about to have a serious confrontation with Popp for 'disrespecting our beloved and celebrated president and for undermining the constitution of Uganda.' Five hours later, Kainerugaba tweeted again, saying if Popp did not apologize to the president personally by 9 a.m. Monday for what the general called Popp’s undiplomatic behavior, the government would demand that he leave. Speaking to VOA, Sewanyana Livingstone, director of the Foundation for Human Rights Initiative Uganda, said Kainerugaba has no authority to declare Popp persona non grata unless he is appointed minister of foreign affairs. Sewanyana said Kainerugaba’s comments should be dismissed. 'He needs to calm down. He needs to understand that Uganda is not him, neither is he Uganda,' Sewanyana said. 'Uganda will always be there. Sanctions are not the functions of an ambassador. They are issued by the State Department. So, I think he is even targeting the wrong person. I think Ugandans need to call him to order. It’s high time.' On Wednesday, U.S. State Department spokesperson Matthew Miller said four Ugandan police officers had been sanctioned for gross violations of human rights. These included torture and cruel inhumane treatment and punishment. The police officers were identified as Bob Kagarura, Alex Mwine, Elly Womanya and Hamdani Twesigye. The State Department said reports of the violations as documented by Ugandan civil court documents, civil society organizations and independent journalists were serious and credible. Ugandan authorities did not respond to requests for comment. A report released last month by the African Center for Treatment and Rehabilitation of Torture Victims, or ACTV, noted that torture cases in Uganda were on the rise despite laws against the practice. Herbert Sam Nsubuga, executive director of ACTV, said the organization was concerned about the situation in Uganda. 'The situation is not as good as we want it to be,' Nsubuga said. 'Because just halfway this year, we have made 903 cases. So, it’s still really an issue.' In 2023, monitors in Uganda recorded 1,235 cases of torture, with the Uganda People’s Defense forces and police as top perpetrators. The four designated officers in April 2020 raided a Ugandan legislator's home, accusing him of violating the regulations put in place to control the spread of COVID-19 as he distributed food to vulnerable communities. According to records produced in court, the legislator, Francis Zaake, was arrested and detained at the Defense Intelligence and Security headquarters, where he was tortured before he was left at a hospital. He later sued the four officers, and a court awarded him $20,400. In response to VOA questions on Kainerugaba’s threats, the U.S. Embassy in Uganda quoted State Department spokesman Miller as saying the embassy, the ambassador and the U.S. government were continuing to work directly and normally every day with Ugandan authorities on a full range of issues. Miller said in accordance with U.S. law, the United States was committed to supporting justice for victims and accountability of those involved in human rights violations around the world. This, he said, includes denying or restricting travel visas to visit the United States for individuals when there is demonstrated evidence that they have committed abuses.	https://www.voanews.com/a/uganda-s-military-threatens-us-ambassador-with-expulsion-/7810960.html	2024-10-04T13:55:46-07:00	
India faces tough balancing act amid escalating Middle East conflict	new delhi / washington — Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi presided over a Cabinet meeting on security Friday to address the escalating conflict in the Middle East. According to Press Trust of India, the meeting focused on the implications on trade and the supply of petroleum products. India expressed grave concern regarding the escalation of the security situation involving Israel and its neighbors, emphasizing that 'the conflict must not take a wider regional dimension.' In view of the increasing tensions, the question is how India will balance its relations with all parties if the situation becomes worse. Analysts in New Delhi say India should adopt a neutral stance, especially if the situation worsens and a formal war breaks out between Iran and Israel. India's major concern is a potential extended disruption in trade. Traders worldwide are preparing for this, as the crucial Red Sea shipping route could stay closed to international shipping lines longer than initially expected, likely keeping freight rates and petroleum prices elevated. Former Indian diplomat Rajiv Dogra told VOA that if the situation got more tense, it would affect the supply chain, imports and exports, and India's interests in the region. Dogra said that big powers were trying to ensure that the situation does not deteriorate, and that India was also trying to establish peace. Journalist and author Nilofar Suhrawardy told VOA there would not be a formal war. Suhrawardy referred to U.S. President Joe Biden's statement that said that the Israeli reaction to the Iranian attack should be proportionate. She said the Iranian ballistic missile attack Tuesday on Israel was in reaction to the September 27 killing of Hezbollah leader Hassan Nasrallah. Nasrallah was killed in an Israeli airstrike on the militant group's headquarters in Beirut, Lebanon. But if there is a full-scale war, what will be India's stand? Analysts said India would take a neutral stand. According to Suhrawardy, India has good relations with Israel, Iran, Arab countries and the Palestinians, so it will not take any party's side. She said she believed the policy India adopted in the Ukraine-Russia conflict would be applied to the Israel-Iran conflict, too. Modi has spoken to Palestinian Authority President Mahmoud Abbas and Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu in the past two weeks. On September 23, he met Abbas in New York on the sidelines of the U.N. General Assembly. Modi spoke to Netanyahu by phone on Monday. The Indian leader condemned terrorism and urged the release of citizens held hostage by Hamas.

Gang attacks Haitian town, killing more than 70	new york — The United Nations secretary-general joined the Haitian prime minister Friday in strongly condemning a horrific overnight gang attack on a town outside Haiti's capital that killed at least 70 people, including at least 10 women and three infants. 'The criminals responsible for these abominable acts will be hunted down and brought to justice, without respite,' Prime Minister Garry Conille said in a statement. Haiti's transition government said members of the Gran Grif gang perpetrated the attack in the town of Pont Sonde in the Artibonite department. A report in the Haiti Gazette said the gang was trying to extort money from the local population and they resisted paying it. The massacre was retribution. The U.N. human rights office said gang members firing automatic rifles also reportedly set fire to at least 45 houses and 34 vehicles, forcing a number of residents to flee. At least 3,000 people have been displaced by the attack. A number of people were also wounded, including two gang members. Sixteen people suffered serious injuries, the U.N. said. The government said many of the injured are being treated at the Saint-Nicolas public hospital in Saint-Marc. 'As gang violence continues to spread from the capital to other departments of Haiti, the secretary-general stresses the importance of the joint efforts undertaken by the Haitian National Police and the multinational security support mission,' Antonio Guterres' spokesperson told reporters Friday. 'Those efforts need to be supported.' In June, a multinational security support mission, or MSS, began its first deployment of about 400 police from Kenya, which is also leading the mission. About 100 others from Jamaica and Belize have also been deployed to assist the embattled Haitian National Police in subduing armed gangs, which have been terrorizing the country's capital and some outer lying areas. Other countries are expected to contribute police officers to the force. The mission has been beset with delays and financial and equipment shortages. But it has had some success inside the capital. The government said agents from the Haitian National Police Anti-Gang Unit have been deployed as reinforcements to support teams already on the ground in Artibonite. Specialized police units supported by the MSS are also deploying to the area. Haiti has been rocked by instability since 2021, when President Jovenel Moise was assassinated. Prime Minister Ariel Henry then led the country until he announced his resignation in March. A transitional government is now in place with the goal of organizing free and fair elections. Haiti has not held elections since 2016. The country is facing a massive humanitarian crisis due to the violence. On Monday, international food monitors said more than half the country's population — 5.4 million people — are struggling to feed themselves. At least 6,000 displaced persons in shelters in the capital are facing catastrophic levels of hunger, while 2 million people are one step behind them.	https://www.voanews.com/a/gang-attacks-haitian-town-killing-more-than-70-/7810831.html	2024-10-04T12:24:54-07:00	
Exiled media fight to keep Belarusian language alive	washington — While the Belarusian government continues a long-running clampdown on use of the Belarusian language, exiled news outlets are leading the fight to keep their language — and cultural identity — alive. Although Belarusian has been the country’s official language since Belarus declared independence from the former Soviet Union in 1991, there has been an ongoing process of Russification since President Alexander Lukashenko came to power in 1994. That process has only accelerated since 2020 when Lukashenko — seen by some to be a puppet of Russian President Vladimir Putin — declared victory in an election that was widely viewed as fraudulent. Since then, the Belarusian government has grown increasingly hostile toward Belarusian as the language has become more and more associated with resistance toward Lukashenko’s rule. As Minsk continues to grow closer to Moscow, Belarusian media outlets that left the country following the 2020 elections see it as their duty to help keep the Belarusian language alive through their reporting, multiple media leaders told VOA. 'It’s a strategic move to preserve the language, to preserve the culture, which is being actively attacked,' said Natalia Belikova, head of international cooperation at Press Club Belarus in Poland’s capital Warsaw. Belarusian not illegal, but unwelcome Speaking Belarusian isn’t illegal in Belarus, but the government has long made clear its preference for Russian, which has been the other official language in Belarus since 1995. Belarusian is more similar to Ukrainian than Russian. Instead of outlawing Belarusian entirely, the government has taken steps like targeting Belarusian-language newspapers and bookstores. Classes in school are more often taught in Russian, and there aren’t any universities where Belarusian is the primary language. Government officials tend to speak Russian, and government documents are often in Russian, too. 'The presence of Belarusian language is vividly vanishing,' Belikova said. '‘Upsetting’ is probably a milder word for this. It’s really devastating.' A 2019 census found that around 60% of the population consider Belarusian their native language, but only about 28% use the language at home. Still, since Belarusian isn’t banned, speaking it is one of the few remaining ways for people to safely signal their political beliefs and opposition to Lukashenko, multiple journalists said. However, multiple analysts said doing so in public is likely to draw negative attention from authorities because the language is so closely associated with the resistance. 'Formally, it’s safe. It’s OK to speak Belarusian in Belarus. But in practice, well, it’s not safe,' Pavel Sviardlou, editor-in-chief of European Radio for Belarus, told VOA from Warsaw. The Belarusian foreign ministry did not reply to VOA’s email requesting comment. As the Belarusian government works to suppress the Belarusian language in favor of Russian, leaders from prominent exiled outlets like European Radio for Belarus, Nasha Niva and Zerkalo say their outlets are prioritizing coverage in the Belarusian language. In the case of Nasha Niva, one of the oldest Belarusian newspapers, the outlet’s mission has long been to popularize the Belarusian language, culture and history, according to the newspaper’s director Nastassia Rouda. That mission has become more important since the contested 2020 election, after which hundreds of journalists fled the country to escape harassment and censorship. 'Who, if not us? This is the question,' Rouda told VOA from Lithuania. Nasha Niva’s primary language is Belarusian, but the outlet also translates everything into Russian. European Radio for Belarus operates similarly. 'This is a chance to, for example, listen to Belarusian every day, to read in Belarusian every day. And, of course, to feel that the language is not dead,' Sviardlou said. The fight to preserve the Belarusian language goes hand in hand with the more obvious role that exiled media play — ensuring people still inside Belarus can access independent news about what’s happening. 'Only media like us, who are working from exile right now, can give some truthful information about the political situation. No one inside can do this,' Nasha Niva’s Rouda said. Although Belarusian authorities block access to independent news sites, Belarusians still access them with circumvention tools like virtual private networks, or VPNs. Despite the risks and the fact that the government spent about 50 million euros ($55 million) on propaganda in 2023 alone, it’s clear that many people inside Belarus, which has a population of about 9 million, still regularly access banned news sites. The five biggest sites had over 17 million visits in December 2023, according to a 2024 JX Fund report. The news outlet Zerkalo, for instance, receives about 3 million unique visitors each month, with about 60% of them located inside Belarus, according to a 2024 Press Club Belarus report. Zerkalo is the successor outlet of Tut.by, which was the largest independent news site in Belarus until authorities shut it down in 2021. As the Belarus government grows ever closer with Russia amid the ongoing war in Ukraine, exiled Belarusian media view their efforts as critical to maintaining a distinct Belarusian identity. The stakes are high, according to Aliaksandra Pushkina, a board member of Zerkalo. 'If we lose our culture, our language, we really will be a part of Russia,' she told VOA from Austria. While exiled outlets are prioritizing Belarusian language coverage, Belarusian propaganda outlets inside the country primarily use Russian, according to Sviardlou. 'They don’t even try to work in Belarusian because they understand that no one will listen to them,' he said. He asserted that Belarusian has taken on a different meaning, saying, 'It is a language of truth.'	https://www.voanews.com/a/exiled-media-fight-to-keep-belarusian-language-alive-/7810871.html	2024-10-04T12:19:07-07:00

2 sisters from Egypt were among those killed in Mexican army shooting	TAPACHULA, Mexico — An 11-year-old Egyptian girl and her 18-year-old sister were among those killed after Mexican army troops opened fire on a truck carrying migrants earlier this week, an official said Friday. The sisters, and four other migrants from countries including Peru and Honduras, were killed Tuesday in the southern state of Chiapas. An official in the state’s prosecutor's office confirmed the identification of the two sisters and said their father was wounded in the shooting but survived. Federal officials, including newly inaugurated President Claudia Sheinbaum, again refused Friday to confirm the ages or genders of the six migrants killed in the shooting, which occurred on Sheinbaum’s first day in office. Soldiers claimed they heard shots and returned fire, and officials have studiously avoided saying the migrants were killed by army gunfire. However, that appears to be the case, and two soldiers have been relieved of duty and turned over to civilian prosecutors for questioning. The killings placed in doubt Sheinbaum's statements over her first days in office that human rights will be at the forefront of her administration's policies. Asked about her immigration policy Friday, Sheinbaum said only that the killings were under investigation and doubled down on earlier claims that the government doesn't violate human rights. 'First of all, human rights are respected,' Sheinbaum said. 'That is very important, that is why it is called a humanistic immigration policy, because human rights are at the forefront.' Three of the dead were from Egypt, and one each from Peru and Honduras. The other has apparently not yet been identified. Ten other migrants were wounded in the shooting. but there has not been any information on their conditions. Peru’s foreign ministry confirmed one Peruvian was killed and demanded 'an urgent investigation' into the killings. Peru and Mexico have had damaged relations since a 2022 diplomatic spat. It was the worst killing of migrants by authorities in Mexico since police in the northern state of Tamaulipas killed 17 migrants in 2021. Sheinbaum has said the shootings are being investigated to see if any commanders might face punishment, and noted 'a situation like this cannot be repeated.' But she left out any mention of that Thursday at a ceremony at a Mexico City army base, where army and navy commanders pledged their loyalty to her in front of massed combat vehicles and hundreds of troops. 'In our country, there is not a state of siege, there are no violations of human rights,' Sheinbaum said, as she promised wage increases for soldiers and sailors. The shootings Tuesday occurred near the city of Tapachula, near the border with Guatemala. The Defense Department initially said that soldiers claimed to have heard shots as a convoy of three trucks passed the soldiers’ position. The Attorney General’s Office later said all three trucks ignored orders to stop and tried to flee. The soldiers pursued them and reported coming under fire from the convoy and returned fire. One of the trucks eventually stopped, the driver reportedly fled, and a total of 33 migrants were found aboard, from the three countries already mentioned, as well as Nepal, Cuba, India and Pakistan. The Defense Department said four of the migrants were found dead, and 12 wounded. Two of the wounded later died of their injuries. Sheinbaum refused to say whether any weapons were found in the migrants’ truck. The area is a common route for smuggling migrants, who are often packed into crowded freight trucks. It has also been the scene of drug cartel turf battles, and the department said the trucks 'were similar to those used by criminal groups in the region.' Irineo Mujica, a migrant rights activist, said he doubted the migrants or their smugglers opened fire. 'It is really impossible that these people would have been shooting at the army,' Mujica said. 'Most of the time, they get through by paying bribes.' If the deaths were the result of army fire, as appears likely, it could prove a major embarrassment for Sheinbaum. The new president has followed the lead of former President Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador in giving the armed forces extraordinary powers in law enforcement, state-run companies, airports, trains and construction projects.	https://www.voanews.com/a/sisters-from-egypt-were-among-those-killed-in-mexican-army-shooting/7810904.html	2024-10-04T12:12:14-07:00	
Philippines condemns China attack of Vietnamese fishermen	manila, philippines — The Philippines on Friday denounced China 's alleged assault of Vietnamese fishermen in the South China Sea, where Manila and Beijing are also locked in violent confrontations that have led to fears of armed conflict. Vietnam has accused 'Chinese law enforcement forces' of beating the 10 fishermen with iron bars and robbing them Sunday of thousands of dollars' worth of fish and equipment off the Paracel Islands. A Chinese foreign ministry spokesperson acknowledged an incident took place there but disputed the Vietnamese version of the events. China and Vietnam both claim the Paracel Islands, but the Philippines does not. 'We strongly condemn the violent and illegal actions of Chinese maritime authorities against Vietnamese fishermen near the Paracel Islands on September 29, 2024,' Philippine National Security Adviser Eduardo Ano said in a statement. He described the 'unjustified assault' as an 'alarming act with no place in international relations.' The Philippine foreign department also issued a statement Friday saying it was aware of the 'serious incident.' 'The Philippines has consistently denounced the use of force, aggression and intimidation in the South China Sea, and emphasized the need for actors to exercise genuine self-restraint,' it said. 'It is a paramount obligation to ensure the safety at sea of vessels and their crew, especially fisherfolk.' The incident came just over three months after Chinese law enforcement personnel armed with knives, sticks and an axe attacked Filipino troops attempting to resupply a Philippine garrison on Second Thomas Shoal in the Spratly archipelago. The Chinese seized guns and other equipment and damaged Philippine boats, while a Filipino sailor lost a thumb in the June 17 melee. Chinese coast guard and other vessels have in recent months also rammed, water-cannoned and blocked Philippine government vessels on several occasions around Second Thomas Shoal and Sabina Shoal in the Spratlys, as well as Scarborough Shoal in another area of the sea. Beijing claims most of the South China Sea and has for years sought to expand its presence in contested areas there, brushing aside an international ruling that its claim to most of the waterway has no legal basis. It has built artificial islands armed with missile systems and runways for fighter jets, and deployed vessels that the Philippines says harass its ships and block its fishermen.	https://www.voanews.com/a/philippines-condemns-china-attack-of-vietnamese-fishermen-/7810817.html	2024-10-04T11:03:46-07:00	
Middle East conflict sparks Chinese national pride, criticism of Israel	Washington — After Iran fired a barrage of 180 missiles at Israel on Tuesday in retaliation for the assassination of the leaders of two of its proxies and one of its senior military leaders, people in China went online, inundating social media platforms with a wide range of reactions to the escalation of the conflict in the Middle East. On Weibo, a platform akin to X with added censorship, most users condemned Israel, while some voices called for a show of support in contrast with mainstream anti-Israel and anti-U.S. opinions. Chinese official government media leveraged the opportunity to promote national pride, highlighting the successful evacuation of Chinese citizens from Lebanon. Chinese officials call for peace In official statements, Chinese representatives made appeals for sovereignty and peace, with a focus on preventing Chinese citizens from being caught in the crossfire of the intensifying conflict. Responding to a question about Iran’s attack on Israel, a Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesperson simply said that China opposed the intrusion upon Lebanese sovereign rights and cited Gaza as the 'root cause of this round of turmoil in the Middle East.' The Chinese Embassy in Israel also issued a message following the bombardment, calling on Chinese citizens in Israel to take precautions and reminding Chinese citizens not to travel to Israel. 'Be prepared for various attacks involving missiles, rockets, and drones, and enter the bomb shelter as soon as the alarm sounds. Do not go out unless necessary, and avoid going to high-risk areas and sensitive locations such as the north.' Such warnings seemingly resonated with Chinese Weibo users. The search term on the Chinese social media site, '# Remind our country’s citizens to not travel to Israel for the time being' reached 33.6 million clicks and some 3,700 discussions and thread posts. For each topic with a hashtag on Weibo, the site shows the total clicks and comments. The government prioritized evacuating Chinese citizens in Lebanon. The popularity of this move was reflected online, with the phrase, '# Chinese planes flew from Lebanon amid gunfire to evacuate Chinese citizens' attracting 28.5 million clicks and more than 3,700 comments. Official news service China Daily posted a video of 146 Chinese citizens in Lebanon and five of their foreign family members walking out of the cabin of the Air China charter flight that evacuated them to Beijing. The video featured passengers waving Chinese flags as they entered the airport. One woman said, 'This war is ruthless, but our country is full of love.' Online commenters point fingers '# Israeli air base hit by Iranian missile' was another hot search topic on Weibo, which garnered 16.3 million clicks and more than 1,000 comments. Nearly 300 commenters expressed opinions on a post from Chinese Central Television reporting the news of the Iranian attack. A slim majority condemned Israel, some cracked jokes about Iran and the attack, and a small number expressed support for Israel. 'Israel is really a demon country,' said one user, while another said, 'Hit Israel hard. It will be a relief.' Striking a different tone, user 'Master Ji Xian' said, 'We firmly support Israel in eradicating all evil and eliminating terrorists.' An article posted by Sina News attracted more than 113,000 comments, which overwhelmingly condemned Israel and criticized the United States. 'Iran struck too late,' replied one user. Another wrote, 'A group of Israelis is disturbing the peace in the Middle East. Without the support of the United States, would they have such courage?' Despite the dominating anti-Israel sentiment on Weibo, some discussions on WeChat, which has relatively looser regulations on speech, show a different side of Chinese public opinion. WeChat public account 'Vision Talk' published an article titled 'Iran launches 200 missiles to attack Israel, Russia collectively shoots and kills 16 Ukrainian prisoners of war.'

Nobel Prizes will be announced against backdrop of wars, famine and artificial intelligence	stavanger, norway — Wars, a refugee crisis, famine and artificial intelligence could all be recognized when Nobel Prize announcements begin next week under a shroud of violence. The prize week coincides with the October 7 anniversary of the Hamas-led attacks on Israel, which began a year of bloodshed and war across the Middle East. The literature and science prizes could be immune. But the peace prize, which recognizes efforts to end conflict, will be awarded in an atmosphere of ratcheting international violence — if awarded at all. 'I look at the world and see so much conflict, hostility and confrontation, I wonder if this is the year the Nobel Peace Prize should be withheld,' said Dan Smith, director of the Stockholm International Peace Research Institute. As well as events roiling the Middle East, Smith cites the war in Sudan and risk of famine there, the ongoing conflict in Ukraine and his institute's research showing that global military spending is increasing at its fastest pace since World War II. 'It could go to some groups which are making heroic efforts but are marginalized,' Smith said. 'But the trend is in the wrong direction. Perhaps it would be right to draw attention to that by withholding the peace prize this year.' Withholding the Nobel Peace is not new. It has been suspended 19 times in the past, including during the world wars. The last time it was not awarded was in 1972. However, Henrik Urdal, director of the Peace Research Institute Oslo, says withdrawal would be a mistake in 2024, saying the prize is 'arguably more important as a way to promote and recognize important work for peace.' Civil grassroot groups, and international organizations with missions to mitigate violence in the Middle East could be recognized. Nominees are kept secret for 50 years, but nominators often publicize their picks. Academics at the Free University Amsterdam said they have nominated the Middle East-based organizations EcoPeace, Women Wage Peace and Women of the Sun for peace efforts between Israelis and Palestinians. Urdal believes it's possible the committee could consider the Sudan Emergency Response Rooms, a group of grassroots initiatives providing aid to stricken Sudanese facing famine and buffeted by the country's brutal civil war. The announcements begin Monday with the physiology or medicine prize, followed on subsequent days by the physics, chemistry, literature and peace awards. The Peace Prize announcement will be made on Friday by the Norwegian Nobel Committee in Oslo, while all the others will be announced by the Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences in Stockholm. The prize in economics will be announced the following week on October 14. New technology, possibly artificial intelligence, could be recognized in one or more of the categories. Critics of AI warn the rise of autonomous weapons shows the new technology could mean additional peace-shattering misery for many people. Yet AI has also enabled scientific breakthroughs that are tipped for recognition in other categories. David Pendlebury, head of research analysis at Clarivate's Institute for Scientific Information, says scientists from Google Deepmind, the AI lab, could be among those under consideration for the chemistry prize. The company's artificial intelligence, AlphaFold, 'accurately predicts the structure of proteins,' he said. It is already widely used in several fields, including medicine, where it could one day be used to develop a breakthrough drug. Pendlebury spearheads Clarivate's list of scientists whose papers are among the world's most cited, and whose work it says are ripe for Nobel recognition. 'AI will increasingly be a part of the panoply of tools that researchers use,' Pendlebury said. He said he would be extremely surprised if a discovery 'firmly anchored in AI' did not win Nobel prizes in the next 10 years.	https://www.voanews.com/a/nobel-prizes-will-be-announced-against-backdrop-of-wars-famine-and-artificial-intelligence-/7810764.html	2024-10-04T10:47:52-07:00	
Clashes erupt in Kenya as people discuss deputy president's impeachment motion	NAIROBI, Kenya — Supporters and opponents of Kenya's deputy president clashed Friday at public forums over an impeachment motion against him, which was introduced in parliament by the ruling alliance this week. Rigathi Gachagua is accused of supporting anti-government protests in June and of being involved in corruption and other irregularities, charges he denies. A motion for the impeachment of Gachagua was proposed in parliament Tuesday and Kenyans were given until Friday to fill out public participation forms at their constituencies. Public forums are being held across the country to discuss the impeachment. In the capital, Nairobi, a public forum at the Bomas of Kenya turned violent as supporters of President William Ruto clashed with those supporting Gachagua. Chairs were thrown in the auditorium and an activist Morara Kebaso, known for exposing stalled government projects, said he had been injured. In central Kenya’s Nyeri county, police clashed with supporters of the deputy president as they chanted that there would be no president if his deputy is impeached. The two were elected on a joint ticket. In Nyandarua county, opponents were called out as being traitors and were chased out of the community hall. Some 291 legislators, more than the 117 constitutional requirement, signed the impeachment motion before it was introduced, but several of them from the deputy president’s home turf say they no longer support the motion after hearing contrary views from their constituents. 'If the deputy president is guilty, then his boss the president is equally guilty,' a female supporter told Citizen TV. Gachagua is facing impeachment on 10 grounds that include corruption, ethnic discrimination and contradicting government policies. He has maintained that he is innocent and has vowed to fight the impeachment motion. The high court Thursday declined to stop Friday’s public participation and set next Wednesday as the date for the hearing. Ruto has not weighed in on his deputy’s impeachment debate. He is on record in the earlier days of his presidency saying he would not publicly humiliate his deputy, alluding to the troubled relationship he had with his predecessor Uhuru Kenyatta during their second term in office. The senate is expected to hear the impeachment motion Tuesday.	https://www.voanews.com/a/clashes-erupt-in-kenya-as-people-discuss-deputy-president-s-impeachment-motion/7810760.html	2024-10-04T10:47:38-07:00	
Collective trauma marks anniversary of Hamas attack on Israel	GENEVA — As the conflict in Gaza enters its second year, the World Health Organization is calling for an end to the 'unspeakable suffering' of civilians in Israel and the region and for health care to be protected and not attacked. The WHO says the horrific attacks by Hamas militants and other armed groups in Israel on October 7 of last year, have unleashed a chain of events that have caused tens of thousands of civilian deaths and injuries, as well as the displacement of millions of people in Israel, Gaza, the West Bank, and now in Lebanon. Dr. Michel Thieren, special WHO representative to Israel, told journalists at a briefing in Geneva Friday that for Israel, the October 7 massacres mark an event as significant and agonizing as the 9/11 terrorist attacks against the World Trade Center and the Pentagon in the United States. Ten thousand people remain buried under the rubble,' he said. 'The health system has suffered immensely from repeated attacks and an ongoing shortage of supplies, medicines, fuel, and staff.' The WHO said there have been at least 516 attacks on health care in Gaza, resulting in 765 deaths. It says only half of Gaza's hospitals are partially operational and 43% of primary health care centers are functional. It notes many essential health services are unavailable, including Gaza's only limb reconstruction center and sole psychiatric hospital. Other critical services, such as oncology and MRI services, specialized pediatric surgery and endocrinology services also are out of commission, 'At least 24,090 people are suffering from life-changing injuries due to the conflict, with no access to rehabilitation or specialized care,' the WHO's Ayadil Saparbekov said. 'We are deeply concerned about the conflict's impact on mental health in Gaza, where more than 485,000 people had already been diagnosed with mental disorders before the war.' The WHO flags malnutrition as another major concern. It said more than 20,000 children have been admitted for malnutrition treatment since January, including 4,437 for severe acute malnutrition, a condition that can lead to death if left untreated. The U.N. health agency warns communicable diseases are a significant public health threat, with cases of acute watery diarrhea and acute respiratory infections accounting for more than 80% of diseases reported during the first eight months of 2024. 'The poor water, sanitation, and hygiene situation, along with overcrowding in shelters, are the primary drivers of these diseases, Saparbekov said. 'These conditions are expected to worsen during winter, likely leading to a further rise in cases.' On a more positive note, he mentioned that preparations are underway for the second round of a polio vaccination campaign, scheduled to begin October 14 and end October 29. 'We have communicated these dates to the Israeli authorities, and we are having a meeting on Sunday to see whether this will be confirmed. We estimate that over 500,000 children between the ages of zero to 10 years will be vaccinated with the novel oral polio vaccine. 'In addition to the polio vaccinations, the children also will receive a dose of vitamin A to boost their immune system,' he said. WHO officials warn that repeated evacuation orders by Israel and ongoing hostilities continue to disrupt humanitarian operations in Gaza. As the grim one year anniversary of Hamas' terror attack on Israel nears, they are calling for 'effective deconfliction and protection of health care, safe access to health facilities, and sustained aid flow into and across Gaza' to assist the many in desperate need.	https://www.voanews.com/a/collective-trauma-marks-anniversary-of-hamas-attack-on-israel/7810793.html	2024-10-04T10:47:09-07:00	
Ukraine's Femen protest war at Iran embassy	kyiv, ukraine — Ukrainian feminist activists staged a topless protest Friday outside the Embassy of Iran, which Kyiv and the West say is arming Russia. Ukraine's Femen group is a feminist art collective that has for years staged stunts in Ukraine and abroad, with its trademark move being women appearing with their chests bare, protest slogans written across their bodies. Kyiv has branded Iran an 'accomplice' in Russia's invasion of Ukraine and regularly reports finding fragments of Iranian Shahed drones used by Moscow in attacks targeting civilian infrastructure. AFP saw two activists take their shirts off near the Iranian Embassy building in Kyiv, chanting and displaying anti-Iran and anti-Russia slogans written on their bodies. Western governments have accused Iran of supplying Moscow with both drones and missiles, which Tehran has repeatedly denied. At the U.N. last month, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy denounced Russia involving authoritarian states Iran and North Korea — also widely believed to be arming Russia — in Moscow's more than two-year invasion of his country. 'Russia has no legitimate reason — none at all — for making Iran and North Korea de facto accomplices in its criminal war in Europe, with their weapons killing us, killing Ukrainians,' Zelenskyy said. Western countries have imposed sanctions on Iran's air transport links over its alleged supply of ballistic missiles to Russia for use in Ukraine. Femen, which campaigns for women's rights and against sexism and conservative Orthodoxy, originated in Ukraine but now also has branches in other countries. It has staged numerous stunts, including two of its activists lunging at Russian President Vladimir Putin on a visit to Germany in 2013 shouting 'dictator!'	https://www.voanews.com/a/ukraine-s-femen-protest-war-at-iran-embassy-/7810697.html	2024-10-04T09:45:41-07:00

US adds 254,000 jobs, unemployment dips to 4.1% in still-sturdy labor market	WASHINGTON — America’s employers added a surprisingly strong 254,000 jobs in September, the latest evidence that the U.S. labor market is still solid enough to support steady hiring and a growing economy. Last month’s hiring gain was far more than economists had expected, and it was up sharply from the 159,000 jobs that were added in August. And after rising for most of 2024, the unemployment rate dropped for a second straight month, from 4.2% in August to 4.1% in September, the Labor Department said Friday. The latest figures suggest that many companies are still confident enough to fill jobs despite the continued pressure of high interest rates. Few employers are laying off workers, though many have grown more cautious about hiring. In an encouraging sign, the Labor Department also revised up its estimate of job growth in July and August by a combined 72,000. The September job gains were fairly broad-based, a healthy trend if it continues. Restaurants and bars added 69,000 jobs. Health care companies gained 45,000, government agencies 31,000, social assistance employers 27,000 and construction companies 25,000. A category that includes professional and business services added 17,000 after having lost jobs for three straight months. Average hourly raises were solid, too. They rose by a higher-than-expected 0.4% from August, slightly less than the 0.5% gain the month before. Measured from a year earlier, hourly wages climbed 4%, up a tick from a 3.9% year-over-year gain in August. The economy’s progress in taming inflation led the Federal Reserve last month to cut its benchmark interest rate by a sizable half-point, its first rate cut in more than four years, and said further cuts were likely in the coming months. The Fed said it wanted to ease the cost of borrowing to help bolster the job market. Considering Friday’s strong jobs report, the Fed is now likely to reduce its key rate by more typical quarter-point increments. 'The September jobs report shows a nice bump in labor demand at the beginning of the fall,″ said Bill Adams, chief economist at Comerica Bank. 'The U.S. economy is growing solidly in 2024 even as inflation slows to near the Fed’s target.' The resilience of the economy has come as a relief. Economists had expected that the Fed’s aggressive campaign to subdue inflation — it jacked up interest rates 11 times in 2022 and 2023 — would cause a recession. It didn’t. The economy kept growing even in the face of ever-higher borrowing costs for consumers and businesses. Most economists say the Fed appears to have achieved the once unlikely prospect of a 'soft landing,' in which high interest rates help vanquish inflation without triggering a recession. The economy is weighing heavily on voters as the Nov. 5 presidential election nears. Many Americans are unimpressed by the job market’s durability and are still frustrated by high prices, which remain on average 19% above where they were in February 2021. That was when inflation began surging as the economy rebounded with unexpected speed and strength from the pandemic recession, causing severe shortages of goods and labor. The public’s discontent with inflation and the economy under President Joe Biden has been a political burden for Vice President Kamala Harris in her race for the White House against former President Donald Trump. The jobs report for October, which the government will issue four days before Election Day, will likely be muddied by the effects of Hurricane Helene and a strike by Boeing machinists. Across the economy, though, most indicators look solid. The U.S. economy, the world’s largest, grew at a vigorous 3% annual pace from April through June, boosted by consumer spending and business investment. A forecasting tool from the Federal Reserve Bank of Atlanta points to slower but still healthy 2.5% annual growth in the just-ended July-September quarter. The Institute for Supply Management, an association of purchasing managers, reported that America’s services businesses grew for a third straight month in September and at an unexpectedly fast pace. The economy’s service sector is closely watched because it represents more than 70% of U.S. jobs. Last month, the nation’s households increased their spending at retailers. And even with hiring having slowed, Americans are enjoying unusual job security. Layoffs are near a record low as a percentage of employment. The number of people filing for unemployment benefits also remains near historically low levels. Companies seem generally reluctant to let workers go even though some are also hesitant to expand their payrolls. That unusual dynamic may stem from many employers having been caught flat-footed and short of staff after the economy began roaring back from the pandemic recession. Posted job openings, too, have declined steadily, to 8 million in August, after having peaked at 12.2 million in March 2022. Workers have noticed the chillier environment for jobseekers. Far fewer feel confident enough to leave their jobs to seek a better position. The number of Americans who are quitting their jobs has reached its lowest level since August 2020, when the economy was still reeling from COVID.	https://www.voanews.com/a/us-adds-254-000-jobs-unemployment-dips-to-4-1-in-still-sturdy-labor-market/7810508.html	2024-10-04T07:55:49-07:00

Tunisia's president faces little challenge ahead of Sunday's vote	paris — On a warm fall evening five years ago, supporters of the moderate Islamist Ennadha party packed one end of Tunis' Habib Bourguiba Boulevard, the iconic landmark of Tunisia's 2011 revolution. The other end hosted a boisterous get-out-the vote for business tycoon Nabil Karaoui — one of 26 candidates running in the North African country's 2019 presidential race. Tunisians voting Sunday will face a sharply narrower field. Out of 14 aspiring presidential candidates, the country's electoral commission — handpicked by current President Kais Saied — approved just three. The first is in prison. The second is considered close to Saied. The third is Saied himself. 'The climate today is one of repression of every form of liberty,' said Kamel Jendoubi, a former minister who headed Tunisia's first post-revolution electoral commission. 'Arrests have multiplied against the opposition. Today all the main political leaders, from the left, center and right, are in prison.' Jendoubi's remarks are echoed by a raft of opposition politicians, analysts and rights activists, even as Saied's supporters praise him for overhauling a corrupt and gridlocked system. Few dispute that after five years in office, the 66-year-old leader has dramatically reshaped Tunisia's political landscape, even as high unemployment and a struggling economy persist. With Sunday's vote seemingly stacked in the president's favor, some believe a second Saied term could consolidate a return to the country's authoritarian past. Others suggest Tunisians, notably a young, post-revolution generation, will not tolerate the loss of their fledgling democracy — especially if they judge the vote to be rigged. 'If he's elected under these circumstances, it will be a weak regime,' predicted Michael Ayari, senior Tunisia analyst for the International Crisis Group policy institute. 'And a weak regime will do spectacular things to gain legitimacy.' Cleaning up A law professor and political newcomer, Saied catapulted to power in 2019, running a one-man, shoestring campaign. His populist message of rooting out cronyism and returning power to the people resonated among an electorate fed up with years of dysfunctional governance. Thousands celebrated after Saied clinched runoff elections against businessman Karaoui, capturing 73% of the vote — a score some analysts believe he hopes to match or exceed. Tunisian taxi driver Mongi Ben Ameur voted for Saied then. He plans to vote for him again on Sunday. 'The former regime, the people in politics, they profited from the country, they profited from the people,' Ben Ameur says. 'Saied is trying to clean everything up. We won't harvest the fruits right away, but he's done things we haven't seen before.' In July 2021, Saied seized widespread powers, ultimately dissolving parliament. Over the next two years, he rewrote the country's constitution, beefing up presidential powers and reducing legislative ones. Voter turnout to approve each change was low, however, dipping to just over 11% in last year's legislative polls. 'I think he had this philosophy that he had to destroy everything to rebuild on solid foundations,' said Abdelkaddous Saadaoui, an activist and former Cabinet member, describing Saied's philosophy which he opposes. 'He's convinced he's found solutions for the people,' said Tunisian essayist Hatem Nafti, who authored a newly published book on Tunisia under Saied. 'He doesn't even realize he's a dictator.' Under Saied's presidency, authorities have detained or imprisoned dozens of opposition politicians, activists and journalists, dismissed judges and prosecutors, and weakened free expression and judicial independence. Even as Saied cracked down on corruption, analyst Ayari said, new forms have rooted and flourished. For now, Saied faces no major challengers. On Tuesday, a Tunisian court toughened a prison sentence against presidential candidate Ayachi Zammel on forgery charges, although he remains on the ballot. Separately, the elections commission rejected a top administrative court's decision authorizing three additional candidates to run. Last week, lawmakers hastily passed legislation stripping the court's authority to decide election disputes. 'He's afraid of losing,' former minister Jendoubi said of Saied. 'When Kais Saied did his coup, he was popular — people went out on the streets to applaud him. But his popularity has dropped considerably, because he's not been able to resolve people's problems.' Challenging times Internationally, Saied has moved beyond Tunisia's traditional Western alliances, reaching out to Iran, China and Russia, and rejecting foreign interference. He struck a controversial deal with the European Union to radically curb African migration to Europe, but rejected a $1.9 billion International Monetary Fund bailout, even as the country's public debt soars. Prices and joblessness are also high, and the country faces a major water crisis, which the president blames on a conspiracy. 'Mr. Saied has shown little interest in reforms: his economic policy does not go much beyond ranting about speculators and the odd anti-corruption drive (usually aimed at his political opponents),' The Economist wrote recently. 'Another five years of this all but ensures that Tunisia's economy will continue to flounder.' While some activists still take to the streets, fear has silenced others. One declined to be interviewed over safety concerns. 'We've returned to self-censorship,' another Tunisian said. 'It's true that some still dare to speak out, but no one knows when that will be deemed too much.' Still, one Tunisian businesswoman, with local government experience, does not regret Saied's tenure. 'These are challenging times, but sadly I feel we need to go through this,' she said. 'Because in the past, political parties always made agreements to get a piece of the pie instead of serving the people.' 'For the moment, populism works,' said Crisis Group analyst Ayari of Saied. 'Because each time he makes a mistake, he says 'it's not me — it's the others, it's the plotters.' But if there's a new narrative saying Kais Saied is responsible, then there will be mobilizations.'Members of Tunisia's weakened and divided opposition believe change will come, sooner or later. 'I think there will be resistance against Kais Saied if he is going to confiscate power through cheating and repression,' says Ridha Driss, a senior member of the opposition Ennahdha party. 'A peaceful political resistance will gain ground, and things won't last long for Kais Saied.'	https://www.voanews.com/a/tunisia-s-president-faces-little-challenge-ahead-of-sunday-s-vote/7809412.html	2024-10-04T06:35:48-07:00	
Pakistan locks down capital, suspends cellphones to thwart opposition rally	Islamabad — Pakistan Friday imposed strict security measures in and around Islamabad to deter supporters of imprisoned former prime minister Imran Khan from marching on the country’s capital. Authorities have blocked highways and roads leading into the city with freight containers. They have suspended cellphone service and public transport, and closed schools. Police and paramilitary forces were stationed at entry and exit points, and the government temporarily banned public gatherings in Islamabad. Similar security measures were placed in the adjoining city of Rawalpindi, where Pakistan's military is headquartered. Khan has urged supporters of his Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf, or PTI, party from all over the country to assemble at D-Chowk, a public square, near Parliament and the prime minister's office, to peacefully protest claimed election rigging and government efforts to introduce contentious constitutional amendments. Friday’s anti-government demonstration is the latest in a series of PTI rallies against Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif's coalition government in recent weeks. Khan, 71, contends that the ruling coalition has neither moral nor legal jurisdiction to amend the constitution, citing alleged election fraud as the basis for its illegitimacy. 'I want you all to reach D-Chowk today for a peaceful protest rally,' read an Urdu-language statement posted on Khan’s social media platform X on Friday. 'This war has entered a decisive phase,' he added. Police in the capital were seen rounding up several PTI activists Friday, including women, trying to make their way to the protest site. Interior Minister Mohsin Naqvi warned PTI supporters against storming and holding the rally in Islamabad. 'Anyone caught will not be shown any leniency, and no one should complain later,' he told a late Thursday news conference. Naqvi defended the government's response to the opposition rally, saying Malaysian Prime Minister Anwar Ibrahim was in the capital, and preparations were underway for an October 15-16 Shanghai Cooperation Organization meeting. He said Chinese Prime Minister Li Qiang is scheduled to visit Islamabad before the SCO gathering, adding that the government 'can't allow any chaos' in the wake of these high-profile events, and urging Khan’s party to move the rally to a later date. Khan has been in jail since August of last year on highly contentious corruption and other criminal charges, while his party remains a target of a military-backed government crackdown. He rejects all the charges as politically motivated, and his convictions have either been quashed or suspended for lack of evidence. Despite facing challenges, PTI-backed candidates won the most seats in the general election in February, but not enough to form a government. That enabled Khan’s opponents, led by Sharif, to cobble together a ruling coalition, allegedly with the help of the powerful military. Khan, a former cricket star turned prime minister, was ousted from power in a 2022 opposition parliamentary no-confidence motion led by Sharif. The deposed Pakistani leader rejected the move as illegal and claimed the military orchestrated it, charges Sharif and army officials subsequently denied.	https://www.voanews.com/a/pakistan-locks-down-capital-suspends-cellphones-to-thwart-opposition-rally-/7810320.html	2024-10-04T05:08:30-07:00

Bosnia floods kill 14 people	Kiseljak, Bosnia and Herzegovina — Heavy rains that flooded towns and touched off landslides left at least 14 people dead in Bosnia on Friday, authorities said. Jablanica, some 70 kilometers (43 miles) southwest of Sarajevo, appeared to bear the brunt of the 24 hours of downpours, which cut it off from the outside world. Photos on local media from the Jablanica region showed mudslides coming up to roofs of houses and a mosque with only its minaret sticking out. 'For now, the bodies of 14 people have been found' in the region of Jablanica, spokesman Darko Jukan told AFP, adding that the toll was likely to rise. Jablanica 'cannot be entered or exited at the moment', a mountain rescue service said of the town of around 4,000 people. A number of people from the area were reported missing, the authorities said while some injured were evacuated with a helicopter from the European Union peacekeeping force (EUFOR). At mid-Friday the situation was the most critical in the village of Donja Jablanica that remained cut off, the spokesman said. Several roads and bridges in the region collapsed, he said. In Kiseljak, some 20 kilometers west of Sarajevo, houses, gardens and cars were under water, an AFP journalist reported. A large part of Bosnia's population is at risk due to heavy floods and landslides, the federal civil protection administration said in a statement. Firefighters, police and utility companies were working in the affected areas, but more help is needed to mitigate the consequences of storms and rainfall, the federal civil protection administration warned. Prime Minister of Bosnia's Muslim-Croat half Nermin Niksic wrote on social media platform X that the situation was 'very serious as many citizens are still trapped in their houses. In neighboring Croatia, weather authorities issued a warning for the northern Adriatic coast, Istria peninsula and central part of the country due to the heavy rains. In a statement, it said that urban flooding and interruption of traffic, communications, electricity and water supply were expected. Scientist warn that climate change worsens the impact of extreme weather events. Torrential rains and strong winds have led to widespread flooding in central and eastern Europe last month, killing at least 24 people and devastating towns and villages.	https://www.voanews.com/a/bosnia-floods-kill-14-people-/7810269.html	2024-10-04T04:34:55-07:00	
EU executive to adopt tariffs on Chinese EVs after vote	BRUSSELS — The European Commission said on Friday it had received enough support from E.U. members to impose tariffs of up to 45% on Chinese electric vehicle imports in the bloc's highest profile trade case, but would continue to negotiate with Beijing. The Commission, which oversees the bloc's trade policy, has proposed final duties on Chinese-built EVs for the next five years to counter what it sees as unfair Chinese subsidies after a year-long anti-subsidy investigation. In a vote on Friday, 10 E.U. members backed tariffs and five voted against, with 12 abstentions, E.U. sources said. It would have taken opposition from a qualified majority of 15 E.U. members, representing 65% of the E.U. population, to block the proposal. Reuters reported on Wednesday that the measure was likely to pass with France, Italy and Poland planning to vote in favor. The E.U. executive said it had obtained 'the necessary support' to adopt the tariffs, although it would continue talks with Beijing to find an alternative solution. The region's biggest economy and major car producer, Germany, voted against the proposal, sources said on Friday. BMW Chief Executive Oliver Zipse described the vote as 'a fatal signal for the European automotive industry'. He said a quick settlement was needed between Brussels and Beijing to prevent a trade conflict. Volkswagen said the planned tariffs were 'the wrong approach.' China's foreign ministry did not immediately respond to a Reuters request for comment. Stellantis said it supported free and fair competition and that the sector was under pressure from ambitious carbon reduction plans and 'the Chinese global commercial offensive.' Hungarian Prime Minister Viktor Orban said on Friday that the E.U. was headed for an 'economic cold war' with China. The E.U.'s stance towards Beijing has hardened in the last five years. It views China as a potential partner in some issues, but also as a competitor and a systemic rival. In moves seen as a retaliation, Beijing this year launched its own probes into imports of E.U. brandy, dairy and pork products. The Commission says China's spare production capacity of three million EVs per year, which needed to be exported, is twice the size of the E.U. market. Given 100% tariffs in the United States and Canada, the most obvious outlet for those EVs is Europe. The E.U. executive has said it is willing to continue negotiating an alternative to tariffs with China and could re-examine a price undertaking — involving a minimum import price and typically a volume cap — having previously rejected those offered by Chinese companies. The tariffs range from 7.8% for Tesla TSLA.O to 35.3% for SAIC 600104.SS and other companies deemed not to have cooperated with the E.U. investigation. These tariffs are on top of the EU's standard 10% import duty for cars.	https://www.voanews.com/a/eu-executive-to-adopt-tariffs-on-chinese-evs-after-vote-/7810243.html	2024-10-04T04:04:46-07:00	
Sudan's war to intensify as rainy season draws to a close	DUBAI — After almost 18 months of war, fighting in Sudan is escalating as seasonal rains end with the army using intensified airstrikes and allied fighters to shore up its position ahead of a likely surge by the rival Rapid Support Forces (RSF). An uptick in fighting will aggravate an already dire humanitarian crisis in which famine has been confirmed and over 10 million people — one fifth of the population — are displaced, more than anywhere else in the world. U.N. agencies have often been unable to deliver aid. 'There won't be a decisive breakthrough,' a senior Western diplomat in the region, speaking on condition of anonymity due to political sensitivities, told Reuters. 'What we expect to come into the fall more and more is much more fragmentation, to see more armed groups getting involved ... And this will make the situation in general much more difficult.' The paramilitary RSF has had the upper hand during much of the conflict but last week the army, after shunning U.S.-led talks in Switzerland, launched its biggest offensive yet in the capital Khartoum, advancing across a key bridge over the Nile. In Darfur, former rebel groups and volunteers from displacement camps have rallied to defend the densely populated city of al-Fashir, the army's last holdout in the western region, against waves of RSF attacks. Two army sources said the army had worked for months to replenish weaponry including drones and warplanes, as well as training up new volunteers, to strengthen its position on the ground before any negotiations. Three residents in the capital, which is made up of Khartoum and its adjoining cities of Omdurman and Bahri, said that in recent days the army had been carrying out more air bombardments with a larger number of drones and fighter jets than before. While the army has used its superior air power at the end of the rainy season to pound RSF-held territory in the capital, Darfur and El Gezira state, the RSF's more effective ground troops are expected to regain an edge as the dry season starts and roads become more passable. The RSF released a video on Monday with its fighters promising a 'hot winter' for its rivals in Sennar, where its progress had earlier been slowed by the rains. Witnesses there as well as in the capital reported heavy fighting on Thursday. Both sides have reinforced militarily as the conflict in Africa's third largest country by land area has deepened, drawing on material support from foreign backers, diplomats and analysts say. Battle in the capital The war began in April 2023 as the army and the RSF jostled to protect their power and wealth ahead of a planned political transition towards civilian rule and free elections. The RSF, which has its roots in the so-called Janjaweed militias that helped the government crush a rebellion by non-Arab groups in Darfur in the early 2000s, quickly occupied much of the capital before consolidating its grip on Darfur and seizing El Gezira state, south of Khartoum. Earlier this year, the army gained ground in Omdurman after acquiring Iranian drones. But it showed little sign of building on the advance before the surprise offensive it began last week on the day that its commander, General Abdel Fattah al-Burhan, told the United Nations that the RSF had to withdraw and lay down its arms for there to be peace. The army now has control of the capital's Halfaya bridge, allowing it to build a foothold in Bahri from its bases in Omdurman. It has also weathered heavy clashes and sniper fire to advance across another Nile bridge that leads to the heart of the capital, military sources and witnesses said. Disease and starvation For months the RSF has besieged al-Fashir, which is crammed with some 1.8 million residents and displaced people. Activists and diplomats have warned of ethnically-charged bloodletting if the city falls, after similar violence that was blamed on the RSF and its allies elsewhere in Darfur. Two witnesses in al-Fashir told Reuters that the RSF had been shelling large areas of the city as the army responded with air strikes. The battle has dragged on as non-Arab former rebel groups and volunteers from displacement camps who are better equipped for ground combat than the army fight to protect themselves and their families, the witnesses said. A local group representing displaced people in Darfur said this week that the fighting had exacerbated the humanitarian situation in two dozen camps across the Darfur region, 'all of which suffer from a lack of the most basic daily necessities', and that disease and starvation were spreading. Aid workers and human rights activists say there has been little increase in humanitarian relief, despite pledges by both sides to improve access for aid. Sudan, often overlooked amid armed conflicts in Ukraine, Gaza and elsewhere, received some diplomatic attention at the U.N. General Assembly last week. But USAID Deputy Administrator Isobel Coleman told Reuters there had been little progress getting outside players to stop fueling the war. 'Both of the actors in this conflict, both sides of this, have outside support which they believe is going to tip the scales to their advantage,' she said.	https://www.voanews.com/a/sudan-s-war-to-intensify-as-rainy-season-draws-to-a-close-/7810231.html	2024-10-04T03:35:55-07:00	
Ukraine says Russia attacked its critical infrastructure with 19 drones	KYIV, Ukraine — The Ukrainian air force said on Friday that Russia attacked critical infrastructure in the country with 19 drones overnight. Air defenses shot down nine drones, with seven more likely impacted by electronic jamming, it said in a statement, without saying what happened to the other three. Kyiv mayor Vitali Klitschko said an apartment building was damaged in the capital but reported no casualties. The fire was promptly extinguished there, he added. The attack also damaged a business administrative building in the central region of Kirovohrad, causing light injuries to one of the employees, governor Andriy Raykovych said. Russian forces also hit critical infrastructure, utility facilities and 35 private residences in the past day in the southern Kherson region, Governor Oleksandr Prokudin. Various attacks there killed one and injured four more, he said.	https://www.voanews.com/a/ukraine-says-russia-attacked-its-critical-infrastructure-with-19-drones/7810176.html	2024-10-04T02:17:26-07:00	
Nuclear stalemate sparks debate over information campaign aimed at North Korea	Washington — As a nuclear standoff between the United States and North Korea continues with no diplomatic off-ramp in sight, some experts in Washington say an information campaign aimed at pressing North Korea should be considered as an alternative strategy, while others caution against such an approach. The discussion comes as the North escalates tensions while the U.N. Security Council remains split over how to respond to Pyongyang's increasing threats. Kim Song, North Korea's U.N. ambassador, told the U.N. General Assembly on Monday his country will resolutely hold onto its nuclear weapons, saying 'we will never bargain,' regardless of who gets elected as the next U.S. president in November. Last month, North Korea's state media outlets released photos showing leader Kim Jong Un visiting what they claimed to be a uranium enrichment facility, another move against international calls to resume talks on denuclearization. It was the first time it had disclosed a uranium enrichment facility publicly. Nuclear standoff Talks between the U.S. and North Korea have been stalled since October 2019. Moreover, Russia, one of five permanent members of the U.N. Security Council with veto power, has blocked U.N. action against the North since February 2022, when it invaded Ukraine. Moscow has deepened military ties with Pyongyang since it started the war. Russia has imported dozens of ballistic missiles and more than 18,000 containers of munitions and munitions-related materiel from North Korea since its invasion of Ukraine, Robert Wood, deputy U.S. ambassador to the U.N., said at a U.N. Security Council meeting in September. Some experts suggest Washington consider launching an information campaign against Pyongyang, separate from the work of Voice of America and Radio Free Asia, U.S. government-funded broadcasters. The two networks reach people inside North Korea through their Korean language broadcasts. David Maxwell, vice president of the Center for Asia Pacific Strategy, said Washington policymakers have long neglected an information campaign aimed at North Korea as a viable strategy for pressing Pyongyang to change its provocative behavior. 'We really haven't had an overall information strategy that cuts across everything that is happening,' Maxwell told VOA Korean on Tuesday in an interview. Maxwell, a former U.S. Special Forces colonel who served on the Combined Forces Command of the U.S and South Korea, said information is a threat to Pyongyang and could possibly drive the North Korean leader to the negotiating table. The U.S. should respond to every North Korean provocation by actively informing North Korean people of their dire human rights situations, Maxwell argued. 'If North Korea conducts a missile test, the response should not just stop at condemning the act,' he said. 'Kim's deliberate decision to prioritize nuclear weapons and missiles is what is causing the suffering of the Korean people in the North. That should be a routine message that we should be sending in response to every action by North Korea.' Targeted information campaign Bruce Bennett, a senior defense analyst at the Rand Corporation, said information could be part of the targeted efforts to put pressure on the Kim regime. 'We could tell Kim Jong Un, look, we know you're preparing to do a seventh nuclear weapon test. If you do that, we will send a million USB drives into the Pyongyang area with K-Pop, K-dramas and messages to your senior leaders,' he told VOA Korean by phone on Tuesday. Bennett stressed it is time that the U.S. government renews its understanding that information can be a powerful tool. 'You go back to World War II, we viewed information as being very powerful,' he said. 'But we've lost sight of that.' Bennett added that the U.S. government should mobilize its experts in psychological operations to put together an effective campaign plan. Some are cautious about using information tactics against North Korea. Robert Rapson, who served as chargé d'affaires and deputy chief of mission at the U.S. Embassy in Seoul from 2018 to 2021, told VOA Korean on Wednesday via email that an information campaign may complement sanctions and effective diplomacy, but risks could follow. 'Turning the volume and intensity of the information campaign way up, as some are now advocating, runs the clear risk of escalating tensions across the demilitarized zone in ways that threaten peace and stability, to include the distinct possibility of war,' Rapson said. 'The regime would undoubtedly see a high intensity information campaign as a major provocation of existential dimensions and would respond accordingly.' Rapson also said significant qualitative improvements are needed in dissemination technology as well as message focus and content, for an enhanced information campaign to have any chance of success, however long-term that might be. Potential risks Joseph DeTrani, who served as the special envoy for six-party denuclearization talks with North Korea from 2003 to 2006, said implementing such an approach would prove challenging but is 'doable.' 'The North Korean regime fears exposing its people to the reality of the outside world — the real situation in South Korea and other countries as compared to the dire economic and health care situation in North Korea,' DeTrani told VOA Korean on Wednesday via email. 'Mindful of this, inserting truthful information into North Korea must be done with care, given the harsh treatment by the regime to those who dare to listen or read foreign broadcasts, videos, newspapers, etc.' Meanwhile, Maxwell said the end goal of the information strategy should be to empower the North Korean people with information. 'Only through information can the people be empowered to create conditions where new emerging leadership can come to power,' he said. 'So that, they change the direction of North Korea and ultimately, their leaders.' The U.S. State Department has stressed the need for an effort to facilitate the flow of independent information into North Korea when asked whether the U.S. should consider using information as a pressure tool against the North. 'An informed citizenry, with unfettered access to information, is critical for responsive governance and contributes to regional peace, security, and prosperity,' a State Department spokesperson said in an emailed response on Thursday to a VOA Korean inquiry. 'The United States will continue to coordinate with like-minded governments to cooperate on areas such as access to information and advancing accountability for those responsible for human rights violations and abuses in the DPRK.' DPRK stands for the Democratic People's Republic of Korea, North Korea's official name.	https://www.voanews.com/a/nuclear-stalemate-sparks-debate-over-information-campaign-aimed-at-north-korea/7810170.html	2024-10-04T01:59:23-07:00	
Analysts: Japan's new prime minister may seek nuclear consulting body with US	Washington — Japan's new prime minister, Shigeru Ishiba, who began his term this week, may advocate for forming a nuclear body with the United States that is similar to an arrangement between the U.S. and South Korea aimed at planning for nuclear warfare contingencies. 'The U.S.-ROK [Republic of Korea, or South Korea] approach is probably a good example of where the U.S. and Japan might go in the future if nuclear threats keep increasing,' said James Schoff, a senior director of the U.S.-Japan NEXT Alliance Initiative at the Sasakawa Peace Foundation USA. 'It's not about nuclear sharing or Japan building its own nuclear forces — both politically impossible at the moment and not necessary — but [about] the alliance taking more practical steps to be prepared for U.S. nuclear retaliation, if it becomes necessary,' Schoff said. He said creating such a body would demonstrate resolve, credibility and readiness to any potential adversary and thus deter nuclear use in the first place. Nuclear talk body The new body would resemble the Nuclear Consultative Group (NCG) that South Korea and the United States established as part of the Washington Declaration in April 2023. The Washington-Seoul nuclear body is aimed at planning for potential nuclear contingencies caused by North Korea. A U.S.-Japan nuclear consultative body would focus on nuclear threats from China and Russia in addition to North Korea, analysts say. In a joint statement issued at their Security Consultative Committee meeting in July, Tokyo and Washington shared concerns over China's 'rapid expansion of its nuclear weapons arsenal' and agreed to strengthen deterrence through their ongoing Extended Deterrence Dialogue. 'Ishiba is likely to continue the strategies of [his predecessor Fumio] Kishida against China, and may in fact try to be bolder,' said Ryo Hinata-Yamaguchi, a nonresident senior fellow at the Atlantic Council's Indo-Pacific Security Initiative and an associate professor at Tokyo International University. Countering China Though he is not entirely anti-China, Ishiba, a former defense minister who analysts say tends to view foreign relations through a security framework, is expected to be tough on China's military assertions. 'Prime Minister Ishiba has spoken openly about the serious security challenges China poses to Japan,' said Ken Weinstein, the Japan chair at Hudson Institute. 'These challenges lie behind his desire for an Asian NATO and nuclear sharing, neither of which is likely to be policy,' Weinstein continued. 'Instead, we are likely to see a change in tone towards the PRC with a tougher line from the Kantei on Chinese provocations than we saw from the more establishmentarian Kishida government.' The People's Republic of China (PRC) is the official name of China, and the Kantei refers to the Japanese prime minister's office. Before Ishiba was elected, he wrote an article published in September by the Hudson Institute, an American conservative non-profit think tank based in Washington D.C., advocating for an Asian version of NATO that would consider sharing U.S. nuclear weapons or introducing nuclear weapons in the region. He said if nuclear threats by China and North Korea escalate in the region, 'the U.S. extended deterrence in the region will no longer function.' Extended deterrence involves a U.S. commitment to use all military assets, including nuclear weapons, to defend the region. Such a commitment would deter potential adversaries from causing any conflict. But in recent years, there has been growing skepticism among U.S. allies over its extended deterrence commitment, leading South Korea to call for its own nuclear weapons. In January 2023, South Korean President Yoon Suk Yeol said South Korea may have to consider developing its own nuclear weapons or ask the U.S. to redeploy nuclear weapons in South Korea. Yoon later retracted his statement after the NCG was created in April 2023, saying that South Korea will instead focus on enhancing deterrence with the United States to deal with North Korea's nuclear threat. Asian NATO Ishiba's call for a collective security arrangement like an Asian NATO and nuclear deployment and sharing options stems from uncertainty in relying 'solely on the security alliance with the U.S.,' said Daniel Sneider, a lecturer in international policy focusing on Japanese foreign policy at Stanford University. Ishiba sees 'the need to protect Taiwan from Chinese attempts to forcefully reunify' the self-governed island that Beijing considers its own territory. He also wants Japan 'to be prepared for any eventualities, including the retreat of the United States from global leadership,' amid concerns over U.S. foreign policy after the presidential election in November, Sneider said. Before Japan's own election this month, Ishiba, as a member of the Japanese Liberal Democratic Party, visited Taiwan in August and told Taiwan President Lai Ching-te that enhanced deterrence was necessary to resist China's aggression in the Taiwan Strait. The Sasakawa Peace Foundation's Schoff said Ishiba probably knows that a true Asian NATO is not feasible, but 'he is sending a signal to China and Russia that their aggressive use of military forces harassing other countries and penetrating their sovereign space is being noticed and will push Asian countries closer together in collective defense if they keep it up.' Japan accused a Chinese spy plane of violating its airspace for the first time in August. Matthew Brummer, a professor at the National Graduate Institute for Policy Studies in Tokyo, said instead of calling for an Asian NATO, Japan will likely increase cooperation with NATO countries, deepening security agreements, especially regarding joint technology sharing and production.	https://www.voanews.com/a/analysts-japan-s-new-prime-minister-may-seek-nuclear-consulting-body-with-us-/7810159.html	2024-10-04T01:23:42-07:00	
Dozens of zoo tigers die after contracting bird flu in southern Vietnam	HANOI, Vietnam — More than a dozen tigers were incinerated after the animals died after contracted bird flu at a zoo in southern Vietnam, officials said. State media VNExpress cited a caretaker at Vuon Xoai zoo in Bien Hoa city saying the animals were fed raw chicken bought from nearby farms. The panther and 20 tigers, including several cubs, weighed between 10 and 120 kilograms when they died. The bodies were incinerated and buried on the premises. 'The tigers died so fast. They looked weak, refused to eat and died after two days of falling sick,' said zoo manager Nguyen Ba Phuc. Samples taken from the tigers tested positive for H5N1, the virus that causes bird flu. The virus was first identified in 1959 and grew into a widespread and highly lethal menace to migratory birds and domesticated poultry. It has since evolved, and in recent years H5N1 was detected in a growing number of animals ranging from dogs and cats to sea lions and polar bears. In cats, scientists have found the virus attacking the brain, damaging and clotting blood vessels and causing seizures and death. More than 20 other tigers were isolated for monitoring. The zoo houses some 3,000 other animals including lions, bears, rhinos, hippos and giraffes. The 30 staff members who were taking care of the tigers tested negative for bird flu and were in normal health condition, VNExpress reported. Another outbreak also occurred at a zoo in nearby Long An province, where 27 tigers and three lions died within a week in September, the newspaper said. Unusual flu strains that come from animals are occasionally found in people. Health officials in the United States said Thursday that two dairy workers in California were infected — making 16 total cases detected in the country in 2024. 'The deaths of 47 tigers, three lions, and a panther at My Quynh Safari and Vuon Xoai Zoo amid Vietnam's bird flu outbreak are tragic and highlight the risks of keeping wild animals in captivity,' PETA Senior Vice President Jason Baker said in a statement sent to The Associated Press. 'The exploitation of wild animals also puts global human health at risk by increasing the likelihood of another pandemic,' Baker said. Bird flu has caused hundreds of deaths around the world, the vast majority of them involving direct contact between people and infected birds.	https://www.voanews.com/a/dozens-of-zoo-tigers-die-after-contracting-bird-flu-in-southern-vietnam/7810149.html	2024-10-04T00:52:12-07:00	
Israeli airstrikes rock southern suburbs of Beirut, cut off a key crossing into Syria	BEIRUT — Israel carried out a series of massive airstrikes overnight in southern suburbs of Beirut and another that cut off the main border crossing between Lebanon and Syria. The new wave of strikes came after Israel warned people to evacuate communities in southern Lebanon that are outside a United Nations-declared buffer zone, as the yearlong conflict between Israel and the Lebanese militant group Hezbollah escalates. Israel launched a ground incursion into Lebanon on Tuesday and its forces have been clashing with Hezbollah militants in a narrow strip along the border. A series of attacks before the incursion killed some of the group's key members, including longtime leader Hassan Nasrallah. The blasts overnight rocked Beirut's southern suburbs, sending huge plumes of smoke and flames into the night sky and shaking buildings kilometers away in the Lebanese capital. The Israeli military did not immediately comment on what the intended target was, and there was no information immediately available on casualties. Lebanon's state-run National News Agency reported that there were more than 10 consecutive airstrikes in the area late Thursday. The agency also reported that an Israeli airstrike led to the closure of the road near the busy Masnaa Border Crossing, from which tens of thousands of people fleeing war in Lebanon have crossed into Syria over the past two weeks. It gave no other details. The airstrike that cut the busiest border crossing between the two countries came a day after an Israeli military spokesperson said Lebanon's Hezbollah has been trying to transport military equipment through the border crossing. Hezbollah is believed to have received much of its weaponry from Iran via Syria. The group has a presence on both sides of the border, a region where it has been fighting alongside Syrian President Bashar Assad's forces. Dama Post, a pro-government Syrian media outlet, said Israeli warplanes fired two missiles, damaging the road between Masnaa Border Crossing in Lebanon and the Syrian crossing point of Jdeidet Yabous. It was the first time this major border crossing has been cut off since the beginning of the war. Lebanese General Security recorded 256,614 Syrian citizens and 82,264 Lebanese citizens crossing into Syrian territory between September 23 — when the Israel launched a heavy bombardment of southern and eastern Lebanon — and September 30. There are half a dozen border crossings between the two countries and most of them remain open. Lebanon's minister of public works said all border crossings between Lebanon and Syria work under the supervision of the state. Israel and Hezbollah have traded fire across Lebanon's southern border almost daily since the day after Hamas' cross-border attack on October 7, 2023, in which the militants killed 1,200 Israelis and took 250 others hostage. Meanwhile, the Israeli army said it carried out a strike Thursday in Tulkarem, a militant stronghold in the West Bank, in coordination with the Shin Bet internal security service. The Palestinian Health Ministry said 18 people were killed in an Israeli strike on a refugee camp there. Violence has flared across the Israeli-occupied territory since the Israel-Hamas war erupted in October 2023. Tulkarem and other northern cities have seen some of the worst violence. Israel declared war on Hamas in the Gaza Strip in response to their October 7 attack. More than 41,000 Palestinians have since been killed in the territory, and just over half the dead have been women and children, according to local health officials. Nearly 2,000 people have been killed in Lebanon in that time, most of them since September 23, according to the Lebanese Health Ministry.	https://www.voanews.com/a/israeli-airstrikes-rock-southern-suburbs-of-beirut-cut-off-a-key-crossing-into-syria-/7810144.html	2024-10-04T00:33:46-07:00	
Work and travel resume across Taiwan after Typhoon Krathon dissipates	KAOHSIUNG, Taiwan — Work, classes and flights resumed across Taiwan on Friday after Typhoon Krathon brought torrential rainfall to the island but finally dissipated over a mountain range. A heavy rain advisory remained in place for the northern coast and mountainous areas, where two landslides occurred early Friday. Krathon had brought much of the island to a standstill for three days but weakened to a tropical depression early Friday. Its center moved back over the sea after making a 'U-turn' across the island's southwestern tip overnight. Schools and businesses reopened with the exception of the city of Kaohsiung, Pingtung County, and some parts of Hualien County and New Taipei. Domestic flights, which had been grounded for two days, resumed. Krathon lashed Kaohsiung with winds up to 126 kph and higher gusts. It felled trees and flooded roads. Heavy rains and flooding also occurred along Taiwan's southern and eastern coasts. Mountainous Taitung County saw 171 centimeters of rain over six days. Two people died earlier in the week and one person remained missing, according to Taiwan's fire department. The missing person was swept off a bridge. Authorities had expected Krathon to bring devastation comparable to a major typhoon that swept Kaohsiung in 1977, causing 37 deaths. But it lost steam shortly after making landfall in Kaohsiung and reaching the mountains northeast of the city, according to the Central Weather Administration. Krathon was one of only two typhoons in recent history to 'die' over Taiwan, beside Typhoon Trami, in 2001, the weather agency said.	https://www.voanews.com/a/work-and-travel-resume-across-taiwan-after-typhoon-krathon-dissipates-/7810132.html	2024-10-03T23:22:37-07:00	
North Korea's Kim threatens to destroy South Korea with nuclear strikes if provoked	SEOUL, South Korea — North Korean leader Kim Jong Un threatened to use nuclear weapons and destroy South Korea permanently if provoked, state media reported Friday, after the South's leader warned that Kim's regime would collapse if he attempted to use nuclear arms. The exchange of such rhetoric between the rival Koreas is nothing new, but the latest comments come during heightened animosities over the North's recent disclosure of a nuclear facility and its continuation of missile tests. Next week, observers say North Korea's rubber-stamp parliament is expected to constitutionally declare a hostile 'two-state' system on the Korean Peninsula to formally reject reconciliation with South Korea and codify new national borders. During a visit to a special operation forces unit on Wednesday, Kim said his military 'would use without hesitation all the offensive forces it possesses, including nuclear weapons,' if South Korea attempts to use armed forces encroaching upon the sovereignty of North Korea, according to the North's official Korean Central News Agency. 'If such a situation comes, the permanent existence of Seoul and the Republic of Korea would be impossible,' Kim said, using South Korea's official name. Kim's statement was a response to South Korean President Yoon Suk Yeol's speech at his country's Armed Forces Day on Tuesday. Unveiling South Korea's most powerful Hyunmoo-5 ballistic missile and other conventional weapons that could target North Korea, Yoon said the day that North Korea tries to use nuclear weapons would be the end of the Kim government because Kim would face 'the resolute and overwhelming response' of the South Korean-U.S. alliance. Kim responded that Yoon's address fully betrayed his 'bellicose temerity' and showed 'the security uneasiness and irritating psychology of the puppet forces.' In a derisive comment, Kim called Yoon 'an abnormal man,' saying that 'the puppet Yoon bragged about an overwhelming counteraction of military muscle at the doorstep of a state that possesses nuclear weapons.' On Thursday, Kim's sister and senior official, Kim Yo Jong, also ridiculed South Korea's showcasing of the Hyunmoo-5 missile, saying there there's no way for South Korea to counter the North Korea's nuclear forces with conventional weapons. Since adopting an escalatory nuclear doctrine in 2022, Kim has repeatedly threatened to use nuclear weapons preemptively. But many foreign experts say it's still unlikely that he would use his nuclear arms first because his military is outmatched by the U.S. and its allied forces. In July, South Korea and the U.S. signed a defense guideline on integrating South Korea's conventional capabilities with the U.S. nuclear forces to better deal with North Korea's advancing nuclear program. South Korea has no nuclear weapons. Animosities between the Koreas are at the worst point in years with Kim's provocative run of missile tests and the South Korean-U.S. military exercises intensifying in a cycle of tit-for-tat. All communication channels and exchange programs between the rivals remain stalled since 2019, when a broader U.S.-North Korea diplomacy on ending the North's nuclear program collapsed. In January, Kim called for rewriting North Korea's constitution to eliminate the idea of a peaceful unification between the war-divided countries and to cement the South as an 'invariable principal enemy.' He also reiterated that his country does not recognize the Northern Limit Line, a western sea boundary that was drawn by the U.S.-led U.N. Command at the end of the 1950-53 Korean War. He called for the new constitution to include a clear definition of the North's territories. North Korea has traditionally insisted upon a boundary that encroaches deeply into waters currently controlled by South Korea. On Friday, South Korea's military said North Korea was again flying balloons likely carrying trash across the border into South Korea. Since late May, North Korea has launched thousands of rubbish-carrying balloons toward South Korea, prompting South Korea to resume anti-Pyongyang propaganda loudspeaker broadcasts at border areas.	https://www.voanews.com/a/north-korea-s-kim-threatens-to-destroy-south-korea-with-nuclear-strikes-if-provoked/7810110.html	2024-10-03T21:43:46-07:00	
Year-old Gaza conflict takes toll on neighboring Egypt	Cairo — The war unleashed by Israel after the Hamas-led attack on Israel on October 7, 2023, has ravaged not only the people of Gaza but also taken a toll on neighboring Egypt, keeping its government officials busy and straining its economy -- while also bringing some benefits. The conflict has spawned countless hours of diplomatic activity and a long list of visits by envoys from several countries. Mediation efforts have been unsuccessful, but the conflict has kept diplomats busy, with meetings of the Cairo-based Arab League and consultations involving Egypt, Qatar and the U.S., among others. Said Sadek, professor of peace studies and human rights at the Egypt-Japan University in Alexandria, told VOA Egypt has been one of the key players in mediation efforts between Israel and Hamas. He said its efforts have been successful at times and unsuccessful at others. 'Politically (the conflict) highlighted the Egyptian role in being a moderating force in the Middle East,' he said. 'In all the negotiations that took place later on between Hamas and Israel, they always needed a mediator, and it was Egypt and Qatar and the United States. And they all played a role in that and sometimes they succeeded and sometimes they failed.' The head of Egyptian intelligence, Abbas Kamel, spent many hours mediating between Israel and Hamas, as has U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken and Qatar's foreign minister, Mohammed bin Abdulrahman bin Jassim al Thani. Economically, the Gaza conflict has caused serious damage to the Egyptian economy, but it has also brought benefits, as Washington-based Middle East analyst Paul Sullivan pointed out. 'Egypt is being squeezed between many rocks and many hard places, with a few positive bits of light,' he said. 'Those positive bits include money flows from the GCC (Gulf Cooperation Council), the IMF (International Monetary Fund), the World Bank and others, to make sure that Egypt gets a bit more stabilized economically.' Sadek and Sullivan both agree the Egyptian economy suffered setbacks from the side effects of the Gaza conflict, including a massive drop in revenue from the Suez Canal, one of the Egyptian government's primary sources of income. 'The (Houthis) in Yemen blocked safe navigation across the Red Sea and that affected the Suez Canal that used to bring Egypt about $10 billion dollars,' said Sadek. 'Now we are getting only $3 billion, so there is a big loss of 70%.' Sullivan said Egypt is not only suffering from a loss of revenue from the Suez Canal due to ships going around the Horn of Africa to get to their destinations, but it is also in danger of a natural gas shortage 'if Israel were to cut off its gas exports to Egypt.' That would force the Egyptian government to import natural gas at considerably higher prices. Egyptians are already reeling. The government has raised the prices of petroleum and natural gas twice this year by as much as 15% each time.

Mixed verdict for 3 Memphis officers convicted in man’s fatal beating	MEMPHIS, Tennessee — Three former Memphis police officers were convicted Thursday in the 2023 fatal beating of Tyre Nichols, but were acquitted of the harshest charges they faced for a death that sparked national protests and calls for broad changes in policing. Jurors deliberated for about six hours before coming back with the mixed verdict for Tadarrius Bean, Demetrius Haley and Justin Smith. All were convicted of witness tampering related to the cover-up of the beating, but Bean and Smith were acquitted of civil rights charges. Haley was acquitted of violating Nichols' civil rights causing death, but convicted of the lesser charge of violating his civil rights causing bodily injury. He was also convicted of a conspiracy to witness tamper charge that the others were acquitted of. The court remained silent as the verdicts were read. The judge ordered all three officers to be taken into custody. He planned to hold a hearing Monday to hear from the defense lawyers about releasing them pending sentencing. The witness tampering charges carry possible sentences of up to 20 years in prison. The civil rights charge against Haley carries up to 10 years in prison. They had faced up to life in prison if convicted on the harshest charges. The verdict marked a partial setback for prosecutors who were unable to land a conviction for civil rights violations for two officers who played an active role in the encounter. Jurors repeatedly watched graphic clips from police video that showed the officers punch and kick Nichols and hit him with a police baton just steps from his home, as the 29-year-old called out for his mother. In a statement, Assistant U.S. Attorney General Kristen Clarke, who oversees the Justice Department's civil rights division, said 'Tyre Nichols should be alive today.' 'We hope this prosecution provides some measure of comfort as the law enforcement officers tied to his death have been held accountable,' Clarke said. Bean and Smith were seen on video wrestling with Nichols and holding his arms, while also hitting him, but the jury was not convinced those actions amounted to civil rights violations. An FBI agent said Smith told him he punched Nichols, but defense lawyers argued Bean and Smith were merely slapping Nichols' hands away as they tried to put handcuffs on him. Rodney Wells, Nichols' stepfather, told The Associated Press outside the courtroom: 'A win is a win. They're all going to jail.' Five officers were charged in Nichols' death, but two pleaded guilty and testified against members of their old crime suppression unit. Prosecutors argued that Nichols was beaten for running from a traffic stop, saying it was part of a common police practice referred to in officer slang as a 'street tax' or 'run tax. ' They said the officers lied — to a supervisor, to medical professionals attending to Nichols and in required written reports — about the extent of the force they used. 'This has been a long journey for our family,' RowVaughn Wells, Nichols' mother, told reporters. 'I'm actually in shock right now because I still can't believe all the stuff that's going on. But we're happy that they all have been convicted and they have been arrested.' Smith's lawyer declined to comment. Attorneys for Bean and Haley did not respond to requests for comment. Nichols, who was Black, ran from the traffic stop despite being hit with pepper spray and a Taser. The five officers, who were fired after the beating, also are Black. Some of the most emotional testimony at trial came from one of the officers, Desmond Mills, who took a plea deal in which prosecutors call for up to 15 years in prison. He testified in tears that he was sorry, that he left Nichols' young son fatherless and that he wishes he stopped the punches. Later, he testified that he went along with a cover-up in hopes that Nichols would survive and the whole thing would 'blow over.' Nichols died Jan. 10, 2023, three days after the beating. His son is now 7 years old. The other officer who reached a deal with prosecutors, Emmitt Martin, testified that Nichols was 'helpless' while officers pummeled him, and that afterward the officers understood 'they weren't going to tell on me, and I wasn't going to tell on them.' Under his plea agreement, prosecutors will suggest a prison sentence of up to 40 years. Defense attorneys sought to portray Martin as a principal aggressor. Martin testified Nichols was not a threat, yet he acknowledged punching and kicking Nichols in the head. Mills' lawyer declined to comment. Martin's attorney did not immediately respond to a phone message. The police video shows the officers milling about and talking as Nichols struggles with his injuries. An autopsy report shows he died from blows to the head. The report describes brain injuries, and cuts and bruises on his head and other areas. With the federal criminal trial complete, other investigations and court action still aren't settled. The five officers also have been charged with second-degree murder in state court, where they pleaded not guilty, although Mills and Martin are expected to change their pleas. A trial date in state court has not been set. The U.S. Department of Justice is conducting a 'patterns and practices' investigation into how Memphis officers use force and conduct arrests, and whether the department in the majority-Black city engages in racially discriminatory policing. The Justice Department also has a separate review concerning use of force, de-escalation strategies and specialized units within Memphis police. Pastor Earle Fisher, a Memphis activist who has long called for investigations of the city's police, said he hopes the probes 'provide for us the remedies we so rightly deserve.' Additionally, Nichols' mother filed a $550 million lawsuit against the city and its police chief. Ben Crump and Anthony Romanucci, lawyers for Nichols' family, said the verdicts 'bring a measure of accountability for his senseless and tragic death.' 'Our fight for justice for Tyre is far from over,' the lawyers said in a joint statement.	https://www.voanews.com/a/mixed-verdict-for-3-memphis-officers-convicted-in-man-s-fatal-beating/7810093.html	2024-10-03T20:33:19-07:00	
Grace period for US student loan payments is over. Here's what you need to know	NEW YORK — The 12-month grace period for student loan borrowers ended on September 30. The 'on-ramp' period helped borrowers who are struggling to make payments avoid the risk of defaulting and hurting their credit score. 'The end of the on-ramp period means the beginning of the potentially harsh consequences for student loan borrowers who are not able to make payments,' said Persis Yu, Deputy Executive Director at the Student Borrower Protection Center. Around 43 million Americans have student loan debt, amounting to $1.5 trillion. Around eight million of those borrowers had enrolled in the SAVE plan, the newest income-driven repayment plan that extended the eligibility for borrowers to have affordable monthly student loan payments. However, this plan is currently on hold due to legal challenges. With the on-ramp period and a separate program known as Fresh Start ending and the SAVE plan on hold, student loan borrowers who are struggling to afford their monthly payments have fewer options, added Yu. Student loan borrowers who haven't been able to afford their monthly payments must consider their options to avoid going into default. If you have student loans, here's what you need to know. What was the on-ramp period? The Education Department implemented this grace period to ease the borrower's transition to make payments after a three-year payment pause during the COVID-19 pandemic. During this year-long period, borrowers were encouraged to keep making payments since interest continued to accumulate. 'Normally, loans will default if you fall about nine months behind on making payments, but during this on-ramp period, missed payments would not move people towards defaulting and then being subject to forced collections. However, if you missed payments, you still be falling behind ultimately on repaying your loans,' said Abby Shaforth, director of National Consumer Law Center's Student Loan Borrower Assistance Project. Since this grace period has ended, student loan borrowers who don't make payments will go delinquent or, if their loans are not paid for nine months, go into default. Borrowers who cannot afford to make payments can apply for deferment or forbearance, which pause payments, though interest continues to accrue. What happens if I don't make my payments? Borrowers who can't or don't pay risk delinquency and eventually default. That can badly hurt your credit rating and make you ineligible for additional aid and government benefits. If a borrower missed one month's payment, they will start receiving email notifications, said Shaforth. Once the loan hasn't been paid for three months, loan servicers notify to the credit reporting agencies that the loan is delinquent, affecting your credit history. Once the borrower hasn't paid the loan for nine months, the loan goes into default. If you're struggling to pay, advisers first encourage you to check if you qualify for an income-driven repayment plan, which determines your payments by looking at your expenses. You can see whether you qualify by visiting the Federal Student Aid website. If you've worked for a government agency or a non-profit organization, you could also be eligible for the Public Service Loan Forgiveness Program, which forgives student debt after 10 years. What happens when a loan goes into default? When you fall behind on a loan by 270 days — roughly nine months — the loan appears on your credit report as being in default. Once a loan is in default, it goes into collections. This means the government can garnish wages (without a court order) to go towards paying back the loan, intercept tax refunds, and seize portions of Social Security checks and other benefit payments. What if I can't pay? If your budget doesn't allow you to resume payments, it's important to know how to navigate the possibility of default and delinquency on a student loan. Both can hurt your credit rating, which would make you ineligible for additional aid. If you're in a short-term financial bind, you may qualify for deferment or forbearance — allowing you to temporarily suspend payment. To determine whether deferment or forbearance are good options for you, you can contact your loan servicer. One thing to note: interest still accrues during deferment or forbearance. Both can also impact potential loan forgiveness options. Depending on the conditions of your deferment or forbearance, it may make sense to continue paying the interest during the payment suspension. What is an income-driven repayment plan? The U.S. Education Department offers several plans for repaying federal student loans. Under the standard plan, borrowers are charged a fixed monthly amount that ensures all their debt will be repaid after 10 years. But if borrowers have difficulty paying that amount, they can enroll in one of several plans that offer lower monthly payments based on income and family size. Those are known as income-driven repayment plans. Income-driven options have been offered for years and generally cap monthly payments at 10% of a borrower's discretionary income. If a borrower's earnings are low enough, their bill is reduced to $0. And after 20 or 25 years, any remaining debt gets erased. What is the latest with the SAVE program? In August, the Supreme Court kept on hold the SAVE plan, the income-driven repayment plan that would have lowered payments for millions of borrowers, while lawsuits make their way through lower courts. Eight million borrowers who had already enrolled in the SAVE plan don't have to pay their monthly student loan bills until the court case is resolved. Debt that already had been forgiven under the plan was unaffected. The next court hearing about this case will be held on October 15. What happened with the Fresh Start program? The Fresh Start program, which gave benefits to borrowers who were delinquent prior to the pandemic payment pause, also closed on September 30. During this limited program, student loan borrowers who were in default prior to the pandemic were given the opportunity to remove their loans from default, allowing them to enroll in income-driven payment plans, or apply for deferment, among other benefits.	https://www.voanews.com/a/grace-period-for-us-student-loan-payments-is-over-here-s-what-you-need-to-know-/7810088.html	2024-10-03T20:16:49-07:00	
US dockworkers to suspend strike until January	detroit — The union representing 45,000 striking U.S. dockworkers at East and Gulf coast ports reached a deal Thursday to suspend a three-day strike until January 15 to provide time to negotiate a new contract. The union, the International Longshoremen's Association, is to resume working immediately. The temporary end to the strike came after the union and the U.S. Maritime Alliance, which represents ports and shipping companies, reached a tentative agreement on wages, the union and ports said in a joint statement. A person briefed on the agreement said the ports sweetened their wage offer from about 50% over six years to 62%. The person didn't want to be identified because the agreement is tentative. Any wage increase would have to be approved by union members as part of the ratification of a final contract. The union went on strike early Tuesday after its contract expired in a dispute over pay and the automation of tasks at 36 ports stretching from Maine to Texas. The strike came at the peak of the holiday shopping season at the ports, which handle about half the cargo from ships coming into and out of the United States. The walkout raised the risk of shortages of goods on store shelves if it lasted more than a few weeks. Most retailers, though, had stocked up or shipped items early in anticipation of the dockworkers' strike. 'With the grace of God, and the goodwill of neighbors, it's gonna hold,' President Joe Biden told reporters Thursday night after the agreement. In a statement later, Biden applauded both sides 'for acting patriotically to reopen our ports and ensure the availability of critical supplies for Hurricane Helene recovery and rebuilding.' Biden said that collective bargaining is 'critical to building a stronger economy from the middle out and the bottom up.' The union's membership won't need to vote on the temporary suspension of the strike, meaning that giant cranes should start loading and unloading shipping containers Thursday night. Until January 15, the workers will be covered under the old contract, which expired on September 30. The union had been demanding a 77% raise over six years, plus a complete ban on the use of automation at the ports, which members see as a threat to their jobs. Both sides also have been apart on the issues of pension contributions and the distribution of royalties paid on containers that are moved by workers. Thomas Kohler, who teaches labor and employment law at Boston College, said the agreement to halt the strike means that the two sides are close to a final deal. 'I'm sure that if they weren't going anywhere they wouldn't have suspended (the strike),' he said. 'They've got wages. They'll work out the language on automation, and I'm sure that what this really means is it gives the parties time to sit down and get exactly the language they can both live with.' Industry analysts have said that for every day of a port strike it takes four to six days to recover. But they said a short strike of a few days probably wouldn't gum up the supply chain too badly. Kohler said the surprise end to the strike may catch railroads with cars, engines and crews out of position. But railroads are likely to work quickly to fix that. Just before the strike had begun, the Maritime Alliance said both sides had moved off their original wage offers, a tentative sign of progress. The settlement pushes the strike and any potential shortages past the November presidential election, eliminating a potential liability for Vice President Kamala Harris, the Democratic nominee. It's also a big plus for the Biden-Harris administration, which has billed itself as the most union-friendly in American history. Shortages could have driven up prices and reignited inflation. Thursday's deal came after administration officials met with foreign-owned shipping companies before dawn on Zoom, according to a person briefed on the day's events who asked not to be identified because the talks were private. The White House wanted to increase pressure to settle, emphasizing the responsibility to reopen the ports to help with recovery from Hurricane Helene, the person said. Acting Labor Secretary Julie Su told them she could get the union to the bargaining table to extend the contract if the carriers made a higher wage offer. Chief of Staff Jeff Zients told the carriers they had to make an offer by the end of the day so a manmade strike wouldn't worsen a natural disaster, the person said. By midday the Maritime Alliance members agreed to a large increase, bringing about the agreement, according to the person.	https://www.voanews.com/a/us-dockworkers-union-to-suspend-strike-until-january-to-allow-time-to-negotiate-new-contract-/7810083.html	2024-10-03T20:05:11-07:00

UK gives sovereignty of long-contested Chagos Islands to Mauritius	london — The British government agreed Thursday to hand sovereignty of the long-contested Chagos Islands, an archipelago of more than 60 islands in the Indian Ocean, to Mauritius, in a deal to secure the future of a strategically important U.K.-U.S. military base. British Foreign Secretary David Lammy said the agreement would secure the future of the base at Diego Garcia, the largest in the chain of remote islands off the tip of India that has been under British control for over 50 years. The base, which is home to about 2,500 personnel, mainly Americans, has been involved in military operations including the 2003 war in Iraq and the long-running war in Afghanistan. Britain's Labour government said without the deal, the secure operation of the military base would be under threat, with contested sovereignty and legal challenges, including through various international courts and tribunals. 'It will strengthen our role in safeguarding global security, shut down any possibility of the Indian Ocean being used as a dangerous illegal migration route to the U.K., as well as guaranteeing our long-term relationship with Mauritius, a close Commonwealth partner,' Lammy said. The agreement also paves the way for the potential return of the few people still alive who were forcibly displaced from their homes on the islands decades ago. As part of the deal, the U.K. will retain sovereignty of Diego Garcia for an initial period of 99 years and will pay Mauritius an undisclosed rent. It will also create a 'resettlement' fund for displaced Chagossians aimed at letting them move back to the islands other than Diego Garcia. The Chagos Islands, which conjure up images of paradise with their lush vegetation and long stretches of white sandy beaches, have been at the heart of what Britain has called the British Indian Ocean Territory since 1965, when they were siphoned away from Mauritius, a former U.K. colony that gained independence three years later. Mauritius, which lies east of Madagascar in southern Africa, is around 2,100 kilometers (1,250 miles) southwest of the Chagos Islands. Following a lease agreement with Britain, the U.S. built the naval base at Diego Garcia for defense purposes in the 1970s. The U.S. has described the base as 'an all but indispensable platform' for security operations in the Middle East, South Asia and East Africa. Around 1,500 inhabitants from the Chagos Islands were displaced to make way for the U.S. base, in what Human Rights Watch said last year amounted to 'crimes against humanity committed by a colonial power against an indigenous people.' Chagossian Voices, a U.K.-based group representing the Chagossian diaspora around the world, voiced disappointment that the negotiations excluded those displaced. 'Chagossians have learned this outcome from the media and remain powerless and voiceless in determining our own future and the future of our homeland,' it said in a statement on social media. 'The views of Chagossians, the indigenous inhabitants of the islands, have been consistently and deliberately ignored and we demand full inclusion in the drafting of the treaty.' The agreement will be included in a treaty and is dependent on legal processes being finalized. Both sides have committed to complete this as quickly as possible. A spokesman for British Prime Minister Keir Starmer said he spoke to his Mauritius counterpart, Pravind Jugnauth, on Thursday morning, welcoming the agreement after two years of negotiations that began under the previous Conservative government. 'Fifty-six years after our independence, the decolonization is finally complete,' Jugnauth said in a televised address to the nation later Thursday. The Mauritius government said that the treaty would aim to resolve all outstanding issues related to the islands, including 'its former inhabitants,' as well as addressing 'the wrongs of the past.' It laid out the hope that those displaced who are still alive and their descendants, who are mainly living in the U.K., Mauritius and the Seychelles, would have a right to return, as it is now 'free' to implement a resettlement program on the islands except Diego Garcia. It added that the U.K. will financially support the Chagossians, who have fought a long-running legal battle about their displacement, most recently in 2016 when they lost out in a Supreme Court ruling in the U.K. At the time, the previous Conservative government refused their right to return but voiced its 'deep regret' for the way the Chagossian community had been mistreated in the 1960s and 1970s. Over the years, the Chagossians and Mauritius have garnered increasing international support, notably among African nations and within the United Nations. In 2019, in an advisory option that was nonbinding, the International Court of Justice ruled that the U.K. had unlawfully carved up Mauritius when it agreed to end colonial rule in the late 1960s. In a statement, the White House said President Joe Biden applauded the 'historic agreement' on the status of the Chagos Islands. 'The agreement secures the effective operation of the joint facility on Diego Garcia into the next century,' the statement said. In the U.K., Conservative lawmakers standing to be leader of Britain's opposition party expressed dismay at the decision to hand over sovereignty of all but one of the islands. They were criticized for the comments, given that the previous Conservative government started the negotiations. One of the candidates, Tom Tugendhat, said he has consistently opposed any plan to hand over sovereignty of the islands and warned that the move could see Mauritius potentially leasing one of the islands to China. 'This is a shameful retreat undermining our security and leaving our allies exposed,' he said.	https://www.voanews.com/a/uk-gives-sovereignty-of-long-contested-chagos-islands-to-mauritius-/7809658.html	2024-10-03T15:12:20-07:00

Hurricane pushes climate change to forefront of presidential campaign	WASHINGTON — The devastation wrought by Hurricane Helene has brought climate change to the forefront of the presidential campaign after the issue lingered on the margins for months. Vice President Kamala Harris traveled to Georgia Wednesday to see hard-hit areas, two days after her Republican opponent, former President Donald Trump, was in the state and criticized the federal response to the storm, which has killed at least 200 people in the Southeast. Helene is the deadliest storm to hit the U.S. mainland since Hurricane Katrina in 2005. President Joe Biden toured some of the hardest-hit areas by helicopter on Wednesday and Thursday. Biden, who has frequently been called on to survey damage and console victims after tornadoes, wildfires, tropical storms and other natural disasters, traveled to the Carolinas, Florida and Georgia to get a closer look at the hurricane devastation. 'Storms are getting stronger and stronger,' Biden said Wednesday after surveying damage near Asheville, North Carolina. At least 70 people died in the state. 'Nobody can deny the impact of the climate crisis anymore,'' Biden said at a briefing in Raleigh, North Carolina. 'They must be brain dead if they do.' Harris, meanwhile, hugged and huddled with a family Wednesday in hurricane-ravaged Augusta, Georgia. 'There is real pain and trauma that resulted because of this hurricane'' and its aftermath, Harris said outside a storm-damaged house with downed trees in the yard. 'We are here for the long-haul,'' she said. Storm damage forces discussion The focus on the storm — and its link to climate change — was notable after climate change was only lightly mentioned in two presidential debates this year. The candidates instead focused on abortion rights, the economy, immigration and other issues. The hurricane featured prominently in Tuesday's vice-presidential debate as Republican JD Vance and Democrat Tim Walz were asked about the storm and the larger issue of climate change. Both men called the hurricane a tragedy and agreed on the need for a strong federal response. But it was Walz, the governor of Minnesota, who put the storm in the context of a warming climate. 'There's no doubt this thing roared onto the scene faster and stronger than anything we've seen,' he said. Bob Henson, a meteorologist and writer with Yale Climate Connections, said it was no surprise that Helene is pushing both the federal disaster response and human-caused climate change into the campaign conversation. 'Weather disasters are often overlooked as a factor in big elections,'' he said. 'Helene is a sprawling catastrophe, affecting millions of Americans. And it dovetails with several well-established links between hurricanes and climate change, including rapid intensification and intensified downpours.' More than 40 trillion gallons of rain drenched the Southeast in the last week, an amount that if concentrated in North Carolina would cover the state in 3 1/2 feet of water. 'That's an astronomical amount of precipitation,' said Ed Clark, head of the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration's National Water Center in Tuscaloosa, Alabama. Candidates make claims, counter claims During Tuesday's debate, Walz credited Vance for past statements acknowledging that climate change is a problem. But he noted that Trump has called climate change 'a hoax' and joked that rising seas 'would make more beachfront property to be able to invest in.' Trump said in a speech Tuesday that 'the planet has actually gotten little bit cooler recently,' adding: 'Climate change covers everything.' In fact, summer 2024 sweltered to Earth's hottest on record, making it likely this year will end up as the warmest humanity has measured, according to the European climate service Copernicus. Global records were shattered just last year as human-caused climate change, with a temporary boost from an El Niño, keeps dialing up temperatures and extreme weather, scientists said. Vance, an Ohio senator, said he and Trump support clean air, clean water and 'want the environment to be cleaner and safer.' However, during Trump's four years in office, he took a series of actions to roll back more than 100 environmental regulations. Vance sidestepped a question about whether he agrees with Trump's statement that climate change is a hoax. 'What the president has said is that if the Democrats — in particular Kamala Harris and her leadership — really believe that climate change is serious, what they would be doing is more manufacturing and more energy production in the United States of America. And that's not what they're doing,' he said. 'This idea that carbon [dioxide] emissions drives all of the climate change. Well, let's just say that's true just for the sake of argument. So, we're not arguing about weird science. If you believe that, what would you want to do?' Vance asked. The answer, he said, is to 'produce as much energy as possible in the United States of America, because we're the cleanest economy in the entire world.'' Vance claimed that policies by Biden and Harris actually help China, because many solar panels, lithium-ion batteries and other materials used in renewable energy and electric vehicles are made in China and imported to the United States. Walz rebutted that claim, noting that the Inflation Reduction Act, the Democrats' signature climate law approved in 2022, includes the largest-ever investment in domestic clean energy production. The law, for which Harris cast the deciding vote, has created 200,000 jobs across the country, including in Ohio and Minnesota, Walz said. Vance was not in the Senate when the law was approved. 'We are producing more natural gas and more oil [in the United States] than we ever have,' Walz said. 'We're also producing more clean energy.' The comment echoed a remark by Harris in last month's presidential debate. The Biden-Harris administration has overseen 'the largest increase in domestic oil production in history because of an approach that recognizes that we cannot over rely on foreign oil,' Harris said then. While Biden rarely mentions it, domestic fossil fuel production under his administration is at an all-time high. Crude oil production averaged 12.9 million barrels a day last year, eclipsing a previous record set in 2019 under Trump, according to the U.S. Energy Information Administration. Democrats want to continue investments in renewable energy such as wind and solar power — and not just because supporters of the Green New Deal want that, Walz said. 'My farmers know climate change is real. They've seen 500-year droughts, 500-year floods back-to-back. But what they're doing is adapting,'' he said. 'The solution for us is to continue to move forward, [accept] that climate change is real' and reduce reliance on fossil fuels, Walz said, adding that the administration is doing exactly that. 'We are seeing us becoming an energy superpower for the future, not just the current'' time, he said.	https://www.voanews.com/a/hurricane-pushes-climate-change-to-forefront-of-presidential-campaign-/7809571.html	2024-10-03T14:12:41-07:00	
Florida communities hit by 3 hurricanes grapple with whether to rebuild	HORSESHOE BEACH, Florida — It was just a month ago that Brooke Hiers left the state-issued emergency trailer where her family had lived since Hurricane Idalia slammed into her Gulf Coast fishing village of Horseshoe Beach in August 2023. Hiers and her husband, Clint, were still finishing the electrical work in the home they painstakingly rebuilt themselves, wiping out Clint's savings to do so. They will never finish that wiring job. Hurricane Helene blew their newly renovated home off its 4-foot-high pilings, sending it floating into the neighbor's yard next door. 'You always think, 'Oh, there's no way it can happen again,'' Hiers said. 'I don't know if anybody's ever experienced this in the history of hurricanes.' For the third time in 13 months, this windswept stretch of Florida's Big Bend took a direct hit from a hurricane — a one-two-three punch to an 80-kilometer (50-mile) sliver of the state's more than 13,500 kilometers (8,400 miles) of coastline, first by Idalia, then Hurricane Debby in August 2024 and now Helene. Hiers, who sits on Horseshoe Beach's town council, said words like 'unbelievable' are beginning to lose their meaning. 'I've tried to use them all. Catastrophic. Devastating. Heartbreaking … none of that explains what happened here,' Hiers said. The back-to-back hits to Florida's Big Bend are forcing residents to reckon with the true costs of living in an area under siege by storms that researchers say are becoming stronger because of climate change. The Hiers, like many others here, can't afford homeowners insurance on their flood-prone houses, even if it were available. Residents who have watched their life savings get washed away multiple times are left with few choices — leave the communities where their families have lived for generations, pay tens of thousands of dollars to rebuild their houses on stilts as building codes require, or move into a recreational vehicle they can drive out of harm's way. That's if they can afford any of those things. The storm left many residents bunking with family or friends, sleeping in their cars or sheltering in what's left of their collapsing homes. Janalea England wasn't waiting for outside organizations to get aid to her friends and neighbors, turning her commercial fish market in the river town of Steinhatchee into a pop-up donation distribution center, just like she did after Hurricane Idalia. A row of folding tables was stacked with water, canned food, diapers, soap, clothes and shoes, a steady stream of residents coming and going. 'I've never seen so many people homeless as what I have right now. Not in my community,' England said. 'They have nowhere to go.' The sparsely populated Big Bend is known for its towering pine forests and pristine salt marshes that disappear into the horizon, a remote stretch of largely undeveloped coastline that's mostly dodged the crush of condos, golf courses and souvenir strip malls that has carved up so much of the Sunshine State. This is a place where teachers, mill workers and housekeepers could still afford to live within walking distance of the Gulf's white sand beaches. Or at least they used to, until a third successive hurricane blew their homes apart. Helene was so destructive, many residents don't have a home left to clean up, escaping the storm with little more than the clothes on their backs, even losing their shoes to the surging tides. With marinas washed away, restaurants collapsed, and vacation homes blown apart, many commercial fishermen, servers and house cleaners lost their homes and their jobs on the same day. Those who worked at the local sawmill and paper mill, two bedrock employers in the area, were laid off in the past year too. Now a convoy of semi-trucks full of hurricane relief supplies have set up camp at the shuttered mill in the city of Perry. Hud Lilliott was a mill worker for 28 years, before losing his job and now his canal-front home in Dekle Beach, just down the street from the house where he grew up. Lilliott and his wife, Laurie, hope to rebuild their house there, but they don't know how they'll pay for it. And they're worried the school in Steinhatchee where Laurie teaches first grade could become another casualty of the storm, as the county watches its tax base float away. 'We've worked our whole lives, and we're so close to where they say the 'golden years,'' Laurie said. 'It's like you can see the light and it all goes dark.' Dave Beamer rebuilt his home in Steinhatchee after it was 'totaled' by Hurricane Idalia, only to see it washed into the marsh a year later. 'I don't think I can do that again,' Beamer said. 'Everybody's changing their mind about how we're going to live here.' Beamer plans to stay in this river town but will put his home on wheels. He says he’ll buy a camper and build a pole barn to park it under. In Horseshoe Beach, Hiers is waiting for a makeshift town hall to be delivered in the coming days, a double-wide trailer where they'll offer what services they can for as long as they can. She and her husband are staying with their daughter, a 45-minute drive away. 'You feel like this could be the end of things as you knew it. Of your town. Of your community,' Hiers said. 'We just don't even know how to recover at this point.'	https://www.voanews.com/a/florida-communities-hit-by-3-hurricanes-grapple-with-whether-to-rebuild-/7809628.html	2024-10-03T14:07:46-07:00	
Thousands rally in Austria against far right	vienna — Thousands of people protested in Austria's capital, Vienna, on Thursday against a possible return to power for the far-right Freedom Party (FPOe), which topped national elections on Sunday. The FPOe won almost 29% of the vote in Sunday's general election, ahead of the conservative People's Party (OeVP) with just over 26%. 'The Austrian Freedom Party is a danger because it has already said that it wants to govern in the image of Hungary's Viktor Orban,' said student Rihab Toumi, 26, referring to the nationalist leader of Austria's neighboring country. Although the FPOe topped the polls, there is no guarantee that its radical leader, Herbert Kickl, will be given a chance to form a government since no other party is willing to work with him. 'This result was a shock, and we cannot let a party that drifts so far to the right garner so much support without saying anything,' said social worker Marianne, 53, who declined to share her surname. Organizers said there were 15,000 to 17,000 protesters in central Vienna who marched toward parliament. Demonstrators held up placards that said, 'Let's defend democracy,' 'No alliances with Putin's friends,' and other anti-FPOe slogans. Kickl has criticized European Union sanctions against Russian President Vladimir Putin and his inner circle over Moscow's invasion of Ukraine. Demonstrators intend to march every Thursday, having similarly done so after the far-right formed part of short-lived coalition governments in 2000 and 2017.	https://www.voanews.com/a/thousands-rally-in-austria-against-far-right-/7809618.html	2024-10-03T13:58:48-07:00	
Yazidi sex slave rescued from Gaza in rare, internationally collaborative mission	Washington — The State Department has confirmed to VOA the success of a complicated mission to rescue an Iraqi national and former Islamic State sex slave from Gaza via Israel. Because of a long-running diplomatic rift between Israel and Iraq, it took months of vigorous efforts by humanitarian activists and direct intervention from U.S. diplomatic missions in the region to coordinate the young woman’s rescue. Cooperation among Israeli, Jordanian, Iraqi and United Nations officials was involved. 'On October 1, 2024, the United States helped to safely evacuate from Gaza a young Yazidi woman to be reunited with her family in Iraq,' a State Department spokesperson told VOA on Wednesday, adding that the young woman’s story 'is heartbreaking, and we are glad that she will be reunited with her family in Iraq.' Enslaved by Islamic State Now 21, Fawzia Amin Saydo was kidnapped by Islamic State militants from her hometown of Sinjar in August 2014, just a month before her 11th birthday. She and two of her brothers, aged 7 and 10 at the time, were among thousands of Yazidis enslaved by IS due to their religious beliefs. Although the brothers found a way to escape, Saydo spent years suffering violence, injustice and rape by IS fighters. By early 2015, she was taken to the Syrian city of Raqqa where she was imprisoned and raped before being forcibly 'married' to a then 24-year-old Palestinian IS fighter. 'He told me that I had to sleep with him. On the third day, he went to a pharmacy and brought a drug that numbs part of the body. He gave me the drug and I cried,' Saydo recounted in an August 2023 interview from Gaza with the Kurdish media outlet Rudaw. About a year after her arrival in Raqqa, Saydo’s life took another turn when she gave birth to a boy, the first of two children she would have with the Palestinian IS fighter. Saydo decided to dedicate her life to her children, despite the husband turning more abusive, especially after he married another woman. By the end of 2018, when the U.S.-led Kurdish forces squeezed IS out of the group’s territories in Syria, Saydo, then 15 years old, lost contact with her Palestinian captor, who had escaped from northeast Syria to the rebel-held Idlib province in northwest Syria. In early 2019 she was driven to Idlib to be returned to her captor, but their reunion was brief, as the Palestinian militant was soon reported dead. No cause of death was reported. Fearing that her community back in Sinjar, Iraq, might not accept her children — Yazidi spiritual leaders that same year had issued a decree stating that children of rape by IS militants would not be welcomed into the faith — Saydo decided to move in with the Palestinian man’s family in Gaza, where she arrived in 2020. Stuck in Gaza Humanitarian activists who followed Saydo’s case told VOA that her circumstances in Gaza presented a gut-wrenching choice: stay with her children and endure the Palestinian family that became abusive just as their late son had been, or escape — alone and without her children — in the hopes of reuniting with long-lost family in Sinjar. Her resolve to leave was strengthened by Hamas’ deadly October 7 attack on Israel. 'This has been by far the most complicated case I have worked on,' said Steve Maman of the Montreal-based Liberation of Christian and Yazidi Children of Iraq. It took Maman and a small team of Iraqi activists several months of lobbying Iraqi, U.S., and Israeli officials. While waiting for a final decision from Israel, Maman and his supporters helped her escape the Palestinian family’s home and hide in a house about 2 kilometers away from the Israeli army at Kerm Shalom crossing. The rescue process, which VOA has followed since early September, was slow and rescheduled several times due to the difficulty of navigating the Israel-Iraq diplomatic rift. 'I have no idea why every party was so hesitant to act on such a humanitarian case. Now I can finally get my much-needed sleep,' one of Maman’s supporters who asked that his name be withheld, told VOA. Another activist from Sinjar, Sufyan Waheed Hammo, told VOA, 'The Iraqi officials were very helpful when it came to preparing paperwork, but they couldn’t do much diplomatically because of the Iraqi law.' Iraq's parliament in May 2022 passed legislation that criminalized any ties with Israel. According to Maman, what finally triggered U.S. officials in the region to make a final push to rescue her was 'a deeply troubling incident' that occurred just a day before her rescue. 'She was walking alone when a group of men abused her.' Complicated handoff In the early morning of October 1, a 'personnel team' whose individual identities are known only to U.S., U.N. and likely Israeli officials, drove Saydo to Israel via Kerm Shalom crossing in a U.N. ambulance. According to Maman’s supporters, Saydo arrived at the U.S. Embassy in Jerusalem that day before moving on to Jordan via the Allenby Bridge crossing. Salwan Sinjaree, chief of staff to Iraq’s foreign minister, told VOA that his government had no contact with the Israeli government during the rescue process. 'Our embassy in Amman received her, prepared travel documents for her, and hired a plane to fly her back to Baghdad with one of our female embassy staff,' Sinjaree told VOA. 'All our contacts during the process have been with the U.S. embassy, the Jordanian foreign ministry, and the U.N. We have not made any communication with Israel.' The official from the Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu’s office who was tasked to handle the case turned down VOA’s request for comment. Saydo arrived in Baghdad via a plane around 10:30 a.m. local time Wednesday. She was then escorted by a team of Iraqi intelligence officers to Mosul, where she was reunited with family. Saydo’s brother Barzan told VOA from Germany that the rest of his family, including their mother, sister, and two brothers, are thrilled to see her after a decade apart. Her father, however, would not be there to witness his daughter’s return, Barzan added, because he died of a heart attack just two months prior, 'caused by the pain of the separation from her.' 'We welcome her back and support her decision to return home. She didn’t have any choice in what happened,' he told VOA. 'My heartfelt thanks every single person who helped to rescue her.' Ongoing trauma Beyond Saydo’s trauma of the past decade, however, is a new kind of pain in the wake of reunion: the reality of now living apart from her young son and daughter, who remain with their father’s family in Gaza. Despite the impossible choice with which Saydo was confronted in Gaza, some still insist on judging her decision to flee her captor’s family. 'No mother would leave her children. They came from her belly,' an activist associated with Maman who wanted to be cited only by his first initial, D, told VOA. According to Mirza Dinnayi, a Yazidi activist based in Germany, at least 2,745 Yazidis remain missing since the 2014 IS massacre of some 5,000 members of their religious community. That event, which the U.N. has said constitutes an act of genocide, also resulted in the abductions of young Yazidi women like Saydo and the displacement of an estimated 100,000 members of the faith who were forced to take refuge outside of Iraq. 'We do not know if those missing people are still alive or not. If they are alive, they are probably held in different places of Syria such as in al-Hol camp or in areas controlled by terrorists in northwest Syria,' Dinnayi told VOA. 'There are rare cases of Yazidis found in Turkey and some unverified reports about some people taken to Egypt.' For Maman and his fellow activists, saving Saydo from conflict-ridden Gaza is a way to help the community recover. It is also a message of hope at a time when tensions between Israel and Iran enter a new phase. 'I am a practicing Jew, and I was willing to put aside my life to help a Yazidi girl get out,' he told VOA. 'I had to fight my contacts in this case because it was not that easy, but the result is at the end a life is saved.' The State Department spokesperson told VOA that they are asking people to respect Saydo’s privacy 'for her own safety while she reunites with loved ones and returns home.' Dakhil Shammo of VOA’s Kurdish Service contributed reporting from Washington.	https://www.voanews.com/a/yazidi-sex-slave-rescued-from-gaza-in-rare-internationally-collaborative-mission/7809579.html	2024-10-03T13:40:27-07:00	
California investigating possible case of bird flu in dairy worker	chicago — California is investigating a possible case of bird flu in a dairy worker who had contact with infected cattle, the state's public health department said Thursday. The virus' jump to cattle in 14 states and infections of 13 dairy and poultry farmworkers this year have concerned scientists and federal officials about the risks to humans from further spread. The worker had a 'presumptive positive' result to a test for bird flu, and the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention will do further testing to confirm the finding, the California Department of Public Health said in a statement. The person, who was not identified, suffered only conjunctivitis, or pink eye, the department said in a statement. The person is being treated with antiviral medication and staying home, it added. The person works at a Central Valley dairy facility suffering an outbreak in cattle, according to the statement. Cows at dairy farms in California, the top U.S. milk-producing state, began testing positive for bird flu in late August. 'The risk to the general public remains low, although people who interact with infected animals are at higher risk of getting bird flu,' the department said. Missouri last month confirmed bird flu in a person with underlying medical conditions who had no immediate known animal exposure. Six health care workers who cared for the Missouri patient developed respiratory symptoms, but the virus was not confirmed in any of them. Scientists are watching closely for signs that the virus has begun to spread more easily in people. The U.S. Food and Drug Administration on Thursday said it would begin testing raw cow's milk intended for pasteurization at dairy plants to better understand the prevalence of the bird flu virus in milk. Participation in the study, set to begin October 28, is voluntary, and pasteurized dairy products remain safe to consume, the agency said. Prior FDA testing of retail dairy samples came back negative, and more such testing is underway.	https://www.voanews.com/a/california-investigating-possible-case-of-bird-flu-in-dairy-worker-/7809564.html	2024-10-03T13:14:25-07:00	
In the fast lane: Chinese car imports grow in South Africa	Johannesburg — In South Africa’s capital of Johannesburg, some of the most ubiquitous vehicles on the streets are the thousands of minibus taxis crammed tight with daily commuters traveling from the dusty townships into work. At the other end of the spectrum are souped-up sports cars and flashy convertibles zooming around the leafy suburbs that are home to the elite. Increasingly, however, there’s another kind of vehicle cruising Johannesburg’s streets: new gas-powered SUVs with names like Chery, BAIC and Haval — all Chinese cars that industry experts say are giving more established brands a run for their money and gaining popularity with South Africans. Potential car buyer Ross Grey was considering a large pick-up truck made by Chinese manufacturer JAC Motors. 'I’m a sales manager at a kitchen company, hence why I’m looking at buying a double cab, because I’ve got a young family and I need to also carry a lot of goods on the back of the vehicle, I’m often on building sites and that sort of thing,' he told VOA recently. His interest in a Chinese-made vehicle stemmed in part from a bad experience. 'The Chinese vehicles are not on the stolen list like the big brands are,' said Grey, who was a loyal Toyota Hilux owner until car thieves stole his car. The Hilux is one of the most stolen cars in South Africa – often for its engine, which fits perfectly into commuter minibus taxis. Along with consumers, car thieves are taking notice of Chinese makes and models, data shows. South Africans used to be skeptical about cars with the 'made in China' label. While Grey acknowledged Chinese brands have not yet stood the test of time, he said his research shows the quality seems to have improved in recent years. In the fast lane The biggest draw for many Chinese car buyers, including Grey, is the cost. 'The reason I’m looking at something like this, the Chinese vehicles, is because first of all the price, it’s a lot cheaper than your big brands that have been in the country for many, many years,' he said. Chinese-imported vehicles cost a lot less than most SUVs from Germany’s Volkswagen, America’s Ford or Japan’s Toyota, said Mikel Mabasa, CEO of South Africa’s car industry organization Naamsa. 'These Chinese brands have actually been growing at double digits, particularly in the last three years,' he told VOA. 'So if you look at growth between 2019 and 2023, we’ve seen actually a more than 200% increase in terms of Chinese brands that are coming into the South African market, and that is obviously very, very unusual.' Mabasa added: 'But I think there are reasons … many of those brands, if you look at the price points, are much cheaper than competing brands.' The number of imported Chinese vehicles in South Africa has steadily increased, with more than 39,000 automobiles brought into the country last year, compared with some 11,000 in 2019, according to Naamsa figures. German imports showed the opposite trend, with just over 21,000 coming into the country in 2023, down from almost 37,000 in 2019. Vehicles imported from Japan show similar figures. The U.S. exported almost 4,200 vehicles in 2019 but close to 300 fewer automobiles last year, statistics show. In terms of sales, certain models of established brands such as Ford and Toyota are still leading the pack, but Chinese upstarts are not far behind. Between July 2023 and July 2024, Chinese brand Chery sold more than 11,000 of their Tiggo 4 Pro models in South Africa. That’s compared with 25,000 Ford Rangers and 34,000 Toyota Hilux pickup trucks during the same period. Going electric South Africa is itself a major producer of cars, with manufacturing plants in the country for brands including Ford, Toyota, BMW, Mercedes, Nissan, Volkswagen and Suzuki. 'Thirty-nine percent of the components that they use in the manufacturing process are sourced locally in South Africa,' Mabasa told VOA. He said that while some of the cars made in South Africa go to the local market, more than 60% are exported overseas to nearly 150 countries. The first local Chinese car manufacturing plant for BAIC was opened by Chinese President Xi Jinping and South African counterpart Cyril Ramaphosa in Eastern Cape province to great fanfare in 2018. The Chinese consulate in Cape Town described the project 'as a milestone for the two countries' economies.' But the project hit some bumps in the road. 'They’re still in the setting up phase, they’ve obviously experienced some hiccups in getting that particular plant off the ground,' said Mabasa. BAIC executives have told local South African media the pandemic and labor disputes were to blame for the delay. But Mabasa is still hopeful. 'We obviously wish them well, and I think it’s a model that a number of other plants or companies from China would definitely adopt as a template should they wish to come into South Africa and start manufacturing vehicles,' he said. That’s something Ramaphosa is also encouraging. On a state visit to China last month, he visited the headquarters of massive Chinese electric vehicle maker BYD. 'We have introduced policies to promote the development of the electric vehicle industry in South Africa,' the South African president said on the trip. 'We are certain that companies such as BYD … will find South Africa a unique and advantageous location that can serve as a hub to reach other markets.' The electric vehicle revolution is in the very nascent stages in South Africa, where gas is still king. However, BYD is looking to Africa as it faces increasing trade restrictions in the U.S. and Europe. BYD already has a showroom in South Africa and recently opened others in Rwanda, Zambia and Kenya.	https://www.voanews.com/a/in-the-fast-lane-chinese-car-imports-grow-in-south-africa/7809451.html	2024-10-03T11:54:21-07:00

Boston university relaunches journalism curriculum to encompass humanities	Washington — As the fall semester begins, a women’s college in Boston, Massachusetts, has retooled its media-related curriculum to best reflect the ideals of the school’s namesake, the late journalist Gwen Ifill. Simmons University announced it would relaunch the media school as the Gwen Ifill School of Media, Humanities and Social Sciences. A search committee also named media scholar Ammina Kothari as the new dean. The Ifill School’s new structure expands its media curriculum to include humanities and social sciences. The attributes that defined Ifill also shape a new, holistic approach, 'An unwavering commitment to accuracy and objectivity, a nuanced understanding of social and historical context and a compassion-based appreciation of policymaking’s real-world implications,' according to a Simmons press release. 'Folks here are very proud of Gwen’s legacy and want to honor it in many different ways,' said Bert Ifill, Gwen’s brother and a longtime university administrator. A crucial component of the Ifill School is its emphasis on communications, a field Gwen excelled in, Bert told VOA. After graduating from Simmons in 1977, she had long careers in both print and television journalism, working for The Baltimore Evening Sun, The Washington Post, The New York Times, NBC and PBS. She covered seven presidential campaigns and died in 2016 at age 61. Ifill was the first African American woman to moderate a vice presidential debate and to coanchor a national newscast, 'PBS NewsHour.' 'Gwen valued storytelling, and she was an amazing journalist,' Kothari, the school’s new dean, told VOA. 'But she also worked really hard to raise awareness about important social issues and to highlight underrepresented voices.' Abigail Meyers, a current junior at the Ifill School, admires the journalist’s 'groundbreaking work' in both journalism and racial justice, she told VOA. Raised near Baltimore, Maryland, Meyers feels a special connection to Ifill’s work for the Baltimore Evening Sun newspaper. The school has been instrumental in supporting Meyers’ aspirations to become a professional journalist, she told VOA. 'The support that you get from the faculty and alumni is unlike really any other journalism program,' she said. Being a double major in communications and political science, Meyers appreciates the new curriculum’s flexibility, as she is able to take classes across different disciplines. This flexibility will help prime Simmons’ students to achieve success, Kothari said. She believes interdisciplinary training leads to stronger leaders in the world. 'As we think about communications or media, including journalism or social sciences, we need a strong foundation in humanities to understand the historical context for what we see happening today,' Kothari said. The school’s increased focus on humanities 'couldn’t be more timely,' according to the press release. Nearly three of four Americans believe media literacy is an important skill in today’s news landscape, a 2023 Boston University survey found. However, humanities-focused degree programs like the Ifill School’s receive little recognition. Of all the bachelor’s degrees awarded in 2020, humanities degrees made up less than 10%, a number that has only been decreasing, according to a 2022 MIT study. Meanwhile, science, technology, engineering and math degrees, or STEM, have grown exponentially. But humanities and STEM shouldn’t be seen as opposites, Kothari said. She cited the COVID-19 pandemic response as an example. Many precautionary measures such as social distancing were grounded in 'amazing scientific research,' but weren’t effectively communicated to the public, she said. 'As we have new knowledge being produced, we also need journalists,' Kothari said. 'We need communicators who are able to translate very complex information to the audience so they can see, ‘How does it matter to me? What is the effect for me?’' Ifill’s legacy is not only celebrated within her namesake school, but also through press freedom organizations around the world. The Committee to Protect Journalists, a press freedom nonprofit, honors Ifill with the annual Gwen Ifill Press Freedom Award, which is presented to individuals who have 'shown extraordinary and sustained achievement in the cause of press freedom,' according to CPJ’s website. Christophe Deloire, the late director of international media freedom organization Reporters Without Borders, or RSF, received the 2024 Gwen Ifill Press Freedom Award. 'Christophe was one of journalism's greatest-ever champions,' RSF Executive Director Clayton Weimers told VOA in an email. 'There was hardly a fight or an advance in press freedom in the past decade that he wasn't a part of, if not leading.' As Ifill’s legacy spreads, there is one person who couldn’t be prouder: her brother, Bert. He told VOA it often seems as though his full-time job is 'to talk nicely about Gwen.' 'It's always a great pleasure and honor for me to talk about her and to talk about her legacy, not only as obviously a very skilled journalist, but as an extraordinary mentor and confidant,' he said.	https://www.voanews.com/a/boston-university-relaunches-journalism-curriculum-to-encompass-humanities/7808224.html	2024-10-03T11:22:10-07:00

Ethiopian military boosts operations in Amhara region	ADDIS ABABA, Ethiopia — Ethiopia’s army said it has launched a major operation against Fano rebel groups in the Amhara region, as the conflict continues, despite calls by rights groups and international partners for a peaceful resolution. Army spokesperson Colonel Getnet Adane said Tuesday that the Ethiopian National Defense Force, or the ENDF, in coordination with the region’s security forces, have started a military operation. He claimed continued calls for peace have 'fallen on deaf ears.' 'The only language they [armed rebel groups] understand is force. From now on we will talk to them in that language,' said Getnet. 'For peace to prevail they need to be met with force. They have to be targeted, hit.' He indicated the operation started this past weekend. Federal and regional officials said measures are also being taken against suspected supporters of the rebel group, including members of the business community. The announcement of the operation came on the day human rights group Amnesty International accused Ethiopia’s army of conducting 'mass arbitrary detentions' in the Amhara region. Amnesty’s regional director for East and Southern Africa, Tigere Chagutah, alleged that hundreds have been detained, including members of the academic community, in major towns across the Amhara region since Sept. 28. 'The Ethiopian army and police’s ongoing campaign of arbitrary mass detentions in Amhara region is yet more evidence of the government’s total disregard for the rule of law,' the director said in a statement. 'Eyewitnesses have stated that authorities came with a ‘list’ and failed to obtain arrest and search warrants before detaining hundreds of civilians across the region. Those detained have largely not been brought before a court of law within 48 hours, as required by the country’s national laws and constitution.' Amnesty urged authorities to 'immediately end these arbitrary arrests, press charges against those detained for internationally recognized crimes and follow due process, or release them without further delay.' It is time for authorities to stop using arbitrary detention as a tool of repression, the statement said. Fighting in the Amhara region began more than a year ago with a dispute over the disarming of regional paramilitary forces. Fresh fighting was reported as recently as last week. VOA’s Horn of Africa service attempted to reach an Amhara region spokesperson, the federal government of Ethiopian communication affairs minister and ENDF spokesperson and Fano rebels. None of them could be reached for comment on Amnesty International’s statement. Abductions Meanwhile, police in Ethiopia have reported that abductions are on the rise in two conflict regions where armed groups are fighting government forces. A spokesperson for the Amhara regional police, Mesafint Eshete, said the commission recorded 287 abduction cases in the Ethiopian fiscal year 2016, which ended three weeks ago. The Ethiopian calendar runs several years behind the calendar in most other countries. Speaking to the Horn of Africa service, Mesafint hinted the figure could be higher as most victims don’t report incidents to the police. In a report issued last week, the state-appointed Ethiopian Human Rights Commission, or EHRC, linked the kidnapping cases to the political and security crisis in the country. The report said that kidnappings have become a recurrent fixture, especially in the Oromia and Amhara areas. The EHRC also said that kidnapping cases in those areas involve diverse actors with different goals and modus operandi. While financial gain drives most of them, others seek to further a political agenda, the report added. According to the EHRC report, armed groups operating in the regions, criminal gangs and some members of the security forces are implicated in the kidnapping cases. The World Food Program said last week that the conflict in the Amhara region has become the biggest challenge for humanitarian operations. 'Growing insecurity, particularly in the Amhara region, is hindering our deliveries. Our operations face severe security risks,' the WFP Ethiopia representative and country director, Zlatan Milisic, told reporters in Addis Ababa. He said that this year, eight humanitarian workers have lost their lives and more than 20 people have been abducted. Six of the killings took place in the Amhara region, while one happened in Tigray and the other occurred in the Gambela area. Despite the security challenges, Milisic said WFP didn’t stop operating in the region, and has reached 90% of its intended aid beneficiaries in Ethiopia this year. 'We want to be there, and we plan to continue supporting the needy,' Milisic said. Speaking on funding gaps, Milisic indicated that over the past three months, 4.6 million people needed aid, but only 1.3 million received humanitarian support. He appealed for $341 million for WFP humanitarian operations through February 2025. This story originated in VOA’s Horn of Africa Service.	https://www.voanews.com/a/ethiopian-military-boosts-operations-in-amhara-region/7809375.html	2024-10-03T11:03:21-07:00	
Beijing tests regional resolve in South China Sea amid Middle East conflict	Taipei, Taiwan — As the United States and other like-minded countries hold joint military exercises in the South China Sea, Chinese vessels have been aggressively asserting Beijing’s territorial claims in the hotly contested waterway, testing the resolve of the Philippines, Malaysia and Vietnam. Last week on September 26, China used two missile boats and a high-intensity laser to disrupt an attempt by the Philippines to deliver supplies to local fishermen posted near the Half Moon Shoal, an atoll that lies within Manila’s Exclusive Economic Zone, or EEZ. On Sunday, Chinese law enforcement reportedly attacked Vietnamese fishermen with iron pipes, confiscating fishing equipment near the Paracel Islands. And a new report by the Washington-based Asia Maritime Transparency Initiative released Tuesday highlighted how the Chinese coast guard vessels have been operating 'like clockwork' this year in waters claimed by Malaysia as the resource-rich country tries to expand oil and gas exploration in the South China Sea. On Thursday, The Washington Post also reported that Chinese vessels have been disrupting the repair and construction of subsea cables running under the South China Sea. China emboldened Analysts say these actions suggest Beijing is attempting to test regional countries’ resolves to safeguard their territorial claims at a time when the United States is fixated on the conflict in the Middle East. 'The serious crisis in the Middle East has emboldened China and allowed them to test the Americans further in the Indo-Pacific region,' said Collin Koh, a maritime security expert at the Singapore-based S. Rajaratnam School of International Studies. He added that Beijing is using physical actions and lawfare to try to change the situation in the South China Sea 'altogether.' The Philippines has characterized Beijing’s harassment of its vessels as 'irresponsible, dangerous, and provocative,' while Hanoi said the attack on the Vietnamese fishermen violated its sovereignty and international law. China’s Foreign Ministry did not respond to a request from VOA regarding the harassment of Philippine vessels. Commenting on the attack on the fishermen, Beijing claims Chinese law enforcement forces were stopping Vietnamese fishermen from illegally fishing near the Paracel Islands, which China calls Xisha. The islands are an equal distance from China and Vietnam, but Beijing has maintained de facto control of the islands since it seized them in 1974 after a clash with Vietnamese forces. In recent years, Beijing has reclaimed land and established military installations in the Paracel Islands, including an airstrip and artificial harbor. New front Koh told VOA that the incident near Half Moon Shoal, which comes after Chinese and Philippine coast guard vessels collided twice near the disputed Sabina Shoal since August, shows Beijing may be 'opening a new front' against Manila. 'The Philippines wants to apply the provisional agreement that they have reached with China over Second Thomas Shoal in July to the other contested reefs in the South China Sea, but I don’t think the Chinese are keen to expand the agreement throughout the region,' he said in a phone interview. While the United States and other countries, including Australia, Japan and New Zealand, have been conducting more joint patrols in the South China Sea to counter China’s aggression, experts say that appears to have done little to thwart Beijing's ability to challenge its neighbors in the region. 'There needs to be more concrete minilateral cooperation between regional countries like Vietnam and the Philippines, including joint military exercises, expansion of maritime domain awareness activities or search and rescue drills,' Stephen Nagy, a regional security expert at the International Christian University in Japan, told VOA by phone. In January, Vietnam and the Philippines signed an agreement aimed at boosting cooperation between their coast guard forces to prevent incidents in the South China Sea. Then in August, Manila and Hanoi held their first joint coast guard drill, focusing on firefighting, rescue and medical response in Manila Bay. In addition to bilateral cooperation between the Philippines and Vietnam, some regional observers say all Southeast Asian countries that have competing territorial claims with China in the South China Sea should explore the possibility of establishing a regional alliance. Such a mechanism 'could potentially evolve into a coast guard alliance specifically designed to address China’s actions in the region, and such a coalition would present a more formidable deterrent and could more effectively safeguard the interests of these nations in the South China Sea,' Duan Dang, a Vietnam-based maritime security analyst, told VOA in a written response. However, he said the Association of Southeast Asian Nations 'appears too weak and divided' on issues related to the South China Sea to present a united front. As the U.S. and Japan both gear up for major elections in the coming weeks, Nagy thinks China is also trying to use this 'window of opportunity' to try to 'lock in some strategic gains' in the South China Sea.	https://www.voanews.com/a/beijing-tests-regional-resolve-in-south-china-sea-amid-middle-east-conflict/7809345.html	2024-10-03T10:55:24-07:00

WHO launches plan to tackle growing threat of dengue, other diseases	GENEVA — The World Health Organization launched a global plan Thursday to address the growing threat of dengue and other deadly arboviruses, which have affected millions of people around the world and put billions more at risk. 'The rapid spread of dengue and other arboviral diseases in recent years is an alarming trend that demands a coordinated response across sectors and across borders,' said WHO Director-General Dr. Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus. An arbovirus is a virus that is transmitted to humans by mosquitoes, ticks, or other arthropods, such as crustaceans, insects and arachnids. Dengue has emerged as the most problematic arbovirus disease. The WHO notes the number of cases has nearly doubled each year since 2021, with over 12.3 million cases at the end of August of this year, including more than 6,000 deaths. The WHO aims to 'turn the tide' against dengue and arboviral diseases, Tedros said, noting that the measures in the proposal could 'protect vulnerable populations and pave the way for a healthier future.' The WHO chief said everyone has a role to play in the fight against dengue, 'from maintaining clean environments to supporting vector control and seeking and providing timely medical care.' 'Factors such as unplanned urbanization and poor water, sanitation and hygiene practices, climate change and international travel, are facilitating the rapid geographical spread of dengue,' Dr. Raman Velayudhan, WHO unit head, global program on control of neglected tropical diseases, told journalists in Geneva Tuesday, in advance of the plan’s launch. 'The disease is now endemic in more than 130 countries,' he said. 'Similar trends are also observed for other arboviral diseases, such as Zika, chikungunya, and more recently, the Oropouche virus disease, especially in the Americas.' Dengue is endemic in tropical and subtropical climates, particularly in Southeast Asia, the Western Pacific and the Americas. The WHO says the majority of dengue cases, as well as several other arboviruses, have been reported from the American region this year. WHO officials say the situation is also of concern in Africa, 'where countries are battling multiple diseases amid conflict and natural disasters,' placing additional strain on already fragile health systems. The Africa CDC reports more than 15,000 cases of dengue have been recorded in 13 African countries this year. 'This global escalation underscores the urgent need for a robust strategy to mitigate risks and safeguard populations taking into account that urban centers are at greater risk,' Velayudhan said. Dengue is a viral infection that spreads from mosquitoes to people. Most people who get dengue get better in one to two weeks. However, some people who develop severe cases can die. According to the WHO, prevention is the best protection from dengue. It recommends people avoid mosquito bites, especially during the day, 'by covering up.' Chikungunya, a virus spread by Aedes mosquitoes, has been reported in 118 countries, with the highest circulation found in Brazil. Dr. Diana Rojas Alvarez, team lead on arboviruses, epidemic and pandemic preparedness and prevention at the WHO, notes newborns, elderly and people with pre-existing conditions 'have been identified as a risk factor for poor disease outcome.' Besides chikungunya, she said Zika and Oropouche, which are spreading widely in the Americas, have symptoms similar to dengue and 'can be easily misdiagnosed in areas with co-circulation of multiple arboviruses.' To avoid misidentifying those diseases, she said it is critical for countries to strengthen their detection, surveillance, and testing activities and 'to make sure populations know which measures to take to protect themselves and their communities.' The World Health Organization says the global escalation of arboviral diseases underscores the urgent need for 'a robust strategy to mitigate risks and safeguard populations.' It urges governments to implement five components of its strategic global plan: Emergency coordination activities, collaborative detection and surveillance, community protection and prevention measures, safe and scalable care to prevent illness and death, and access to countermeasures, such as the promotion of research for improved treatments and vaccines. The WHO estimates $55 million will be required to put the plan into action over the next year.	https://www.voanews.com/a/who-launches-plan-to-tackle-growing-threat-of-dengue-other-diseases/7809252.html	2024-10-03T09:42:01-07:00	
Trump, Harris stances on China differ, but not completely	The United States’ policy on China has been mostly consistent from the administration of Donald Trump to the White House of Joe Biden — with both presidents viewing China as America’s biggest competitor. But in the race for the next president, Kamala Harris and Donald Trump have slightly different approaches toward the global superpower. VOA’s Elizabeth Lee explains.	https://www.voanews.com/a/trump-harris-stances-on-china-differ-but-not-completely/7809235.html	2024-10-03T09:29:46-07:00	
Taliban FM to be ‘chief guest’ in Russia-hosted Afghanistan talks	Islamabad, Pakistan — Russia is set to convene a meeting of regional countries on Friday to discuss, among other issues, the expansion of 'practical interaction' with Taliban-governed Afghanistan in political, economic, counterterrorism and counternarcotics areas. Taliban Foreign Minister Amir Khan Muttaqi will participate as the 'chief guest' in what will be the sixth round of the 'Moscow Format' of consultations on Afghanistan, reported Maria Zakharova, the Russian foreign ministry spokesperson, on the eve of the gathering. Russia launched the Moscow Format in 2017, and it has since become a regular platform for discussion of challenges facing impoverished, war-torn Afghanistan. Zakharova told reporters in the Russian capital on Wednesday that special representatives and senior officials from China, India, Iran, Kazakhstan, Kyrgyzstan, Pakistan, Tajikistan, Turkmenistan, and Uzbekistan will attend the gathering. She said Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov will preside over the closed-door meeting, and that 'the main focus of the discussions' would be advancing the Afghan national reconciliation process. Zakharova also said, without elaborating, that Lavrov plans to hold bilateral talks separately with Muttaqi and his team on key areas of collaboration between Moscow and Kabul. Muttaqi’s office in Kabul reported separately that he is scheduled to meet Lavrov on the sidelines of the Moscow Format gathering. Moscow has established close informal ties with the Taliban since the former insurgents regained control of Afghanistan three years ago, following the withdrawal of U.S.-led coalition troops after almost two decades of war. Russia, however, has not recognized the Taliban as a legitimate government, in line with international consensus on the issue. But the Russian foreign and justice ministries submitted a proposal to President Vladimir Putin in June to remove the Taliban from Russia’s list of designated terrorist organizations. Taliban officials confirmed last week that they had formally sought to join the coming Russia-led summit of the BRICS intergovernmental group of major emerging economies. There has been no public response from Moscow. The Taliban said that Afghanistan is a developing country and needs to attend forums like BRICS to help improve the national economy. The leaders of the 10-nation BRICS, whose original members were Brazil, Russia, India, China, and South Africa, are set to convene October 22-24 in the southwestern Russian city of Kazan. The U.S. remains opposed to any step toward easing sanctions or moving toward recognition of the Taliban as Afghanistan’s rightful government. 'We have been very clear that we judge the Taliban by what they do, not by what they say,' White House press secretary Karine Jean-Pierre said last week while responding to the de facto Afghan government’s bid to attend BRICS. She reiterated that the Taliban would need to improve its human rights record to win international legitimacy and be removed from sanctions lists so they can rejuvenate the Afghan economy. 'Afghanistan cannot strengthen its economy unless women are able to participate in all aspects of society without limitations,' stated Jean-Pierre. 'So, we will continue to engage with the Taliban on matters of our interest — for example, on respect for the rights of women and girls and the return of wrongfully detained U.S. citizens — and that's how we're going to move forward with them.'	https://www.voanews.com/a/taliban-fm-to-be-chief-guest-in-russia-hosted-afghanistan-talks/7809205.html	2024-10-03T09:00:15-07:00	
Pressure to hold elections motivating, Bangladesh student leader tells VOA	Dhaka — Along Dhaka’s chaotic roads, where cycle rickshaws and dilapidated double-deckers compete for space with honking cars and scurrying pedestrians, brightly painted graffiti tells the story of the protests that in just over five weeks ended the 15-year rule of Bangladesh’s Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina. The uprising, popularly known in Bangladesh as the 'July 36 Revolution,' began as a student-led protest against a job quota system on July 1. It ended on August 5 with Hasina fleeing to India on a helicopter, as millions of people angered by the regime's deadly crackdown on students descended on the capital calling for the prime minister's ouster. Nahid Islam, a 26-year-old student leader who announced the mass movement's demand for Hasina's resignation on August 3, is one of two student leaders who are part of a 19-member 'advisory council' – in effect, an interim government – headed by Nobel laureate Muhammad Yunus. 'My lifestyle has changed drastically,' 26-year-old Islam told VOA in his office Sunday about the dramatic shift from student politics to running two ministries. The young activist is heading the Ministry of Posts, Telecommunications and Information Technology as well as the Ministry of Information and Broadcasting. 'In the case of government, it’s an official set up, and again we are re-learning how to work for the people,' said the casually dressed Islam. 'So, we have organizational capacity and that is being put to work right now but the government has different rules, there is a bureaucratic setup. We have started working in the system and are trying to adjust.' He was also trying to change the system, Islam said. His 100-day plan includes breaking down silos to increase communication with lower-level officials, investigating corruption in government projects, expanding internet access, and getting rid of draconian cybersecurity and media laws. 'If we cannot realize those wishes, we will not be fulfilling people’s demands,' Islam said, adding that without necessary reforms, the next elected government will not be able to function well. However, the advisory council is under pressure from political parties to return the nation of 170 million people to democracy. After years of facing crackdowns, major parties like Bangladesh Nationalist Party and Jamat-e-Islami have resumed political activities. Party leaders have expressed support for the advisory council but are also pushing for elections. 'This pressure should be on us,' said Islam. 'If we face the pressure, we will also actively work to pave the way for elections,' Islam told VOA. Islam said the entire reform program of the interim government which includes electoral, judicial, and police reforms could take more than a year to implement. He said the bureaucracy needs to be cleansed of norms installed by Hasina's Awami League party that allowed corruption and politicization of government institutions. Bangladesh's military chief Wakar-Uz-Zaman told Reuters last month the country could head to polls within 18 months. Speaking to VOA Bangla earlier this week, Yunus refused to say when his interim government of academics, technocrats, student leaders, and rights defenders will hand over charge to a democratically elected government. Despite enjoying mass support, Islam said student leaders of the mass movement are currently not focusing on turning the alliance into a political party for the next elections. 'The people have a desire to see the students in political leadership but actually we are not paying attention to this issue right now,' the young leader said. 'After the goals of the uprising are achieved or the nation has been reconstructed, the students will decide how they want to proceed.' Several hundred people died between July and early August as the outgoing regime used deadly force against protesters across Bangladesh. Dozens of policemen were killed in revenge attacks. Anger at Hasina's Awami League is still high as hospitals across the country continue to treat injured protesters, most suffering from bullet and pellet gun wounds. While anti-Awami League students now have access to power, many student leaders of Awami League's student wing, known as the Bangladesh Chhatra League, now face the risk of attacks. Last month a mob beat a former organizing secretary of the Chhatra League for allegedly supporting violence against the protesters in July. The student leader died hours later. Another student leader told VOA he is afraid to go to his hostel on the Dhaka University campus. Islam said the Awami League may still have a role in Bangladesh's democracy but not without accountability. 'We have not banned Awami League so far. But since the party and its beneficiary class are involved in mass killings, they should face the law. Those who are found to be guilty will face punishment according to the law and those who are found to be innocent, they will continue to enjoy their democratic rights.' In a show of anger, student groups marked Hasina's birthday on September 28 by throwing shoes at her images. In Dhaka, a giant mural of the former leader next to an equally huge painting of her father, Shaikh Mujib, the founder of Bangladesh, has a garland of shoes hanging over it. Hasina is facing more than 200 cases. The list of cases against her party leaders, many of whom have fled, continues to grow. Islam, who was abducted and tortured in July – allegedly by intelligence agencies notorious for extrajudicial actions, believes justice will heal the nation. 'Everything will be decided by the courts,' said Islam, 'Through such a process society will achieve reconciliation.' Across Bangladesh's capital, messages of defiance, hope, and people power painted on walls celebrate hard-won political freedom. They are also a reminder of the burden of expectations that Islam and his fellow interim leaders carry.	https://www.voanews.com/a/pressure-to-hold-elections-motivating-bangladesh-student-leader-tells-voa/7809199.html	2024-10-03T08:52:46-07:00

Denmark jails 2 Swedish teens over blasts near Israeli Embassy	COPENHAGEN, Denmark — Two Swedish teenagers were jailed Thursday in pretrial detention in connection with two predawn explosions in the vicinity of the Israeli Embassy in Copenhagen a day earlier. Prosecutors said investigators were establishing 'whether the motive could be a terror attack.' No one was injured in the blasts on early Wednesday in a neighborhood with several foreign diplomatic missions, although the nearby Jewish school was closed following the explosions. The pair, who cannot be identified under a court order, were ordered held for 27 days. They faced preliminary charges of possessing illegal weapons and carrying five hand grenades. Two of the grenades blew up when the suspects threw them at a house near the embassy, prosecutor Soren Harbo said. 'This was pretty close to the Israeli Embassy,' Harbo said before Thursday's court hearing. The explosions caused damage to a roof terrace of a nearby house. The diplomatic mission was not harmed. Thursday's hearing was held behind closed doors after the preliminary charges were read. Reporting from inside the court room, Danish broadcaster DR said the teenagers, ages 16 and 19, are suspected of acting 'in association and together with prior agreement with one or more perpetrators.' Both denied the charges, local media reported. The two suspects were arrested Wednesday shortly before noon on a train at Copenhagen's central station. Danish media ran photos of a man in a white hazmat suit being taken away by police on a train platform at the station. A third suspect, age 19, who had been arrested near the embassy, has been released, police said Thursday. In Denmark, the charges are one step short of formal charges and allow authorities to keep criminal suspects in custody during an investigation. Separately, shots were fired late Tuesday at the Israeli Embassy in Stockholm. No one was injured. No arrests have been made. The Danish domestic security service, known by its acronym PET, said that 'Swedish authorities have assessed that at least one specific act directed at the Israeli Embassy in Stockholm, which was carried out by young criminals in Sweden, has links to Iran.' In May the Swedish domestic security agency SAPO accused Iran of using established criminal networks in Sweden as a proxy to target Israeli or Jewish people. The announcement came after the Israeli Embassy in Stockholm was sealed off in late January after what was then described as 'a dangerous object' was found on the grounds of the diplomatic mission. Swedish media said the object was a hand grenade. In a statement, PET said, 'If we have a state actor who gets young criminals to carry out actions aimed at Jewish targets in our neighboring country, then we can be concerned that this will also happen in Denmark.' In Stockholm, the operative of Sweden's domestic security agency SAPO, Fredrik Hallstrom, said, 'The latest incident at the Israeli Embassy is not classified as a terrorist crime at the moment.' His counterpart at the Swedish police's National Operations Department, Johan Olsson, told the same press conference that the charges were of 'aggravated weapons offenses, causing danger or other serious illegal threats and damage.'	https://www.voanews.com/a/denmark-jails-2-swedish-teens-over-blasts-near-israeli-embassy/7809092.html	2024-10-03T07:48:40-07:00	
Georgian parliament speaker signs anti-LGBTQ+ law after president refuses to	Tbilisi, Georgia — The speaker of the Georgian parliament signed into a law Thursday a bill that severely curtails LGBTQ+ rights in the country and mirrors legislation adopted in neighboring Russia. Shalva Papuashvili, the parliament speaker, said on social media that the legislation does 'not reflect current, temporary, changing ideas and ideologies, but is based on common sense, historical experience and centuries-old Christian, Georgian and European values.' Georgian President Salome Zourabichvili had refused to sign the bill and returned it to parliament on Wednesday. It was introduced by the governing Georgian Dream party and approved by lawmakers last month. The bill includes bans on same-sex marriages, adoptions by same-sex couples and public endorsement and depictions of LGBTQ+ relations and people in the media. It also bans gender-affirming care and changing gender designations in official documents. 'This law protects the rights of all citizens, including freedom of expression, so that the rights of others are not violated, which is the essence and idea of true democracy,' Papuashvili wrote. Parliament gave the legislation its final approval as Georgia, a largely conservative country where the Orthodox Church wields significant influence, prepares to vote in a parliamentary election. The law has been widely seen as an effort by the governing party to shore up support among conservative groups. It was decried by human rights advocates and LGBTQ+ activists, who said it further marginalized an already vulnerable community. By signing the law, Georgian Dream 'have taken homophobia to a new level, and that is political and institutional homophobia,' said Ana Tavadze, an activist with Tbilisi Pride, an LGBTQ+ advocacy group. Georgian Dream's aim is to 'fabricate' problems ahead of the election to distract people from 'their failure' to solve issues involving unemployment, education and healthcare, Tavadze told The Associated Press. The law has drawn comparisons with Russia, where the Kremlin has been highlighting what it calls traditional family values. Russian authorities in the last decade have banned public endorsement of 'nontraditional sexual relations' and introduced laws against gender-affirming care, among other measures. Its Supreme Court effectively outlawed LGBTQ+ activism by labeling what the authorities called the LGBTQ+ 'movement' operating in Russia as an extremist organization and banning it. In Georgia, the LGBTQ+ community has struggled even before the legislation was introduced. Demonstrations and violent outbursts against LGBTQ+ people have been common, and last year hundreds of opponents of gay rights stormed an LGBTQ+ festival in the Georgian capital, Tbilisi, forcing the event's cancellation. This year, tens of thousands marched in Tbilisi to promote 'traditional family values.' A day after parliament gave its final approval to the anti-LGBTQ+ bill, transgender actor and model Kesaria Avramidze was stabbed to death in her apartment in Tbilisi. Rights advocates had worried that the bill would stoke more violence. Papuashvili, the parliament speaker, said that by not signing the bill, President Zourabichvili and the Georgian opposition 'did not have enough courage to openly express their opinion regarding this law.' Some analysts say parts of the Georgian opposition are walking a fine line ahead of the Oct. 26 election between condemning the move to curtail LGBTQ+ rights and not wanting to alienate some voters. Zourabichvili has long been at odds with the governing party and vetoed a 'foreign influence' law adopted by parliament earlier this year. She was overridden by parliament, where Georgian Dream dominates. The measure requires media and nongovernmental organizations to register as 'pursuing the interests of a foreign power' if they receive more than 20% of their funding from abroad. It ignited weeks of protests and was widely criticized as threatening democratic freedoms. Those opposing the law compared it to similar legislation in Russia which is routinely used to suppress dissent, and accused the governing party of acting in concert with Moscow, jeopardizing Georgia's chances of joining the European Union. The South Caucasus nation of 3.7 million formally applied to join the EU in 2022, after Russia's full-scale invasion of Ukraine, but the bloc halted its accession in response to the 'foreign influence' law and froze some of its financial support. The United States imposed sanctions on dozens of Georgian officials in response to the law. Georgian Dream was set up by Bidzina Ivanishvili, a shadowy billionaire who made his fortune in Russia and served briefly as Georgia's prime minister in 2012. It promised to restore civil rights and 'reset' relations with Moscow, which fought a brief war with Georgia in 2008 over the breakaway province of South Ossetia. Russia then recognized the independence of South Ossetia and another breakaway Georgian province, Abkhazia, and established military bases there. Many Georgians backed Ukraine as Kyiv battled Russia's invasion in 2022. But the Georgian government abstained from joining sanctions against Moscow, barred dozens of Kremlin critics from entering the country, and accused the West of trying to drag Georgia into open conflict with Russia. The opposition has accused the governing party of steering the country into Russia's orbit to the detriment of its European aspirations.	https://www.voanews.com/a/georgian-parliament-speaker-signs-anti-lgbtq-law-after-president-refuses-to/7808951.html	2024-10-03T07:16:29-07:00	
Russia to try American accused of being Ukrainian mercenary in secret	MOSCOW — The trial of a 72-year-old American man whom Russia accuses of working as a mercenary for Ukraine will take place behind closed doors, and the verdict will be announced Monday, Russian state media reported. Stephen Hubbard is accused of signing a $1,000-per-month contract with a Ukrainian territorial defense unit in the city of Izyum in February 2022. He was captured by Russian forces in April that year, and he faces a sentence of seven to 15 years if convicted. The RIA news agency said the judge on Thursday accepted a prosecutor's request to hold the proceedings in secret to ensure the safety of the participants. It was not clear why the prosecutor believed an open trial would have placed them at risk. RIA said Hubbard himself supported the move, saying he did not want outsiders to be present. RIA reported earlier that he had pleaded guilty to the charges. Another state agency, TASS, said the verdict would come on October 7. A U.S. embassy spokesperson said: 'We are aware of reports of the arrest of an American citizen. Due to privacy restrictions, we are unable to comment any further.' Prosecutors have said Hubbard was provided with training, weapons and ammunition when he allegedly signed up. Hubbard's sister Patricia Fox and another relative have cast doubt on his reported confession, saying he held pro-Russian views and was unlikely to have taken up arms at his age. 'He never had a gun, owned a gun, done any of that. ... He's more of a pacifist,' Fox told Reuters last month. Hubbard is one of at least 10 U.S. nationals behind bars in Russia.	https://www.voanews.com/a/russia-to-try-american-accused-of-being-ukrainian-mercenary-in-secret/7809004.html	2024-10-03T07:11:41-07:00

Kazakhstan seeks clarity from Russia over grain transit halt	ASTANA, Kazakhstan — Kazakhstan has halted grain exports to Russia, Kazakh officials said on Thursday, adding it has asked Moscow to prove claims it has breached rules on plant health, the reason cited by Moscow for an effective ban of imports and transit of Kazakh grain. Both Russia and Kazakhstan are net grain exporters, but Kazakhstan relies on transit through Russian territory to sell its grain in Europe and the Mediterranean. The two countries also tranship each others' oil to foreign markets. The Russian state agricultural watchdog said this week that from Sept. 23, its systems would automatically block the issuance of phytosanitary certificates for grain, grain products, sunflower seeds, tomatoes, and peppers from Kazakhstan. In the absence of such certificates, the goods cannot legally cross the border, and the Kazakh state railway company confirmed on Thursday that grain shipments to Russia have been halted. Kazakh deputy agriculture minister Yermek Kenzhekhanuly said the Astana government has requested more detailed information on the alleged violations, had not heard back from Moscow and therefore could not comment further on what some industry players have described as a potential trade war.	https://www.voanews.com/a/kazakhstan-seeks-clarity-from-russia-over-grain-transit-halt/7808775.html	2024-10-03T02:35:45-07:00	
Vietnam protests Chinese attack on fishing vessels in South China Sea	WASHINGTON — Vietnam Wednesday protested China's reported behavior toward fishermen near the disputed Paracel Islands in the South China Sea after Vietnamese state media said Chinese personnel boarded a Vietnamese fishing boat and beat crew members. The Vietnamese reporting said Chinese government personnel Sunday attacked the boat, leaving 10 fishermen with injuries, some serious. Vietnam’s state-run Tien Phong newspaper reported Tuesday that the fishermen said around 40 people from the foreign vessels beat them with iron pipes and took away their fishing equipment. Four Vietnamese fishermen from the central Vietnamese city of Quang Ngai were hospitalized with serious injuries, VietnamNet reported Tuesday. The newspaper cited Nguyen Thanh Bien, the vessel's captain, describing the two vessels as having the numbers '101' and '301.' 'On the morning of September 29, while operating in the waters, they spotted a foreign ship identified as number 301 pursuing them. Sensing danger, Bien ordered the crew to head back to Sa Ky port [on the seashore of Quang Ngai]. However, an additional foreign vessel with number 101 joined the pursuit, deploying three smaller boats to encircle them,' VietnamNet reported. 'They were beating us mercilessly. I raised my hands to defend myself, knowing we couldn’t fight back. After their attack, they forced us to the front of the ship and covered us with a tarp,' said Nguyen Thuong, 34, one the hospitalized fishermen, who suffered injuries to his left arm, according to VietnamNet. Vietnamese Foreign Affairs Ministry spokeswoman Pham Thu Hang said in her statement that Chinese law enforcement forces 'suppressed, injured, and confiscated property' of Vietnamese fishermen aboard the QNg 95739 TS fishing vessel of Quang Ngai province. 'Việt Nam is extremely concerned about, discontented with, and resolutely opposes the Chinese law enforcement force’s brutal behaviors towards the Vietnamese fishermen,' Hang said. 'The Vietnamese Ministry of Foreign Affairs has sternly communicated with the Chinese Embassy in Hanoi, strongly opposed the abovementioned acts by the Chinese law enforcement force and demanded China to fully respect Vietnam’s sovereignty over the Hoàng Sa archipelago, quickly investigate and announce results to the Vietnamese side, and not repeat similar acts,' Hang added, using the Vietnamese name for the Paracel Islands. Two Chinese government vessels, the Sansha Zhifa 101 and Sansha Zhifa 301, have been identified as the ships that allegedly attacked a Vietnamese fishing crew on September 29, according to the geoint.asia and South China Sea expert Duan Dang. 'Two Chinese coast guard ships, Sansha Zhifa 101 and Sansha Zhifa 301, unprovokedly attacked Vietnamese fishermen and ships,' Hoang Viet, a lecturer with the University of Law of Ho Chi Minh City, told VOA by phone Wednesday. 'This clearly shows China's plot to monopolize the East Sea,' Hoang Viet said, using the Vietnamese name of the South China Sea. China's Foreign Affairs Ministry said Tuesday that Vietnamese fishing boats were fishing without Beijing’s permission, so Chinese authorities took measures to stop them, according to Reuters. 'The on-site operations were professional and restrained, and no injuries were found,' the ministry said, in response to a Reuters request for comment, without specifically referring to the attack. 'China’s assertion of its maritime claims are growing increasingly violent. Its law enforcement ships have been effectively turned into a paramilitary force, with authorization to use all available means to coerce its neighbors into submission,' Raymond Powell, founder and director of SeaLight, a project that monitors activities in the South China Sea, told VOA by text message Wednesday. 'It seems only a matter of time before someone is killed during one of these encounters,' Powell wrote. 'Vietnam government responded rather fast to the incident,' Hoang Viet, the law lecturer, said by phone. 'Vietnam always prioritizes its relationship with China, and it also puts its territorial sovereignty at a more important level.' 'China has never stopped its ambition to occupy the East Sea. Vietnam, as well as other Southeast Asian countries, are always in China's sights. When will it act? It's just a matter of time,' Hoang Viet said. Some information in this report came from Reuters.	https://www.voanews.com/a/vietnam-protests-chinese-attack-on-fishing-vessels-in-south-china-sea/7808763.html	2024-10-03T02:00:02-07:00	
VOA Interview: Muhammad Yunus on restoring order in Bangladesh	New York — After a series of student-led protests resulted in hundreds of civilian casualties, former Bangladeshi Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina stepped down and fled the country on August 5. Days later, Muhammad Yunus, the Nobel laureate who pioneered the global microcredit movement, was sworn in as the nation’s interim leader. He spoke with Voice of America Bangla Service reporter Anis Ahmed on Friday in New York, where he explained his decision to grant temporary magistracy powers to the army to restore law and order after the police lost public trust. He also stressed the critical role of youth leadership in shaping the country's future. Yunus, who took office amid widespread unrest, highlighted key priorities such as strengthening relations with neighboring countries, holding elections, reforming the constitution and addressing the Rohingya refugee crisis. He confirmed that reforms and elections remained essential before power could be handed over to elected representatives. The following transcript has been edited for length and clarity: VOA: First, we would like to know that after nearly one and a half months of assuming this responsibility on August 8, you have now delegated magistracy power to army officers. Why do you feel it was necessary? Muhammad Yunus, chief adviser of the interim government of Bangladesh: To bring law and order to the country. We were trying to work it out through the police, which is normal. But the police have lost their moral courage because when they face people, they hear bitter words. Just a few days ago they killed some students, so they are distancing themselves — they don’t want to be out front. So, as they lost morale, we lost the strength of law and order. But as we’ve said before, not everyone in the police is responsible for wrongdoing. We will identify those who have done wrong. They will be brought to justice. But this is a long process; it’s not happening all of a sudden. And in the meantime, law and order is being violated — different types of violations are happening. We thought that if we allowed this to continue, then conditions would deteriorate, so the issue of giving powers to our army came up. We asked the army, and they agreed. They said, 'We're here, but no one is heeding us because we do not have any power. If we had some power, the people would be cautious.' We then gave them the magistracy power but for a limited period, for two months. That’s how it happened. VOA: So, you’re hopeful that the police service will return in two months? Yunus: Yes, I hope so. They’re not able to use their power; the army has come in and that’s not very pleasing for them that their duties are being performed by someone else. VOA: We know students took the role of leadership amid the unrest, and that there are student representatives in your government as well. But is it also true that we are seeing students trying to establish their authority in different sectors and institutions of the country? Are these students running the country? What role are they playing? Yunus: Yes, they should. The youth should assume authority. So far, the old people have made mistakes, so let there be an effort for youth to come forward and take responsibility. They might also make mistakes and then correct those, but their leadership ushered in big changes. So, I don’t find any reasons to doubt their capacity for leadership. VOA: So, can we say that the students are running your administration? Yunus: No, I didn’t say they are running the administration, I said they should. Let the youth take it. I have always said, even before I took this responsibility, that it should be in the hands of the youth because they will build their future. If we try to write the future for them, that would not be right. So, I’ll say again that not only in Bangladesh but in the entire world, youth should be given this responsibility. VOA: We haven’t heard anything from you regarding the duration of this interim government, but General Waqar-Uz-Zaman recently said an election would occur within the next 18 months. Are we safe to assume the interim government would dissolve at that time? Yunus: Well, if you want to presume, you may, but that’s not the decision of the government. The government has not given any opinion so far. The government needs to say when they would take a decision about their duration. VOA: The Advisory Committee to the interim government has yet to make any decisions? Yunus: We have discussed but no decisions have been taken yet. VOA: What are the plans of your government to improve relations with India? Yunus: We are telling them clearly that we want good relations with them. Because that is needed for India and for us, too. We are neighbors. If relations between neighbors are bad, it’s not good for any nation. It’s not good for them, nor for us. It’s in the interest of our two countries that our relations should be close and cordial. VOA: Former Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina is in India. What steps are you taking to extradite her to Bangladesh? Yunus: This is a legal matter. Definitely we will want her back, wherever she might be, whenever we can legally implement the decision. VOA: After August 5, Bangabandhu Memorial Museum, once home to Hasina’s father but turned into a museum after his assasination there, Sheikh Mujibur Rahman, was destroyed. Your government subsequently canceled the national day of mourning. Obviously, some look on Rahman, in their words, as a fascist icon. But Rahman has long been recognized as the father of the nation. What’s the viewpoint of your interim government? Yunus: You’re talking about the past. Apparently, you don’t remember that a mass uprising has since taken place. You’re speaking as if it never happened. You need to see what’s happening in this new situation. You do not seem to have any questions about how many students have sacrificed their lives, why they sacrificed their lives. First, we must admit that they, the students, said that we have pushed a reset button. The past is gone for sure. Now we will build up in new way. People also want that. And this new way means we must bring reforms. VOA: We’ve paid respect to those killed during the student-led uprisings, and you have said that their killers will be brought to justice. But at the same time, after August 5, many others were killed. A short while ago we were talking about many police being killed. What steps are being taken by your government to bring the perpetrators to justice? Yunus: Whoever has committed a crime and wherever that might be, they will be brought to justice. If that’s not done, justice won’t be complete. To judge one type of crime and not another, that’s not acceptable. That would be a form of partisan justice. So, if we return to that kind of partisanship, the mass movement would have been meaningless. So, if crime is committed, the criminal will face the law. VOA: There are more than a million Rohingya currently displaced in Bangladesh. Will your government grant them refugee status? Yunus: International institutions have given them this status. The United Nations refugee agency [UNHCR] has been working there for a long time. So, they are refugees. They are not citizens of our country. VOA: But officially they are not recognized as refugees. Yunus: If they were not refugees, UNHCR couldn’t reach them. VOA: Thousands of Rohingya recently arrived in Bangladesh, and it is assumed that more are on the way. So, if more Rohingya enter Bangladesh, then what would be your decision? Yunus: According to international law, if they want to come, we will let them. We will accept them. And then we’ll do whatever is necessary. It’s not our problem alone. It is the responsibility of the entire world. When one’s life is at stake, one seeks refuge. We cannot close doors on them. You know, it’s been going on for ages. They have been here for the last seven years. Questions are being raised about their future and the future of their children. Nearly 32,000 Rohingya children are born here every year, so the Rohingya community is growing, even independently of new arrivals. When they came, they brought infant children with them. They, too, have grown up. What are you going to do about them? They can’t even see their future. Because of high-tech media they can see the entire world, but they’re confined like in a prison. They may grow angry; they may grow rebellious. This is not a good thing. We don’t know how it’s going to spread, where it will go. We really don’t know, so the whole world should focus on how to help them have a satisfying life. We are looking for a solution. VOA: There are discussions about constitutional amendments. You've even established a committee about it. Is it going to happen during your interim government’s time and what kind of changes or amendments are you expecting? Yunus: As I said before, we must begin everything anew. The previous government destroyed everything. So, from that destruction we need to rise afresh. That’s why we are establishing commissions for all fields. We have made six commissions; more commissions will come soon. Of those, one commission is on the constitution. The whole country wants the constitution to be amended. However, the topic may be subject to debate. That’s why the commission will create guidelines for those debates. That will give the country an opportunity to debate on it so that the political parties can give their opinion and can decide whether they are going to amend right now or later, and what exactly they would do. The constitution that we have now will not be helpful. If the country runs according to the present constitution, the same situation will happen again. VOA: Some people are talking about changing the constitution, others are talking about amending it. Whatever happens, how is it going to be implemented? Yunus: It is a matter of law. What we are now doing is not on the process of implementation, we are focusing on why we need it. When they sit for discussion, they will decide those matters from a legal perspective. We are trying to reach a unanimous opinion on what exactly we need. Then there will be another round of discussion on the legal process. VOA: What are your main objectives as interim leader? Yunus: My main objectives are to bring in reforms, to arrange an election and hand over the power to the elected representatives. VOA: The chief adviser of the interim government of Bangladesh, Dr. Muhammad Yunus, thank you so much on behalf of Voice of America. Yunus: Thanks to you, too.

EU to vote on tariff hike for Chinese EVs as Germany fears retaliation	Vienna — The European Union is set to vote Friday on a massive tariff increase on Chinese electric vehicles that Germany fears could spark a trade war with Beijing. Reuters reported Wednesday that the measure already has enough votes to pass, with support from France, Greece, Italy and Poland, whose populations make up 39% of the EU. At least 65% of the EU's population must vote against the tariff plan to stop it. Regardless, analysts say, continued negotiations will be needed on China's subsidies to its EV industry. On Wednesday, French President Emmanuel Macron in Berlin called Chinese subsidies 'unbearable.' German Chancellor Olaf Scholz on Wednesday said talks with China must continue, and he indicated Germany might abstain from the vote. 'More trade with more partners from more countries — that's what sensible risk management looks like in an uncertain world,' Scholz said, as reported by Reuters. 'That's why negotiations with China on electric vehicles must continue and why we must finally tackle the areas where cheap Chinese imports are harming our economy, for example steel,' he said. Bloomberg reported that Germany expected a significant number of EU states to abstain from voting on the tariffs. German automakers are against tariffs, fearing that retaliation from Beijing could impact access to China, their largest market. German Finance Minister Christian Lindner said Wednesday 'A trade war with China would do us more harm than good for a key European industry and a crucial sector in Germany.' If the vote passes, it could see tariffs on Chinese EVs as high as 45%. Beijing has hinted that it could retaliate with tariffs on German and Italian vehicles and on European agricultural products such as dairy, pork and French brandy. Chinese Commerce Minister Wang Wentao visited Europe in late September and met with officials and businesspeople in charge of foreign trade and commerce in the EU, Belgium, Germany, Italy and other auto-manufacturing countries to lobby the EU to abandon the tariffs. During the negotiations, the Chinese side proposed to set a minimum import price, but the European side refused. The vote was pushed from September 25 to Friday to allow time for more consultation between the two sides. Analysts believe the EU may make some compromises due to the complex interests within the EU. Ja Ian Chong, associate professor of political science at the National University of Singapore, told VOA, 'Because the EU is made up of many national entities with cross-cutting interests, these may lead to the vetoing of tougher action, much the same way ASEAN (the Association of Southeast Asian Nations) is ineffective in the face of PRC (People's Republic of China) pressure.' Spanish Prime Minister Pedro Sánchez said during a visit to Beijing in early September that he would urge the European Commission to reconsider raising tariffs on China's EVs. Francesco Sisci, an Italian Sinologist, told VOA that the centrifugal forces of member states and political parties within the EU are too strong to make difficult decisions. In the past, the EU 'was ruled by a solid majority centered around People's parties and Social-Democratic parties and a triangle made of Germany, France and Italy, Sisci said. 'Both these two architectures are now partially shattered.' 'The People's parties and Social-Democratic parties have still a majority but a thin one,' he said. 'Italy, with a right leaning government, didn't vote for the present President of the commission, Ursula von der Leyen, and it is dragging its feet on many EU policies.' 'Germany and France have governments at home that are under siege from new rightist parties,' he added. Sisci told VOA Mandarin that Germany's car industry 'is dependent on the sales in the Chinese market and yet risks being squeezed out of all markets because of the Chinese EV competition. There are no good or clear alternatives.' Although China's EVs have a price advantage in the European market, Chinese businesspeople working in the automotive industry there are more cautious. Yang is a Chinese businessman in Austria who does automobile maintenance, annual inspection and second-hand car trading. He did not give his full name because of privacy concerns. Yang said that because of Europe’s economic downturn, consumers there are careful with their money and will not easily replace their gasoline-powered vehicles with all-electric vehicles. 'Many European consumers choose hybrid electric vehicles,' Yang said, talking about his own business. 'This year's data report shows that the sales of all-electric vehicles have decreased by one-third, while hybrid electric vehicles have increased.' He said tariffs will certainly affect the price of Chinese electric vehicles in Europe, but European consumers are more concerned about other factors such as the life and endurance of the car. 'All-electric vehicles may not be a big market in Europe,' he said. The EU's vote comes after a probe into China's subsidies for the industry and 100% tariff hikes on Chinese EV imports to the U.S. and Canada.

In India, pride in Harris’s run for US presidency, but excitement missing	NEW DELHI — In the small South Indian village of Thulasendrapuram, where U.S. Vice President Kamala Harris’s maternal grandfather once lived, locals and priests have prayed to the local deity at a Hindu temple for her victory as she runs for the U.S. presidency. In the capital, New Delhi, many express pride that one of the candidates for the world’s most powerful office has Indian roots – she is the daughter of an Indian mother and Jamaican father. But Harris has failed to enthuse others who feel she never built on her Indian connection during her vice presidency. 'It’s quite exciting for someone like me who is a common girl around town,' said New Delhi resident, Simran Singh. Another city resident, Nandita Soni, and her husband watched Harris debate her opponent, former U.S. President Donald Trump, last month. 'I think she won hands down. Of course, there is a sense of pride for us. That she is, firstly, a woman and then of Indian heritage, feels really good,' Soni said. Harris is not the only Indian connection to the American presidential race. Usha Vance, the wife of Republican vice-presidential nominee J.D. Vance, is also the daughter of Indian immigrants. Not many in India have heard of Usha Vance. Those who have, see it as a tribute to a country where immigrants can make a mark. 'I think both of them having a role in the elections is a very good thing for our Indian heritage and diaspora, but I think it is much more important for the American system,' said Shyam Bajpai, a retired professional. He praises Harris for 'reviving the Democrat Party’s energy after a very difficult moment with Mr. Biden.' However, the euphoria witnessed in India four years ago when Harris became vice president is missing. She hosted a luncheon for Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi last year during his state visit to Washington, where she spoke of her deep personal connection to India. In interviews she has said that her introduction to the concepts of equality, freedom and democracy came from her Indian grandfather during her visits to her maternal family’s hometown, Chennai, when she was young. But some point out that she neither visited India during her tenure as vice president nor emphasized her Indian identity much while in office. 'To be honest we did not hear much of her in India, because as vice president, her connections with India were not all that great,' said Pradeep Bhargava, a New Delhi resident. 'We were not getting much news about her.' That may be why many young Indians ask: Who is Kamala Harris? 'I think she is not on social media,' said Simar Kaur, an undergraduate student in Delhi University. 'I get most of the news from social media only.' But IT professionals who have long eyed the United States for career opportunities are excited about the possibility of an American president with roots in India. 'I am sure this will help in more job opportunities for Indians in the future,' said software engineer Vishal Chabra. 'It will be good for India as well.' Those who are tracking the U.S. race see Harris’s bid as another huge milestone for its diaspora in Western countries -- Rishi Sunak, who became British Prime Minister in 2022 but lost in July, was also of Indian origin. They also point to the success of Indian Americans who have risen to the top of the corporate ladder in the U.S., heading companies like Google. 'With UK also and now America, Indians are all the way, and it is the way to go from them,' said Soni.	https://www.voanews.com/a/in-india-pride-in-harris-s-run-for-us-presidency-but-excitement-missing/7808740.html	2024-10-03T00:07:33-07:00

Singapore's disgraced former transport minister jailed for 12 months in landmark case	SINGAPORE — A Singapore court on Thursday sentenced a former minister to 12 months in prison for obstructing justice and receiving more than $300,000 worth of gifts, in the first jailing of an ex-cabinet member in a city-state famous for its clean governance. S. Iswaran, who was a cabinet member for 13 years and has held the trade, communications and transport portfolios, pleaded guilty last week to four counts of improperly receiving gifts and one of obstructing justice. The sentence handed down was more severe than the six to seven months sought by the prosecution, which presiding judge Vincent Hoong said was 'manifestly inadequate' given the gravity of Iswaran's offenses and their impact on public trust. 'Trust and confidence in public institutions were the bedrock of effective governance, which could all too easily be undermined by the appearance that an individual public servant had fallen below the standards of integrity and accountability,' he said in sentencing Iswaran. The case has shocked Singapore, which prides itself on having a well-paid and efficient bureaucracy as well as strong and squeaky clean governance. It was among the world's top five least corrupt countries last year, according to Transparency International's corruption perception index. The last corruption case involving a Singaporean minister was in 1986, when its national development minister was investigated for alleged bribery but died before any charges were filed in court. The investigation caused a stir in the Asian financial hub and centered on allegations Iswaran while transport minister accepted expensive gifts from businessmen that included tickets to English Premier League soccer matches, the Singapore Formula 1 Grand Prix, London musicals and a ride on a private jet. Iswaran, 62, faced a huge media scrum as he arrived in court and declined to answer questions. He showed no emotion during the court session. The judge allowed him to remain on bail for the next few days and begin his jail term on Monday. Iswaran had initially said he was innocent and would fight to clear his name but pleaded guilty last week to the five charges put before the court. The former minister faced a total of 35 charges, two of which were corruption-related but were later amended to charges of receiving gifts while a public servant. The attorney-general's chambers last week said they made amendments because of litigation risks involved in proving the corruption charges beyond a reasonable doubt. Iswaran was arrested in July last year and was accused of taking kickbacks from businessmen including property tycoon Ong Beng Seng. Iswaran was an adviser to the Singapore Grand Prix's steering committee, while Ong owns the rights to the race. Ong has not been charged with any offense and has issued no public comment on the allegations. The attorney-general's chambers last week said it would decide whether to take action against Ong soon. Judge Hoong in his ruling said there was a higher level of culpability when a public servant holds high office that wield greater influence over business transactions.	https://www.voanews.com/a/singapore-s-disgraced-former-transport-minister-jailed-for-12-months-in-landmark-case/7808732.html	2024-10-02T23:10:52-07:00

Supporters demand release of highly regarded Cambodian journalist	Bangkok — Cambodia this week has seen an outpouring of support from journalists, media groups and embassies for Mech Dara, one of the country’s last remaining independent journalists, who recently was taken into custody and charged with incitement. The U.S. Embassy in Cambodia posted on social media platform X that it was deeply troubled by Monday’s arrest and called for Dara’s release. 'He is a leading voice against human trafficking & online scams,' the embassy posted on X, noting that he was presented with an award by U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken last year for his work to combat human trafficking. Describing Dara as an advocate for the freedom of expression that is guaranteed in Cambodia’s constitution, the embassy added, 'We encourage authorities to engage [with] diverse voices & foster a free, independent press.' Cambodian-state media confirmed that Dara, 36, was charged with incitement related to social media posts he made at the end of September. He is now in pre-trial detention and could face up to two years in prison for his alleged offenses. Local media quoted a family member saying Dara’s car was stopped while he was traveling from Sihanoukville to Phnom Penh and that police arrived in a military vehicle and five other cars. The relative said police cited an arrest warrant, seized Dara’s phone and asked his family members to stay in their car. He has since been taken to a prison in Kandal Province, outside Phnom Penh, where he will remain until his trial. The Phnom Penh provincial court issued a statement saying Dara has been charged under two articles of Cambodia’s criminal code for incitement to provoke serious social disorder. It said Dara has admitted his guilt. His arrest came a day after authorities in Prey Veng accused Dara of posting 'fake news.' The journalist had posted a photo on Facebook showing destroyed concrete stairs leading to a pagoda that serves as a religious site and tourist destination in the province. Neil Loughlin, an assistant professor in comparative politics at City University of London who specializes in Southeast Asia, described Dara as one of Cambodia’s most respected journalists. 'His posts related to alleged damage to a temple site cut through, because there is a lot of this kind of thing in the country, where resource extraction and wealth concentration in the hands of the country’s elite is a central part of its elite political settlement,' Loughlin told VOA. But a spokesman for Cambodia’s Ministry of Information said in a statement that Dara was charged for incitement intended to cause serious unrest impacting social security. The statement said the actions Dara is charged with are not a 'journalism related affair.' It added that 'falsifying information and posting incident messages that distort the truth, slander, fabricate false information that is done with malicious intent to ignite anger among the public with confusions and misconceptions are not considered as freedom of expression.' Over the years, Dara’s investigative reporting has focused on human trafficking and its connection to illegal scam operations in Cambodia. Dara was once detained by police while reporting on the activities of a scam center in Sihanoukville. One of his best-known stories saw him link Cambodian tycoon and senator Ly Yong Phat to scam compounds. The U.S. imposed sanctions on the businessman in September. Cambodia is home to scam centers that have operated in several cities, towns and provinces throughout the country. These include 'pig butchering,' in which victims generally are contacted via the internet and enticed to gradually invest in fake and fraudulent schemes over a period of time. According to a report by the United States Institute of Peace, 100,000 scammers have been involved in pig butchering in Cambodia, generating income estimated at $12.8 billion in 2023. But Chou Bun Eng, the permanent vice chair of Cambodia’s National Committee for Counter Trafficking, told the pro-government newspaper Khmer Times in March that 80% of human trafficking cases they’ve investigated are 'false.' Journalists like Dara have long faced security risks when covering the illegal scam centers in Cambodia or reporting on other matters that show the government in a bad light. In 2020, journalist Sok Oudom was convicted and sentenced to 20 months in prison for broadcasting false news with the intent to cause incitement. In 2021, reporter Khou Piseth was charged with incitement for criticizing officials on Facebook over COVID-19 measures. The same year saw Youn Chhiv sentenced to one year in prison for incitement to cause a felony after he made a Facebook post criticizing a provincial court prosecutor. 'The vague charge of incitement has often been used by Cambodian authorities to target critics, including journalists,' Beh Lih Yi, Asia program coordinator at the Committee to Protect Journalists, told VOA via email. 'Arresting one of Cambodia's best-known journalists on vague charges like incitement is a clear attempt to muzzle any remaining independent reporting left in the country,' she wrote. Loughlin said incitement charges are typical of the government’s tactics against dissenting voices. 'The charge of incitement to social unrest is telling. Over the past decade, as part of the broader crackdown on dissent, the CPP government has promoted a narrative of stability to legitimate its use of coercion to silence those who criticise it or shine a light on corruption etc.,' he wrote to VOA. 'It uses this narrative to legitimize its repressive control over the country in perpetuity, with anybody who the government doesn’t like targeted for repression, justified in the name of that stability,' he added. Cambodia has been ruled by the same political party, the Cambodia People Party (CPP), since 1979 and has maintained its grip on power by banning opposition parties and cracking down on dissidents. The CPP shared power with co-prime ministers from 1993-97 with a royalist party. Hun Manet came into power in 2023, taking over as prime minister from his father Hun Sen, who led Cambodia for nearly 40 years. Reporters without Borders, a media watchdog that ranks 180 countries and territories worldwide for their level of press freedom, has ranked Cambodia at 151, a lowly position in its World Press Freedom Index for 2024. Cambodia's Ministry of Information says the country has taken a firm stand to promote the freedom of the press.	https://www.voanews.com/a/supporters-demand-release-of-highly-regarded-cambodian-journalist-/7808721.html	2024-10-02T22:15:29-07:00	
Biden, Harris tour hurricane-affected states	President Joe Biden and Vice President Kamala Harris on Wednesday visited areas hit hard by Hurricane Helene, where more than a million people remain without power and the death toll is climbing. Biden offered as many as 1,000 active-duty soldiers to support the response effort.

Israel’s threat to retaliate against Iran triggers panic buying at Iranian gas stations	WASHINGTON — Israel’s vow to make Iran pay a price for carrying out a large-scale missile strike on the Jewish state has prompted panic buying of gasoline in major Iranian cities and the temporary closure of Iranian airspace to all commercial flights. Iran fired about 200 ballistic missiles at Israel after nightfall on Tuesday, in a major escalation of a yearlong conflict between Israel and Iran’s regional proxy forces. The Israeli military intercepted most of the missiles with help from allied U.S. naval forces. Speaking late Tuesday, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said Iran’s Islamist rulers had made a 'big mistake' by attacking his nation. Other Israeli officials warned those rulers to expect a powerful and painful response. Israel’s threats sparked long lines of cars outside gas stations in major Iranian cities as drivers rushed to fill their vehicles’ tanks. One video posted to social media and vetted by VOA Persian showed dozens of cars waiting to fill up at a gas station in Tehran, apparently on Wednesday. Other social media clips reviewed by VOA Persian appeared to show similar long lines of vehicles outside gas stations late Tuesday in the Tehran provincial city of Eslamshahr and in the central city of Isfahan. VOA could not independently confirm the panic buying at the gas stations seen in the videos because it is barred from operating inside Iran. In another apparent reaction to Israel’s threat of a retaliatory strike, Iran shut its airspace to all domestic and international flights after completing its missile attack. The Iranian Civil Aviation Organization’s Aerospace Committee said in a Wednesday statement that flights would remain suspended until at least 5 a.m. local time on Thursday to 'maintain the safety of passengers.' Western media reported on Wednesday that Israel may target Iran’s oil and other energy facilities in its threatened retaliation. There was no confirmation from Israel. Any Israeli strike on Iranian oil or gas infrastructure would have a big economic impact on the country, according to Kpler’s Homayoun Falakshahi, a senior oil analyst for the Belgium-based global trade data firm. In a message to VOA, Falakshahi said Iran sources most of its gasoline from domestically produced oil that it refines into petroleum products. Iran’s Islamist rulers also rely heavily on revenue from energy exports to major customers such as China, a practice they have maintained for years in defiance of U.S. sanctions. Tehran has shipped an average of 1.54 million barrels of crude oil and gas condensate per day for the year to date, according to Falakshahi. Iran does not publish official data on its energy exports as part of its efforts to circumvent sanctions. Kpler uses a variety of sources to estimate those Iranian exports, such as location data from oil tankers' Automatic Identification System transponders, satellite imagery, and information provided by personnel at ports. The impact of an Israeli attack on Iran's energy exports would depend on whether Israel targets export infrastructure, Falakshahi said. 'For now, I don’t think such an attack will be the case, because China would get quite upset,' he added. This story was produced in collaboration with VOA’s Persian Service.	https://www.voanews.com/a/israel-s-threat-to-retaliate-against-iran-triggers-panic-buying-at-iranian-gas-stations/7808689.html	2024-10-02T20:35:04-07:00	
Conservative think tank pushes US to continue engagement in Pacific	washington — U.S. engagement with a string of Pacific Island nations must continue, regardless of which party wins the White House, the conservative think tank Heritage Foundation said in a newly published report. The islands, situated between Hawaii and Australia, are the latest front of competition between Washington and Beijing. In the 45-page report, Andrew Harding, a research assistant in the Heritage Foundation's Asian Studies Center, argues that it's time to make the case to taxpayers and Washington policymakers that investing in the Pacific Islands is money well-spent because it 'counters Chinese ambitions' and denies Beijing a foothold 'that can threaten U.S. national security interests and complicate possible future military operations in Asia.' That argument appears convincing to some China hawks in the Republican Party. Alexander Velez-Green, former national security adviser to Republican Senator Josh Hawley, called the report 'a compelling vision,' telling VOA in a statement, 'The Pacific Islands are key terrain in America's efforts to balance power against China.' Likewise, former Asia adviser in the Trump administration Alexander Gray said the Heritage report would benefit 'whoever is president in January 2025.' 'I expect a Trump 2.0 would only expand on this important work,' Gray wrote in response to VOA's emailed questions. The Heritage Foundation now employs many former Trump administration officials. Last year it released Project 2025, a controversial series of proposals to staff and shape policy for a second Trump White House. Former President Donald Trump has sought to distance himself from the effort, even as his opponent, Vice President Kamala Harris, claims it defines his policies. John Hennessey-Niland, who served as U.S. ambassador to Palau from 2020 to 2022, argues that Harding's message may convince policymakers in Washington but addresses only one of the region's problems. 'The Pacific Islands are concerned about PRC interference and coercion, but it is not the only threat they face. Other concerns include climate and their own capacity to provide for their people,' Hennessey-Niland told VOA via a statement, using the abbreviation for the People's Republic of China. Kathryn Paik agrees. She served as director for the Pacific and Southeast Asia at the National Security Council under President Joe Biden and now works as a senior fellow at the Center for Strategic and International Studies in Washington. 'Making U.S. Pacific engagement 'all about China' neglects precisely what can enable the U.S.-Pacific relationship to grow deeper than anything China could ever hope to have — our history, our culture and our shared values,' she told VOA in response to emailed questions. Harding said he is just saying the quiet part out loud. 'America's primary driver is U.S.-China competition and the threats that it poses to America's national interests and the security of its people,' he told VOA Tuesday in an interview. Chinese President Xi Jinping has traveled to the Pacific Islands to meet one on one with the leaders of Fiji and Papua New Guinea. He also has hosted numerous other Pacific Islands heads of state in Beijing. In contrast, the White House has only held joint meetings with Pacific Islands leaders, and Biden has not traveled to the nations. The Chinese Embassy in Washington did not respond to VOA's request for comment. While analysts differ over the report's rationale for deeper engagement in the Pacific, they say many of the 31 policy recommendations have bipartisan appeal, including appointing a special envoy for the Pacific Islands, creating more positions at key departments to oversee outreach and planning a presidential visit to a Pacific Islands state. Greg Brown, a senior analyst at the Australian Strategic Policy Institute, said the appointment of a special envoy is vital to sustained U.S. engagement. He said the real challenge is convincing the 535 members of the U.S. Congress to increase foreign assistance to the Pacific Islands when few American voters even know where they are, much less why they're important to U.S. national security. 'Anything requiring funding from Congress will be a chore — not because the demands are large or fiscal-burden heavy, but because members and staffs need constant reminders why securing U.S. interests in this region are imperative,' Brown told VOA in an interview. He added that the special envoy should be a 'heavyweight appointment ... with the ear of the president' and the 'diplomatic skill to navigate and drive changes' across Washington.	https://www.voanews.com/a/conservative-think-tank-pushes-us-to-continue-engagement-in-pacific-/7808642.html	2024-10-02T18:54:33-07:00	
Israel-Iran escalation heightens fears of widening war, direct US involvement	For months, U.S. President Joe Biden has warned Israel against allowing its war with Iran-backed Hamas in Gaza to spread against Hezbollah in Lebanon and Iran itself.

Chinese gangs revive scam hubs in Myanmar as Beijing eases pressure on junta	WASHINGTON — A recent report by the U.S. Institute of Peace highlights the resurgence of scam hubs, particularly in Myanmar's Karen State, due to China's softened stance toward the country's military regime. China's posture has shifted, said Jason Tower, co-author of the report and the country director for Burma at the institute. 'They're now much more focused on regime survival, looking at how they can prevent the [Myanmar] regime from toppling,' Tower told VOA Burmese. 'As a result, China has shown much less interest in taking forceful action to pressure the Myanmar military to address these problems.' According to the report, these criminal networks benefit from the complex dynamics between Myanmar's military and Chinese interests. China's focus has shifted from cracking down on scams to supporting the Myanmar military. This change in strategy has allowed the criminal organizations to flourish, using Myanmar as a base of operations. After contacting the Chinese Embassy in Washington about the issue, VOA received a statement that did not directly address cyber scam operations. Instead, it emphasized China's focus on peace and stability in Myanmar. 'China and Myanmar are close neighbors with a deep bond of friendship,' wrote embassy spokesperson Liu Pengyu. 'As a friendly neighbor, China has always paid close attention to the development and evolution of the situation in Myanmar and northern Myanmar. We do not hope to see conflict or chaos in Myanmar and sincerely hope for an early restoration of stability.' China's Ministry of Public Security portrayed the situation differently, according to a report published Monday by China's state-run Xinhua news agency. In a recent statement on its crackdown on cyber scams, the report said, the ministry highlighted joint efforts with Myanmar authorities, noting that 'a total of 870 suspects, including 313 Chinese and 557 Myanmar nationals, were arrested during a crackdown on telecom and online fraud in northern Myanmar.' Myanmar's state-controlled media Global New Light of Myanmar also focused on crackdowns, noting that Myanmar's police had worked closely with China in extraditing 20 Chinese nationals in September. Shift in China's priorities China's view on the conflict constantly evolves based on events inside Myanmar, said Thomas Kean, a senior consultant at the International Crisis Group, a nongovernmental think tank. 'Since 2021, we've seen different phases, but ultimately, China wants stability in Myanmar to pursue its strategic objectives, keep its borders safe, and ensure that Chinese nationals and the economy aren't affected,' Kean said. Tower described how China's priorities have shifted from addressing scams to focusing on maintaining its strategic interests in Myanmar. 'The Chinese government began prioritizing the advancement of the China-Myanmar Economic Corridor, which includes infrastructure and trade routes, giving China access to the Indian Ocean,' he said. Tower said some Chinese strategists had suggested that China had perhaps gone too far in its crackdown on the scam syndicates, losing sight of its broader strategic goals. As a result, Chinese authorities pushed hard to broker cease-fire agreements between Myanmar's military and ethnic armed groups to stabilize the region. 'Pig butchering' scams The Chinese scams emanating from Myanmar have grown in sophistication, the U.S. Institute of Peace report noted. The United States has become one of the primary targets, losing billions of dollars annually to 'pig butchering' scams. 'Pig butchering' is a type of investment fraud where scammers lure victims on social media only to defraud them for significant amounts of money, often in cryptocurrency. Many Americans have fallen victim to scams originating from Myanmar, said Erin West, a deputy district attorney with California's REACT Task Force to combat high-tech crime. 'They've liquidated retirement accounts, children's college funds, only to find out that the entire thing is fictitious, and they've lost everything,' West told VOA. Victims are lured into fraudulent online relationships, believing they are investing in cryptocurrency, she said. While some criminals are deported back to China, Tower said, broader networks remain primarily untouched and continue to operate with the protection of local warlords and military elites. He is concerned that these scams will increasingly become a threat to U.S. national security. 'These scams are currently causing estimated losses in the range of $5.5 billion per year for the U.S., but other estimates place the numbers as high as $15 billion,' Tower said. These actors are often under the protection of the Myanmar military or other corrupt regional elites, he added, making it difficult for law enforcement to intervene. 'This is a serious crisis,' Tower said. 'We're seeing a massive transfer of wealth from the United States to bad actors in Southeast Asia — actors that are undermining democracy, highly corrupt and often under the protection of the Myanmar military or other corrupt elites. This is bad news for the U.S. on many fronts.'	https://www.voanews.com/a/chinese-gangs-revive-scam-hubs-in-myanmar-as-beijing-eases-pressure-on-junta/7808652.html	2024-10-02T18:42:12-07:00

Cybersecurity head says there's no chance a foreign adversary can change US election results	WASHINGTON — Nearly a month out from Election Day, the head of the nation's cybersecurity agency is forcefully reassuring Americans who have been swept into the chaotic churn of election disinformation and distrust that they will be able to feel confident in the outcome. State and local election officials have made so much progress in securing voting, ballot-counting and other election infrastructure that the system is more robust than it has ever been, said Jen Easterly, director of the U.S. Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency. As a result, she said, there is no way Russia, Iran or any other foreign adversary will be able to alter the results. 'Malicious actors, even if they tried, could not have an impact at scale such that there would be a material effect on the outcome of the election,' Easterly told The Associated Press in an interview Wednesday. Easterly's trust in the election process comes as intelligence officials have warned of escalating efforts by foreign adversaries to influence voters, deepen partisan divides and undermine faith in U.S. elections. Her comments stand in contrast to the doubts millions of Americans, especially Republicans, have held since the 2020 election when former President Donald Trump refused to accept his loss. He has built on his false claims of vote rigging since then, setting the stage to claim the election has been stolen if he loses again this November. Easterly touched on a range of election-related concerns — including misinformation, her agency's role in interacting with social media companies and ongoing threats to election workers — during the 40-minute interview, which came as mail ballots are being sent out and some states have started early in-person voting. She also said her agency is in touch with election officials throughout the regions of the Southeast that have been ravaged by Hurricane Helene and praised those workers for 'displaying enormous and admirable resilience' as they try to ensure that voters are able to cast their ballots despite the devastation. Recognizing that many Americans' confidence in elections 'has been shaken,' Easterly emphasized how prepared election officials are for emergencies, simple mistakes and attacks — and how motivated they are to protect Americans' votes. Election officials have worked in recent years to boost cybersecurity defenses around the nation's voting systems, implementing procedures ranging from access controls to regular testing to identify potential vulnerabilities. Officials also test voting equipment before every election to ensure it works properly. Easterly pointed to layers of security and transparency — such as the paper record of votes in more than 97% of voting jurisdictions — as protections that will help verify the results. 'Things will go wrong. There could be another storm. There could be a ransomware attack, a distributed denial of service attack,' she said. 'These disruptions will create effects, but they will not impact the ability and the votes being cast or those votes being counted.' U.S. officials have spent recent months warning through criminal charges, sanctions and public advisories that foreign adversaries are ramping up their efforts to influence voters in the race for the White House. The Biden administration last month seized more than two dozen Kremlin-run fake websites and charged two Russian state media employees in a scheme to covertly fund right-wing influencers. Last week, three Iranian operatives were charged with hacking the campaign of Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump. Intelligence agencies and tech companies have tracked both Russian and Iranian actors using fake websites and social media profiles to spread misinformation, stoke division and potentially sway American voters. Iran and Russia have sought to influence past U.S. elections through online disinformation and hacking. Easterly noted that China also was 'very interested' in influencing the 2024 election. Beyond the influence campaigns, she said her agency had not detected any activity targeting election systems. 'We have not seen specific cyber activity designed to interfere with actual election infrastructure or processes,' Easterly said. The prevalence of election misinformation has become a widespread concern. One consequence is what Easterly described as a troubling uptick in physical threats against election officials of both parties and, in some cases, their families, often based on false claims about the 2020 election. She called it 'corrosive' to democracy and said it's something the public needs to collectively fight. 'Those election officials, they are not faceless bureaucrats,' Easterly said. 'They're folks we see in the community every single day. And they're not doing this for pay. They're not doing it for glory. They are doing it because they believe in the process of democracy.' Many secretaries of state and some larger local election offices have established specific efforts to combat the misinformation. U.S. Sen. Mark Warner of Virginia, a Democrat who leads the Senate Intelligence Committee, last week wrote a letter to Easterly that urged the agency to take further steps against election misinformation and disinformation, including coordinating with social media platforms to combat false claims. In the interview, Easterly acknowledged 'a very convoluted, very confusing information environment,' and said her agency works with election officials to promote accurate information. However, she also made it clear that her agency does not monitor social media sites or attempt to moderate their content. 'That is not our role,' she said. On the heels of Trump's running mate, Senator JD Vance, accusing the federal government of 'censorship' in Tuesday night's debate between the vice presidential candidates, Easterly strongly defended her agency, known as CISA. 'CISA does not censor, has never censored,' she said. 'And allegations against CISA are riddled with factual inaccuracies.' CISA, along with other federal agencies, was part of a lawsuit filed by Republican-led states claiming the federal government had applied 'unrelenting pressure' to coerce changes in online content on social media platforms. In a 6-3 vote, the U.S. Supreme Court said the states did not have a legal right to sue. Easterly encouraged voters who question how elections are run to contact their local election office and even volunteer to serve as poll workers so they understand the process and the safeguards already in place. She also warned that foreign adversaries almost certainly will seek to take advantage of the vote-counting process after Election Day as a way to undermine confidence in the results. She urged voters to be patient, emphasizing that it could take several days for a presidential winner to be determined. 'We need to come together as Americans to protect and preserve what is most precious,' she said. 'And that is the foundation of our democracy — fair, free, safe and secure elections.'	https://www.voanews.com/a/cybersecurity-head-says-there-s-no-chance-a-foreign-adversary-can-change-us-election-results/7808641.html	2024-10-02T18:16:12-07:00	
US bans new types of goods from China over allegations of forced labor	washington — The Department of Homeland Security announced Wednesday that it would ban the import of goods from a Chinese steel manufacturer and a Chinese maker of artificial sweetener, accusing both of being involved in the use of forced labor from China's far-west region of Xinjiang. The action broadens the scope of the U.S. effort to stop products from entering the country that the government says are tied to human rights abuses. The additions to the entity list under the Uyghur Forced Labor Prevention Act marked the first time a China-based steel company or aspartame sweetener business had been targeted by U.S. law enforcement, DHS said. 'Today's actions reaffirm our commitment to eliminating forced labor from U.S. supply chains and upholding our values of human rights for all,' said Robert Silvers, undersecretary of homeland security for policy. 'No sector is off-limits. We will continue to identify entities across industries and hold accountable those who seek to profit from exploitation and abuse.' The federal law that President Joe Biden signed at the end of 2021 followed allegations of human rights abuses by Beijing against members of the ethnic Uyghur group and other Muslim minorities in Xinjiang. The Chinese government has rejected the claims as lies and has defended its practice and policy in Xinjiang as fighting terror and ensuring stability. The new approach marked a shift in the U.S. trade relationship with China to increasingly take into account national security and human rights. Beijing has accused the U.S. of using human rights as a pretext to suppress China's economic growth. Enforcement of the law initially targeted solar products, tomatoes, cotton and apparel, but over the last several months, the U.S. government has identified new sectors for enforcement, including aluminum and seafood. 'That's just a reflection of the fact that, sadly, forced labor continues to taint all too many supply chains,' Silvers told a trade group in June when marking the two-year anniversary of the creation of the entity list. 'So our enforcement net has actually been quite wide from an industry-sector perspective.' He said the law 'changed the dynamic in terms of putting the onus on importers to know their own supply chains' and that its enforcement had shown that the U.S. could 'do the right thing' without halting normal trade. Since June 2022, the entity list has grown to 75 companies accused of using forced labor in Xinjiang or sourcing materials tied to that forced labor, Homeland Security said. Baowu Group Xinjiang Bayi Iron and Steel Co. Ltd. and Changzhou Guanghui Food Ingredients Co. Ltd. were the Chinese companies newly added to the list.	https://www.voanews.com/a/us-bans-new-types-of-goods-from-china-over-allegations-of-forced-labor-/7808643.html	2024-10-02T18:12:18-07:00	
Army returns remains of 9 Indigenous children who died at boarding school over a century ago	Carlisle, Pa. — The remains of nine more Native American children who died at a notorious government-run boarding school in Pennsylvania over a century ago were disinterred from a small Army cemetery and returned to families, authorities said Wednesday. The remains were buried on the grounds of the Carlisle Barracks, home of the U.S. Army War College. The children attended the former Carlisle Indian Industrial School, where thousands of Indigenous children were taken from their families and forced to assimilate to white society as a matter of U.S. policy. The Office of Army Cemeteries said it concluded the remains of nine children found in the graves were 'biologically consistent' with information contained in their student and burial records. The remains were transferred to the children's families. Most have already been reburied on Native lands, Army officials said Wednesday. Workers also disinterred a grave thought to have belonged to a Wichita tribe child named Alfred Charko, but the remains weren't consistent with those of a 15-year-old boy, the Army said. The remains were reburied in the same grave, and the grave was marked unknown. Army officials said they would try to locate Alfred's gravesite. 'The Army team extends our deepest condolences to the Wichita and Affiliated Tribe,' Karen Durham-Aguilera, executive director of the Office of Army Cemeteries, said in a statement. 'The Army is committed to seeking all resources that could lead us to more information on where Alfred may be located and to help us identify and return the unknown children in the Carlisle Barracks Post Cemetery.' The nine children whose remains were returned were identified Wednesday as Fanny Chargingshield, James Cornman and Samuel Flying Horse, from the Oglala Sioux Tribe; Almeda Heavy Hair, Bishop L. Shield and John Bull, from the Gros Ventre Tribe of the Fort Belknap Indian Community; Kati Rosskidwits, from the Wichita and Affiliated Tribes; Albert Mekko, from the Seminole Nation of Oklahoma; and William Norkok, from the Eastern Shoshone Tribe. The Army declined to release details on one grave disinterment, saying the tribe asked for privacy. More than 10,000 children from more than 140 tribes passed through the school between 1879 and 1918, including Olympian Jim Thorpe. Founded by an Army officer, the school cut their braids, dressed them in military-style uniforms, punished them for speaking their native languages and gave them European names. The children — often taken against the will of their parents — endured harsh conditions that sometimes led to death from tuberculosis and other diseases. The remains of some of those who died were returned to their tribes. The rest are buried in Carlisle.	https://www.voanews.com/a/army-returns-remains-of-9-indigenous-children-who-died-at-boarding-school-over-a-century-ago/7808636.html	2024-10-02T17:55:36-07:00	
Candidates clash over immigration, TPS at vice presidential debate	washington — It came as no surprise that one of the tensest moments in Tuesday night's vice presidential debate between Democratic Governor Tim Walz and Republican Senator JD Vance was over immigration, one of the most divisive issues in America. Debate moderators muted Vance's microphone after he claimed that 'millions of illegal immigrants' had overwhelmed American cities, including Springfield, Ohio, where many Haitians have been encouraged to find jobs. When Walz joined in, both candidates' microphones were muted, and the moderators reminded them the audience couldn't hear them. Hundreds of thousands of Haitian immigrants, including those who live in Springfield, hold Temporary Protected Status, known as TPS, or other forms of legal protection, such as humanitarian parole. 'These are people who have a lawful status. They have a lawful presence. They have work authorization,' Sarang Sekhavat, chief of staff at the Massachusetts Immigrant & Refugee Advocacy Coalition, told VOA. What is TPS? Congress established TPS in 1990 when it said migrants whose home countries were considered unsafe could live and work in the U.S. temporarily if they met certain requirements established by the U.S. government. The secretary of homeland security is responsible for designating a foreign country for Temporary Protected Status. Currently, 16 countries have TPS designations: Afghanistan, Cameroon, El Salvador, Haiti, Ethiopia, Honduras, Myanmar, Nepal, Nicaragua, Somalia, South Sudan, Sudan, Syria, Ukraine, Venezuela and Yemen. 'Usually what happens is the administration will designate a country for TPS because of some kind of catastrophe. It could be a natural disaster ... very often it's used in times of war,' Sekhavat said. 'Basically, the idea is recognizing that, 'OK, this individual here perhaps doesn't have permission to be here, but it would be inhumane of us to actually send them back home to their home country under the conditions their country is suffering right now.' ' TPS and legal immigration Tom Jawetz, a senior fellow at the Center for American Progress, told VOA that people covered by TPS should not be confused with undocumented immigrants. 'It's an immigration status that people can have the statutory right to travel on,' he said. 'In order to get TPS, people file an application. That application is reviewed individually. It's adjudicated. They get identification materials attesting to their TPS. Get work authorization by statute. So, these are not individuals who are undocumented by any means.' Haitian immigrants and TPS Haitian nationals were first given TPS in 2010 after a devastating earthquake struck Haiti, killing more than 100,000 people and overwhelming the government. This protection was renewed several times during the administration of former President Barack Obama and was extended for six months under former President Donald Trump. Trump decided to end TPS for Haitians in 2019, but this decision faced several legal challenges that lasted until the end of his administration. Who can apply for TPS? Protections under TPS are reserved for people who are already in the United States at the time of the designation. To be eligible, a person must be a national of a designated TPS country and have been continuously physically present in the United States since the date specified by the U.S. government. For Haitian immigrants, this date was August 4, 2024. People must apply during the registration period. For Haitians applying for the first time, this period began July 1, 2024, and runs through February 3, 2026. For those renewing their TPS status, the re-registration period began July 1, 2024, and ran through August 30, 2024. 'For example, when we had the earthquake in Haiti, there were many Haitians who came to the U.S. on valid transit or tourist visas, intending for their stay to be temporary. But due to the situation in Haiti, they couldn't return, making them eligible to apply for TPS,' Sekhavat said. Filing for TPS can cost about $545. TPS and US citizenship TPS alone does not lead to U.S. permanent residence or citizenship unless the applicant seeks to change status through other immigration processes. 'If you don't have some other means through which to get permanent residence — whether that's because you qualify for asylum or you have a family member or an employer who is petitioning for you to get a permanent residence — TPS is not going to get you there,' Jawetz said. But TPS allows a person to legally work, and it can open a pathway to an employment-based green card — a process immigration experts say can be long and complicated. TPS ineligibility An applicant is ineligible for TPS if convicted of a felony or two or more misdemeanors in the United States, or if subject to mandatory restrictions for asylum, such as having taken part in the persecution of someone else or having engaged in terrorist activities. People are also ineligible if they do not meet the requirements for continuous physical presence and residency in the United States, fail to register for TPS on time, or do not re-register for TPS when required without a good reason. Travel authorization for TPS holders TPS holders must request travel authorization to leave the U.S. Applicants must show U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services that they need to travel for urgent humanitarian reasons, such as a sick relative. If permission for the TPS holder to travel is requested by a nonprofit organization, it must prove the travel will further social and cultural interests of the United States. The current filing fee is $575. If a TPS holder leaves the United States without first obtaining travel authorization, the person may lose the TPS status and will not be able to reenter the United States. Can an administration end TPS at any time? The secretary of homeland security has to review conditions and decide whether conditions on the ground in a country continue to merit TPS. Only if the secretary concludes that conditions do not merit a continuation of TPS can the secretary issue a determination ending temporary protected status at that point.	https://www.voanews.com/a/walz-and-vance-clash-over-tps-immigration-issues-at-vp-presidential-debate-/7808328.html	2024-10-02T17:50:10-07:00	
Israel-Iran escalation heightens fears of widening war, direct US involvement	WASHINGTON — Since the start of Israel's war with Iran-backed Hamas in Gaza in October 2023, President Joe Biden has warned the U.S. ally against widening the conflict with Tehran's other proxies, including Hezbollah in Lebanon, and with Iran itself. Many fear that moment has come. In the past 10 days, Israel has unleashed an air campaign on Lebanon, striking over 3,600 Hezbollah-linked targets, according to Israel Defense Forces statements. On Tuesday, Israel launched what it called a limited ground offensive into southern Lebanon. Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu also vowed retaliation for Tehran's launching of 180 missiles toward Israel on Tuesday, an attack that damaged a school in the Israeli city of Hod Hasharon and killed at least one person in the West Bank. Meanwhile, in Damascus, Syrian state media said that three civilians had been killed in Israeli strikes Tuesday. More strikes were reported in the Syrian capital on Wednesday. Biden said his administration was giving Israel 'advice' and urging it to respond proportionally. He told reporters Wednesday that he had discussed the matter with leaders of the Group of Seven and that he might speak with Netanyahu 'relatively soon.' 'We'll be discussing with the Israelis what they're going to do, but they — every — all seven of us [G7 leaders] agree that they have a right to respond, but they should respond in proportion,' he told reporters. Netanyahu has threatened retaliation beyond Iran, to countries where Tehran's proxies are located. 'We fight the axis of evil everywhere,' he said Tuesday. 'This is true for Judea and Samaria [West Bank]. It is true for Gaza, Lebanon, Yemen, Syria. And it is also true for Iran.' Iran has for years used its proxies — Hamas in Gaza, Hezbollah in Lebanon and Houthis in Yemen — to attack Israel. It launched its first direct attack with a barrage of missiles and drones on Israeli soil in April, two weeks after Israel's deadly strike on the Iranian consulate in Syria. At that time, Israel's retaliatory attack against Tehran was measured, and as many analysts point out, calibrated to stop the escalation. They predict Israel will respond more strongly this time, possibly targeting Iranian nuclear or oil facilities. When asked, Biden said he would not support any Israeli strike on Iran's nuclear sites. He said more G7 sanctions would be imposed on Tehran. Tehran said its barrage of missiles Tuesday was in retaliation for Israel's recent killing of Hezbollah leader Hassan Nasrallah in Beirut, Hamas leader Ismail Haniyeh in Tehran and an Iranian military commander. Fears US will be dragged into war Washington fears further escalation could drag the United States directly into war should Iran retaliate again against Israel, especially if it hits American interests. 'That could mean attacking oil-producing facilities in Saudi Arabia,' said Aaron David Miller, a former U.S. negotiator for the Middle East who is now with the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace. 'That could mean empowering pro-Iranian groups in Iraq and Syria to attack American forces.' 'And yes, it could provide an avenue, a pathway, for the United States to get into this war,' he told VOA. With the largest military presence in the region compared with other external actors, the U.S. is already indirectly involved. Two U.S. Navy destroyers deployed to the eastern Mediterranean, the USS Bulkeley and USS Cole, joined Israeli air defense units Tuesday in firing about a dozen interceptors to shoot down inbound Iranian missiles, said Pentagon spokesman Major General Pat Ryder. Iranian Supreme Leader Ali Khamenei blamed the U.S. and European countries for the wars in the Middle East. 'If they rid the region of their presence, no doubt these conflicts, wars and clashes will completely go away,' he said. The White House has not responded to VOA's requests for comment on Khamenei's remarks. Containing the conflict It is unclear whether Biden will use offensive capabilities to strike Iran directly. What's clear is that despite calls for a cease-fire in Gaza and Lebanon, Washington has not succeeded in containing the conflict. 'The key drivers of events in the Middle East today are the players that are engaged in these combat operations,' said Brian Katulis, senior fellow at the Middle East Institute. 'It's Israel, it's Hamas in Gaza, Hezbollah in Lebanon, and it's Iran and its networks across the region, including the Houthis in Yemen.' Washington has been largely operating 'as a bystander,' trying to prevent the worst outcomes, Katulis said. The administration's approach has been 'largely reactive, tactical crisis management,' he added. Biden has so far refused to condition military aid to Israel — his biggest leverage in pressuring the country to agree to a cease-fire. He and others in his administration frequently underscore that they support Israel's right to defend itself. It's 'almost inconceivable now' that Biden would restrict military assistance to Israel, Miller said. In any case, he said, U.S. pressure is unlikely to have an impact. Over the past weeks, Hezbollah's capacity as an organized military force has been degraded. And having been pummeled for almost a year by Israel's campaign, Hamas no longer stands as an organized military structure. 'The Israelis are determined with this momentum to break with what the Iranians and the axis of resistance called the ring of fire,' Miller said, referring to Tehran's strategy of surrounding Israel with its proxies. Even if Israel succeeds, Miller said he is skeptical that it can turn its military victories into political agreements that would lead to peace. Miller grimly predicted that the three wars of attrition between Israel and Hamas, Israel and Hezbollah, and Israel and Iran will continue, albeit with less intensity.

Far-right gains in Europe drive debate on migration, Ukraine aid	London — A surge in support for far-right parties in Europe is driving calls for a toughening of migration laws, while also raising questions over the future of military aid to Ukraine. Austria's Freedom Party, which was founded by former Nazis after World War II, is the latest European far-right party to score a shocking win, taking just under 29% of the vote in Sunday’s parliamentary election, ahead of the second-place People’s Party with 26.3%. ‘Fortress Austria’ The Freedom Party, led by Herbert Kickl, campaigned on a platform of ending migration by creating what it called 'Fortress Austria,' carrying out the 'remigration of uninvited foreigners' and suspending the right to asylum. The party also opposes military aid for Ukraine and wants to end sanctions on Russia. Kickl successfully appealed to voters’ frustrations over recent years, said Austrian pollster and political analyst, Peter Hajek. 'Elections are won in those four and a half years before, by taking a position which is clearly distinguishable and good from the point of view of the target audiences,' Hajek told The Associated Press. 'And quite simply that’s what the Freedom Party managed to do with two big topics: on the one hand migration, and on the other — still — the coronavirus.' Far-right success Far-right, anti-immigration parties have won parliamentary elections in the Netherlands in 2023, Italy and Hungary in 2022, a state election in Germany in last month and the European parliamentary elections in France in June. Hans Kundnani, an adjunct professor at New York University and the author of the book Eurowhiteness, said centrist parties in Europe are alarmed by the rise of the far right. 'Another election in Europe, another far right success. The response of the center-right in Europe to that has been to say we have to get even tougher on immigration. The center right has increasingly been mimicking far right parties, especially far right ideas on these questions around identity and immigration and Islam,' Kundnani told VOA. EU summit Immigration is likely to top the agenda at an EU summit on October 17, as European leaders from across the political spectrum have called for a toughening of asylum laws amid growing domestic political pressures. 'A shift in the EU towards thinking much more in terms of a ‘Fortress Europe’ — that's building a wall essentially around the EU,' Kundnani said. The hardening of attitudes marks a sharp turnaround from 2015 when more than 1 million irregular migrants entered the EU, many of them destined for Germany. In 2023, the number had fallen by 75%, to 280,000 people. The 27-member bloc has agreed to a new pact on asylum and migration, due to come into force in 2026. It’s unlikely to calm Europe’s debate on immigration any time soon, according to Raphael Bossong, a migration expert at the German Institute for International and Security Affairs. 'This package that has been agreed upon is about 10 laws. Multiple investments are needed across 27 member states, and an implementation plan with 10 sectors of implementation,' he told VOA. 'So it’s a lot of stuff. And to get that into place to really work as a system, as it's intended, is — even in two years — highly ambitious.' Ukraine While strong opposition to immigration unites Europe’s far-right parties, they are divided over support for Ukraine following Russia’s 2022 invasion. Austria’s Freedom Party, the Alternative for Germany party and Hungary’s Fidesz party under Viktor Orban all oppose military aid for Kyiv and want to end sanctions on Moscow. Yet other European far-right parties, such as the ruling Brothers of Italy party under Prime Minister Giorgia Meloni and Poland’s Law and Justice party — which was in power until last year — are strongly pro-Ukrainian. The issue is clouding European politics, argues analyst Hans Kundnani of New York University. 'Precisely what divides these two groups of far-right parties to a large extent is the question of Russia and Ukraine,' Kundnani said. 'If you're on the far right but you're pro-Ukrainian, then I think a lot of European centrists have no problem with that. And they're willing to turn a blind eye to almost anything else that these far-right parties do, especially on questions like immigration.' Much of European Union foreign policy, including aid for Ukraine, requires a unanimous vote from all 27 members, making it easy for individual governments to veto EU decisions. Hungary’s Viktor Orban has repeatedly blocked EU aid packages for Ukraine. Coalition talks Despite its shocking victory, Austria’s Freedom Party is still well short of a majority. Rival parties are refusing to join them in government and could form their own coalition. The tactic has been used by other more centrist parties in Europe to keep the far-right from power — with mixed results, said Kundnani. 'They form these incoherent coalitions in response to the rise of the far right,' he told VOA. 'Those coalitions then aren't really able to do very much or offer citizens very much, which further empowers the far right. So it just gets worse and worse.'	https://www.voanews.com/a/far-right-gains-in-europe-drive-debate-on-migration-ukraine-aid-/7808290.html	2024-10-02T15:45:56-07:00

US prosecutors show new details of Trump's bid to overturn election loss	WASHINGTON — U.S. prosecutors said Donald Trump was acting outside the scope of his duties as president when he pressured state officials and then-Vice President Mike Pence to try to overturn his 2020 election defeat, in a court filing made public on Wednesday. The 165-page filing is likely the last opportunity for prosecutors to detail their case against Trump before the Nov. 5 election given there will not be a trial before Trump faces Democratic Vice President Kamala Harris. The filing is meant to keep the federal criminal election subversion case against the Republican presidential candidate moving forward following a July U.S. Supreme Court ruling that former presidents have broad immunity from prosecution for their official actions in office. Prosecutors working with Special Counsel Jack Smith laid out a sweeping account of Trump's conduct following the 2020 election, much of which has already been made public through news reports, findings from the House committee that investigated the Capitol riot or the indictment obtained by Smith in the case. It includes an allegation that a White House staffer heard Trump tell family members that 'it doesn't matter if you won or lost the election. You still have to fight like hell.' Trump has pleaded not guilty to four criminal charges accusing him of a conspiracy to obstruct the congressional certification of the election, defraud the U.S. out of accurate results and interfere with Americans’ voting rights. Much of the filing focuses on Trump's dealings with then-vice president and running mate Mike Pence, who Trump tried to pressure into using his official role overseeing Congress's Jan. 6, 2021, certification of the election results to overturn his defeat. Trump gave a fiery speech that day before his supporters stormed the Capitol, battling police, sending lawmakers running for their lives and chanting 'hang Mike Pence.' Prosecutors allege that when a White House aide told Trump, who was watching news coverage of the riot on TV, that Pence had been taken to a secure location, Trump responded, 'So what?' Prosecutors said they did not plan to use that interaction at trial given the Supreme Court's immunity ruling. A warning to Pence It also alleges that on Jan. 1, 2021, Trump warned Pence that people 'are gonna hate your guts' and 'think you're stupid' if he didn't block certification of Democratic President Joe Biden's win. Trump spokesperson Steven Cheung blasted the disclosures, saying, 'This entire case is a partisan, unconstitutional witch hunt that should be dismissed entirely, together with all of the remaining Democrat hoaxes.' Trump has rejected this case and multiple other criminal prosecutions he faced this year as politically motivated attempts to prevent him from returning to power. The filing presents a detailed narrative of the evidence prosecutors intend to use if the case goes to trial, accusing Trump of plotting even before the election to declare victory prematurely, replacing his campaign legal team when they allegedly would not support allegations of voter fraud and attempting to 'manipulate' Pence into aiding his effort to hold onto power. The filing provides details of conversations with senior officials in Trump’s administration including Pence and White House chief-of-staff Mark Meadows, who appeared before the grand jury during the investigation. Prosecutors submitted the court filing on Thursday, but U.S. District Judge Tanya Chutkan had to approve proposed redactions before it was made public. Pence was identified by name throughout. The names of many other members of Trump's administration and state officials he targeted are blacked out in the filing, though details of their locations and actions make their likely identities clear. Trump’s lawyers opposed allowing Smith to issue a sweeping court filing laying out their evidence, arguing it would be inappropriate to do so weeks before the election. They have argued the entire case should be tossed out based on the Supreme Court’s ruling. If Trump wins the election, he is likely to direct the Justice Department to drop the charges. Prosecutors also highlighted a Twitter post that Trump sent during the Capitol riot saying Pence 'didn't have the courage to do what should have been done' during the congressional certification of the election. Prosecutors said that post 'was not a message sent to address a matter of public concern and ease unrest; it was the message of an angry candidate upon the realization that he would lose power.'	https://www.voanews.com/a/us-prosecutors-show-new-details-of-trump-s-bid-to-overturn-election-loss/7808283.html	2024-10-02T15:31:34-07:00	
CIA makes it easier for potential informants to share tips	washington — The Central Intelligence Agency (CIA) wants to make it easier — and safer — for people in Iran, China and North Korea to share information with America's premier spy agency. The agency on Wednesday posted online instructions in Korean, Mandarin and Farsi detailing steps that potential informants can take to contact U.S. intelligence officials without putting themselves in danger. The instructions include ways to reach the CIA on its public website or on the darknet, a part of the internet that can only be accessed using special tools designed to hide the user's identity. The CIA posted similar instructions in Russian two years ago following Russia's invasion of Ukraine. 'People are trying to reach out to us from around the world and we are offering them instructions for how to do that safely,' the agency said in a statement. 'Our efforts on this front have been successful in Russia, and we want to make sure individuals in other authoritarian regimes know that we're open for business.' The tips, presented in text-only videos and infographics, include using a virtual private network, or VPN, to circumvent internet restrictions and surveillance, and the use of a device that can't easily be traced back to the user. The CIA also urged any potential informants to use private web browsers and to delete their internet history to cover their tracks. The messages in the three languages were posted on Telegram, YouTube, X, Facebook, Instagram and LinkedIn. Several of those platforms are blocked in China, Iran and Russia but can still be accessed using a VPN. Authoritarian leaders around the world have used the internet as a tool of mass surveillance and as a way to deliver propaganda and disinformation while blocking sites and views deemed unfavorable to the government. China, Russia, North Korea and Iran all block access to American platforms like Facebook, for example, and use web access to control which sources of information users can access. VPNs and other tools offer ways around this censorship and surveillance, but that ability has made them a target. In its instructions to potential sources, the CIA warned its audience to be selective, as their well-being could depend on choosing the right program. 'Use a VPN provider not headquartered in Russia, Iran, or China, or any other country that is considered unfriendly to the United States,' the agency wrote in its instructions for Mandarin users.	https://www.voanews.com/a/cia-makes-it-easier-for-potential-informants-to-share-tips/7808261.html	2024-10-02T14:45:27-07:00

Turnout for local assembly elections in Indian Kashmir sets record	Srinagar, Indian-administered Kashmir — Election officials in Indian-administered Kashmir are hailing a historically high turnout in elections completed this week as evidence of a commitment to democracy that bodes well for the region’s future. More than 69% of people in Indian-controlled Jammu and Kashmir, or J&K, cast their ballots in Tuesday’s third round of legislative elections, the first local electoral battle in a decade. Round one took place September 18 with a voter turnout of 61.38%, and phase two was September 25 with a voter turnout of 57.31%, according to election officials. Conducted in the three phases, the polling for 40 assembly constituencies — 24 in the Jammu division and 16 in the Kashmir valley — resulted in an overall voter turnout of over 63% in the disputed Himalayan region, organizers said. Wire news reports say results are expected next week. 'These elections have witnessed a significant increase in voter turnout in areas infamous for militancy and boycotting democratic processes,' read a statement issued by the Election Commission of India. 'J&K assembly elections have marked a significant deepening of democracy, which will echo in the pages of history and continue to inspire a democratic spirit of the region for years to come,' said the prepared statement quoting Rajiv Kumar, India’s top elections official. Northern Kashmir’s electoral landscape has traditionally been dominated by two rival political groups, the National Conference, or NC, and Peoples Democratic Party, or PDP. But the 2013 founding of the Awami Ittehad Party, or AIP, which is led by Indian parliamentarian Sheikh Abdul Rashid, popularly known as 'Engineer Rashid,' could alter the electoral battlefield. 'It appears the contest will be between the NC and PDP. However, the situation may change as Engineer Rashid has attracted a massive crowd since his release from Tihar Jail,' Pattan resident Tanveer Najar told VOA. 'It’s possible that the AIP could upset the NC and PDP.' University of Kashmir political scientist Noor Ahmad Baba told VOA all phases of the 2024 local elections saw the largest voter turnout since 1989’s regional armed insurgency against Indian rule. 'People came out in relatively large numbers due to changing political dynamics after special status revocation,' said Baba, referring to India’s 2019 decision to strip the Himalayan region of its semiautonomous status. 'Moreover, there has been no representation for the people during the last six years, so they voted.' Umer Nazir, a resident of the Sumbal area of Bandipora district in northern Kashmir, said he thought the central government had discriminated against the Muslim majority region because of an anti-Muslim agenda. 'We want our own people to lead us,' Nazir told VOA. 'Our properties, our children and much more have been taken from us,' he added. 'To put an end to this torture and seek some relief, I and my family decided to vote.' Political analyst and podcaster Muzamil Maqbool told VOA that election campaigning in recent weeks focused on topics such as the restoration of special status for the area, possible statehood and the release of political prisoners held by India. No 'kingmaker' But, he warned, voting results may not yield major changes. These 'local assembly elections differ from parliamentary elections,' he said, noting that candidates such as Engineer Rashid may not fare as well regionally as their supporters hoped, even though they campaigned impressively. 'Engineer Rashid may win a few seats but he won’t be a kingmaker or a king as he has claimed in several recent interviews,' Maqbool said. 'The support for Engineer Rashid in the recent parliamentary elections was largely based on emotional factors. Many voters believed that their votes would help secure his release from Tihar Jail after spending nearly six years.' Maqbool also said residents were typically thinking about improving their communities when they cast ballots in the local elections. 'People here have understood the importance of voting [now] in these [local assembly] elections, where they could choose a genuine representative, so their rights, especially land rights, and jobs will be safeguarded,' Maqbool said. Meanwhile, regional political parties, along with the main Indian opposition political group, the Indian National Congress, or INC, have said they will continue to lobby the government led by the ruling Bharatiya Janata Party, or BJP, to restore statehood for J&K. 'If statehood is not restored, we have no choice but to approach the Supreme Court. We are confident we will win this battle,' said former J&K Chief Minister Omar Abdullah while revealing the manifesto of his party days before the election. Indian opposition leader Rahul Gandhi also vowed to protest inside and outside Parliament to pressure the BJP to improve governance in J&K. 'If they don’t restore statehood, we will storm the well of both houses and take to the streets,' Gandhi said during a recent rally in Srinagar. 'This is the first time in Indian history that a state has been downgraded to a union territory. This was done to allow governance by outsiders.' Wasim Nabi contributed to this report.	https://www.voanews.com/a/turnout-for-local-assembly-elections-in-indian-kashmir-sets-record/7808179.html	2024-10-02T13:29:20-07:00	
Investigators in Haiti accuse 3 members of transitional presidential council of corruption	San Juan, Puerto Rico — An anti-corruption agency in Haiti on Wednesday accused three members of the country's transitional presidential council of bribery in a scathing report that threatens to destabilize the country’s fragile political stability. Smith Augustin, Emmanuel Vertilaire and Louis Gerald Gilles are accused of demanding more than $750,000 from the director of the government-owned National Bank of Credit to secure his job, the Unit for Combating Corruption said in its report. Gilles organized a meeting among the council members, the former bank director, Raoul Pascal Pierre-Louis, and Haitian consul Lonick Leandre at the Royal Oasis Hotel in the capital of Port-au-Prince, where the demand was made, the agency said. Leandre also is accused of accepting bribes. After the meeting, Pierre-Louis mentioned the demand to several officials, including Prime Minister Garry Conille and a judge. Unable to come with the more than $750,000, Pierre-Louis proposed instead to arrange loans or lines of credit, according to the report. Authorities said that four lines of credit were soon arranged, three of them up to $20,000 each for the council members accused, and a fourth up to $13,500 for Leandre. The three council members and the bank manager all face criminal charges of bribery and corruption, the anti-corruption unit said. Leandre faces charges of instigating bribe payments. None of them could be reached for comment. The agency also called on the U.S. government to extradite Pierre-Louis.	https://www.voanews.com/a/investigators-in-haiti-accuse-3-members-of-transitional-presidential-council-of-corruption/7808168.html	2024-10-02T13:07:09-07:00	
US, China plan Biden-Xi call in the coming days	WASHINGTON — The United States and China are planning a call between President Joe Biden and President Xi Jinping in the coming days, according to people familiar with the discussions who spoke on the condition of anonymity. This call would follow their last conversation in April 2024 and their face-to-face meeting in Woodside, California, in November 2023. After his talks with Chinese Foreign Minister Wang Yi last Friday, U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken told reporters that both sides 'emphasized the need to maintain open lines of communication' between the Chinese and American leaders. 'We also agreed on the importance of the leaders communicating. And so, I fully anticipate that we’ll see that in the week and months ahead,' said Blinken in New York last week. Ukraine U.S. officials have said that they seek opportunities, whenever possible, to find common ground with China, whether on issues such as fentanyl or discussions on artificial intelligence risks and safety. China's material support for Russia in the war on Ukraine is expected to be a key topic on the U.S. agenda. On Wednesday, Deputy Secretary of State Kurt Campbell said the U.S. does not seek to 'contain or constrain China' but wants to ensure an ongoing dialogue and that the competition between the two countries remains 'stable and [does] not trend to conflict.' He also reiterated the U.S. and its allies' growing concern over Chinese firms supplying drones to Moscow, which have significantly bolstered Russia's battlefield capabilities in its war against Ukraine. 'What we've seen over the course of last two years is a reconstitution of the Russian military with a rapidity and determination that frankly surprises us. The level of Russian militarization, its ability to rebuild its tanks, its missiles, UAVs [unmanned aerial vehicles], with the assistance of China, support from North Korea, also from Iran. That has been a topic of real anxiety,' said Campbell during an online moderated conversation at the Washington-based think tank Carnegie Endowment for International Peace. 'Now we're in a situation where Russia is seeking to change the territorial lines of Europe, and the fact that China is backing this so substantially is a topic of real concern,' he said. 75th anniversary This week, China marks 75 years of Communist Party rule. In Beijing, Xi reiterated his party’s plans to 'reunite' China with Taiwan. 'The wheel of history will not be stopped by any individual or any force,' Xi said during a recent reception, without naming specific individuals or governments. He added that it is 'where the greater national interest lies' and 'what the people desire.' Taiwan has been self-ruled since 1949, when Mao Zedong's communists took power in Beijing after defeating Chiang Kai-shek's Kuomintang, or KMT, in a civil war, prompting Chiang and his followers to relocate to the island. In 2000, following Taiwan’s second democratic presidential election, the KMT peacefully transferred power for the first time to the Democratic Progressive Party. While the Chinese Communist Party has never governed Taiwan, it consistently insists that Taiwan must be brought under its rule, by force if necessary. For decades, however, the U.S. has made it clear that its decision to switch diplomatic recognition from the Republic of China — Taiwan’s formal name — to Beijing or the People's Republic of China in 1979 was based on the expectation that 'the future of Taiwan will be determined by peaceful means,' as outlined in the Taiwan Relations Act. Under this act, the U.S. has provided arms to support Taiwan's defense. On Sunday, U.S. President Joe Biden approved $567 million in defense assistance for Taiwan, as China intensifies its political and military pressure on the self-ruled democracy. In a statement, Biden announced that he has authorized Blinken 'to direct the drawdown of up to $567 million in defense articles and services of the Department of Defense, and military education and training, to provide assistance to Taiwan.' In Beijing, Chinese officials urged the U.S. to 'stop arming Taiwan in any way.' Lin Jian, spokesperson for the PRC’s Ministry of Foreign Affairs, told reporters during a Monday briefing that 'no matter how many weapons the United States provides to Taiwan,' it will not shake the Beijing government’s firm determination 'to defend national sovereignty and territorial integrity.'	https://www.voanews.com/a/us-china-plan-biden-xi-call-in-the-coming-days/7808130.html	2024-10-02T12:37:53-07:00

State-run media in Latin America criticize US government, candidates	Madrid — In their coverage of the U.S. presidential election, countries with repressive media such as Cuba, Nicaragua and Venezuela have taken aim at the American system of government and, to some degree, the candidates themselves. Following the two assassination attempts targeting Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump, Cuban state-run newspaper Granma ran a headline, 'The guns speak again in the U.S. elections,' an apparent reference to gun violence in the United States. But the newspaper made no mention on its front pages Wednesday of the previous night’s vice presidential debate between Republican JD Vance and Democrat Tim Walz in which the two candidates clashed on issues that included gun control. The paper did cover the face-to-face debate last month between Trump and Vice President Kamala Harris, saying they traded 'low blows.' Overall, Cuban press coverage of the U.S. has not favored either candidate during this election cycle, said William LeoGrande, professor of government at American University in Washington. 'The Cuban press has been very even-handed in coverage of the U.S. elections, mostly offering simple factual accounts of the campaign — no doubt because they will have to deal with whoever wins,' said LeoGrande. 'To the extent that they have offered any critical commentary, it can be summed up as a ‘plague on both your houses,’' he said. LeoGrande noted that one Granma report said, 'There is only one certainty: Whoever wins will be the face invested with the arrogance of the empire with a desire for power.' Cuba has long referred to the U.S. as the 'empire.' To understand how Granma views the U.S. election, VOA emailed its editor, Yailin Orta Rivera, for comment but did not receive a reply before publication. In Nicaragua, ‘hate and criticism’ In Nicaragua, state-controlled media have used reports about the U.S. election as a chance to repeat traditional criticisms of Washington, independent media monitoring groups say. Abigail Hernandez, director of Galeria News and a member of the Independent Journalists and Communications of Nicaragua, said state media such as La Nueva Radio Ya have run reports critical of the American political system. 'These analysis reports concentrate on the judicial and electoral system of the U.S. and criticize the candidacy of Trump,' she told VOA. 'I say ‘analysis’ because in reality, these articles are the traditional line of hate and criticism toward the U.S. empire.' Hernandez added, 'They try to say that the U.S. is a sham democracy and that the elections are a reflection of this.' The government of Nicaraguan President Daniel Ortega did not respond to an emailed request for comment before publication. In Nicaragua, state media are controlled by Ortega or members of his family, independent media monitoring groups said. In 2010, Canal 8, which had been an independent television network, had a new chief executive — Juan Carlos Ortega Murillo — the president’s son. Until then, the channel had been known for scrutinizing governments of the left or right, the Reuters news agency reported. Its new owner is the wife of Rafael Ortega Murillo, another of the president’s sons. Media analysts say that in Nicaragua and Venezuela, reports on the U.S. election criticized the U.S. political system in relation to key issues of interest to their core audiences, especially migration. Tens of thousands of Nicaraguans desperate to escape the Ortega government have headed north, seeking to cross into the United States. Earlier this year, the U.S. imposed sanctions on Nicaragua over issues related to migrant smuggling and human rights. Venezuela, US in tense relationship Venezuela’s government has also had a tense relationship with the United States over human rights and the conduct of elections. Driven by political turmoil, 7.7 million people have left Venezuela since 2014, according to a United Nations report published earlier this year. Most have headed for other Latin American countries or Spain. Others have ended up in the United States illegally, although there have been efforts to allow some Venezuelans into the U.S. lawfully, the U.N. report said. Marivi Marin Vazquez, founder and director of ProboxVE, a nongovernmental organization that studies disinformation in Latin America, said state media in Cuba, Nicaragua and Venezuela all used reports about the U.S. elections to criticize the American political system. 'They all look at problems in the political system so they can justify their own systems,' she said in an interview with VOA from Washington, where she has lived in exile since leaving Venezuela four years ago. 'They pick holes in things like contradictions, inequality and the power of corporate interests.'

Israel strike on Syria capital kills three, war monitor says	Beirut, Lebanon — An Israeli airstrike killed three people Wednesday in Damascus, a monitor said, in the second strike in as many days on a neighborhood that is home to security headquarters and embassies. 'An Israeli airstrike targeted a flat in a residential building in the Mazzeh neighborhood frequented by Hezbollah leaders and the Iranian Revolutionary Guards,' the Britain-based Syrian Observatory for Human Rights said. It killed at least three people, two of them foreigners, the monitor said. State news agency SANA quoted a military source as saying that 'the Israeli enemy launched an air strike... targeting one of the residential buildings in the Mazzeh neighborhood.' That source said three civilians were killed and three wounded. Wednesday's strike hit around 500 meters from Tuesday's strike. The Observatory said the earlier strike killed six people — three civilians, including a television anchor, and three Iran-backed fighters, one of them from Hezbollah. Israel has carried out hundreds of strikes in Syria since the country's civil war erupted in 2011, mainly targeting army positions and Iran-backed fighters, including those of Hezbollah. Israeli authorities rarely comment on individual strikes but have said repeatedly they will not allow archenemy Iran to expand its presence in Syria.	https://www.voanews.com/a/israel-strike-on-syria-capital-kills-three-war-monitor-says/7807887.html	2024-10-02T10:08:18-07:00

4 Russian journalists accused of working for Navalny group go on trial	TALLINN, Estonia — Four Russian journalists went on trial in Moscow on Wednesday after being accused of working for an anti-corruption group founded by the late Russian opposition politician Alexey Navalny, which was designated by authorities as an extremist organization in 2021. Antonina Favorskaya, Artyom Kriger, Sergey Karelin and Konstantin Gabov were arrested earlier this year and charged with involvement with an extremist group, a criminal offense punishable by up to six years in prison. All four have rejected the charges. The trial, which is being held behind closed doors, is the latest step in the Kremlin's unrelenting crackdown on dissent that has reached unprecedented levels after Russia's full-scale invasion of Ukraine more than two years ago. The authorities have targeted opposition figures, independent journalists, rights activists and ordinary Russians critical of the Kremlin with criminal and misdemeanor charges, jailing hundreds and prompting thousands to leave the country, fearing prosecution. The four journalists were accused of working with Navalny's Foundation for Fighting Corruption, which was designated as extremist and outlawed by the Russian authorities in 2021. That designation has been widely seen as politically motivated. Navalny was President Vladimir Putin's fiercest and most prominent foe and relentlessly campaigned against official corruption in Russia. In February, Navalny died in a remote Arctic prison while serving a 19-year sentence on a number of charges, including running an extremist group, which he had rejected as politically driven. Favorskaya and Kriger worked with SotaVision, an independent Russian news outlet that covers protests and political trials. Gabov is a freelance producer who has worked for multiple organizations, including Reuters. Karelin is a freelance video journalist who has done work for Western media outlets, including The Associated Press. As they were led into the courtroom on Wednesday, a crowd of supporters greeted them with applause. In the courtroom, the four smiled at their loved ones from a glass defendant's cage. Addressing reporters from behind the glass, Kriger cast the case against him and his fellow journalists as a cautionary tale and urged journalists still in Russia to leave the country: 'It is not a joke. Any person can be charged with anything.' Favorskaya, in turn, spoke about hope: 'Everything that is happening now, the darkness that surrounds us, it is not forever, and we will definitely see the country that Alexei [Navalny] dreamed of, we will definitely live in a country where rights and freedoms will be [respected] and journalists and other people will not be jailed for their views.' Shortly after the hearing began, the judge ordered that the proceedings be held behind closed doors upon a request from the prosecution, even though the defense objected to it.	https://www.voanews.com/a/russian-journalists-accused-of-working-for-navalny-group-go-on-trial/7807809.html	2024-10-02T09:06:02-07:00	
Russian authorities systematically torture Ukrainian POWs, UN says	Geneva — Russian authorities have subjected hundreds of Ukrainian prisoners of war to 'widespread and systematic torture' while supervisors in detention facilities aware of that treatment did nothing to stop the abuse, according to a report published by the U.N. Office of the High Commissioner for Human Rights. 'We have interviewed 174 Ukrainian prisoners of war, and this includes five medics since March of last year, and almost every single one provided credible and reliable and detailed accounts of torture and severe ill-treatment,' Danielle Bell, head of the U.N. human rights monitoring mission in Ukraine, told journalists in Geneva. Speaking Tuesday via video link from the Ukrainian capital, Kyiv, Bell said the POWs described 'severe beatings, electric shocks, sleep deprivation, dog bites, mock executions' and other threatening and degrading treatment. She said 68% of the POWs reported that 'sexual violence, torture and ill treatment occurs at all stages of captivity under appalling internment conditions' across multiple facilities in the occupied territory and the Russian Federation. She said the routine nature of the abuse, which occurred on a daily or weekly basis and continued throughout the period of internment — sometimes as long as up to three years — 'indicated knowledge of faculty supervisors.' 'When external officials of the Russian Federation visited internment sites, in many instances, the torture and ill treatment temporarily ceased and conditions improved, indicating that those responsible for these facilities were aware of the mistreatment,' she said. 'Russian public figures have openly called for the inhumane treatment and execution of Ukrainian POWs,' she said, adding that 'these factors, combined with the adoption of broad amnesty laws for Russian service persons, have contributed to a climate of impunity.' The United Nations report, which describes conditions of detention as poor, 'with most POWs reporting food shortages, lack of medical care, overcrowding and poor hygienic conditions,' says 10 Ukrainian POWs have died due to 'torture, lack of medical care and dire health conditions.' Of the 205 Russian POWs interviewed since March 2023, the report says 104 were subjected to torture or ill-treatment by Ukrainian authorities 'during the initial stages of their captivity,' including severe beatings, threats of death and physical violence. 'However, in nearly all cases, torture and ill-treatment stopped when prisoners arrived at official places of internment, where conditions appeared generally compliant with international standards,' it says. Bell underlined differences in the scope and scale of the treatment meted out to Ukrainian and Russian POWs by their captors. She observed that the torture or ill treatment of the Russian POWs by Ukrainian authorities takes place during their initial capture, in the early days. She said these practices stop and the captives 'are safe once they are inside the internment facilities,' whereas the abusive treatment of Ukrainian POWs in Russian detention centers 'happens throughout the duration of their internment.' Bell attributes the better treatment of Russian POWs in large part to the monitors having unrestricted access to Ukrainian sites where they are held, noting that U.N. officials are 'able to carry out a very open dialogue with Ukrainian authorities on where to make improvements.' She added, however, that the mission cannot look out for the welfare of Ukrainian POWs because it does not have access to them in the Russian Federation, 'though we have been asking for access for a long time.' Other human rights developments Besides delving into the torture experienced by POWs since Russian armed forces’ full-scale invasion of Ukraine in February 2022, the 30-page U.N. report also covers key human rights developments in the country from June 1 to August 31, 2024. The report finds civilian casualties and damage to civilian infrastructure have increased significantly during that period, noting that 589 civilians have been killed and 2,685 injured. That represents 'a 45% increase in casualties on the previous three months' and brings the total number of civilians killed since the start of the war to 11,743, with 24,614 injuries. 'During the reporting period, Russian armed forces continued to target energy infrastructure across Ukraine, affecting essential services and deepening concerns about the plight of the civilian population with winter approaching,' Liz Throssel, spokesperson for the U.N. human rights office, said at the release of the report. She also said intensive military attacks by Russian armed forces against cities across Ukraine such as Sumy, Kharkiv and Zaporizhzhia 'have damaged and destroyed civilian property and infrastructure, including schools, hospitals and even a geriatric care home.' 'And we have documented even more attacks against Ukraine’s energy infrastructure,' said Throssel. Bell said the Russian Federation has launched nine waves of large-scale, coordinated attacks between March and August targeting Ukraine’s energy generation facilities, primarily thermal, hydroelectric and heating plants. 'The cascading damage from these attacks has affected essential services like electricity, water, heating, sewage and public education,' she said. 'Vulnerable populations — for example, older persons, persons with disabilities, lower income households and children — have been disproportionately affected. 'Rolling blackouts are expected to resume this winter,' she said. 'But let me emphasize, significant efforts are underway to restore Ukraine’s generation capacity and to mitigate the risks of a harsh winter. But this situation is exacerbated by ongoing attacks.' The High Commissioner’s report will be submitted to the U.N. human rights council next week.	https://www.voanews.com/a/russian-authorities-systematically-torture-ukrainian-pows-un-says/7807761.html	2024-10-02T08:46:33-07:00	
Long water, power outages from Helene test patience in Carolinas, Georgia	SWANNANOA, North Carolina — Many residents of the Carolinas still lacked running water, cellphone service and electricity Wednesday as rescuers searched for people unaccounted for after Hurricane Helene caused catastrophic damage across the Southeast and killed at least 166 people. President Joe Biden will survey the devastation in the two states as floodwaters receded and revealed more of the death and destruction left in Helene's path. More than 1.2 million customers still had no power Wednesday in the Carolinas and Georgia, where Helene tore far inland after initial landfall on Florida's Gulf Coast. Some residents cooked food on charcoal grills or hiked to high ground in the hopes of finding a signal to let loved ones know they are alive. 'We have to jump-start this recovery process,' Biden said Tuesday, estimating it will cost billions. 'People are scared to death. This is urgent.' While Biden is in the Carolinas, Vice President Kamala Harris will be in neighboring Georgia. Cadaver dogs and search crews trudged through knee-deep muck and debris in the mountains of western North Carolina looking for more victims. At least 57 people were killed in Buncombe County alone, home to the city of Asheville, a tourism haven known for its art galleries, breweries and outdoor activities. In small Swannanoa, outside Asheville, receding floodwaters revealed cars stacked on top of others and mobile homes that had floated away. Sinkholes pockmarked roads caked with mud and debris. Cliff Stewart survived 2 feet of water that poured into his home, topping the wheels on his wheelchair and sending his medicine bottles floating. Left without electricity and reliant on food drop-offs from friends, he has refused offers to help him leave. 'Where am I going to go?' the Marine Corps veteran said. 'This is all I've got. I just don't want to give it up, because what am I going to do? Be homeless? I'd rather die right here than live homeless.' Across the border in east Tennessee, a caravan including Gov. Bill Lee surveying damage outside the town of Erwin drove by a crew pulling two bodies from the wreckage, a grim reminder that the rescue and recovery operations are still very much ongoing and the death toll is likely to rise. In Augusta, Georgia, Sherry Brown converted power from her car's alternator to keep her refrigerator running. She has been taking 'bird baths' with water collected in coolers. In another part of the city, people waited in line for more than three hours to get water from one of five centers set up to serve more than 200,000 people. What is being done to help? More than 150,000 households have registered for assistance with the Federal Emergency Management Agency, and that number is expected to rise rapidly in the coming days, said Frank Matranga, an agency representative. Nearly 2 million ready-to-eat meals and more than a million liters of water have been sent to the hardest-hit areas, he said. The storm unleashed the worst flooding in a century in North Carolina, dumping more than 2 feet (61 centimeters) of rain in places. The administration of Gov. Roy Cooper said Tuesday that more than two dozen water plants remained closed. Active-duty U.S. military units may be needed to assist the long-term recovery, he said, adding that Biden had given 'the green light' to mobilizing military assets soon. A section of one of the region's main arteries, Interstate 40, reopened Tuesday after a mudslide was cleared, but a collapsed stretch near North Carolina's border with Tennessee remained closed. How some of the hardest-hit areas are coping Residents and business owners wore masks and gloves while clearing debris Tuesday in Hot Springs, North Carolina, where almost every building along the main street was heavily damaged. Sarah Calloway, who owns the deli and gourmet grocery Vaste Riviere Provisions, said the storm arrived frighteningly quickly. She helped fill sandbags the night before, but they turned out to be useless. The water rose so rapidly that even though she and others were in an apartment on an upper floor, she feared they would not be safe. They called to request a rescue from a swift water team. 'It was really challenging to watch how quickly it rose up and then just to watch whole buildings floating down the river. It was something I can't even describe,' she said. In the Black Mountain Mobile Home Park in Swannanoa, Carina Ramos and Ezekiel Bianchi were overwhelmed by the damage. The couple, their children and dog fled in the predawn darkness on Friday as the Swannanoa River's rapidly rising waters began flooding the bottom end of the park. By then, trees blocked the roads and the couple abandoned their three vehicles, all of which flooded. 'We left everything because we were panicking,' Ramos said. Mobile service knocked out The widespread damage and outages affecting communications infrastructure left many people without stable access to the internet and cell service. 'People are walking the streets of Canton with their phones up in the air trying to catch a cellphone signal like it's a butterfly,' said Mayor Zeb Smathers, of Canton, North Carolina. 'Every single aspect of this response has been extremely crippled by lack of cellphone communication. The one time we absolutely needed our cellphones to work they failed.' Teams from Verizon worked to repair toppled cell towers and damaged cables and to provide alternative forms of connectivity, the company said in a statement. AT&T said it launched 'one of the largest mobilizations of our disaster recovery assets for emergency connectivity support.' The efforts to restore service were made more challenging by the region's terrain and spread-out population, said David Zumwalt, president and CEO of the Association for Broadband Without Boundaries. Destruction from Florida to Virginia Helene blew ashore in Florida late Thursday as a Category 4 hurricane and upended life throughout the Southeast, with deaths reported in six states: Florida, Georgia, Tennessee and Virginia, in addition to the Carolinas. With at least 36 killed in South Carolina, Helene passed the 35 people who were killed in the state after Hurricane Hugo made landfall north of Charleston in 1989. When Lee, the Tennessee governor, flew to the eastern part of the state to survey damage Tuesday, residents said the governor and his entourage were the first help they had seen since the storm hit. 'Where has everyone been?' one frustrated local asked. 'We have been here alone.'	https://www.voanews.com/a/long-water-power-outages-from-helene-test-patience-in-carolinas-georgia-/7807699.html	2024-10-02T08:03:51-07:00	
US group helps resettle LGBTQ+ refugees fleeing violence, crackdowns	SAN FRANCISCO, California — Cabrel Ngounou's life in Cameroon quickly unraveled after neighbors caught the teenager with his boyfriend. A crowd surrounded his boyfriend's house and beat him. Ngounou's family learned of the relationship and kicked him out. So Ngounou fled — alone and with little money — on a dangerous, four-year journey through at least five countries. He was sexually assaulted in a Libyan prison, harassed in Tunisia and tried unsuccessfully to take a boat to Europe. 'The worst thing was that they caught us. So, it was not easy for my family,' Ngounou said. 'My sisters told me I need to get out of the house because my place is not there. So that's what really pushed me to leave my country.' Ngounou's troubles drew attention after he joined a protest outside the U.N. refugee agency's Tunisia office. Eventually, he arrived in the United States, landing in San Francisco in March. Ngounou joined a growing number of LGBTQ+ people accepted into the Welcome Corps, which launched last year and pairs groups of Americans with newly arrived refugees. So far, the resettlement program has connected 3,500 sponsors with 1,800 refugees, and many more want to help: 100,000 people have applied to become sponsors. President Joe Biden has sought to rebuild the refugee programs Donald Trump largely dismantled as president, working to streamline the process of screening and placing people in America. New refugee resettlement sites have opened across the country, and on Tuesday, the Biden administration announced that it resettled 100,000 refugees in fiscal year 2024, the largest number in more than three decades. In contrast, Trump has pledged to bar refugees from Gaza, reinstate his Muslim ban and impose 'ideological screening' for all immigrants if he regains the presidency. He and running mate JD Vance are laying groundwork for their goal of deporting millions of illegal immigrants by amplifying false claims, such as the accusation that Haitians given temporary protected status to remain in the U.S. legally are eating pets in Ohio. Under Biden, meanwhile, two human rights officials in the State Department were tasked last year with identifying refugees who face persecution either due to their sexual orientation or human rights advocacy. 'LGBTQ refugees are forced to flee their homes due to persecution and violence, not unlike other people,' said Jeremy Haldeman, deputy executive director of the Community Sponsorship Hub, which implements the Welcome Corps on behalf of the State Department. But they are particularly vulnerable because they're coming from places 'where their identities are criminalized, and they are at risk of imprisonment or even death.' More than 60 countries have passed anti-LGBTQ laws and thousands of people have fled the Middle East and Africa seeking asylum in Europe. In April, Uganda's constitutional court on Wednesday upheld an anti-gay law that allows the death penalty for 'aggravated homosexuality.' 'There are just a lot of people who are really at risk and are not safe in their country, and they're usually not safe in the neighboring or regional countries either,' Kathryn Hampton, senior adviser for U.S. Strategy at Rainbow Railroad, which helps LGBTQ+ people facing persecution. The demand far outstrips capacity: Of more than 15,000 requests for help in 2023, the nonprofit group helped resettle 23 refugees through the Welcome Corps program in cities as large as Houston and towns as small as Arlington, Vermont. It has a goal of resettling 50 this year. 'So, we have a lot of urgency as an organization to find and create new pathways that LGBTQI+ people can access to find safety,' Hampton said. Another refugee in the program, Julieth Luna Garcia, is a transgender woman from El Salvador who settled in Chicago. Speaking through a translator, the 31-year-old Garcia said she suffered abuse from her family because of her trans identity and couldn't legally access gender-affirming care until she arrived in the United States. 'I lived with constant fear, even more so at night. I didn't like to go out. I was really scared that somebody would find me alone and do something,' Garcia said. Since arriving in February, Garcia has found a place to live and a job as a home health aide and hopes to study to become a lawyer. 'Here, I'm not scared to say who I am. I'm not scared to tell anyone,' she said. Maybe the biggest change was starting hormone treatments, she said: 'To see yourself in the mirror and see these changes, I can't really explain it, but it's really big. It's an emotional and exciting thing and something I thought I would never experience.' Welcome Corps sponsors are expected to help refugees adjust for at least three months after they arrive. Garcia said the five volunteers helped her 'adapt to a new life with a little less difficulty,' by accessing benefits, getting a work permit and enrolling in English classes. Ngounou recalled how his sponsors, a team of seven that included a lesbian couple, Anne Raeff and Lori Ostlund, hosted him and connected him with LGBTQ+ resources and a work training program. They also served as his tour guides to gay life, taking him to the historically gay Castro district, where Ngounou got his first glimpse of the huge rainbow Pride flag and stopped to read every plaque honoring famous gay people. 'Cabrel was just very, very moved by that. Just kind of started crying. We all did,' Raeff recalled. 'I know that feeling like when we were young, when you'd go into a gay bar and you'd feel like this sense of kind of freedom, like this community,' she said. 'That was the only place where you could go and actually be open. And that ... this is this community of people, and we all have this in common.' Now the 19-year-old Ngounou works in a coffee shop and takes college courses, with the goal of becoming a social worker. He hopes the boyfriend he met in Tunisia can visit him in San Francisco — and he still finds it hard to believe that they can share their love openly. 'Here I'm really me ... I feel free,' he said. 'I feel free to have my boyfriend and walk with him in the street. I feel free, you know, to enjoy myself with him wherever we want to enjoy ourselves. But in Tunisia or anywhere else, in Cameroon, you have to hide such things.'	https://www.voanews.com/a/us-group-helps-resettle-lgbtq-refugees-fleeing-violence-crackdowns/7807681.html	2024-10-02T07:37:02-07:00	
Blasts, shooting happen near Israeli embassies in Nordic capitals	Copenhagen — Police in Denmark and Sweden said on Wednesday they were probing explosions and gunfire around Israeli embassies in their capitals that took place amid spiraling Middle East tensions. In Denmark, police said three Swedish nationals had been arrested after two blasts were reported in the 'immediate proximity' of the Israeli Embassy in Copenhagen early Wednesday. Swedish police said the Israeli Embassy in Stockholm had been targeted in a shooting on Tuesday just before 6 p.m. No injuries were reported from the incidents, but both came amid heightened international fears as Iran fired missiles at Israel, which has vowed to respond to the attack. 'Two explosions occurred at 3:20 a.m. at the Israeli Embassy. It is our preliminary assessment that it was due to two hand grenades,' Jens Jespersen of the Copenhagen police said at a press conference. He added that three Swedes between the ages of 15 and 20 had been arrested. The police officer explained that one suspect was arrested shortly after the incident near the crime scene and that the other two had been arrested later. Police said in an earlier statement that two suspects had been arrested on a train at Copenhagen Central Station. 'It's too early to say if there is a link' between the blasts and the Israeli Embassy, Danish police spokesperson Jakob Hansen said of the Copenhagen incidents. By midmorning, the area in Copenhagen was cordoned off and police were working at the scene, an AFP correspondent observed. Denmark's intelligence service, PET, said it was monitoring events 'closely' and assisting the police investigation. 'We are also in dialogue with the Israeli embassy about security, and are constantly assessing the scale of the security measures already implemented in relation to a number of Jewish locations,' PET said in a statement to AFP. Writing on X, Israeli Ambassador to Denmark David Akov said he was 'shocked by the appalling incident near the embassy a few hours ago.' Swedish police said in a statement that information indicated the Israeli Embassy building had been hit by shots on Tuesday evening. 'We've made finds that indicate a shooting at Israel's Embassy, but we don't want to disclose exactly what finds have been made since there is an ongoing investigation,' Rebecca Landberg, Stockholm police press officer, told AFP. Landberg added that an investigation had been opened into an aggravated weapons offense, endangerment of others and unlawful threats. Police had made no arrests, but Landberg said police were actively gathering and analyzing material from the many surveillance cameras in the area. Since the outbreak of the Israel-Hamas war in October 2023, several incidents apparently targeting Israeli interests in Sweden have been reported. In February, police found a grenade in the Israeli Embassy compound grounds, which the ambassador said was an attempted attack. In May, gunshots were fired outside the Israeli Embassy, which prompted Sweden to boost security around Israeli interests and Jewish community institutions.	https://www.voanews.com/a/blasts-shooting-happen-around-israeli-embassies-in-nordic-capitals/7807603.html	2024-10-02T06:49:34-07:00	
Unlike past Arab-Israeli conflicts, Arab governments pursue diplomacy while Iran proxies' fight	Amman, Jordan — Arab states like Egypt, Qatar, Jordan and Saudi Arabia have engaged in diplomacy and humanitarian efforts during the year-long Gaza conflict, but those doing the actual fighting against Israel are in fact Iran's Arab proxies or non-state actors, Hamas and Hezbollah. This signals not just a big switch from past Arab-Israeli conflicts, but a growing threat of a wider regional war. Arab governments have struggled to respond to the Gaza crisis. Rami G. Khouri, a non-resident fellow of Washington’s Arab Center writes they have been trying to balance support for Palestinians 'without strengthening Hamas and other Islamist militant allies that most Arab governments see as radicalizing threats.' This, while providing humanitarian aid for suffering Gaza civilians. Lebanese analyst Dania Koleilat Khatib explained the conundrum to VOA. 'Most Arab states, either have formal relations or they have taken the decision not to engage in any fight with Israel. Now the resistance movements have no sponsor. That’s why they go to Iran, why Hamas went to Iran,' she said. Khatib, president of the Research Center for Cooperation and Peace Building in Beirut, said the unresolved Israeli-Palestinian conflict has given non-Arab Iran a way to influence regional politics for its own purposes. 'They’re engaged, and they use the Palestinian issue as an entry door to the Arab community. If you take the Palestine issue aside, what do we have with the Iranians in common? Nothing. Of course, this creates friction. The Arab states are going on one course and these resistance movements are going on another course. The PLO was not Islamist, it was secular. But unless you solve the problem, you will have a problem that hasn’t been solved,' said Khatib. Analyst Nicholas Heras of the New Lines Institute in Washington told VOA that Iran spent years building 'committed proxies' like Hezbollah, Hamas, and others, most of which, he says, are of 'Arab origin,' and that see defeating Israel 'as the culmination of their ideological mission.' This allows Iran not to take on Israel directly. That changed on October 1 with Iran’s biggest missile attack on Israel. Despite Israel’s downgrading of Hezbollah, once considered Iran’s chief defense line, Heras said Hezbollah may be down, but not out. 'On the longer term what Iran most likely will try to do is create a Hezbollah organization that’s younger, more extreme, and transnational in character so as to truly link all the different battlefronts in the region to force the Israelis to have to play a broader regional conflict and to continue to signal to the Americans that if the Americans get involved, it would require them to go to war with Iran,' he said. Heras said that ultimately Iran wants missiles and drones capable of threatening 'Israel in a manner that has never been done before by any Arab state actor in the course of Arab-Israeli conflicts.' 'The Iranians view themselves as the flag bearers of a revolutionary cause that is not Arab. It’s Islamic. The Iranians are hoping that the current conflict in Gaza, with all the difficult images of human suffering and destruction, will inspire a future generation of the Arab and the broader Islamic world, to take up arms against Israel,' he said. Former Mideast Pentagon adviser Yasmine El Gamal told the BBC that Arab and Muslim states have now provided a 'diplomatic offramp' to Israel: their recognition of Israel in exchange for 'the end of the occupation and a two-state solution' to end the Arab Israeli conflict. She and other analysts say the West needs to bring Israel back from the brink of a possible widening conflict. But will that be enough to settle the decades-long animosity between Israel and Iran?	https://www.voanews.com/a/unlike-past-arab-israeli-conflicts-arab-governments-pursue-diplomacy-while-iran-proxies-fight/7807615.html	2024-10-02T06:44:57-07:00

Pope opens new debates on Catholic Church future	Vatican City, Holy See — Pope Francis launched new consultations Wednesday on the future of the Roman Catholic Church, as it faces pressure over the role of women and the ongoing scourge of clerical child abuse. The General Assembly of the Synod, comprising 368 religious and lay people — including women — from around 100 countries, will hold closed-door debates on potential reforms at the Vatican until October 27. The synod had already gathered for a month-long assembly in October 2023, after a three-year worldwide consultation among Catholics organized by Francis to confront challenges facing the 2,000-year-old Church. The 87-year-old Argentine pontiff will have the final say on any doctrinal changes they recommend. Last year, the assembly addressed themes as varied as attitudes to LGBTQ people, polygamy, the ordination of married men and the fight against the sexual abuse of children by priests. Although the body resisted pressure to allow the ordination of female priests, calls continue for more visibility and space for women in an institution still run by men. No decisions are expected any time soon, with the most sensitive issues entrusted to working groups that will deliver their conclusions in June 2025. Francis launched the Assembly with a mass in St Peter's Square, where he urged participants to enter the discussions with an open mind. 'Let us be careful not to see our contributions as points to defend at all costs or agendas to be imposed,' he said. He added that the meeting was 'not a parliamentary assembly, but rather a place of listening in communion.' On Tuesday evening, Francis held a 'penitential' vigil attended by around 2,5000 people in St Peter's Basilica, during which he again asked forgiveness and expressed his 'shame' for the abuse by priests that has overshadowed the Church's work across the world. People at the vigil heard from a South African former choirboy who was assaulted by a priest when he was just 11, and who denounced a lack of transparency and responsibility in and by the Church that he said had shaken the faith of millions of people. 'We are here as beggars of the Father's mercy, asking for forgiveness,' Francis said.

Weakening Krathon expected to hit land early on Thursday	KAOHSIUNG, Taiwan — Taiwan shut down on Wednesday, grounding hundreds of flights and closing schools, offices and financial markets ahead of the arrival of a weakening Typhoon Krathon with one person reported dead and torrential rain lashing the island's south. Officials in the key port city of Kaohsiung, set to be in the eye of the storm, told people to stay home and avoid the sea, rivers and mountains, warning of a repeat of 1977's Typhoon Thelma that killed 37 and devastated the city of 2.7 million. Although the typhoon has weakened, the threats from a storm surge, strong winds and rain remain as it slowly makes its way towards Taiwan's coast, weather forecasters said. The typhoon would lose power once it hits land, said Kaohsiung Mayor Chen Chi-mai, but would still bring intense winds and rain. 'But if it moves north, the winds will strengthen again, so the threat to Kaohsiung will continue to exist, and people cannot take this lightly,' he told reporters. Once it hits land, the typhoon could be downgraded into a tropical depression and dissipate, which has happened only once before in Taiwan, in 2001, forecasters said. That storm, called Trami, dumped vast amounts of rain leading to massive flooding. The fire department reported one person dead, an elderly man in the eastern county of Hualien who fell from a tree, with two others missing and 70 injuries. On Wednesday, all the island's cities and counties declared a day off, shutting financial markets .TWII and cancelling domestic flights, along with 246 international ones, while more than 10,000 people were evacuated, mostly in the south and east. Typhoons often hit Taiwan's mountainous and sparsely populated east coast facing the Pacific, but Krathon is set to make landfall on its flat western plain. It is forecast to hit between Kaohsiung and its neighboring city of Tainan in the early hours of Thursday, before heading northeast up towards Taipei, the capital, the Central Weather Administration (CWA) said. 'Because of Typhoon Gaemi being quite severe earlier this year, everyone is more cautious and prepared this time around,' said sales representative Yu Ren-yu, 35, picking up sandbags at a government office, referring to July's storm that killed 11. 'First be prepared, then we can face this typhoon.' The typhoon has revived the older generation's bad memories of Thelma, prompting extra precautions, said Chou Yi-tang, a government official working in the Siaogang district home to the airport. 'We were hit directly by the eyewall,' he added, describing events almost five decades ago. 'Power was out for two weeks and no water for almost a month. It was disastrous.' More than 700 sandbags have been distributed in his district, a record for a typhoon, while authorities are making more to meet demand, Chou said. Taiwan's defense ministry said it had put more than 38,000 troops on standby. The north-south high speed rail line stayed open, but scaled back services. TSMC2330.TW, the world's largest contract chipmaker and a major Apple AAPL.O and Nvidia NVDA.O supplier, said on Tuesday it did not expect the typhoon would have a significant impact on operations. TSMC's factories are along the west coast, some in the city of Tainan.	https://www.voanews.com/a/weakening-krathon-expected-to-hit-land-early-on-thursday-/7807468.html	2024-10-02T04:43:14-07:00	
VOA EXCUSIVE: AFRICOM Chief on threats, way forward for US military in Africa	Pentagon — U.S. Africa Command chief Gen. Michael Langley is starting to reshape the U.S. military presence on the continent following the U.S. military withdrawal from Niger. Uncertainty about the next phase of the counter-terror fight in West Africa stems from America’s lost access to two critical counter-terror bases in Niger. In the east, international participants and troop numbers for the new African Union Mission in Somalia (AUSSOM) have yet to be finalized less than three months before the African Union Transition Mission in Somalia (ATMIS) ends on December 31. In an exclusive interview at the VOA on Thursday, Langley said the Islamic State in Somalia had grown about twofold and explained how al-Qaida affiliate al-Shabab had taken advantage of tensions between Ethiopia and Somalia to increase recruitment. Below are highlights from his discussion with VOA Pentagon correspondent Carla Babb, edited for brevity and clarity: On the growing U.S. partnership with Angola: AFRICOM Chief General Michael Langley: Angola has displayed their leadership across southern Africa … I’m very encouraged by the actions of Angola. With Angola and all the countries across the periphery, you have over 38 countries in Africa that have a shoreline. Economic viability is heavily dependent upon their economic exclusive zones … In the maritime and maritime awareness of some of these countries, we have a number of engagements, whether it be Exercise Obangame Express in Gabon this past summer … We have shared type objectives. They want to be able to stabilize and grow their economy through their fishing industries, but it's hampered by other countries that are going across their economic exclusive economic zones. On Chinese aspirations for a second military base in Africa: Langley: I think they do have, in my best military opinion, aspirations for another military base… We're actively watching. On Russia’s Africa Corps: Langley: As you can see, they're already in Mali. They're already in Burkina Faso and, to some degree, in Niger. They've been in CAR for a while, Central African Republic, and also in Libya. … (Wagner) has transitioned to the Russian MOD and the introduction of the Africa Corps, trying to replicate what we do best in partnering with these countries and trying to say that their security construct is better. It has proven not to be … I don't have particular numbers that they've introduced to Mali, limited numbers in Burkina Faso and also in Libya. It's in the hundreds. I'll just put it that way. It's not extensive just yet. On how the disputes between Ethiopia, Somalia and others in east Africa are affecting the war against al-Shabab: Langley: Well, it comes down to troop-contributing countries: who's going to play and who's going to be a troop contributing country in the transition from ATMIS to AUSSOM, and that starts at the end of the year. The sunset of ATMIS is 31 December, and then AUSSOM is supposed to take effect. The unknowns are who are going to be the troop-contributing countries to the AUSSOM construct…It is not finalized yet. That's the UN, that's the AU and that's the government of Somalia doing that. We're not in those discussions, but it's going to be revealed soon. I hope so. So, in the ATMIS construct, one of the anchor and frontline countries was Ethiopia. So that's what has me concerned. Ethiopia, especially in the South West State and their contributions to the liberation and stabilization, has been valuable … So time will tell if they can settle their differences and coalesce into a force that's very effective, because when they do work together, they're very, very effective at clearing out al-Shabab … There’re limited operations with the Ethiopians at this time.…Al-Shabaab leadership will try to exploit those disagreements and use that as a recruiting mechanism. VOA: We’ve heard that they've had a stronger recruitment because of that situation. Would you agree with that? Langley: Yes, I will agree with that. They have used that to their advantage. On whether U.S. forces may be needed during that transition from ATMIS to AUSSOM to try to supplement security: Langley: That's not what we're there for. We're there … helping President Hassan Mohamud be able to build his army. He's going through the force generation … all of our initiatives and our approach on the African continent, with our African partners, will be Africa-led and U.S.-enabled. So our piece of enabling is not our boots on the ground. We're there to advise and assist, and assist in the training, but the fight is theirs… That's not my mission… President Sheik Mohammed does not ask for our boots on the ground. On June comments from senior U.S. defense officials who told VOA that al-Shabab had reversed Somali National Army gains in central Somalia: Langley: I will say it ebbs and flows…They're still building the Somali National Army. So as they go on offensive operations, it is stress on the force. As they clear and liberate a region, you have to have a credible holding force there so stabilization activities and efforts can initiate and turn the populace and faith in the federal government of Somalia with the services they provide. So that's a very, that's a very fragile period. And if they can't sustain that, because they're moving to the next region or next district, it ebbs. VOA: So that was what was happening in this instance. They couldn't hold the territory that they had gained? Langley: Right. VOA: And that's where your training is coming in, to try to get them ready to be able to hold that territory? Langley: Exactly. It takes time. It’s an investment to build an army … so they have staying power, and they can also close the military and civilian divide, where the local populace will have faith in the federal government of Somalia and the national army that is there trying to hold. On why he’s 'cautiously optimistic' the Somali forces will be successful against al-Shabab: Langley: We are at an inflection point. This is unknown territory … However, when I say I'm consciously optimistic, I'm looking at the whole-of-government effort. ... Every time I go there, stabilization activities are increasing…Yes, we need a credible holding force because sometimes the shadow governments of al-Shabab try to re-insert themselves back in that region and try to influence some of the local leaders … So it goes back and forth to some of these regions, but they're being overridden by some of the stabilization activities that USAID, the biggest contributor, has put forth. On the collaboration between Yemen’s Iran-backed Houthi militants and al-Shabab: Langley: There’s probably aspirations. That’s something that we're watching closely but, you know, I will stay tight lipped on … We're concerned, and we're closely watching that, because this can turn into a bad neighborhood real quick. This is a strategic choke point on the globe…That's where a lot of our commerce goes through. It could affect our global economy if those waters don't have free flow of commerce… With the Houthis and their actions, and al-Shabab and their actions and (Somali President) HSM trying to keep them from coalescing, that can interdict the free flow of commerce across those waters of the Gulf of Aden, Bab-el-Mandeb, the Red Sea, and through the Suez Canal. On reports Islamic State in Somalia leader Abdulqadir Mumin is now the leader of Islamic State: Langley: We have to take it as credible … As far as who is the overall leader--and ISIS professes that--sometimes you’ve got to take that seriously, because that person may have an act or aspirations or put forth operations that can affect our homeland. So yes, we’ve got to take that seriously. On Islamic State in Somalia’s growth: Langley: I am concerned about the northern part of Somalia and ISIS growing in numbers, and also the possibility of foreign fighters growing there. Oh, wow ... In the past year, it's probably grown, probably twofold. Now, I won't give numbers, but I'd say it's probably, it's more than what it was last year. On whether France, the U.S. and Germany have failed the Sahel: Langley: If we look at the numbers of the global index for terrorism across the Sahel … 40% of those killed across the globe came from the Sahel. So that's concerning. It emanated from, the ideology, I would say, emanated down through Syria, through the Maghreb. Arab Spring contributed to it. The fall of Libya contributed to it. That's how that has grown and metastasized to the numbers you have today…that jihad-type ideology is preying upon the civil society, preying upon the military-aged males. We are engaging with coastal West African countries because as we look at what direction it’s metastasized, it’s on the northern regions of Cote D'Ivoire, Ghana and Togo and Benin. …They understand the enduring solution for terrorism …. it's not about kinetics. So that's why I don't just go see the militaries. I get with USAID, and we sit down with these, with these administrators that go out in the field. On the possibility of southern Libya providing a solution to the U.S. bases challenge in the fight against terror in the Sahel: Langley: We've affected the conversation… I went in and talked to both sides, the GNU and the LNA leadership, but also I want to say that this is very much in the diplomatic realm. …We need to affect unity to move forward. They are at an impasse, a political impasse, because, for us to fully be able to support building their capacity to fight terrorism, anything emanating from the Sahel, we do need them in agreement, in concert, working together as a joint force. But I will tell you, you know, there is another elephant in the room--elephant in that country--and it's the Russian Federation. And so their activities are irrespective of the law of armed conflict, irrespective of rules-based order, irrespective to human rights. So we want to be the preferred partner. We don't tell them to choose. We don't give them ultimatums, but through our actions and whatever we offer in a value proposition that protects human rights, that's mindful of the laws of armed conflict, protects the civil society … both the GNU and LNA understand that, and they have made overtures that they do want to work with us. So we're in the nascent stages, but they need to address the political impasse that they have between the east and the west. And so our State Department is working that effort.	https://www.voanews.com/a/voa-excusive-africom-chief-on-threats-way-forward-for-us-military-in-africa/7807419.html	2024-10-02T04:15:38-07:00	
South Korea's Yoon, Japan's Ishiba agree united response needed against North Korea	SEOUL — South Korean President Yoon Suk Yeol held his first telephone call with Japan's new Prime Minister Shigeru Ishiba on Wednesday and agreed a united response together with the United States is needed to counter North Korea's threats, his office said. South Korea last week welcomed Ishiba's election as the head of Japan's ruling party, saying it looked forward to the two countries continuing to improve ties and working together on security and economic issues under his leadership. Yoon told Ishiba during their call the neighbors are important partners who share values and interests and invited him to continue to communicate closely and enhance cooperation, Yoon's office said. 'The two leaders agreed that South Korea and Japan, South Korea, the United States and Japan need to unite to respond to North Korea's continued provocations,' it said. Ishiba, who was confirmed as prime minister on Tuesday, pledged to seek deeper ties with friendly nations to counter the gravest security threats his country has faced since World War Two. Yoon has made it a diplomatic priority to improve ties with Tokyo and build trilateral security cooperation together with the United States by putting years of animosity stemming from Japan's wartime history behind. Ishiba's predecessor Fumio Kishida and Yoon oversaw a newfound partnership after orchestrating an about-face in ties that had sunk to their lowest level in decades before Yoon came to office, prodded by U.S. President Joe Biden.	https://www.voanews.com/a/south-korea-s-yoon-japan-s-ishiba-agree-united-response-needed-against-north-korea-/7807399.html	2024-10-02T03:19:40-07:00

OPEC+ unlikely to change output policy	LONDON/DUBAI — An OPEC+ panel is unlikely this week to recommend any changes to its current deal to reduce production and to start unwinding some cuts from December, despite recent sharp declines in oil prices, five sources from the producer group told Reuters. Top ministers from the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries and allies led by Russia, or OPEC+ as the group is known, will hold an online joint ministerial monitoring committee meeting on Wednesday. 'Although the oil market situation is a bit complicated, I do not expect a new decision or any change to the OPEC+ agreement in Wednesday's meeting,' one of the sources said, declining to be identified. Oil prices have fallen in 2024 with Brent crude last month slipping below $70 a barrel for the first time since 2021, pressured by concern about global demand and rising supply outside OPEC+. Brent was trading near $71 on Tuesday. OPEC+ is currently cutting output by a total of 5.86 million barrels per day (bpd), or about 5.7% of global demand, in a series of steps agreed since late 2022. Its latest agreement calls for OPEC+ to raise output by 180,000 bpd in December, part of a plan to gradually unwind its most recent layer of voluntary cuts during 2025. The hike was delayed from October after prices slid. Compliance by countries with cuts will also be in focus at the meeting and in coming weeks, particularly that of Iraq and Kazakhstan which have promised so called compensation cuts of 123,000 bpd in September and more in later months to make up for past over-production. An OPEC+ source told Reuters last week that when it becomes clearer that the compensation cuts are being made in September, this will allow the December increase to go ahead as the net supply addition to the market will be minimal. However, a lack of compliance could prompt Saudi Arabia and others to unwind their cuts faster from December, analysts said. 'If they fail to comply, we can envision a swifter sunsetting of the voluntary cuts,' Helima Croft of RBC Capital said in a report. The JMMC, which groups the oil ministers from Saudi Arabia, Russia and other leading producers, usually meets every two months and can make recommendations to change policy.	https://www.voanews.com/a/opec-unlikely-to-change-output-policy/7807381.html	2024-10-02T02:46:42-07:00	
Japan's foreign minister says 'Asian NATO' is an idea for the future	TOKYO — The idea of an 'Asian NATO' floated by Japan's new prime minister is one to consider in the mid- to long-term but not imminent, the new foreign minister, Takeshi Iwaya, said on Wednesday. Asian nations have expressed skepticism and reticence in response to the call from Prime Minister Shigeru Ishiba, who took up his post on Tuesday. 'I think it's one idea for the future,' among efforts to create a multi-layered network of like-minded countries and boost regional deterrence, Iwaya told a news conference in Tokyo. 'It's difficult to immediately set up a mechanism that would impose mutual defense obligations in Asia, so it's more of a vision for the future.' In a paper to the Hudson Institute thinktank in September, Ishiba had argued for locking Washington into an 'Asian NATO' as a way to deter China from using military force in Asia. On Tuesday, Indian Foreign Minister Subrahmanyam Jaishankar countered that the South Asian country did not share the vision for an 'Asian NATO,' saying it had never been an ally of another country and took a different approach. The United States has also quietly brushed off the idea. It was too early for such talk, Daniel Kritenbrink, the U.S. assistant secretary of state for East Asia and the Pacific, said last month. Such a framework would not be aimed at any specific country, Iwaya said when asked at Wednesday's press conference whether it was targeting China. 'The best way would be for a defense and security co-operation relationship that spans the Indo-Pacific without excluding any specific nation,' Iwaya said. The new defense minister, Gen Nakatani, told a separate press conference that Ishiba had not asked his ministry to pursue a proposal to set up an Asian equivalent of NATO.	https://www.voanews.com/a/japan-s-foreign-minister-says-asian-nato-is-an-idea-for-the-future/7807372.html	2024-10-02T02:34:42-07:00	
Japan airport shut after likely WWII-era bomb explodes near runway, 87 flights canceled	TOKYO — A regional airport in southwest Japan was closed on Wednesday after a U.S. bombshell, likely dropped during World War Two to stem 'kamikaze' attacks, exploded near its runway, causing nearly 90 flight cancellations. Miyazaki Airport shut its runway after the explosion caused a crater seven meters wide and one meter deep in the middle of the taxiway next to the runway, according to a Japanese transport ministry official. A bomb disposal team from the Japan Ground Self-Defense Force later found that the cause of the explosion was an American bomb that had been buried beneath the land surface, probably dating to a wartime air raid, the official said. No injuries were reported but live cam footage showed an airplane had been taxiing nearby just two minutes before the explosion, according to local broadcaster MRT. The runway shutdown has led to the grounding of 87 flights but there is no danger of any further explosions and repair works to fill the hole should be completed by Thursday morning, said Japan's top government spokesperson Yoshimasa Hayashi. The affected flights were operated by JAL, ANA and other airlines connecting Miyazaki with cities such as Tokyo, Osaka and Fukuoka, according to the airport website. Located at the southeast end of Kyushu island, Miyazaki airport was formerly a Japanese navy base until the end of World War II, from where hundreds of young 'kamikaze' pilots set off on their final missions, according to the Miyazaki city website. Multiple unexploded bombs previously have been found at Miyazaki airport, the transport ministry official said. More than 79 years since the end of the war, unexploded bombs from the intense airstrikes are still found across Japan today. A total of 2,348 bombs weighing 37.5 tons were disposed of during fiscal year 2023, the Self-Defense Forces have said.	https://www.voanews.com/a/japan-airport-shut-after-likely-wwii-era-bomb-explodes-near-runway-87-flights-canceled/7807370.html	2024-10-02T02:27:58-07:00

Thai police arrest driver, try to identify victims of school bus fire that killed 23	Bangkok — Thai police have arrested the driver of a bus carrying young students and teachers that caught fire and killed 23 in suburban Bangkok, as families arrived in the capital Wednesday to help identify their loved ones. The bus carrying six teachers and 39 students in elementary and junior high school was traveling from Uthai Thani province, about 300 kilometers north of Bangkok, for a school trip in Ayutthaya and Nonthaburi provinces Tuesday. The fire started while the bus was on a highway north of the capital and spread so quickly many were unable to escape. Trairong Phiwpan, head of the police forensic department, said 23 bodies were recovered from the bus. The recovery work and confirmation of the total dead had been delayed earlier because the burned vehicle, which was fueled with natural gas, remained too hot to enter for hours. The families were driven from Uthai Thani in vans to the the forensic department at the Police General Hospital in Bangkok on Wednesday to provide their DNA samples for the identification process. Kornchai Klaiklung, assistant to the Royal Thai Police chief, told reporters the forensics team was working as fast as it could to identify the victims. The driver, identified by the police as Saman Chanput, surrendered Tuesday evening several hours after the fire. Police said they have charged him with reckless driving causing deaths and injuries, failing to stop to help others and failing to report the accident. The driver told investigators he was driving normally until the bus lost balance at its front right tire, hit another car and scraped a concrete highway barrier, causing the sparks that ignited the blaze, Chayanont Meesati, deputy regional police chief, told reporters. The driver said he ran to grab a fire extinguisher from another bus that was traveling for the same trip but he could not put out the fire, and ran away because he panicked, Chayanont said. Police said they are also investigating whether the bus company followed all safety standards. In an interview with public broadcaster Thai PBS, bus company owner Songwit Chinnaboot said the bus was inspected for safety twice a year as required and that the gas cylinders had passed the safety standards. He also said he would compensate the victims’ families as best as he could. Three students are hospitalized, and the hospital said two of them were in serious condition. A 7-year-old girl suffered burns on her face, and a surgeon said doctors were doing their best to try to save her eyesight.	https://www.voanews.com/a/thai-police-arrest-driver-try-to-identify-victims-of-school-bus-fire-that-killed-23-/7807333.html	2024-10-02T00:07:16-07:00

Danish police investigate two blasts near Israel's embassy in Copenhagen	COPENHAGEN, Denmark — Danish police said on Wednesday they were investigating two blasts in the vicinity of Israel's embassy in the northern outskirts of Copenhagen. 'No one has been injured, and we are carrying out initial investigations at the scene,' Copenhagen police said on social media platform X. 'A possible connection to the Israeli embassy, located in the area, is being investigated,' they said. A large area was cordoned off amid heavy police presence, according to local media reports. Investigators were seen wearing coverall suits as they combed the scene for evidence, tabloid B.T. reported. The Israeli embassy was not immediately available for comment when contacted by Reuters. Police said they will give an update on the investigation in the hours ahead.	https://www.voanews.com/a/danish-police-investigate-two-blasts-near-israel-s-embassy-in-copenhagen/7807329.html	2024-10-01T23:42:10-07:00	
Thousands march in India as doctors resume strike	Kolkata, India — Tens of thousands of people packed the streets of one of India's biggest cities after doctors resumed a strike and called fresh rallies over the rape and murder of a colleague. The discovery of the 31-year-old's bloodied body at a state-run hospital in Kolkata two months ago rekindled nationwide anger at the chronic issue of violence against women. Doctors in the eastern city went on strike for weeks in response and walked off the job again on Tuesday, saying pledges by the West Bengal state government to improve safety and security at hospitals had been unmet. They were joined on Tuesday evening by thousands of people from all walks of life for a huge protest march, with many carrying the Indian tri-color flag and some staying out until dawn on Wednesday. ‘’We want to send out the message that our protests will not end until we get justice,' rally organizer Rimjhim Sinha, 29, told AFP at the march. Kolkata is days away from the start of a festival held in honor of the Hindu warrior goddess Durga, the city's biggest annual religious celebration. Sinha said that the dozens of civil society groups backing doctors' calls for public protests would use the occasion to demand an end to violence against women. 'The festival of worshipping Goddess Durga epitomizes the victory of good over evil,' she said. 'This year it will turn into the festival of protests.' With further demonstrations called over the coming days, a senior police official told AFP on condition of anonymity that more than 2,500 extra officers had been put on active duty around Kolkata. The victim of the August attack is not being identified in keeping with Indian laws on media reporting of sexual violence cases. Her father attended Tuesday's march and told AFP that his family was still 'devastated' two months after her death. 'My daughter's soul will not rest in peace until she gets justice,' he said. Doctors had briefly returned to limited duties in emergency departments last month, only to strike again in defiance of a September order from India's top court to fully return to work. They say that the state government's promises to upgrade lighting, CCTV cameras and other security measures in hospitals have not been fulfilled. Tens of thousands of ordinary Indians took part in the protests that followed the August attack. One man has been detained over the murder but the West Bengal government has faced public criticism for its handling of the investigation. Authorities sacked the city's police chief and top health ministry officials. The gruesome nature of the attack drew comparisons with the 2012 gang rape and murder of a young woman on a Delhi bus, which also sparked weeks of nationwide protests.	https://www.voanews.com/a/thousands-march-in-india-as-doctors-resume-strike/7807323.html	2024-10-01T23:28:03-07:00

New Japan PM wants bank to be careful when raising rates	TOKYO — Japan's newly appointed economy minister, Ryosei Akazawa, said on Wednesday that Prime Minister Shigeru Ishiba expects the Bank of Japan to make careful economic assessments when raising interest rates again. 'Our top priority is to ensure that Japan completely exit from deflation,' said Akazawa in his first news conference as the economy minister. 'It will take some time to achieve the full exit.' 'Ishiba's (previous) comments on the need for monetary policy normalization have conditions attached,' said Akazawa, a close ally of Ishiba. The government wants the BOJ to share its view that the exit from deflation is Japan's top priority and to make careful decisions on whether to raise interest rates further, he said. The minister also stressed the administration would closely communicate and coordinate with the BOJ to decisively beat deflation. The BOJ raised rates in July, but kept policy steady at the September meeting, saying it could afford to spend time eyeing the fallout from global economic uncertainties.	https://www.voanews.com/a/new-japan-pm-wants-bank-to-be-careful-when-raising-rates/7807294.html	2024-10-01T22:02:43-07:00	
China files appeal to WTO on Canada's tariffs on EVs, metal products	SINGAPORE — China's commerce ministry said on Wednesday it has asked the World Trade Organization to rule on Canada's imposition of steep tariffs on Chinese electric vehicles as well as steel and aluminum products. Following the lead of the United States and European Union, Canada began imposing on Tuesday a 100% levy on EVs shipped from China, having also announced in late August a 25% tariff on Chinese steel and aluminum products. 'China has raised a litigation to the WTO over Canada's unilateral and trade protectionist measures, and will conduct anti-discriminatory probe into these restrictive measures,' the ministry said in a statement. The ministry repeated its strong opposition to the tariffs, which it says will 'disrupt and distort global industrial and supply chain.'	https://www.voanews.com/a/china-files-appeal-to-wto-on-canada-s-tariffs-on-evs-metal-products/7807260.html	2024-10-01T21:03:57-07:00	
Swiss glaciers are receding again after 2 punishing years	GENEVA — The volume of Switzerland's glaciers shrank again this summer, compounding the negative impact of climate change after a devastating two-year run that depleted the ice by more than 10%, scientific experts reported Tuesday. The cryosphere observation team at the Swiss Academy of Sciences reported that high temperatures in July and August, combined with the heat-absorbing impact of reddish-yellow dust blown northward from the Sahara Desert onto Swiss glaciers, led to a loss of 2.5% of their volume this year. The shrinkage came despite 'extremely favorable' conditions through June, the academy said, thanks to 30% more snowfall in the preceding winter compared to average levels, meaning that the glaciers had an extra layer of protective covering of snow — before temperatures rose. 'August saw the greatest loss of ice recorded since measurements began,' the academy said in a statement summarizing the findings. 'The retreat of the glacier tongues and their disintegration continue unabated as a result of climate change,' it said, adding that the 2.5% loss of volume was higher than the average levels over the last decade. Experts at the Glacier Monitoring in Switzerland network, known as GLAMOS, said that more than half of the glaciers it monitored completely lost their snow coverage throughout the summer. Several topmost measurement points on glaciers, such as Plaine Morte and Gries in the south and Silvretta in the east, recorded melt rates of a meter or more, the network said in a report for the Swiss Academy of Sciences. GLAMOS cited three factors: 'very high' average air temperatures in July and August; good weather in those months in which there was no fresh snow; and southwesterly winds in the winter and spring that dumped the Saharan dust onto the Alps, causing a warming effect on the ice. Switzerland is home to the most glaciers of any country in Europe, and saw 4% of its total glacier volume disappear last year. That was the second-biggest decline in a single year on top of a 6% drop in 2022.	https://www.voanews.com/a/swiss-glaciers-are-receding-again-after-2-punishing-years-/7807258.html	2024-10-01T20:56:15-07:00

Analysts expect strong Israel reaction to Iran attack, uncertain of wider conflict	Washington — Iran's brazen missile attack on Israel has heightened tensions across the Middle East, with some analysts predicting a powerful Israeli response. What is less certain is whether this will be a one-off exchange or ignite a series of tit-for-tat strikes that could engulf the entire Middle East in conflict. 'It could go either way,' said Shaan Shaikh, a fellow at the Center for Strategic and International Studies. 'At every exchange, the actors – Iran and Israel – have options to escalate or de-escalate. There is no predetermined path that they must choose.' James Jeffrey, a former U.S. ambassador to Turkey and Iraq, said Iran's military capabilities are more limited than Israel's. 'At the end of the day, military strength can be decisive,' Jeffrey, who served as a special envoy for Syria engagement, told VOA. In a statement released Tuesday, Iran's Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps said it crried out the attack in retaliation for the Israeli killings of three key figures: Hezbollah leader Hassan Nasrallah, Hamas political leader Ismail Haniyeh and an Iranian commander. Involving nearly 200 ballistic missiles, this was Iran's second and largest direct attack on Israel from its own territory. In April, Iran fired more than 300 missiles and drones at Israel in response to an Israeli attack on an Iranian diplomatic base in Syria. But unlike its measured response in April, Israel is expected to respond more forcefully to the latest strike. In a video statement, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said Iranian leaders made a 'big mistake' and warned that they will 'pay for it.' Why now? Prior to the latest attack, Iran's muted response to a series of Israeli strikes on Iranian officials and proxies in recent months had raised doubts about Tehran's willingness to confront a stronger adversary. That may be so, but Iranian officials could not sit back and watch one of their key allies, Hezbollah, decapitated by Israel, Shaikh said. 'They need(ed) to push back both to protect Lebanese Hezbollah and also to show to their other proxy groups and allies across the region that they will defend their interests,' Shaikh said in an interview with VOA. The Iranian strike follows Israel's ground incursion into southern Lebanon on Monday, after weeks of airstrikes that have killed more than 1,000 people in Lebanon and crippled Hezbollah's leadership. Israel has described the operation as 'limited, localized and targeted,' aimed at pushing Hezbollah forces away from the border area and eliminating its military infrastructure. Following Iran's attack in April, the Biden administration reportedly persuaded Israel to respond with restraint. Whether a similar diplomatic effort will be mounted or is desired remains uncertain. The stakes appear higher this time. President Joe Biden said he directed the U.S. military to help Israel shoot down the Iranian missiles, adding, 'Make no mistake: the United States is fully, fully, fully supportive of Israel.' Jeffrey, the former envoy, said that following the April attack, the understanding between Israel, the U.S. and Iran was: 'This is the last time, Bubba. If you do this again, there will be a serious retaliation.' The question now is how far each side will test the limit of the other's tolerance. Shaikh, the CSIS analyst, warned that the longer the conflict drags on, the more political pressure each side will face to 'engage with more firepower, and that's a concern.' Joshua Landis, director of the Center for Middle East Studies at the University of Oklahoma, said the attack gives Netanyahu 'an opportunity to deal really quite a big blow to Iran.' 'Whether he will be restrained by the United States or not, we just don't know,' Landis said in an interview with VOA.	https://www.voanews.com/a/analysts-expect-strong-israel-reaction-to-iran-attack-uncertain-of-wider-conflict-/7807226.html	2024-10-01T20:08:36-07:00	
Justice Department launches first federal review of 1921 Tulsa race massacre	WASHINGTON — The U.S. Department of Justice has launched a review and evaluation of the 1921 race massacre in Tulsa, Oklahoma, Assistant Attorney General Kristen Clarke said. The massacre started on May 31, 1921, when white attackers killed as many as 300 people, most of them Black, in Tulsa's prosperous Greenwood neighborhood, which had gained the nickname 'Black Wall Street.' In announcing the review on Monday, Clarke said the department aims to have it finalized by the end of the year. 'When we have finished our federal review, we will issue a report analyzing the massacre in light of both modern and then-existing civil rights law,' said Clarke, who oversees the Justice Department's civil rights enforcement efforts. The review will be conducted under the Emmett Till Unsolved Civil Rights Crime Act, which allows the Department of Justice to investigate death-resulting civil rights crimes that occurred on or before Dec. 31, 1979. The massacre started after a Black man was accused of assaulting a white woman. 'We have no expectation that there are living perpetrators who could be criminally prosecuted by us or by the state,' Clarke said. 'Although a commission, historians, lawyers and others have conducted prior examinations of the Tulsa Massacre, we, the Justice Department, never have.' Clarke said the department is examining available documents, witness accounts, scholarly and historical research and other information related to the massacre.	https://www.voanews.com/a/justice-department-launches-first-federal-review-of-1921-tulsa-race-massacre/7807200.html	2024-10-01T18:58:00-07:00	
Firefighters battle forest fire raging in southern Greece	ATHENS, Greece — Hundreds of firefighters and volunteers in southern Greece battled a wildfire for a third day that has killed two people and devastated a large forested area, prompting pledges of assistance from other European Union countries. Two waterbombing aircraft from Italy joined the firefighting effort late Tuesday after Greece requested help through the 27-country bloc's emergency civil protection mechanism. A third plane from Croatia was also expected. The Greek fire service said more than 400 firefighters, assisted by 22 aircraft, were engaged against the blaze in the rugged mountains of Corinthia in the Peloponnese region. The authorities were optimistic that progress had been made as the main front of the blaze was out, leaving a large number of scattered fires. However, it remained unclear whether that success could be expanded on before winds whipped up and spread the blaze again. Greece's minister for climate change and civil protection, Vassilis Kikilias, said so far up to 5,000 hectares (12,300 acres) had been affected by the blaze. 'The situation is very difficult,' he told a press conference. 'We didn't expect that at this time of year ... there would be so many wildfires and that they would be so difficult to handle.' While wildfires are common in the summer, this year the season started much earlier than usual, in April, and has extended well into the fall. The fire service said a total of 41 wildfires broke out all over the country over the past 24 hours. Government spokesman Pavlos Marinakis said firefighters had been hampered in their initial response Sunday by the difficult terrain and poor road network. 'During the first, crucial stage of the fire, firetrucks had great difficulty approaching (the blaze) because of the narrow roads,' he said. 'The many ravines and the gale-force winds blowing that day greatly impeded' the firefighting effort, Marinakis added. Officials ordered another village be evacuated as a precaution Tuesday, a day after half a dozen similar orders were issued. A major highway that was closed overnight as flames swept close by was reopened on Tuesday. The blaze destroyed a historic church in the mountains and reportedly damaged buildings outside the threatened villages, but the fire service was not immediately able to provide further details. The two victims were identified as local residents who got trapped late Sunday by the fast-advancing blaze. Greece, like other southern European countries, is plagued every summer by destructive wildfires that have been exacerbated by global warming. Over the past few months, the fire service has had to cope with more than 4,500 wildfires — which Kikilias said was the highest number ever recorded in a single fire season. This year's had been flagged as the most dangerous season in two decades after the countryside was left parched by a protracted drought and early summer heat waves. Still, Greece's big investments in extra waterbombing aircraft, warning drones and other equipment have led to most blazes being extinguished shortly after they broke out.	https://www.voanews.com/a/hundreds-of-firefighters-battle-a-deadly-forest-fire-raging-in-southern-greece/7807195.html	2024-10-01T18:50:24-07:00

Two boats carrying migrants sink in the Red Sea off Djibouti's coast killing 45, UN says	Djibouti — Two vessels carrying migrants from Africa sank in the Red Sea off the coast of Djibouti, killing 45 people, the U.N. migration agency said Tuesday. The boats had departed from Yemen carrying 310 people, the International Organization for Migration said. Thousands of migrants from African, Middle Eastern and South Asian countries seeking a better life in Europe attempt irregular migration every year. Smugglers pack vessels full of desperate people willing to risk their lives to reach continental Europe. The U.N. agency, which was assisting search and rescue efforts, said on the social media platform X that 32 survivors were rescued. Djibouti's coast guard said the tragedy struck some 150 meters off a beach near the northwest Khor Angar region. It said a joint rescue effort was under way, which began early Monday. It said 115 survivors were rescued. 'We remain committed to finding the missing persons and ensuring the safety of the survivors,' the agency said in a statement posted on social media, with images of white body bags.	https://www.voanews.com/a/two-boats-carrying-migrants-sink-in-the-red-sea-off-djibouti-s-coast-killing-45-un-says/7807190.html	2024-10-01T18:38:49-07:00	
Trump declines to be interviewed for '60 Minutes' election special	NEW YORK — CBS News said Tuesday that Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump has declined to participate in an interview with '60 Minutes' for its election special, which will go forward next Monday with Democratic opponent Kamala Harris alone. Television's top-rated news program regularly invites the two presidential contenders for separate interviews that air back-to-back on a show near the election. This year, it is scheduled for Monday instead of its usual Sunday time slot. Asked for comment, the former president's campaign spokesperson Steven Cheung said, 'Fake news,' adding that there were discussions, but nothing was ever locked in. '60 Minutes' said Trump's campaign had initially agreed to an interview before telling CBS that the former president would not appear. The network said its invitation to sit for an interview still stands, and correspondent Scott Pelley will explain Trump's absence to viewers. Vice President Harris will appear in a pretaped interviewed with Bill Whitaker. There are currently no other scheduled opportunities for voters to compare the two candidates together. Harris and Trump previously debated on Sept. 10. Although Harris has accepted an invitation from CNN for a second debate later this month, Trump has not accepted. The interview special is scheduled to air Monday instead of the usual '60 Minutes' time slot because CBS is showing the American Music Awards on Sunday. Trump's interview with '60 Minutes' correspondent Lesley Stahl prior to the 2020 election proved contentious, with the former president ending the session early and his campaign posting an unedited transcript of the session. CBS News was hosting Tuesday's vice presidential debate between Republican Ohio Sen. JD Vance and Tim Walz, Minnesota's Democratic governor.	https://www.voanews.com/a/trump-declines-to-be-interviewed-for-60-minutes-election-special/7807173.html	2024-10-01T18:21:33-07:00	
Political parties in Kurdistan Region seek female, minority candidates	washington — With a parliamentary election in the Kurdistan Region of Iraq scheduled for October 20, interest is growing among major political parties for candidates who are women or members of ethnic and religious minorities. Whatever the outcome of the election, the region's quota system has guaranteed 30 seats for women and five for Turkmen, Christians and Armenians out of a total of 100 seats in parliament. The quota system has provided an incentive for political parties, especially the Kurdistan Democratic Party (KDP) and the Patriotic Union of Kurdistan (PUK), to reach out to active members of those minority communities and women who are popular among voters. Roshna Jamil, a female candidate in Halabja city, told VOA that the quota system might secure some representation for women in parliament, but it comes at a cost of increased intervention from established political parties. 'Women should not rely on the quota system forever, because if it continues like this, political parties will nominate women as a strategy to win more seats,' Jamil told VOA. According to United Nations Women, the U.N. entity dedicated to gender equality and the empowerment of women, women's voices are missing from decision-making 'in every region of the world.' The organization said that in 2024, women held only 27% of seats in national parliaments and 35.5% of seats in local governments. In Iraq, women were largely absent from the political arena until 2004, when the country's constitution required female representation in the parliament to be not less than a quarter. But in the north of the country, the Kurdistan Regional Government (KRG) has boasted of taking bolder steps to bring women to power, such as appointing a female speaker of the parliament in 2019. Despite the progress, women would be unlikely to achieve significant representation in the parliament without the quota system. In the region's most recent election in 2018, only 13 of the 35 women who were elected received enough votes to have entered the parliament without it. According to the Irbil-based Middle East Research Institute, the lack of support for female candidates is related to 'the progress of gender equality in Kurdistan overall.' Haider Nimat, head of the PUK electoral department in Sharazoor, told VOA the nomination of more capable women to run for political positions will help narrow the gender gap in the region, adding, 'We want to provide an opportunity to them … and we are giving more importance to those who can win a seat on their own.' According to data provided by Iraq's Independent High Electoral Commission, nearly 2.9 million people from the region's four provinces are eligible to vote in the election. The total number of candidates is 1,191 people — 368 of them women. For Jamil in Halabja, the campaign period is a good time to raise awareness of women's rights. She said her message for voters was to trust female candidates because 'there are dozens of women who are more capable than men to govern.' She told VOA, 'As a woman, I have come to compete with all candidates regardless of their gender. I'm not settling for the quota system which, I think, is only a temporary solution.' Sazgin Muslih, a Turkmen minority candidate running to win a seat in Kifri town for the Iraqi Turkmen Front, shared Jamil's frustration about political involvement from the PUK and the KDP, which he said have more resources to help their preferred candidates win. 'We want the Kurdish parties not to interfere in the affairs of the [minority] communities, although these parties support their own candidates,' he said. 'If the Kurdish parties do not interfere, 80% of the Turkmen of Kifri are with us.' In its first election in 1992, the Kurdistan Regional Parliament allocated five quota seats for Christians. In 2005, that quota increased to 11 seats for Christians, Turkmen and Assyrians. However, the Iraqi Federal Court in a surprise move in February abolished all the seats following a complaint by the PUK, which had argued that the KDP controlled minority parties in the parliament. The Iraqi high court decision prompted a political boycott from the minority parties and the KDP that lasted until late May when the court decision was reversed, and five seats were returned to the system. This story originated in VOA's Kurdish Service.	https://www.voanews.com/a/political-parties-in-kurdistan-region-seek-female-minority-candidates/7807125.html	2024-10-01T17:54:29-07:00	
Australia's online dating industry agrees to code of conduct to protect users	MELBOURNE, Australia — A code of conduct will be enforced on the online dating industry to better protect Australian users after research found that three-in-four people suffer some form of sexual violence through the platforms, Australia's government said on Tuesday. Bumble, Grindr and Match Group Inc., a Texas-based company that owns platforms including Tinder, Hinge, OKCupid and Plenty of Fish, have agreed to the code that took effect on Tuesday, Communications Minister Michelle Rowland said. The platforms, which account for 75% of the industry in Australia, have until April 1 to implement the changes before they are strictly enforced, Rowland said. The code requires the platforms' systems to detect potential incidents of online-enabled harm and demands that the accounts of some offenders are terminated. Complaint and reporting mechanisms are to be made prominent and transparent. A new rating system will show users how well platforms are meeting their obligations under the code. The government called for a code of conduct last year after the Australian Institute of Criminology research found that three-in-four users of dating apps or websites had experienced some form of sexual violence through these platforms in the five years through 2021. 'There needs to be a complaint-handling process. This is a pretty basic feature that Australians would have expected in the first place,' Rowland said on Tuesday. 'If there are grounds to ban a particular individual from utilizing one of those platforms, if they're banned on one platform, they're blocked on all platforms,' she added. Match Group said it had already introduced new safety features on Tinder, including photo and identification verification to prevent bad actors from accessing the platform while giving users more confidence in the authenticity of their connections. The platform used artificial intelligence to issue real-time warnings about potentially offensive language in an opening line and advising users to pause before sending. 'This is a pervasive issue, and we take our responsibility to help keep users safe on our platform very seriously,' Match Group said in a statement on Wednesday. Match Group said it would continue to collaborate with the government and the industry to 'help make dating safer for all Australians.' Bumble said it shared the government's hope of eliminating gender-based violence and was grateful for the opportunity to work with the government and industry on what the platform described as a 'world-first dating code of practice.' 'We know that domestic and sexual violence is an enormous problem in Australia, and that women, members of LGBTQ+ communities, and First Nations are the most at risk,' a Bumble statement said. 'Bumble puts women's experiences at the center of our mission to create a world where all relationships are healthy and equitable, and safety has been central to our mission from day one,' Bumble added. Grindr said in a statement it was 'honored to participate in the development of the code and shares the Australian government's commitment to online safety.' All the platforms helped design the code. Platforms that have not signed up include Happn, Coffee Meets Bagel and Feeld. The government expects the code will enable Australians to make better informed choices about which dating apps are best equipped to provide a safe dating experience. The government has also warned the online dating industry that it will legislate if the operators fail to keep Australians safe on their platforms.	https://www.voanews.com/a/australia-s-online-dating-industry-agrees-to-code-of-conduct-to-protect-users/7807134.html	2024-10-01T17:26:27-07:00	
Wildfires in California have burned 1 million hectares so far this year	LOS ANGELES — The total hectares burned in California this year surpassed 1 million as spiking temperatures Tuesday added to the challenges facing firefighters struggling to contain a stubborn blaze in the mountains northeast of Los Angeles that flared up over the weekend. Evacuation orders were expanded again Monday for remote communities northeast of Los Angeles as the Line Fire that has been burning for nearly a month spread over nearly 176 square kilometers (68 square miles) of the San Bernardino Mountains, and containment dropped from 83% to 76%. 'The dry vegetation, steep slopes and wind aligned ... to create conditions for the rapid fire spread,' according to a statement late Monday from the California Department of Forestry and Fire Protection, or Cal Fire. The risk of wildfires increased across California as an autumn heat wave scorched much of the state. Some inland areas could see temperatures up to 20 degrees above average for this time of year, according to the National Weather Service. San Francisco, where residents typically break out the sweaters in October, could hit 32 degrees Celsius (90 degrees Fahrenheit), while triple digits 38 C were predicted for Sacramento. The weather service office in the state's capital urged residents to stay indoors during the heat of the day on Tuesday. Dry, hot winds in the northern part of the state prompted Pacific Gas & Electric to preemptively cut power to small clusters of customers in high-risk areas. The utility routinely stops electricity service in counties where weather conditions increase the probability of fires. In Southern California, the Line Fire's surge pushed the total hectares burned across the state in 2024 to 405,492 (1,001,993 acres) as of Tuesday morning, according to Cal Fire. The milestone surpasses the total scorched during the same time last year — 118,719 hectares (293,362 acres) — but is roughly on par with the five-year average for the period, the Los Angeles Times reported. A 34-year-old man has pleaded not guilty to starting the Line Fire on September 5. Justin Wayne Halstenberg of Norco, California, was charged with 11 arson-related crimes, according to court records. At its height, the blaze threatened more than 65,000 homes in and around the Big Bear Lake area.	https://www.voanews.com/a/wildfires-in-california-have-burned-1-million-hectares-so-far-this-year/7807130.html	2024-10-01T17:17:16-07:00	
Guatemala arrests police officers implicated in migrant smuggling ring	GUATEMALA CITY — Guatemalan security agents arrested 25 mostly active police officers implicated in a human trafficking network that operated along a route used by mostly U.S.-bound migrants, Interior Minister Francisco Jimenez said on Tuesday. Guatemala has been a major transit country for decades for migrants from Latin America and beyond as they travel north to Mexico's border with the United States. The minister said two of the detained police officers were retired, and an additional 11 civilians were also arrested on charges including money laundering on behalf of an organization known as 'Los Rs.' Guatemalan authorities have said the group has operated for several years while accumulating millions of quetzals, the local currency. 'This organization made use of police agents, corrupting them in order to guarantee the trajectory of the people who they were trafficking across the country,' Jimenez said in a video message. The Interior Ministry noted that a prior arrest of two people who were illegally transporting 10 migrants from Uzbekistan through Guatemala had led to the operation that ultimately dismantled the network. Four vehicles, a firearm and cash were seized, the ministry added in a statement. It did not disclose where the migrants who were being smuggled came from, or where they would be sent. The U.S. Embassy in Guatemala and the U.S. Department of Homeland Security collaborated in the investigation, Jimenez added. The U.S. Embassy said on X the human-trafficking network had exploited nearly 10,000 migrants. In August, Panama launched U.S.-funded migrant deportation flights as Washington seeks to stem the flow of people traveling to its southern border, many seeking better economic conditions and security. The same month, Guatemalan and U.S. authorities announced the joint dismantling of another human-smuggling network with ties to the 2022 deaths of 53 migrants trapped in a sweltering truck in Texas.	https://www.voanews.com/a/guatemala-arrests-police-officers-implicated-in-migrant-smuggling-ring/7807123.html	2024-10-01T17:11:06-07:00

US special envoy for Taliban-ruled Afghanistan moved to different role	ISLAMABAD — The United States has reassigned its special representative for Afghanistan, leaving vacant a key position in its efforts to engage with the Taliban-ruled country. U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken announced the decision Tuesday to reassign Tom West, while emphasizing that Washington's commitment to the South Asian nation 'remains an enduring priority.' Blinken said West would serve in a new role as the acting head of the Office of Sanctions Coordination at the U.S. State Department and commended him for working 'tirelessly to ensure [that] both our national interests and the welfare of the Afghan people guided our policy in Afghanistan.' West was appointed as the special representative to Afghanistan in October 2021, two months after the Taliban regained power and all U.S.-led NATO troops withdrew from the country, ending 20 years of involvement in the war. 'Tom has skillfully led diplomacy on Afghanistan during a complex period,' Blinken said. 'Today's global challenges are equally as complex, and I look forward to working with him on coordinating economic sanctions strategies across the U.S. government with our partners and stakeholders to achieve U.S. foreign policy priorities,' he said without elaborating. The Taliban takeover compelled Washington and other Western capitals to relocate their diplomatic missions from Kabul to Doha, Qatar, where Karen Decker serves as the chief of the U.S. Embassy. Blinken said Decker has been asked to lead Afghan diplomacy. The de facto Afghan leaders have imposed their strict interpretation of Islamic law, known as Shariah, banning girls' education beyond the sixth grade, prohibiting women from most workplaces and access to public life at large across the impoverished country. Taliban leaders reject international criticism and calls for reversing bans on Afghan women's rights to work and education as interference in the country's internal matters. Blinken said that Rina Amiri, the U.S. special envoy for Afghan women's and girls' rights, would continue to lead her mission to ensure that 'human rights, and particularly women's rights, are prioritized.' Asif Durrani, who served as Pakistan's special representative to Afghanistan until last month, said that many countries, including the U.S., are frustrated with the Taliban due to their treatment of women and their lack of an inclusive government in Kabul. 'Issues such as inclusivity or human rights, particularly girls' right to education and women's right to work, are issues that the American administration cannot afford to overlook and engage the Taliban in a meaningful way,' Durrani said. But he suggested the wars in Ukraine and Gaza have diverted Washington's attention from the Afghan situation. 'It's quite obvious that Afghanistan is not on the United States' priority list, at least for the time being,' Durrani said. State Department spokesperson Matthew Miller rejected that view when asked by reporters Tuesday whether Afghanistan is still a U.S. foreign policy priority. 'Of course it is,' he said. 'And we will continue to stay engaged in Afghanistan. It remains an enduring priority.' Durrani said the U.S. cannot be blamed alone for the lack of improvement in Afghanistan. 'The Taliban's rigid attitude towards women's education and their ban on women's work is not winning them any friends or sympathy.' No country has officially recognized the men-only Taliban government in Kabul, mainly due to human rights issues and their sweeping restrictions on women's freedoms. The United States and allied nations have imposed financial and banking sector sanctions on Afghanistan since the Taliban takeover. Donors have cut economic development assistance, citing terrorism-related sanctions on several key leaders of the de facto government. State Department Bureau Chief Nike Ching contributed to this report.	https://www.voanews.com/a/us-special-envoy-for-taliban-ruled-afghanistan-moved-to-different-role/7806849.html	2024-10-01T17:00:24-07:00	
Dockworkers may have negotiating advantage in their strike against US ports	philadelphia — The 45,000 dockworkers who went on strike Tuesday for the first time in decades at 36 U.S. ports from Maine to Texas may wield the upper hand in their standoff with port operators over wages and the use of automation. Organized labor enjoys rising public support and has had a string of recent victories in other industries, in addition to the backing of the pro-union administration of President Joe Biden. The dockworkers' negotiating stand is likely further strengthened by the nation's supply chain of goods being under pressure in the aftermath of Hurricane Helene, which has coincided with the peak shipping season for holiday goods. The union is also pointing to shipping companies' record profits, which have come in part because of shortages resulting from the pandemic, and to a more generous contract that West Coast dockworkers achieved last year. The longshoremen's workloads also have increased, and the effects of inflation have eroded their pay in recent years. The dockworkers' strike, their first since 1977, could snarl supply chains and cause shortages and higher prices if it stretches on for more than a few weeks. Beginning after midnight, the workers walked picket lines Tuesday and carried signs calling for more money and a ban on automation that could cost workers their jobs. Major retailers prepared Experts say consumers won't likely notice shortages for at least a few weeks, if the strike lasts that long, though some perishable items such as bananas could disappear from grocery stores — although at this time of year, most other fruits and vegetables are domestically grown and not processed at ports, according to Alan Siger, president of the Produce Distributors Association. In anticipation of a strike, most major retailers also stocked up on goods, moving ahead shipments of holiday gift items. The strike, coming weeks before a tight presidential election, could also become a factor in the race if shortages begin to affect many voters. Pressure could eventually grow for the Biden administration to intervene to force a temporary suspension of the strike. Little progress was reported in the talks until just hours before the strike began at 12:01 a.m. The U.S. Maritime Alliance, the group negotiating for the ports, said both sides did budge from their initial positions. The alliance offered 50% raises over the six-year life of the contract. Comments from the union's leadership had briefly suggested a move to 61.5%, but the union has since signaled that it's sticking with its initial demand for a 77% pay increase over six years. In early picketing, workers outside the Port of Philadelphia walked in a circle, chanting, 'No work without a fair contract.' The union posted message boards on the side of a truck reading: 'Automation Hurts Families: ILA Stands for Job Protection.' Boise Butler, president of the union local, asserted that the workers want a contract that doesn't allow for the automation of their jobs. The shipping companies, he argued, made billions during the pandemic by charging high prices. 'Now,' Butler said, 'we want them to pay back. They're going to pay back.' And in New Orleans, Henry Glover Jr., a fourth-generation dockworker who is president of the union local, says he can recall the days when longshoremen unloaded 150-pound sacks of sugar by hand. He acknowledges that machinery has made the job easier, but he worries that the ports need fewer people to handle the equipment. 'Automation could be good, but they're using it to kill jobs,' Glover said. 'We don't want them to implement anything that would take our jobs out.' William Brucher, an assistant professor of labor studies and employment relations at Rutgers University, noted that 'this is a very opportune time' for striking workers. The contract agreement reached last year with West Coast dockworkers, who are represented by a different union, shows that 'higher wages are definitely possible' for the longshoremen and has enhanced their bargaining power, Brucher said. Biden's options Under the Taft-Hartley Act, Biden could seek a court order for an 80-day cooling-off period that would end the strike at least temporarily, but he has told reporters that he wouldn't take that step. The administration could risk losing union support if it exercised such power, which experts say could be particularly detrimental for Democrats ahead of next month's election. On Tuesday, the White House continued to ask the alliance to negotiate a fair contract that reflects the longshoremen's contribution to the economy. 'As our nation climbs out of the aftermath of Hurricane Helene,' Biden said in a statement, 'dockworkers will play an essential role in getting communities the resources they need. Now is not the time for ocean carriers to refuse to negotiate a fair wage for these essential workers while raking in record profits.'	https://www.voanews.com/a/dockworkers-may-have-negotiating-advantage-in-their-strike-against-us-ports-/7806846.html	2024-10-01T16:53:12-07:00	
Trump rallies in battleground state of Wisconsin before VP debate	WAUNAKEE, Wisconsin — Former President Donald Trump spent more than an hour ahead of Tuesday night's vice presidential debate campaigning in a Democratic county crucial to Kamala Harris' hopes for winning the key battleground state of Wisconsin. Republican Trump appeared at a manufacturing facility in Waunakee, a suburb of Wisconsin's capital city of Madison in the Democratic stronghold of Dane County. Trump had never campaigned in Dane County nor visited as president. In an event advertised as economic-themed, Trump bounced from subject to subject, also taking on Democratic nominee Harris on issues, including foreign policy, crime and immigration, while intermittently pivoting to criticism of outgoing President Joe Biden. 'I'm asking every citizen to join me in launching sort of a new golden age for America,' Trump told hundreds inside Dane Manufacturing, a metal fabricator that has a long history of hosting Republican candidates and officeholders. Trump also could not pass up a jab at former President Jimmy Carter on the Georgia Democrat's 100th birthday. With hollow praise, Trump declared the one-term Carter 'the happiest man' because he 'is considered a brilliant president' compared with Biden. Trump did not note Carter's birthday, nor his status as the longest-living former president. Later Tuesday, Trump was to hold an event at a museum in Milwaukee, Wisconsin's largest city and home to the state's largest number of Democratic voters and second-largest number of Republicans. His appearance there was also meant to give him reach into the city's conservative suburbs, a part of Wisconsin where his support has softened but where he must do well to win. In Milwaukee, Trump was slated to speak in a small auditorium at Discovery World, a science museum along Lake Michigan's lakefront. His event was not open to the public and his audience was to consist only of news media. Last Saturday, he held a rally in western Wisconsin where he blamed Harris for crimes committed by people in the country illegally. Both of his planned stops were ahead of Tuesday's debate in New York between Trump's running mate JD Vance, a senator from Ohio, and Democratic vice presidential nominee Tim Walz, the governor of Minnesota. Dane County, the location of Trump's first stop, is Wisconsin's fastest-growing county and an economic engine for the state, fueled by jobs in the health care and tech industries. It is also home to the University of Wisconsin. Dane County's population grew by about 30,000 people between 2016 and 2020. It has gone up by an additional 13,000 since then, based on the most recent U.S. Census Bureau estimate. That presents a challenge for Republicans, especially given that nearly 90% of registered voters in the county cast ballots in 2020. Biden won 75% of the vote that year in Dane County, beating Trump by 181,000 votes in the county while carrying the state by fewer than 21,000. Hillary Clinton beat Trump in Dane County in 2016 by 47 points, and Trump won the state by less than one point. It's a point former Wisconsin Governor Tommy Thompson said he made to Trump. In remarks to the crowd before Trump arrived, Thompson said the former president should 'go where the opposition is.' 'And, the retort was, 'Isn't Madison very liberal?'' Thompson said. 'Yes, but Dane County has the third-most Republican votes in the state of Wisconsin, and all we have to do is increase them.' Democratic presidential candidates have long come to Dane County to hold massive rallies to fire up the base. Harris campaigned there on September 20, holding a rally in Madison that attracted more than 10,000 people. Waunakee, which bills itself as the 'only Waunakee in the world,' is slightly more Republican than the county as a whole. In 2020, Trump got 36% of the vote there compared to less than 23% countywide.	https://www.voanews.com/a/trump-rallies-in-battleground-state-of-wisconsin-before-vp-debate-/7806823.html	2024-10-01T16:32:35-07:00	
Hurricane damage creates uncertainty about how voters will cast ballots in swing state	ASHEVILLE, North Carolina — North Carolina election officials say they will do everything in their power to ensure that voters in the crucial presidential swing state will be able to cast their ballots despite the devastation of Hurricane Helene and the destruction of basic infrastructure only about a month before the November election. Karen Brinson Bell, the executive director of the state's election board, said Tuesday that 12 county election offices in the hard-hit western part of the state remain closed after the storm unleashed 'unprecedented' damage. Absentee ballots, some of which already have been mailed to voters who requested them, also face obstacles, from U.S. Postal Service delays to road and residential damage that could render them undeliverable. The viability of early and Election Day voting sites remains unknown, she said. She described the storm as causing a 'daunting' level of uncertainty, with early in-person voting scheduled to start in just over two weeks, on October 17. Still, she said the state is prepared to help voters navigate the emergency. 'We've battled through hurricanes and tropical storms and still held safe and secure elections, and we will do everything in our power to do so again,' Brinson Bell told reporters during a media call. 'Mountain people are strong, and the election people who serve them are resilient and tough, too.' Helene, which battered large swaths of the Southeast late last week with torrential rain and strong winds and massive storm surges along the Gulf Coast, caused devastation 'beyond belief' in the popular mountain city of Asheville and other parts of western North Carolina, Governor Roy Cooper said during a media briefing Tuesday. 'This disaster is unlike anything our state has ever experienced,' he said. The level of destruction could have far-reaching implications beyond the immediate damage to the flooded communities, especially if it has any impact on voting. North Carolina is among seven swing states being hotly contested by Vice President Kamala Harris, the Democratic nominee, and former President Donald Trump, the Republican nominee. Trump barely defeated Democrat Joe Biden in the state four years ago, winning by about 74,500 votes out of 5.5 million cast. Asheville is the most populous city in the 25-county region under a disaster declaration and sits in the one county — Buncombe — where registered Democrats outnumber Republicans. Michael Bitzer, a politics professor at Catawba College in Salisbury, North Carolina, said the disaster area includes 'significant blue dots in a very red sea,' making it difficult to predict how the storm might affect voter turnout and election results. On Tuesday, emergency workers were still engaged in rescue efforts across the broad swath of the Southeastern U.S. that bore the brunt of the storm. Election officials in Florida, Tennessee and Georgia were assessing the damage and the potential impacts to mail balloting, early voting and Election Day operations. Georgia election workers have returned to work even as some offices face power outages, limited internet and infrastructure damage. Absentee ballots are scheduled to go out on October 7 as planned, said Robert Sinners, communications director for Georgia's secretary of state. In Tennessee, two county election offices had water damage, and at least six polling locations in the northeastern part of the state have been damaged or are inaccessible, said Doug Kufner, spokesman for the secretary of state's office. North Carolina officials said they are considering moving or combining voting locations if some are unusable or inaccessible. More urgently, state officials are offering guidance and some special accommodations for absentee voters, who may not receive their ballots because of evacuations, suspended Postal Service operations or residential mailboxes swept away in the storm. Paul Cox, general counsel for the North Carolina State Board of Elections, said displaced voters can contact their county election office to request that their absentee ballot be spoiled and sent to a different location. Those voters also have the option of waiting to cast a ballot in person, either during the early voting period of October 17 to November 2 or on Election Day, November 5, Cox said. State law requires all voters to show voter ID, but those who are from a county under a disaster declaration and have lost their ID can fill out an exception form so they can cast a ballot. Officials are still weighing whether to take further steps to accommodate voters, such as extending the absentee ballot deadline or allowing more people to cast ballots through an online portal already used by military, overseas and visually impaired voters, Brinson Bell said. Some of the county boards whose offices remain closed or are dealing with outages have been given special emergency kits from the state, which were initially intended for use in case of a ransomware attack, Brinson Bell said. The kits are equipped with laptops, cellphones, Wi-Fi hotspots and other essentials to allow election operations to continue even without power, phone or internet service. Kelly Godfrey, who has lived in Asheville for more than three years, is one of the few voters who returned their absentee ballot before the storm hit. In Buncombe County, which includes Asheville, nearly 9,990 voters had requested absentee ballots as of Tuesday — 85% of them Democrats or voters who are not affiliated with any party, according to Associated Press election research. Only about 170 had been returned. Godfrey said she hopes rules and procedures will be adjusted to make it easier for voters who were displaced by the storm. But she also worries that any changes could lead to misinformation and false claims of voter fraud after the election. 'It's going to be spun a lot of different ways,' she said. For now, though, voting feels 'so far out in the distance,' Godfrey said. 'Right now, people are thinking food and water.'	https://www.voanews.com/a/hurricane-damage-creates-uncertainty-about-how-voters-will-cast-ballots-in-swing-state/7806790.html	2024-10-01T16:30:09-07:00	
Amid struggling economy, Nigeria downplays anniversary festivities	Abuja, Nigeria — Nigeria Tuesday marked the 64th anniversary of its independence in a generally somber mood. Persistent inflation, widespread insecurity, and unpopular economic reforms have left many Nigerians feeling frustrated and pessimistic. In comments Tuesday, President Bola Tinubu acknowledged these challenges but said that ongoing reforms will lead to prosperity. 'As your president, I assure you that we are committed to finding sustainable solutions to alleviate the suffering of our citizens,' said Tinubu. 'Once again, I plead for your patience as the reforms we are implementing show positive signs, and we are beginning to see light at the end of the tunnel.' This year's Independence Day comes amid widespread frustration. Inflation is at a record high, and the naira's devaluation has eroded purchasing power. Citizens such as Felix Chukwuemeka and Kenneth Ugwu question whether it is appropriate for the country to celebrate. 'I feel like it is not worth celebrating because of the hardship of the economy, of the country, because everybody, most of us businessmen, we are not finding it easy,' said Chukwuemeka. 'Sixty-fourth independence means that we are supposed to have been full grown, but as it stands today, we are just crawling,' said Ugwu. 'What a shame.' Many Nigerians see the economic hardships as a result of reforms championed by Tinubu, including the removal of fuel subsidies and the floating of the naira. Tinubu said Tuesday that the reforms are essential for Nigeria's long-term economic stability. Amid frayed nerves, the government toned down the usual holiday parades and displays in Abuja, holding only a small ceremony that was closed to the public. Economist Isaac Botti said a low-key celebration is justified. 'What would be the basis for celebrating independence?' asked Botti. 'I think in the best interest of the president is to even shelve any form of celebration completely because Nigerians are angry, and if it continues with this, there's going to be a public outburst that he may not be able to control.' Nigerians are also anxious about general insecurity in many parts of the country, especially in the northeast, where suspected Boko Haram militants opened fire at a market in the town of Yobe in September and killed close to 40 people. The president said his government is making progress against extremists. 'We have restored peace to hundreds of communities in the North, and thousands of our people have been able to return home,' said Tinubu. 'It is an unfinished business, which our security agencies are committed to ending as quickly as possible. As soon as we can restore peace to many communities in the troubled parts of the North, our farmers can return to their farms.' The president maintained that stability is on the horizon, and despite the current challenges, he said, the government believes Nigeria can still forge a path to a better future.	https://www.voanews.com/a/nigeria-opts-for-muted-independence-day-celebrations-amid-insecurity-struggling-economy/7806761.html	2024-10-01T15:38:02-07:00

British justice at Hong Kong's top court declines to renew term	London — Another overseas, nonpermanent judge at Hong Kong's top court, 86-year-old Briton Nicholas Phillips, has chosen not to renew his term after it ended on Sept. 30, becoming the fifth foreign judge to step down from the Court of Final Appeal this year. Phillips told VOA through his chamber, Brick Court Chambers, in an email Monday, 'I have declined the invitation to serve for a further 3 year term on the Court of Final Appeal of Hong Kong for personal and not political reasons.' According to the chamber, he would not comment further. The Hong Kong Judiciary thanked him in a statement sent to online media The Witness for his contribution to the work of the Court of Final Appeal and his support for the rule of law in Hong Kong during his tenure over the past 12 years. It added that 'the recent changes in court personnel will not affect the operation of the Court of Final Appeal.' It went on to say despite the departure of the judges this year, the majority of serving and outgoing nonpermanent judges have publicly reaffirmed their continued confidence in Hong Kong's independent judicial system and the courts' commitment to upholding the rule of law. The Court of Final Appeal is formed by the chief justice, three local permanent judges, and 10 nonpermanent judges. The nonpermanent judges include four local judges and six overseas judges. Anthony Gleeson, an 85-year-old former chief justice from Australia, did not renew his term in March, citing his advanced age. Canadian judge Beverley McLachlin also said she would not renew her term after July because she was 80 and hoped to spend more time with family. In June, two British judges, Lawrence Collins, 83, and Jonathan Sumption, 75, resigned from the court, saying it was because of the city's worsening political situation and 'profoundly compromised' rule of law. Rights activists say Hong Kong's government is using the foreign judges to lend credibility to its crackdown on rights and freedoms since Britain returned the financial hub to China in 1997. The Washington-based Committee for Freedom in Hong Kong (CFHK) Foundation issued a report in May criticizing overseas judges in Hong Kong for undermining its freedoms and called for them to quit. The foundation said it was shocked that it took Phillips so long to quit despite a series of high-profile cases targeting Hong Kong's pro-democracy groups, which prompted at least two judges to resign. Alyssa Fong, public affairs and advocacy manager for CFHK Foundation, said the more foreign judges that resign, the less the Hong Kong government can use them to justify rights abuses. 'I urge Phillips' fellow common law judges from the U.K. and Australia to immediately follow suit. It is dumbfounding that some judges continue to choose to ruin their reputations and their integrity for the Hong Kong authorities and Chinese Communist Party,' she told VOA. After Phillips' departure, six overseas judges remain in the Hong Kong Court of Final Appeal — Leonard Hoffmann and David Neuberger from Britain and William Gummow, Robert French, Patrick Keane, and James Allsop from Australia. Hoffmann, 90, has been a nonpermanent judge of the Court of Final Appeal since 1998, and his term will end in mid-January next year. Gummow's term will expire next July, while the terms of the other three Australian judges will expire in 2026 or 2027. At the end of June, Neuberger heard Hong Kong's case accusing Apple Daily newspaper founder Jimmy Lai of unauthorized assembly and agreed with the controversial verdict. Neuberger came under criticism, then resigned as chairman of an expert panel of the Media Freedom Coalition. Kevin Yam, a Hong Kong activist-lawyer now based in Australia, pointed out on social media X that Phillips could have left office on the grounds of age, but he chose to use personal reasons, which he notes would invite some speculation. 'When even Phillips does this, the four remaining Australian judges on the HKCFA stick out even more like sore thumbs,' Yam said on X. The Hong Kong government awarded Phillips the Gold Bauhinia Star in July last year and described him as 'a strong supporter of the rule of law in Hong Kong and very much a friend of Hong Kong.' Beijing agreed to uphold Hong Kong's 'one country, two systems' political structure when colonial ruler Britain transferred the city back to China in 1997. Critics say Beijing has violated that deal by forcing harsh security laws on Hong Kong that have seen independent media shut down or leave the city and dissidents face arrest or flee abroad. Beijing says Hong Kong's 2020 National Security Law was needed to maintain stability after a series of pro-democracy protests in the past decade, but has used it to arrest, jail and try hundreds of activists, stifling Hong Kong's once vibrant civil society. In March, Hong Kong lawmakers unanimously and quickly approved their own sweeping national security law known as Basic Law Article 23, strengthening the government's ability to silence dissent.

US press freedom under unprecedented pressure, report finds	washington — As a tight presidential election looms in the United States, journalist safety in the home of the First Amendment is no longer guaranteed, according to a report published Tuesday. Journalists in the United States are facing a slew of threats, including attacks by police, online harassment, violence and legal challenges, according to the report by the New York-based Committee to Protect Journalists (CPJ). The report primarily analyzes developments since 2020. 'There was a hope at the beginning of the Biden administration that things would get better for journalists. And what we've seen, actually, is that things haven't really gotten better. They've stayed the same or worsened in some situations,' Katherine Jacobsen, CPJ's U.S., Canada and Caribbean program coordinator, told VOA. The numbers paint a concerning picture. As of September 2024, assaults on journalists in the United States in relation to their work have risen by more than 50% compared to last year — from 45 to 68 assaults — according to data from the U.S. Press Freedom Tracker. 'Enemies of the people' Even though former President Donald Trump lost the 2020 presidential election, the report points to his legacy as a driving factor behind the hostile environment continuing to face journalists around the country. During Trump's presidency, he regularly referred to journalists as 'corrupt,' 'dishonest' and 'enemies of the people.' Those kinds of attacks took place — and continue to take place — within the context of record-low trust in the media in the United States, according to a 2023 Gallup poll. 'Donald Trump's treatment of the media still matters because it's very much still an issue,' said Jacobsen, who authored the report. 'It's a really effective political tactic for changing the narrative and undermining the credibility of the media.' Trump's administration also escalated prosecution of news sources, interfered in the business of media owners, and harassed journalists crossing U.S. borders, according to a 2020 CPJ report. Trump's office and presidential campaign did not immediately reply to VOA's emails requesting comment for this story. Karoline Leavitt, the Trump campaign's national press secretary, also did not immediately reply to VOA's request for comment. Meanwhile, CPJ reached out to both the Trump and Kamala Harris campaigns, asking them to sign the organization's pledge to affirm their support for press freedom. Trump's campaign did not reply, and Harris' campaign acknowledged receipt but did not sign the pledge. Consequences continue Trump hasn't been in office for nearly four years, but his tenure in the White House continues to have consequences for journalists in the United States, according to Jacobsen. 'If Donald Trump's anti-media rhetoric did not find resonance among the broader American public, then we wouldn't even be talking about it,' Jacobsen said. President Joe Biden's administration has been markedly friendlier to the press, according to the report, but Jacobsen said that hasn't translated to an improved media environment around the country. A top threat facing journalists is violence, which has steadily increased against the media over the past decade in the United States, the report said. Among the most prominent recent cases is the 2022 killing of Las Vegas Review-Journal reporter Jeff German, who was found stabbed to death outside his home. Robert Telles, a former local Nevada official, was found guilty of murdering German in late August. Although journalist killings are rare in the United States, they can have a chilling effect on the media community, according to Jacobsen. Reporters told CPJ that hostility toward journalists makes them feel less safe working in their home environments. 'The killing of journalists, especially local journalists where the reporters are working in the community, going to the same grocery stores as the people that they're writing about, creates this sense that nowhere is safe,' Jacobsen said. Incidents involving police are another issue for journalists. In a recent case, Chicago police arrested three photojournalists while they covered a pro-Palestinian protest during the Democratic National Convention in August. And four years ago, at least 459 journalists were assaulted while covering the 2020 Black Lives Matter protests, including at least 273 cases in which police targeted journalists, according to the Tracker. 'The press serves as the public's eyes and ears, and if the press is removed completely from the scene, the public's blind to what's happening on the ground,' Gabe Rottman, a senior attorney at the Reporters Committee for Freedom of the Press, said in the CPJ report. Physical threats against journalists are exacerbated by online harassment against them, according to the report. A 2022 survey by Pew Research Center found that one-third of journalists surveyed reported being harassed on social media in the previous year. With the election just over a month away, Jacobsen said it's also important to remember the Jan. 6, 2021, insurrection on the Capitol in Washington. Journalists were among the targets during the riots, with at least 18 journalists assaulted that day, according to the Tracker. But there hasn't been much accountability in those cases, according to Jacobsen, and large swaths of the American public still don't agree on what happened that day. Some journalists who were present during the insurrection say grappling with the subsequent trauma has been difficult, according to the report. 'I really do think that January 6th was a warning shot,' Amanda Andrade-Rhoades, a freelance photojournalist who was on assignment at the Capitol during the riots, said in the CPJ report. 'It was a wake-up call to the fragility of our democracy and trust in institutions — like journalism, like the government — that's been eroding for a very long time.' Jacobsen said she's worried about ramifications for the media landscape if the results of the presidential election are contested. Trump has previously said that Democrats will cheat in the election and suggested that any election in which he does not win is likely to be fraudulent. 'It's really important for journalists across the country to prepare themselves for the worst-case scenario and hope for the best,' Jacobsen said.	https://www.voanews.com/a/us-press-freedom-under-unprecedented-pressure-report-finds/7806682.html	2024-10-01T15:01:44-07:00	
Former US ‘China House’ official: Taiwan conflict not inevitable	Washington — China has been one of the most-discussed international topics during the U.S. presidential campaign. VOA spoke with Rick Waters, former head of the Office of China Coordination at the State Department and deputy assistant secretary of state for China and Taiwan, about the Biden administration's China policy. Waters spoke about his experience dealing with his Chinese counterparts, and how he thinks Vice President Kamala Harris or former President Donald Trump would handle China, if elected. This interview has been edited for clarity and brevity. VOA: How do you evaluate the progress made in U.S.-China relations after U.S. President Joe Biden and Chinese President Xi Jinping met in California last year, and do you see real, meaningful results coming from the meeting? Rick Waters: I think we have to look at this Woodside summit as the culmination of a number of things that happened in the administration. The first is that for the first period, Biden was focused on rebuilding the U.S. domestic strength and reinvigorating partnerships and alliances globally, and then from that position, dealing with China from a position of relative strength. So during that first two-year period, the U.S. China relationship was, in some ways, arguably, not the priority. It was important, but it was managed largely through leader level diplomacy, which, in China's current political configuration is the most important channel. And then we know what happened in 2022 circumstances around the visit of former Speaker of the House Nancy Pelosi [to Taiwan] led to a downward spiral, and Biden and Xi made an initial effort to stabilize relations that fall at their summit in Bali, but it only made it a few months, and then the surveillance balloon knocked things sideways again. So, I think what we have now is a little bit more stable floor built around the leader level channels, a few modest areas where there is some common work underway, and a web of senior, empowered channels at the Cabinet level, including Jake Sullivan, who try to manage conflict and competition rather within bounds, within guardrails, to avoid the scenario of unmitigated downward spiral we saw in 2022. VOA: Do you think a Chinese invasion of Taiwan is inevitable, or what should the U.S. do to deter that invasion? Waters: I don't think that conflict is inevitable, and I think at its core the U.S.’s interest is peace and stability. That's what's anchored the prosperity in the Indo-Pacific over the past couple of decades. The ability for commerce, for trade, for people-to-people flows regionally to thrive in an environment where there is no war. And so, I think if we take that as our starting point, I don't think that conflict is inevitable, but I do think that the U.S. and Taiwan are focused very much on the question of how to ensure that the leadership in Beijing never believe they have a viable military option and an acceptable cost. And if that condition holds, then I think it will fall to the diplomats and to the channels that exist between the parties to manage this issue carefully. VOA: During your career as a U.S. diplomat, what’s your experience dealing with your Chinese counterparts? What are some striking and most challenging aspects or moments that left an impression on you? Waters: I've been fortunate to deal with Chinese diplomats for the better part of 30 years. And what I will say is irrespective of what you think of China's policy or political system, they do have a very professional diplomatic corps. They've got very talented people in the system. What I think has changed over the past few decades is it's a much more disciplined system. So, it's very difficult, especially in official meetings, for Chinese diplomats to move too far off of the established line. So, I don't think that we should misunderstand the level of talent in the system when we look at it through its structural constraints. But I do think that as China's overall foreign policy has become more assertive, as you know, the leadership has talked about China playing a greater role on the international stage. It has gone through periods where the wolf warriorism, the change in tone from the podium, has characterized a different era of Chinese diplomacy than what we saw before. But I actually think, in some ways, there are plenty in the system who understand the counterproductive nature of those tactics, and I've seen a little bit of a tactical recalibration over recent years in how they express their foreign policy views publicly. VOA: In this election season, the Biden administration's China policy has often been criticized by the Republican campaign for being too weak. What is your take on that? Waters: We're in an election campaign, so obviously you're never going to hear anyone say that someone's policy is too tough. I think that the honest reality is that this election is not really, in my view, about China. It's about other issues. China is present, but if you look at how much it’s featured in the speeches at the Republican and Democratic conventions, there are issues related to China that are important, but I think we have to maintain that perspective. Second, I think that the issues that, in my view, matter most to voters center around trade and a perception of unfairness, a lack of reciprocity, and fentanyl, which for a number of years is a problem that has had a direct relationship to the producers of these precursor chemicals in China, and so I think those types of issues do matter on the margins, but they're not central to U.S. voters, particularly in the swing states that will decide this election. VOA: For the observers in China who are looking at this election, how is Harris' China policy going to be different than President Biden's, and what awaits China if Trump regains power? Waters: I think how this is playing in China is a very different story. But I think what we have to say at this point is that we're in the midst of a campaign. So, to be fair to both candidates, what we should judge is, once they form their Cabinets next spring, how will they translate political positions into new policy? I think Harris's team has expressed a general view that her policy will be consistent with Biden's. The Trump team and President Trump himself have talked about aspects of the relationship, particularly trade, where they feel that things are out of balance. VOA: Biden and Xi are likely to meet and sit down again later this year. So, what are the prospects and expectations for this meeting? Waters: It'll be a critical moment, because this meeting — which will be either on the margins of the G20 [Group of 20 largest economies] summit in Brazil [November 18-19], or the APEC [Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation] summit in Lima, Peru [November 10-16], depending on where it takes place — these meetings on the margins of summits are consequential during a presidential transition. I think they can use it as a chance to help bridge between the two administrations. That will be easier if it's a Biden-to-Harris transition, because Democrat-to-Democrat is more likely to be able to talk about how the bridging will work. But if it's, you know, Biden-to-Trump, I still think it's consequential. President Biden can give his advice about how to avoid returning to the events of 2022 [and] how they can reflect on the lessons of what has been achieved since the Woodside [California] Summit [in November 2023]. And I think you probably go into it with fairly modest expectations.	https://www.voanews.com/a/former-us-china-house-official-taiwan-conflict-not-inevitable/7806723.html	2024-10-01T14:48:56-07:00

John Amos, patriarch on 'Good Times' and Emmy nominee for blockbuster 'Roots,' dies at 84	LOS ANGELES — American actor John Amos, who starred as the family patriarch on the hit 1970’s sitcom Good Times and earned an Emmy nomination for his role in the seminal 1977 miniseries Roots, has died. He was 84. Amos' publicist, Belinda Foster, confirmed the news of his death Tuesday. No other details were immediately available. He played James Evans Sr. on Good Times, which featured one of television's first Black two-parent families. Produced by Norman Lear and co-created by actor Mike Evans, who co-starred on All in the Family and The Jeffersons, it ran from 1974-79 on CBS. 'That show was the closest depiction in reality to life as an African American family living in those circumstances as it could be,' Amos told Time magazine in 2021. His character, along with wife Florida, played by Esther Rolle, originated on another Lear show, Maude. James Evans often worked two manual labor jobs to support his family that included three children, with Jimmie Walker becoming a breakout star as oldest son J.J. Such was the show's impact that Alicia Keys, Rick Ross, the Wu-Tang Clan are among the musicians who name-checked Amos or his character in their lyrics. Amos and Rolle were eager to portray a positive image of a Black family, struggling against the odds in a public housing project in Chicago. But they grew frustrated at seeing Walker's character being made foolish and his role expanded. 'The fact is that Esther's criticism, and also that of John and others — some of it very pointed and personal — seriously damaged my appeal in the Black community,' Walker wrote in his 2012 memoir Dyn-O-Mite! Good Times, Bad Times, Our Times. After three seasons of critical acclaim and high ratings, Amos was fired. He had become critical of the show's white writing staff creating storylines that he felt were inauthentic to the Black characters. 'There were several examples where I said, 'No, you don't do these things. It's anathema to Black society. I'll be the expert on that, if you don't mind,'' he told Time magazine. 'And it got confrontational and heated enough that ultimately my being killed off the show was the best solution for everybody concerned, myself included.' Amos' character was killed in a car accident. Walker lamented the situation. 'If the decision had been up to me, I would have preferred that John stay and the show remain more of an ensemble,' he wrote in his memoir. 'Nobody wanted me up front all the time, including me.' Amos and Lear later reconciled and they shared a hug at a Good Times live TV reunion special in 2019. Amos quickly bounced back, landing the role of an adult Kunta Kinte, the centerpiece of Roots, based on Alex Haley's novel set during and after the era of slavery in the U.S. The miniseries was a critical and ratings blockbuster, and Amos earned one of its 37 Emmy nominations. 'I knew that it was a life-changing role for me, as an actor and just from a humanistic standpoint,' he told Time magazine. 'It was the culmination of all of the misconceptions and stereotypical roles that I had lived and seen being offered to me. It was like a reward for having suffered those indignities.' Early years Born John Allen Amos Jr. on Dec. 27, 1939, in Newark, New Jersey, he was the son of an auto mechanic. He graduated from Colorado State University with a sociology degree and played on the school's football team. Before pursuing acting, he moved to New York and was a social worker at the Vera Institute of Justice, working with defendants at the Brooklyn House of Detention. He had a brief professional football career, playing in various minor leagues. He signed a free-agent contract in 1967 with the Kansas City Chiefs, but coach Hank Stram encouraged Amos to pursue his interest in writing instead. He had jobs as an advertising and comedy writer before moving in front of the camera. Amos' first major TV role was as Gordy Howard, the weatherman on The Mary Tyler Moore Show from 1970-73. As the show's only Black character, he played straight man to bombastic anchor Ted Baxter. Among Amos' film credits were Let's Do It Again with Bill Cosby and Sidney Poitier, Coming to America with Eddie Murphy and its 2021 sequel, Die Hard 2, Madea's Witness Protection and Uncut Gems with Adam Sandler. He was in Ice Cube and Dr. Dre's 1994 video 'Natural Born Killaz.' He was a frequent guest star on The West Wing, and his other TV appearances included Hunter, The District, Men in Trees, All About the Andersons, Two and a Half Men, and The Ranch. In 2020, Amos was inducted into the New Jersey Hall of Fame. He served in the New Jersey National Guard.	https://www.voanews.com/a/john-amos-patriarch-on-good-times-and-emmy-nominee-for-blockbuster-roots-dies-at-84/7806557.html	2024-10-01T12:50:12-07:00	
Shooting, stabbing attack in Tel Aviv kills at least 6, Israeli police say	JERUSALEM — At least six people were killed and nine wounded in a suspected shooting and stabbing terror attack in the Tel Aviv area on Tuesday, Israeli police said. They said that two 'terrorists' started a killing spree on the Tel Aviv light rail and continued on foot before being killed by civilians and inspectors using personal pistols. The attack took place minutes before Iran launched a barrage of missiles at Israel. TV footage showed gunmen getting off at a light rail station and opening fire. Israel's MDA ambulance service said it received a report at 7:01 p.m. of people injured by gunfire. Medics and paramedics provided on-site medical treatment to a number of wounded people with varying degrees of injuries, including some who were unconscious, MDA said.	https://www.voanews.com/a/shooting-stabbing-attack-in-tel-aviv-kills-at-least-6-israeli-police-say/7806485.html	2024-10-01T11:26:04-07:00	
Dispute over Spain's past domination of Mexico reveals domestic divisions	Madrid — Among those not present at Tuesday's inauguration of Mexico's first female president, Claudia Sheinbaum, was the Spanish monarch. Sheinbaum did not invite King Felipe VI of Spain to the ceremony after the monarch did not respond to a letter demanding that he apologize for Spain's 16th century defeat of Mexico's powerful Aztec rulers. Today, a diplomatic dispute between Mexico and Spain over the event half a millennium ago is motivated more by domestic political tensions in both countries, analysts said. The issue of Spain’s colonial past has also revealed political splits within Spain’s own left-wing coalition government, observers noted. In 2019, Mexican President Andres Lopez Obrador, who is known as AMLO and is an ally of Sheinbaum, wrote to King Felipe and Pope Francis to ask them to apologize for the abuses during and after the 1519-1521 conquest. Sheinbaum said that when King Felipe failed to respond, he was not invited to the ceremony, Reuters reported. The snub to King Felipe prompted the Spanish government to say it would not participate 'at any level.' During a visit to New York last week for the United Nations General Assembly, Reuters reported that Spanish Prime Minister Pedro Sanchez ruled out participating in Tuesday's ceremony in Mexico City. 'Spain and Mexico are brotherly peoples. We cannot therefore accept being excluded like this,' he said. 'That’s why we have made it known to the Mexican government that there will be no diplomatic representative from the Spanish government, as a sign of protest.' Historic wounds Historians agree that Spain's conquest of Mexico was marked by violence. However, accounts from that time, including The True History of the Conquest of Mexico by Captain Bernal Diaz del Castillo, counter claims of cruelty while also being critical of the campaign by Hernan Cortes. Spain's government has rejected Mexico's demand for an apology for the conquest, saying the events of the past cannot be judged by the standards of today. Observers suggest that Sheinbaum’s decision not to invite the Spanish king was motivated by a current of anti-Spanish thought she shares with AMLO. Commentators said both Mexican leaders have sought to appropriate a version of history which blames the Spanish conquest for ills which afflict modern Mexico. Jos Maria Ortega, a Mexico-based analyst who has co-written The Dispute of the Past: Spain, Mexico, and the Black Legend, said: 'AMLO and Sheinbaum share the idyllic view that Mexico had existed for thousands of years when this was not the case. Mexico as it exists today won independence from Spain in 1821 after a war that spanned 11 years. 'AMLO will blame corruption, which is a problem for Mexico, on the time of conquest. This plays well with some Mexicans who are anti-Spanish but not those who are pro-Spanish,' Ortega told VOA. Analysts suggest Mexico’s first female president was interested in provoking a diplomatic row with Spain for domestic political gain. Tomas Perez Vejo, a professor at the National School for Anthropology and History in Mexico, said Sheinbaum sought to exploit anti-Spanish feelings among supporters. 'Sheinbaum is a supporter of what is known in America as woke, or the politically correct, and defends the Indigenous people. There is also a populist element in which Spain is seen as the enemy by [Mexican] nationalists,' he told VOA. 'Relations between Mexico and Spain have been complicated since AMLO came to power in 2018. But this relationship is too important in terms of trade, tourism, which have carried on as if nothing happened despite the political ill feelings,' he said. 'This latest row is not going to cause lasting damage.' European roots Both Lopez Obrador and Sheinbaum are descendants of more recent immigrants from Europe. AMLO's maternal grandfather was born in Spain and Sheinbaum's grandparents were Jews from Lithuania and Bulgaria. On the other side of the Atlantic, the dispute has revealed divisions within Spain’s minority coalition government. The Socialist-led government will not attend the inauguration but representatives of Sumar, the far-left Spanish party, which is the junior partner in Spain’s coalition, have accepted an invitation to travel to Mexico. 'Sumar is more about examining the context of history. But the Socialists do not want to do that. The polarization between parties is seen over the colonization of America,' Oriol Bartomeus, a professor of politics at the Autonomous University of Barcelona, told VOA. Some historians argue that Mexico, for three centuries known as New Spain, was not formally a colony, but an overseas territory of Spain and that its inhabitants held full rights as subjects of the Spanish crown. That argument has not dampened the drive by some Spanish politicians to call for atonement for the nation’s imperial past. Ernest Urtasun, the minister of culture who is a member of Sumar, this year announced museums would review their collections to 'overcome a colonial framework,' El Pais reported. Mexico and other nations formerly dominated by Spain have demanded the return of pre-Hispanic artifacts currently owned by museums in Europe. Ana Maria Carmona, a professor of constitutional law at the University of Seville, noted that divisions over the conquest of Mexico between the Socialists and Sumar were the latest in a series of tensions in the government. The two parties fell out over laws on sexual protection, animal rights and housing, she said.	https://www.voanews.com/a/dispute-over-spain-s-past-domination-of-mexico-reveals-domestic-divisions/7806480.html	2024-10-01T11:22:56-07:00	
UN appeals for aid for Lebanon as regional conflict looms	GENEVA — Responding to the growing humanitarian crisis in Lebanon, the United Nations and the Lebanese government launched a $426 million flash appeal Tuesday to provide emergency assistance to support 1 million people directly affected by the rapidly escalating conflict in Lebanon. 'In just the past two weeks, more than 1,000 people have lost their lives, over 6,000 have been injured, and an estimated 1 million people have been directly affected or displaced since October 2023,' Jens Laerke, spokesperson for the Office of the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs, or OCHA, told journalists in Geneva. 'I want to add that you will have seen in recent hours the reports of the beginning of an Israeli ground offensive in southern Lebanon,' he said. 'We are deeply concerned about this development. We urge all parties to prioritize the protection of civilians, adhere to international humanitarian law and engage in immediate de-escalation to prevent further loss of life and to prevent further suffering.' He said the U.N. and nongovernmental organizations already are providing food, nutrition for children, water and other basic supplies needed for 'peoples’ survival and well-being,' but the humanitarian response is insufficient to deal with the overwhelming and growing humanitarian needs. 'This appeal aims to rapidly reinforce and scale up these essential services in support of the government-led response,' Laerke said, adding that there was little time to lose. Israel launched its ground invasion against Hezbollah in southern Lebanon Tuesday morning, describing it as a 'limited, localized and targeted' operation. The action follows the detonation by Israel two weeks ago of thousands of pagers that killed many people, injured thousands and decimated Hezbollah’s leadership — raising the low simmering conflict in Lebanon to a higher, more dangerous level. 'We are gravely concerned by the widening hostilities in the Middle East and their potential to engulf the entire region in a humanitarian and human rights catastrophe,' said Liz Throssell, spokesperson for the U.N. High Commissioner for Human Rights. She warned that further deterioration of the situation 'could rapidly expand to embroil other states in the region. 'With armed violence between Israel and Hezbollah boiling over, the consequences for civilians have already been terrible,' she said. 'We fear a large-scale ground invasion by Israel into Lebanon would only result in greater suffering.' Throssell underscored the dangers of further escalation, noting that the assassination of Hezbollah leader Hassan Nasrallah 'has sent shock waves reverberating around the region.' 'I think what we have seen unfolding in recent days has added to our concerns,' especially on the impact 'of innocent children, women and men from hostilities,' she said. 'All parties to these conflicts must clearly distinguish between military targets and civilians and civilian objects in the way they conduct hostilities,' she said, adding that the warring parties must do all they can 'to protect the lives of civilians,' as well as their homes and essential infrastructure. Israel has said the offensive will continue until Hezbollah stops firing rockets at Israel and it is safe for families to return to the homes they abandoned near the Lebanon border. For Christian Cortez, head of delegation of the International Federation of Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies for Lebanon, the war raging in his country is not just a matter of statistics. It is personal. 'Just a few days ago, my wife’s brother was killed in the line of duty while rescuing others. He served with dedication in the Lebanese Civil Defense. … He leaves behind his wife and three young children, and like thousands of other Lebanese, they now face the hardships of the displacement,' he said. Speaking from the Lebanese capital, Beirut, he told journalists that his brother-in-law’s death was not just a personal loss for his family but one of 'a heartbreaking list of Lebanese humanitarian workers and civilians who have tragically lost their lives in the recent escalation.' 'His is just one of millions of stories of fear and trauma,' Cortez said. He spelled out the immense challenges facing the Lebanese Red Cross, 'which has been at the front line of the emergency response from the first day.' He said the Lebanese Red Cross is facing shortages of medical supplies, ambulances and fuel, noting that the IFRCs $65 million appeal is only 12% covered.	https://www.voanews.com/a/un-appeals-for-aid-for-lebanon-as-regional-conflict-looms/7806438.html	2024-10-01T11:12:08-07:00	
Europe hardens cease-fire calls as October 7 anniversary of Hamas attack nears	London — As the anniversary of the October 7, 2023, Hamas attack on Israel approaches, many European countries are strengthening their calls for Israel to end its assault on Hamas targets in Gaza amid growing horror at the civilian death toll. The militant attack killed 1,200 people, including Israelis and people of several other nationalities. Around 250 people were taken hostage by Hamas. The assault prompted outrage from Israel’s allies in Europe. 'This Hamas attack is terrible, and it is barbaric. In these dark hours for the Jewish state, we … stand firmly by Israel's side,' German Chancellor Olaf Scholz said in the hours following the attack. Then-British Prime Minister Rishi Sunak echoed those words of support. 'I want to express my absolute solidarity for the people of Israel. Now is not a time for equivocation, and I'm unequivocal,' Sunak said on the day following the attack. Israel’s Western allies, most prominently the United States, said the country had the right to defend itself. Israel responded with waves of airstrikes on Hamas targets and a ground invasion of Gaza. Israel officials defended targeting schools and hospitals in Gaza, saying Hamas fighters were using them as bases and to store weapons. 'Miscalculation' But soon, Western concern grew over the mounting civilian death toll, which reached 22,000 by the end of 2023, and has since climbed to over 41,000. 'I think there was a miscalculation on behalf of most Western governments — that they went all in in support for Israel early on, making it very, very difficult to find some sort of off-ramp to also tell Israel when it was wrong, when it acted excessively,' said Andreas Krieg, a Middle East analyst at Kings College London. 'As this became clearer in late 2023 and early 2024, most Western governments found it very hard to backtrack from the initial unequivocal support that they gave to Israel.' There was also global concern over the lack of aid reaching Gaza amid the devastation. South Africa brought an ongoing case of genocide against Israel at the International Court of Justice in The Hague, supported, among others, by Spain, Ireland and Belgium. An interim ruling by the court ordered Israel to 'take immediate and effective measures to enable the provision of urgently needed basic services and humanitarian assistance to address the adverse conditions of life faced by Palestinians in the Gaza Strip.' Israel insisted it operates according to international law. Negotiations to secure a truce, brokered by the United States, Egypt and Qatar, have so far failed. 'Europeans don't have the leverage that the U.S. has to actually do anything about it apart from, obviously, potentially a diplomatic statement or trying to sponsor diplomatic efforts. But if there was no coercion exercised on the Netanyahu government, nothing was going to change,' Krieg said. In Britain, a change of government in July brought a change of approach to Israel. Newly elected Labour leader Keir Starmer dropped the previous government’s plan to challenge an arrest warrant requested by the International Criminal Court against Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu for war crimes. In September, Britain announced it was suspending some arms sales to Israel. 'No contest' Bronwen Maddox, director of London-based Chatham House, said the changing British approach was felt in Israel. 'There's no question that some of these moves, for example, Britain taking more steps to express its disapproval of aspects of what Israel is doing — those are stinging in Israel. I heard a lot — I was there just really just days ago — a lot of people saying, ‘Well, if it's a competition between security and international support, we'll take security anytime. There's no contest,’' Maddox told Agence France-Presse. Germany, Israel’s second-biggest arms supplier after the United States, has been among the strongest of Israel’s allies in Europe. 'I would say the messages coming out of Germany up till now are probably the most pro-Israel of any major country in the world, even in comparison to the United States,' Krieg told VOA. However, Berlin has also suspended several arms exports licenses to Israel in recent months. 'That's likely not because there's a change of policy,' Krieg said. 'I think the German government is still unequivocally standing with Israel. But there is a concern over legal action being taken against the German government in Germany by lawyers who are saying Germany is no longer compliant with international law, by being complicit in this war,' he added. After facing missile attacks from Iran-backed Hezbollah militants in Lebanon and Houthi rebels in Yemen, Israel has widened its military operations in recent days, launching air strikes against both militant groups and a limited ground invasion across the Lebanese border. The United Nations says over 1 million people in Lebanon have been forced to flee the fighting. European nations offered Israel unequivocal support in the wake of October 7. After a year of brutal, escalating conflict, most are demanding an end to the fighting.	https://www.voanews.com/a/europe-hardens-cease-fire-calls-as-october-7-anniversary-of-hamas-attack-nears/7806434.html	2024-10-01T10:58:28-07:00

US sanctions West Bank settler group for violence against Palestinians	WASHINGTON — The United States on Tuesday imposed sanctions on Hilltop Youth, a group of extremist settlers in the Israeli -occupied West Bank who attack Palestinians and their property. In addition, the State Department placed diplomatic sanctions on two men — Israeli settler Eitan Yardeni, for his connection to violence targeting West Bank civilians, and Avichai Suissa, the leader of Hashomer Yosh, a sanctioned group that brings young volunteers to settler farms across the territory, including small farming outposts that rights groups say are the primary drivers of settler violence across the territory. The sanctions, which expose people to asset freezes and travel and visa bans, come as violence against Palestinians in the West Bank has exploded since the start of the Israel-Hamas war following the deadly terrorist attacks of October 7. Palestinians report verbal and physical harassment and restriction of movement, and they face intimidation by settlers circling their properties on motorbikes, cars or horses and spying via drones. The Treasury Department said Hilltop Youth has carried out killings and mass arson, while rights groups and Palestinians say the group is behind 'price tag' attacks — attacks on Palestinian villages in retaliation for perceived efforts to hamper settlement construction. The group may prove difficult to effectively sanction, as it is loosely organized and decentralized. In addition, Israel's finance minister has previously vowed to intervene on sanctioned settlers' behalf. In the past, sanctioned settlers said that the measures had little impact on their finances. Hilltop Youth has already faced sanctions from the EU and U.K. The Biden administration has been criticized for imposing relatively few sanctions on Israeli extremists. According to the Office of Foreign Assets Control, 27 extremists and entities have been sanctioned by the U.S. under President Joe Biden 's February 2024 Executive Order related to maintaining West Bank stability. Treasury Acting Under Secretary for Terrorism and Financial Intelligence Bradley T. Smith said that the U.S. 'will continue to hold accountable the individuals, groups and organizations that facilitate these hateful and destabilizing acts.' State Department spokesperson Matthew Miller said, 'The actions of these individuals have contributed to creating an environment where violence and instability thrive. Their actions, collectively and individually, undermine peace, security and stability in the West Bank.'	https://www.voanews.com/a/us-sanctions-west-bank-settler-group-for-violence-against-palestinians/7806212.html	2024-10-01T08:55:18-07:00

New leader of Japan says security environment 'most severe since end of WWII'	Tokyo — Japan's new prime minister, Shigeru Ishiba, said Tuesday that his nation faces its 'most severe' regional security situation in the post-WWII era, without naming any specific threats. 'The security environment surrounding our country is the most severe since the end of World War II,' he said in his first press conference after being approved as prime minister by parliament earlier in the day. Ishiba, 67, is a former defense minister who has previously called for the creation of an Asian NATO to counter China's rapid military build-up, North Korean missile launches and other security threats. 'With the Japan-US alliance as a foundation, we will expand the circle of friendly and like-minded countries, using diplomacy and defense to realize the peace of Japan and the region,' he told reporters on Tuesday. He also said he would focus on cybersecurity and the safety of Japanese people abroad and would work to fix a shortage of new troops for Japan's military. On the economy, Ishiba — who backs the Bank of Japan's exit from its maverick ultra-loose policies — said he would broadly continue the work of his predecessor, Fumio Kishida. 'The Japanese economy stands on the brink of whether to emerge from deflation. I will navigate our economy and fiscal policies by prioritizing ending deflation,' he said. Ishiba, who won a ruling party leadership vote last week, has said he intends to call a general election for October 27 to shore up his mandate. On Tuesday, he said the public and private sectors will have a shared goal for 'female participation in all decision-making scenarios at all organizations.' However, his own 20-strong cabinet announced earlier in the day includes just two women.	https://www.voanews.com/a/new-leader-of-japan-says-security-environment-most-severe-since-end-of-wwii-/7806004.html	2024-10-01T06:30:57-07:00	
NATO's new chief makes Ukraine support a top priority, says he'll work with any US president	Brussels — The new head of NATO vowed on Tuesday to help shore up Western support for war-ravaged Ukraine and expressed confidence that he can work with whoever is elected president of the United States, the alliance's most powerful member, in November. 'There can be no lasting security in Europe without a strong, independent Ukraine,' new NATO Secretary-General Mark Rutte said in his first speech on taking office, and he affirmed a commitment made by the organization's leaders in 2008 that 'Ukraine's rightful place is in NATO.' Russian President Vladimir Putin's forces are making advances in eastern Ukraine. Ukraine's army has a shaky hold on part of the Kursk region in Russia, which has provided a temporary morale boost, but as casualties mount it remains outmanned and outgunned. 'The cost of supporting Ukraine is far, far lower than the cost we would face if we allow Putin to get his way,' Rutte told reporters, a few hours after his predecessor Jens Stoltenberg handed the reins to him, along with a Viking gavel with which to chair future meetings. But Ukraine's NATO membership remains a distant prospect. Several member countries, led by the U.S. and Germany, believe that Ukraine should not join while it's fighting a war. Rutte declined to speculate about what must happen before it can stand among NATO's ranks. Rutte did single out China, and particularly Beijing's support for Putin. 'China has become a decisive enabler of Russia's war in Ukraine. China cannot continue to fuel the largest conflict in Europe since the Second World War without this impacting its interests and reputation,' he said. NATO's new top civilian official also underlined the importance of keeping the trans-Atlantic bond between the United States, Canada and Europe strong, with U.S. elections just a month away. Surveys suggest the election will be a close race. It could see the return of Donald Trump, whose bluster during his last term of office about low defense spending among European allies and Canada undermined the trust of NATO member countries. It became an existential challenge, as smaller members feared that the U.S. under Trump would renege on NATO's security pledge that all countries must come to the rescue of any ally in trouble, the foundation stone the alliance is built on. But Rutte said: 'I know both candidates very well.' He praised Trump for pushing NATO allies to spend more and for toughening their approach toward China. He also hailed the 'fantastic record' of Vice President Kamala Harris and described her as 'a highly respected leader.' 'I will be able to work with both. Whatever is the outcome of the election,' Rutte said. When pressed about Trump's commitment to the other allies, he deflected, saying only that both candidates 'understand that, in the end, the trans-Atlantic relationship is crucial, not just for Europe.' Asked whether the Netherlands, which has only just reached NATO's spending of 2% of gross domestic product on its defense budget, has set a good example to other allies, Rutte shook his head and said 'No. We should have done this earlier.' Earlier, Stoltenberg had welcomed Rutte to NATO headquarters in Brussels for the change of leadership. The two men, who first sat together at NATO's table 14 years ago as the leaders of Norway and the Netherlands, greeted each other warmly, before laying a wreath to fallen military personnel, surrounded by the flags of the 32 member countries. 'Mark has the perfect background to become a great secretary general,' a visibly emotional Stoltenberg said as he ended a decade in office. 'He has served as prime minister for 14 years and led four different coalition governments, so therefore he knows how to make compromises, create consensus, and these are skills which are very much valued here at NATO,' Stoltenberg said. Rutte said that he 'cannot wait to get to work.' Among his other priorities, he said, are to increase defense spending and strengthen partnerships that the alliance has established with other countries around the world, notably in Asia and the Middle East. After hundreds of NATO staffers applauded the two men as they moved inside to the great hall where North Atlantic Council meetings are held at the level of ambassadors, ministers or leaders, Stoltenberg helped his successor to get started by presenting him with a Viking gavel to use when chairing meetings. Stoltenberg, NATO's 13th secretary-general, took over in 2014, the year that 'little green men' from Russia infiltrated Ukraine. Moscow annexed the Crimean Peninsula, sparking a defense spending buildup at the world's biggest security alliance that gathered pace over his term. His tenure was surpassed only by Dutch diplomat Joseph Luns, who spent 12 years in charge of NATO. NATO secretaries-general run the HQ, drive the alliance's working agenda and speak on behalf of the 32-nation organization with one unifying voice. Continuity is usually the key word when they take up office.	https://www.voanews.com/a/nato-s-new-chief-makes-ukraine-support-a-top-priority-says-he-ll-work-with-any-us-president/7805996.html	2024-10-01T06:24:01-07:00

Nigerians gather to mobilize hope amid growing burden of childhood cancers	Abuja — Hundreds gathered in Abuja, Nigeria for the 2024 Childhood Cancer Awareness Walk, raising awareness and support for pediatric cancer. Despite progress in cancer care, Nigerian children face high costs and delayed diagnoses, which the walk aims to address. Titilayo Adewumi joined the walk with her 13-year-old son Shittu, diagnosed with leukemia at age 5. With support from the Okapi Children Cancer Foundation, Shittu is now cancer-free. Adewumi recounts the toll her son's cancer diagnosis took on her family. 'I had to stop working for like 4 - 5 years so I could concentrate on him,' she said. 'We went out of cash, we didn't have money, that is when the Okapi visited us ... I was so excited when the doctor told me that he was free of cancer, I felt like jumping into the roof and back I was so happy because it was not easy.' Among the walkers was Izuyor Tobi. He brought his daughter Hope, who battled neuroblastoma. Treatment costs nearly drained the family’s finances until Okapi intervened. Today, Hope is healthy. Tobi believes that spreading awareness about pediatric cancer will save lives. 'If not for Okapi Children Cancer Foundation, I don't think my daughter will be alive today... What I do is to create more awareness by telling people what Okapi Children Cancer Foundation has done for my daughter,' he said. The World Health Organization (WHO) estimates that 80% of childhood cancers occur in low-income countries like Nigeria, where many cases go undiagnosed or are detected late. Pediatric oncologist Ifeoma Ezeukwu from the Federal Medical Center explained barriers to care. 'Ignorance is also another barrier,' she said. 'I have come across so many people who will tell you, I never knew children could have cancer. ... Early detection is key to survival in childhood cancer unlike the adult cancers; children, the prognosis are better in them when they are seen early, once you capture cancer early, you know that cure is what is expected.' Kemi Adekanye founded the Okapi Children Cancer Foundation in 2017 and has been mobilizing community awareness and support. Funded by friends and family, the foundation has helped over 200 children access treatment, despite costs starting at $180. Adekanye says they’re focused on influencing government action for pediatric cancer. 'As of today, there's currently no supports being provided to children battling cancer, so we expect the government to intervene in terms of subsidizing treatment costs for children battling cancer, as well as equipping our hospitals more so people don't have to travel far and wide to access oncology centers,' she said. Health policy analyst Ejike Oji called for systemic reforms across Nigeria to ease the burden on families. 'The government should establish dedicated pediatric oncology wards across the country to provide grounds for training health care professionals to ensure their skills are good in diagnosing and treating childhood cancer,' he said. 'If you look at the cancer from diagnosis to treatment, it's a lot of money. Radiotherapy is one of the most expensive; most families cannot afford.' The large turnout at the 8th Childhood Cancer Awareness Walk — 'Bridge The Gap' —showed the power of community mobilization. Nigerians are advocating for better health care, early diagnosis and family support, ensuring no child faces cancer alone.	https://www.voanews.com/a/nigerians-gather-to-mobilize-hope-amid-growing-burden-of-childhood-cancers-/7805884.html	2024-10-01T04:54:58-07:00	
North Korean defector in South stole bus in bid to return home, media reports say	SEOUL — A North Korean defector living in South Korea was detained on Tuesday after ramming a stolen bus into a barricade on a bridge near the heavily militarized border, in an apparent attempt to get back to the North, Yonhap news agency reported. The incident took place at around 1:30 a.m. (16:30 GMT on Monday) at the Tongil Bridge in Paju, northwest of the capital Seoul, after the man ignored warnings from soldiers guarding the bridge and attempted to drive through, Yonhap said, citing city police. Paju police referred queries on the incident to provincial police authorities. The northern Gyeonggi police agency could not be reached for comment. The man aged in his 30s who had defected more than a decade ago told police that he was trying to return to North Korea after struggling to settle in the South, the report said. It is highly unusual for North Koreans who have fled their isolated country to try to return, though many struggle to adapt to life in their democratic, capitalist neighbor. As of June, around 34,200 North Koreans had resettled in South Korea, mostly after arduous, sometimes life-threatening journeys, usually via China, to escape poverty and oppression at home, according to Seoul's unification ministry. The ministry, which handles cross-border affairs and provides resettlement support for defectors, said in 2022 that about 30 defectors were confirmed to have returned to the North since 2012, but defectors and activists say there could be many more unreported cases. In early 2022, a defector in his 30s made a rare, risky return to North Korea across the heavily fortified border after struggling to cope in the South, igniting fresh debate over how such escapees are treated in their new home country.	https://www.voanews.com/a/north-korean-defector-in-south-stole-bus-in-bid-to-return-home-media-reports-say-/7805880.html	2024-10-01T04:40:19-07:00	
School bus catches fire outside Bangkok and more than 20 are feared dead, officials say	BANGKOK — A bus carrying young students with their teachers caught fire in suburban Bangkok on Tuesday, with more than 20 of those on board feared dead, officials and rescuers said. The bus was carrying 44 passengers from central Uthai Thani province for a school trip in Ayutthaya and Nonthaburi provinces, Transport Minister Suriya Jungrungruengkit told reporters at the scene. Videos posted on social media showed the entire bus engulfed in fire with huge plumes of black smoke pouring out as it stood on the side of the road. Bodies were still inside the bus hours after the fire. The students on the bus were reported to be in elementary and junior high school. Interior Minister Anutin Charnvirakul said officials could not yet confirm the number of fatalities because they had not finished investigating the scene. He said the driver survived but appeared to have fled and could not yet be found. Anutin had earlier said 25 were feared dead, but Piyalak Thinkaew, a rescuer of the Ruamkatanyu Foundation told reporters later that two more survivors had been found, reducing the number of those still missing to 23 — three teachers and 20 students. Rescuers and officials were able to access the bus hours after the fire was put out. Piyalak said they were still unable to identify the bodies, most of which were found in the middle and back seats, leading them to assume that the fire started at the front of the bus. Thai media reports and rescuers said the bus was heading to Nonthaburi when the fire started around noon in Pathum Thani province, a northern suburb of the capital. A rescuer at the scene told Suriya that the fire likely started after one of the tires exploded and the vehicle scraped against a road barrier. Prime Minister Paetongtarn Shinawatra offered her condolences in a post on social media platform X, saying the government would take care of medical expenses and compensate the victims’ families. The Patrangsit Hospital, which is located near the scene, said in a news conference that it admitted three young girls, one of whom suffered burns to the face, mouth and eye.	https://www.voanews.com/a/school-bus-catches-fire-outside-bangkok-and-more-than-20-are-feared-dead-officials-say-/7805873.html	2024-10-01T04:32:54-07:00	
Lawyer: Tunisia presidential candidate jailed for 12 years	Tunis — Tunisian politician Ayachi Zammel, a candidate in the north African country's October 6 presidential election, has been jailed for 12 years, his lawyer said on Tuesday. 'The court in Tunis sentenced Ayachi Zammel to 12 years in prison in four cases' related to voter endorsements, lawyer Abdessater Messoudi told AFP. Messoudi said Zammel 'remains a candidate in the election' on Sunday. The frontrunner is incumbent President Kais Saied, who was elected in 2019 but later orchestrated a sweeping power grab that included dissolving parliament and replacing it with a legislature with limited powers. Former lawmaker Zammel heads a small liberal party, and had been one of just two candidates approved by Tunisia's electoral authority ISIE to challenge Saied for the top post. Ahead of the vote, ISIE had rejected the bids of some 14 hopefuls. It eventually presented a final list of just three candidates — Saied, former parliamentarian Zouhair Maghzaoui and businessman Zammel. On September 18, his lawyer said Zammel had been handed a 20-month prison term for charges related to forging voter endorsements.	https://www.voanews.com/a/lawyer-tunisia-presidential-candidate-jailed-for-12-years/7805859.html	2024-10-01T04:26:05-07:00	
Chinese woman arrested in Germany on suspicion of espionage, prosecutor says	Berlin — A Chinese woman has been arrested in the German city of Leipzig on suspicion of foreign agent activities and passing on information regarding arms deliveries, the prosecutor general said in a statement on Tuesday. The suspect, named only as Yaqi X, is accused of passing on information obtained while working for a logistics company at Leipzig/Halle airport to a member of the Chinese secret service, who is being prosecuted separately, the statement said. The second Chinese national, named as Jian G, was working as an aide to Maximilian Krah, a member of the European Parliament for the far-right Alternative for Germany, when he was arrested this year on suspicion of 'especially severe' espionage on behalf of Beijing. The information passed along by Yaqi X in 2023 and 2024 included flight, cargo and passenger data as well as details on the transportation of military equipment and people with ties to a German arms company, the prosecutor general said. The Chinese Embassy in Berlin did not immediately respond to a request for comment from Reuters. Anxiety about alleged Chinese spying has risen across Western Europe recently. Beijing has denied the accusations, saying these stem from a 'Cold War mindset' and are designed to poison the atmosphere for cooperation between China and Europe. Tensions have also been simmering between Berlin and Beijing over the past year after Chancellor Olaf Scholz unveiled a strategy to de-risk Germany's economic relationship with China, calling Beijing a 'partner, competitor and systemic rival.'	https://www.voanews.com/a/chinese-woman-arrested-in-germany-on-suspicion-of-espionage-prosecutor-says-/7805844.html	2024-10-01T04:09:32-07:00	
China marks 75 years of Communist Party rule as economic challenges and security threats linger	BEIJING — China is marking the 75th year of Communist Party rule as economic challenges and security threats linger over the massive state. No festivities have been announced for the occasion Tuesday, save for a flag-raising ceremony at Tiananmen Square, with an honor guard marching from the entrance of the sprawling palace that in past centuries was the home of Chinese emperors. The entirely state-controlled media ran constant reports on China's economic progress and social stability, with no mention of challenges ranging from a declining birth rate to the disruption in supply chains that has harmed the largely export-driven economy. Commemorations were also held in the former British colony of Hong Kong and Portugal's former territory of Macao, both of which returned to Chinese sovereignty in the late 1990s in a key indication of Beijing's determination to overcome what it has called a 'Century of Humiliation.' In recent decades, China has mounted military parades and displays of the country's economic might only at the turn of decades, such as for the 60th and 70th anniversaries. The world’s second largest economy has struggled to regain momentum after the COVID-19 pandemic. A prolonged property slump led to a spillover effect on other parts of the economy, from construction to sales of home appliances. Last week, China announced a slew of measures to boost the economy, including lower interest rates and smaller down payment requirements for mortgages. Party leader and head of state Xi Jinping has largely avoided overseas travel since the pandemic, while continuing with his purges at home of top officials considered insufficiently loyal or being suspected of corruption or personal indiscretions. 'The road ahead will not be smooth, there will definitely be difficulties and obstacles, and we may encounter major tests such as high winds and rough seas, or even stormy waves' Xi warned during a banquet on the eve of the anniversary. 'We must be vigilant in times of peace, plan ahead, and rely closely on the entire Party, the entire army, and people of all ethnic groups across the country,' he said, adding 'no difficulties can stop the Chinese people from moving forward.' The anniversary also comes as China is facing growing frictions with neighbors including Japan, South Korea and the Philippines over territorial claims and their close relationships with Beijing’s chief rival, the United States. The Communists under Mao Zedong seized power in 1949 amid a civil war with the Nationalists, also known as the KMT, led by Chiang Kai-shek, who shifted their political, economic and military power to the now self-governing island democracy of Taiwan. Beijing continues to insist Taiwan must be annexed under Communist Party rule, by force if necessary, while the U.S. has provided arms to ensure its defense. China, meanwhile, has involved itself in disputes over its claims to most of the South China Sea and uninhabited islands held by Japan, the Philippines, Vietnam and other neighboring nations. China's military buildup and its recent launch of a nuclear capable ballistic missile into the Pacific Ocean have raised concerns about a possible conflict. At home, Xi has made himself effectively leader for life by ending term limits and extending his power over key government and party bodies. China allows no competitive elections and the party retains near total control over the media that informs its 1.4 billion people.	https://www.voanews.com/a/china-marks-75-years-of-communist-party-rule-as-economic-challenges-and-security-threats-linger-/7805834.html	2024-10-01T04:00:39-07:00

Taiwan warns of storm surge from Typhoon Krathon, mobilizes troops	KAOHSIUNG, Taiwan — Taiwan mobilized nearly 40,000 troops on Tuesday to be on standby for rescue efforts as powerful Typhoon Krathon approached its populous southwest coast, which is bracing for a storm surge. As the typhoon approached, helicopters lifted to safety 19 sailors forced to abandon ship when it took on water. Some flights were canceled, a rail line was closed and in the major port city of Kaohsiung, shops and restaurants shut and streets were mostly deserted. Taiwan regularly gets hit by typhoons, but they generally land along the mountainous and sparsely populated east coast facing the Pacific. This one will make landfall on the island's flat western plain. Krathon is forecast to hit Kaohsiung early on Wednesday afternoon, then work its way across the center of Taiwan heading northeast and cross out into the East China Sea, the Central Weather Administration said. Kaohsiung, home to some 2.7 million people, declared a holiday and told people to stay at home as Krathon - labeled a super typhoon by the U.S. military's Joint Typhoon Warning Center - approached. Li Meng-hsiang, a forecaster for Taiwan's Central Weather Administration, said the storm has reached its maximum intensity and could weaken slightly as it moves closer to Taiwan, warning of gusts of more than 150 kph for the southwest. 'The storm surge might bring tides inland,' Li said. 'If it's raining heavily, it will make it difficult to discharge waters and as a result coastal areas will be subject to flooding.' Kaohsiung Mayor Chen Chi-mai, speaking to reporters after a disaster management meeting, said the strength and path of the storm were both on par with 1977's Typhoon Thelma which killed 37 people and devastated the city. 'After the typhoon, the whole of Kaohsiung was without water and electricity, just like a war,' Chen said, recalling the decades-ago destruction. 'As much as possible, limit going out.' Taiwan's defense ministry said it had put more than 38,000 troops on standby, as Kaohsiung residents made their own preparations. 'It's going to strike us directly. We must be fully prepared,' said fisherman Chen Ming-huang, as he tightened ropes on his boat in Kaohsiung harbor. 'In the worst-case scenario the ropes might snap and my boat could drift away.' TSMC, the world's largest contract chip maker and a major supplier to Apple and Nvidia and which has a large factory in neighboring Tainan, said it had activated routine typhoon preparations and did not expect a significant impact to its operations. Search for sailors Off the southeast coast, Taiwan rescue helicopters lifted to safety 19 sailors from a listing cargo vessel traveling from China to Singapore, the government said. The sailors were taken to shelter on Taiwan's remote Orchid Island. The transport ministry said 88 domestic flights and 24 international ones had been canceled, with boats to outlying islands also stopped. It added that all domestic flights - 234 in total - would stop on Wednesday. The rail line connecting southern to eastern Taiwan was closed, though the north-south high-speed line was operating as normal, albeit with enhanced safety checks for wind and debris. In Kaohsiung, most shops and restaurants pulled down their shutters, and traditional wet markets shut with streets mostly deserted. At a building in Siaogang district, home to the city's airport, residents practiced how to rapidly set up metal barriers to stop water flooding into the underground parking lot. 'We will have only a few minutes to react if the flooding is coming,' said Chiu Yun-ping, deputy head of the building's residents' committee. Chen Mei-ling, who lives near the harbor, said in past typhoons high tides reached just a few meters from her house's main door and she had made preparations. 'We've got torches and emergency food supplies,' Chen said. 'It's a strong typhoon and we are worried.'	https://www.voanews.com/a/taiwan-warns-of-storm-surge-from-typhoon-krathon-mobilizes-troops/7805768.html	2024-10-01T01:58:43-07:00	
India police detain 600 workers, union members as Samsung protests escalate	CHENNAI, India — Indian police on Tuesday said they have detained around 600 Samsung Electronics workers and union members for organizing a street protest, as a strike at the South Korean firm's home appliances plant in Tamil Nadu state entered its fourth week. More than 1,000 workers have disrupted operations and protested in a makeshift tent close to the factory near the city of Chennai since Sept. 9. They have demanded higher wages and union recognition at the plant, which accounts for roughly a third of Samsung's annual Indian revenue of $12 billion. Charles Sam Rajadurai, a senior state police official, said Samsung employees and workers linked to labor group CITU, which is leading the protest, were detained as their protest march near Chennai was inconveniencing the public. 'They are being detained in four wedding halls,' he said. On Sept. 16, police detained 104 striking Samsung workers for almost a day. The protests cast a shadow over Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi's drive for foreign investors to 'Make in India' and is India's biggest such strike in recent years. Samsung has said the striking workers risk losing their jobs. Samsung did not respond to a request for comment. It previously said the average monthly salary of full-time manufacturing workers at the plant is nearly double that of similar workers in the region, and that it was open to engaging with workers and to resolve the matter. Samsung workers at the factory currently earn $300-$375 on average each month, CITU said.	https://www.voanews.com/a/india-police-detain-600-workers-union-members-as-samsung-protests-escalate/7805751.html	2024-10-01T01:05:18-07:00	
Factories reopen amid garment sector unrest in Bangladesh	DHAKA, Bangladesh — Most garment factories in Bangladesh reopened on Tuesday, a day after violent protests over a pay hike left one worker dead and several others injured, officials said. Bangladesh, one of the world’s largest garment producers and a supplier to western brands such as H&M, Zara and Carrefour, has been facing widespread protests in recent weeks, leading to the closure of dozens of factories. The protests have worsened an already significant production backlog caused by recent political turmoil and devastating floods, industry insiders said. 'Most of the factories are open today, and everything is going well so far,' said Abdullah Hil Rakib, senior vice president of the Bangladesh Garment Manufacturers and Exporters Association. He added that only five or six small factories remain closed, as they were unable to clear payments. Rakib said that unrest persists in the sector, largely due to certain groups spreading rumors and taking advantage of the worsening law and order situation. He urged the government to enhance security measures, as some factory owners are unable to operate due to vandalism and ongoing disruptions. 'Stronger security is essential to keep production running smoothly and protect our industry,' Rakib said. A labor ministry official said that a separate review committee is currently assessing the industry's capacity to revise the wage structure and is expected to submit a report soon. The government is also reviewing police cases filed against workers to ensure they are not subjected to harassment, the official added. Garment factory owners have called on the government to take immediate steps to restore order and ensure the safety of their operations, as the unrest threatens to disrupt an industry that accounts for more than 80% of the country’s export earnings. Last year, Bangladesh was ranked the third-largest exporter of clothing globally, after China and the European Union, exporting $38.4 billion worth of garments in 2023, according to the World Trade Organization. The ongoing unrest comes at a critical moment for Bangladesh, as the country’s interim government, led by Nobel Peace Prize laureate Muhammad Yunus, has taken control following the resignation of Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina. The former prime minister fled to India in early August after the deadliest violence in Bangladesh since its independence in 1971, which claimed over 700 lives. Industry leaders have warned that if the unrest continues, global brands may shift production to other countries, such as Indonesia, India, and Pakistan. 'Workers should think: if the industry doesn't survive, will they?' said a garment factory owner.	https://www.voanews.com/a/factories-reopen-amid-garment-sector-unrest-in-bangladesh/7805750.html	2024-10-01T00:57:28-07:00

Biden plans survey of devastation in North Carolina as Helene's death toll tops 130	ASHEVILLE, N.C. — President Joe Biden was set to survey the devastation in the mountains of Western North Carolina on Wednesday, where exhausted emergency workers continued to work around-the-clock to clear roads, restore power and cellphone service, and reach people left stranded by Hurricane Helene. The storm killed at least 133 people and hundreds more were still unaccounted for on Monday night, four days after Helene initially made landfall. Meanwhile, election officials across the South were making emergency preparations to ensure displaced residents would be able to vote in the upcoming presidential election. Officials in the hard-hit tourism hub of Asheville said their water system suffered 'catastrophic' damage that could take weeks to fully repair. Government officials, aid groups and volunteers were working to deliver supplies by air, truck and even mule to the town and surrounding mountain communities. At least 40 people died in the county that includes Asheville. The North Carolina death toll included one horrific story after another of people who were trapped by floodwaters in their homes and vehicles or were killed by falling trees. A courthouse security officer died after being submerged inside his truck. A couple and a 6-year-old boy waiting to be rescued on a rooftop drowned when part of their home collapsed. Rescuers did manage to save dozens, including an infant and two others stuck on the top of a car in Atlanta. More than 50 hospital patients and staff in Tennessee were plucked by helicopter from the hospital rooftop in a daring rescue operation. How some of the worst-hit areas are coping The storm unleashed the worst flooding in a century in North Carolina. Rainfall estimates in some areas topped more than 2 feet (61 centimeters) since Wednesday, and several main routes into Asheville were washed away or blocked by mudslides. That includes a 6.4-kilometer section of Interstate 40 that was heavily damaged. Joey Hopkins, North Carolina’s secretary of transportation, asked people on Monday to stay off the roads. 'The damage is severe, and we’re continuing to tell folks if you don’t have a reason to be in North Carolina, do not travel on the roads of western North Carolina,' Hopkins said at a news conference. 'We do not want you here if you don’t live here and you’re not helping with the storm.' At an Ingles grocery store in Asheville, Elizabeth Teall-Fleming was standing in line with dozens of others waiting to get inside and hoping to find some non-perishable food, since they have no power. She planned to heat up some canned food over a camping stove for her family. 'I’m just glad that they’re open and that they’re able to let us in,' she said. Teall-Fleming said she was surprised by the ferocity of the storm. 'Just seeing the little bit of news that we’ve been able to see has been shocking and really sad.' In one neighborhood, residents were collecting creek water in buckets to flush their toilets. Others waited in a line for more than a block at Mountain Valley Water to fill up milk jugs and whatever other containers they could find with drinking water. Derek Farmer, who brought three gallon-sized apple juice containers, said he had been prepared for the storm but now was nervous after three days without water. 'I just didn’t know how bad it was going to be,' Farmer said. Helene roared ashore in northern Florida late Thursday as a Category 4 hurricane and quickly moved north. The storm upended life throughout the Southeast, where deaths were also reported in Florida, Georgia, South Carolina and Virginia. Officials warned that rebuilding would be lengthy and difficult. Federal Emergency Management Agency officials said Monday that shelters were housing more than 1,000 people. North Carolina Gov. Roy Cooper took an aerial tour of the Asheville area and later met with workers distributing meals. 'This has been an unprecedented storm that has hit western North Carolina,' he said afterward. 'It’s requiring an unprecedented response.' Worries about the presidential election Karen Brinson Bell, executive director of the North Carolina State Board of Elections, said during an emergency board meeting on Monday that they are looking at options for voters in the hardest-hit counties. She planned to provide more information at a Tuesday news conference, including how someone could declare 'natural disaster' as their reason for not being able to provide a photo ID. Election employees across Georgia returned to work even as some offices faced power outages, limited internet and infrastructure damage. In Lowndes County, staff at the local board of elections were working off of two computers instead of the usual eight, said election supervisor Deb Cox. The office is also without wifi. 'We’re fully up and running as of this morning,' said Cox. 'It’s just slower than normal because we have less resources.' In Columbia County, poll worker training will still begin this week, said Nancy Gay, the county’s elections director, but she may have to change the location because of the power outage. 'Our poll workers are being affected,' Gay said. 'They don’t have power. They don’t have gas. You’ve got to allow the workers time to process everything and try and get a plan in place before I can really expect them to come and show up for training.' Mark Ard at the Florida Secretary of State’s office said the Division of Elections is recommending that local elections supervisors reach out to U.S. Post Office officials to discuss a mitigation plan for ballot mailing, delivery, and return. Why western North Carolina was hit so hard Western North Carolina suffered relatively more devastation because that’s where the remnants of Helene encountered the higher elevations and cooler air of the Appalachian Mountains, causing even more rain to fall. Asheville and many surrounding mountain towns were built in valleys, leaving them especially vulnerable to devastating rain and flooding. Plus, the ground already was saturated before Helene arrived, said Christiaan Patterson, a meteorologist with the National Weather Service. 'By the time Helene came into the Carolinas, we already had that rain on top of more rain,' Patterson said. Climate change has exacerbated conditions that allow such storms to thrive, rapidly intensifying in warming waters and turning into powerful cyclones, sometimes within hours. Destruction from Florida to Virginia Along Florida's Gulf Coast, several feet of water swamped the Clearwater Marine Aquarium, forcing workers to move two manatees and sea turtles. All of the animals were safe but much of the aquarium’s vital equipment was damaged or destroyed, said James Powell, the aquarium’s executive director. Georgia Gov. Brian Kemp said the storm 'literally spared no one.' Most people in and around Augusta, a city of about 200,000 near the South Carolina border, were still without power Monday. With at least 30 killed in South Carolina, Helene was the deadliest tropical cyclone to hit the state since Hurricane Hugo made landfall north of Charleston in 1989, killing 35 people. Tropical Storm Kirk forms and could become a powerful hurricane Tropical Storm Kirk formed Monday in the eastern Atlantic Ocean and is expected to become a 'large and powerful hurricane' by Tuesday night or Wednesday, the U.S. National Hurricane Center said. The storm was located about 1,285 kilometers west of the Cabo Verde Islands with maximum sustained winds of 95 kph. There were no coastal watches or warnings in effect, and the storm system was not a threat to land.	https://www.voanews.com/a/biden-plans-survey-of-devastation-in-north-carolina-as-helene-s-death-toll-tops-130-/7805733.html	2024-09-30T23:56:26-07:00	
Claudia Sheinbaum to be sworn in as 1st female president of Mexico	MEXICO CITY — Claudia Sheinbaum will take the oath of office Tuesday as Mexico’s first female president in more than 200 years of independence, promising to protect an expanded social safety net and fight for the poor like her predecessor, but facing pressing problems. The 62-year-old scientist-turned-politician will receive a country with a number of immediate challenges, foremost among them stubbornly high levels of violence, a sluggish economy and hurricane-battered Acapulco. Sheinbaum romped to victory in June with nearly 60% of the vote, propelled largely by the sustained popularity of her political mentor, former President Andrés Manuel López Obrador. He took office six years ago declaring 'For the good of all, first the poor,' and promising historical change from the neoliberal economic policies of his predecessors. Sheinbaum promised continuity from his popular social policies to controversial constitutional reforms to the judiciary and National Guard rammed through during his final days in office. Despite her pledge of continuity, she is a very different personality. 'López Obrador was a tremendously charismatic president and many times that charisma allowed him to cover up some political errors that Claudia Sheinbaum will not have that possibility of doing,' said Carlos Pérez Ricart, a political analyst at Mexico’s Center for Economic Research and Teaching. 'So, where López Obrador was charismatic, Claudia Sheinbaum will have to be effective.' He is not leaving her an easy situation. Her first trip as president will be to the flood-stricken Pacific coast resort of Acapulco. Hurricane John, which struck as a Category 3 hurricane last week and then reemerged into the ocean and struck again as a tropical storm, caused four days of incredibly heavy rain that killed at least 17 people along the coast around Acapulco. Acapulco was devastated in October 2023 by Hurricane Otis, and had not recovered from that blow when John hit. Sheinbaum must also deal with raging violence in the cartel-dominated northern city of Culiacan, where factional fighting within the Sinaloa cartel broke out after drug lords Ismael 'El Mayo' Zambada and Joaquín Guzmán López were apprehended in the United States after they flew there in a small plane on July 25. López Obrador has long sought to avoid confronting Mexico’s drug cartels and has openly appealed to the gangs to keep the peace among themselves, but the limitations of that strategy have become glaringly apparent in Culiacan, the capital of Sinaloa state, where gun battles have raged on the city’s streets. Local authorities and even the army — which López Obrador has relied on for everything — have essentially admitted that the fighting will only end when the cartel bosses decide to end it. But that’s only the latest hotspot. Drug-related violence is surging from Tijuana in the north to Chiapas in the south, displacing thousands. While Sheinbaum inherits a huge budget deficit, unfinished construction projects and a burgeoning bill for her party’s cash hand-out programs — all of which could send financial markets tumbling — perhaps her biggest looming concern is the possibility of a victory for Donald Trump in the Nov. 5 U.S. presidential election. Trump has already vowed to slap 100% tariffs on vehicles made in Mexico. Though that would likely violate the current U.S.-Mexico-Canada trade agreement, there are other things Trump could do to make life difficult for Sheinbaum, including his pledge of massive deportations. Things with its northern neighbor were already tense after López Obrador said he was putting relations with the U.S. embassy 'on pause' after public criticism of the proposed judicial overhaul. First lady Jill Biden struck an optimistic tone for relations with the incoming Sheinbaum administration saying at a reception Monday that, 'Under Dr. Sheinbaum’s presidency I know we will continue to build a more prosperous, safe and democratic region — and take the steps in our U.S.-Mexico partnership.' There are areas where Sheinbaum could try to take Mexico in a new direction. For example, she has a Ph.D. in energy engineering and has spoken of the need to address climate change. López Obrador built a massive new oil refinery and poured money into the state-owned oil company. But his budget commitments do not leave her much room to maneuver. Jennifer Piscopo, professor of gender and politics at the Royal Holloway University of London who has studied Latin America for decades, said Mexico electing its first female leader is important because it will show girls they can do it too, but it can also create unrealistic expectations. 'Woman firsts are powerful symbols, but they do not gain magic power,' she said. 'Especially when the governance challenges are so large, expecting magic solutions overnight can also generate outsized disappointment.'	https://www.voanews.com/a/claudia-sheinbaum-to-be-sworn-in-as-1st-female-president-of-mexico/7805717.html	2024-09-30T22:56:09-07:00	
Dockworkers from Maine to Texas go on strike, risking new shortages	PHILADELPHIA — Dockworkers at ports from Maine to Texas began walking picket lines early Tuesday in a strike over wages and automation that could reignite inflation and cause shortages of goods if it goes on more than a few weeks. The contract between the ports and about 45,000 members of the International Longshoremen’s Association expired at midnight, and even though progress was reported in talks on Monday, the workers went on strike. The strike affecting 36 ports is the first by the union since 1977. Workers began picketing at the Port of Philadelphia shortly after midnight, walking in a circle at a rail crossing outside the port and chanting 'No work without a fair contract.' The union had message boards on the side of a truck reading: 'Automation Hurts Families: ILA Stands For Job Protection.' At Port Houston, which is in the Central time zone an hour behind the East Coast, at least 50 workers gathered outside the port with signs saying 'No Work Without a Fair Contract.' They appeared poised to begin picketing. Workers showed a statement from the ILA on the strike saying that employers have refused to compensate workers fairly. 'The ILA is fighting for respect, appreciation and fairness in a world in which corporations are dead set on replacing hard-working people with automation,' the statement said. 'Robots do not pay taxes and they do not spend money in their communities.' The U.S. Maritime Alliance, which represents the ports, said Monday evening that both sides had moved off of their previous wage offers, but when picket lines went up just after midnight, it was apparent that no deal had been reached. The union’s opening offer in the talks was for a 77% pay raise over the six-year life of the contract, with President Harold Daggett saying it’s necessary to make up for inflation and years of small raises. ILA members make a base salary of about $81,000 per year, but some can pull in over $200,000 annually with large amounts of overtime. But Monday evening, the alliance said it had increased its offer to 50% raises over six years, and it pledged to keep limits on automation in place from the old contract. The union wants a complete ban on automation. It wasn’t clear just how far apart both sides are. 'We are hopeful that this could allow us to fully resume collective bargaining around the other outstanding issues in an effort to reach an agreement,' the alliance statement said. The union didn’t answer requests for comment on the talks Monday night, but said earlier in the day that the ports had refused demands for a fair contract and the alliance seemed intent on a strike. The two sides had not held formal negotiations since June. The alliance said its offer tripled employer contributions to retirement plans and strengthened health care options. During the day Monday, some ports already were preparing for a strike. The Port of Virginia, for instance, was in the process of ceasing operations. It accepted the last inbound train for delivery at 8 a.m., closed its gates to inbound trucks at noon and required ships to leave by 1 p.m. Cargo operations halted at 6 p.m. 'We are handling this just like we would during the ramp up to a possible hurricane,' Joe Harris, the port’s spokesperson, told The Associated Press. 'And we will bring it back online just as we would recovering from a hurricane. We have an experienced team. We’ve done this in the past.' Supply chain experts say consumers won’t see an immediate impact from the strike because most retailers stocked up on goods, moving ahead shipments of holiday gift items. But if it goes more than a few weeks, a work stoppage would significantly snarl the nation’s supply chain, potentially leading to higher prices and delays in goods reaching households and businesses. If drawn out, the strike will force businesses to pay shippers for delays and cause some goods to arrive late for peak holiday shopping season — potentially impacting delivery of anything from toys or artificial Christmas trees to cars, coffee and fruit. The strike will likely have an almost immediate impact on supplies of perishable imports like bananas, for example. The ports affected by the strike handle 3.8 million metric tons of bananas each year, or 75% of the nation’s supply, according to the American Farm Bureau Federation. It also could snarl exports from East Coast ports and create traffic jams at ports on the West Coast, where workers are represented by a different union. Railroads say they can ramp up to carry more freight from the West Coast, but analysts say they can’t make up the cargo handled to the east. 'If the strikes go ahead, they will cause enormous delays across the supply chain, a ripple effect which will no doubt roll into 2025 and cause chaos across the industry,' noted Jay Dhokia, founder of supply chain management and logistics firm Pro3PL. J.P. Morgan estimated that a strike that shuts down East and Gulf coast ports could cost the economy $3.8 billion to $4.5 billion per day, with some of that recovered over time after normal operations resume. The strike comes just weeks before the presidential election and could become a factor if there are shortages. Retailers, auto parts suppliers and produce importers had hoped for a settlement or that President Joe Biden would intervene and end the strike using the Taft-Hartley Act, which allows him to seek an 80-day cooling off period. But during an exchange with reporters on Sunday, Biden, who has worked to court union votes for Democrats, said 'no' when asked if he planned to intervene in the potential work stoppage. A White House official said Monday that at Biden’s direction, the administration has been in regular communication with the ILA and the alliance to keep the negotiations moving forward. The president directed Chief of Staff Jeff Zients and National Economic Council Director Lael Brainard to convene the alliance’s board members Monday afternoon and urge them to resolve the dispute fairly and quickly — in a way that accounts for the success of shipping companies in recent years and contributions of union workers.	https://www.voanews.com/a/dockworkers-from-maine-to-texas-go-on-strike-risking-new-shortages-/7805712.html	2024-09-30T22:46:46-07:00	
Exclusive: AFRICOM Chief says Islamic State doubles size in north Somalia	PENTAGON — Islamic State in Somalia has approximately doubled in size over the past year, the chief of U.S. Africa Command told VOA. 'I am concerned about the northern part of Somalia and ISIS growing in numbers,' AFRICOM commander Gen. Michael Langley said in an exclusive interview, using an acronym for the terror group. Langley declined to provide the United States’ estimate of how many Islamic State fighters are in Somalia, other than to say that the group’s had grown about 'twofold' in the past year. Previous estimates have put the number of Islamic State fighters in north Somalia at about 200 fighters. The AFRICOM commander also warned about the possibility of Islamic State increasing its foreign fighter presence in Somalia. Somali Brigadier General Abdi Hassan Hussein, the former intelligence and police commander of Puntland, where Islamic State is located in the north, told VOA earlier this year that the number of Islamic State foreign fighters there alone is estimated in the hundreds. This figure has yet to be confirmed by local authorities. A U.S. official told VOA in June that Abdulqadir Mumin, the leader of Islamic State in Somalia, had been targeted in an American airstrike in May. Mumin appears to have survived the strike. Asked whether Mumin was now the global leader of IS, Langley said the U.S. must take those reports as 'credible.' 'ISIS professes that. Sometimes you’ve got to take that seriously,' he said. Al-Shabab The increase in Islamic State fighters in northern Somalia comes as the al-Qaida affiliate al-Shabab has exploited diplomatic disagreements between Somalia and Ethiopia to raise its recruitment numbers. Landlocked Ethiopia and Somalia’s breakaway Somaliland region signed a memorandum of understanding earlier this year to use its Red Sea port of Berbera, a deal that Somalia has rejected. Somali Prime Minister Hamza Abdi Barre on Friday accused Ethiopia, before the U.N. General Assembly, of actions that 'flagrantly violate' Somalia's territorial integrity. 'The have used that (dispute) to their advantage,' Langley told VOA. Al-Shabab has been back at high numbers of between 12,000 to 13,000 fighters due to strong financing and heavy recruitment efforts, senior defense officials told VOA in June. The political rift has bled into counter-terror cooperation between Addis Ababa and Mogadishu, with Langley telling VOA that Somali operations with Ethiopia have been 'limited.' 'Time will tell if they can settle their differences and coalesce into a force that's very effective, because when they do work together, they're very, very effective at clearing out al-Shabab.’’ Al-Shabab has continued attacks on civilians, including in the Mogadishu area. The terror group claimed responsibility for a gun attack and suicide bombing that killed at least 32 people in August on a popular beach in the Somalia’s capital. The group is also suspected to have carried out two deadly bombings on Saturday, one in Middle Shabelle region and another about one kilometer from the president’s office. Al-Shabab has suffered defeats from the South West State of Somalia down to the Juba River Valley and has sought to reset and counter-attack in those areas. However, in central Somalia, al-Shabab has reversed gains made by Somali forces over the last two years as government forces failed to hold the terrain they had retaken, according to senior U.S. defense officials. 'We need a credible holding force, because sometimes shadow governments of al-Shabaab try to re-insert themselves back in that region and try to influence some of the local leaders,' Langley said. He said the time following the clearing and liberating of a region is a 'very fragile period' where Somalia and partners like the U.S. Agency for International Development can initiate local services that will increase the population’s faith in the federal government. 'If they can’t sustain that because they’re moving to the next region or next district, it ebbs,' he said, adding that U.S. training was currently focused on helping Somali forces hold liberated terrain. The Somali government has pointed to the El Dheer and Harardhere areas as evidence that some liberated terrain in central Somalia remains under government control. ATMIS transition Later this year, the African Union Transition Mission in Somalia will leave the country after nearly two years of helping Somalia fight al-Shabab terrorists and will be replaced in 2025 by a new African Union Support and Stabilization Mission in Somalia. Which forces will be comprised in the mission is still being worked out by the African Union and the United Nations. Langley ruled out any U.S. role in the transition, saying American forces would maintain only their advise-and-assist mission. 'Our piece of enabling is not our boots on the ground. We’re there to advise and assist, and assist in their training, but the fight is theirs,' he told VOA. Houthis In addition to Islamic State and al-Shabab, Somalia also must worry about Iranian-backed Houthi militants in Yemen, just north of Somalia across the Gulf of Aden, whom Langley says have 'aspirations' to collaborate with al-Shabab. 'We're concerned, and we're closely watching that, because this can turn into a bad neighborhood real quick,' he said. Should the Houthis and al-Shabab put pressure on the Gulf of Aden from opposite sides, Langley worries that squeezing this strategic choke point could further hinder the free flow of commerce and affect the global economy. And analysts fear that Houthis could insert more sophisticated weapons into the fight for Somalia. Houthi militants have targeted more than 80 merchant vessels with missiles and drones since the war in Gaza started in October, seizing one, sinking two and killing at least four sailors. Other missiles and drones have either been intercepted by a U.S.-led coalition in the Red Sea or failed to reach their targets. The Houthi militant campaign began after Israel launched a retaliatory attack against Hamas in Gaza following Hamas' October 7 terror attack, and the Houthis claim they are acting in solidarity with Palestinians during the war.

FBI to pay $22M to settle claims of sexual discrimination at training academy	WASHINGTON — The FBI agreed Monday to pay more than $22 million to settle a class-action lawsuit alleging female recruits were singled out for dismissal in training and routinely harassed by instructors with sexually charged comments about their breast size, false allegations of infidelity and the need to take contraception 'to control their moods.' The payout to 34 women dismissed from the FBI's training academy in Quantico, Virginia — still subject to approval by a federal judge — would rank among the biggest lawsuit settlements in the history of the bureau. 'These problems are pervasive within the FBI and the attitudes that created them were learned at the academy,' said David J. Shaffer, the lawyer for the women. 'This case will make important major changes in these attitudes.' Filed in 2019, the lawsuit contends that female recruits had been subjected to a hostile working environment in which they were judged more harshly than their male peers and 'excessively targeted for correction and dismissal in tactical situations for perceived lack of judgment' and subjective 'suitability.' One of the women said she was admonished to 'smile more' and subjected to repeated sexual advances. Another said an instructor leered at her and stared at her chest, 'sometimes while licking his lips.' 'Through passive tolerance,' the lawsuit said, 'the FBI has intentionally allowed the Good Old Boy Network to flourish unrestrained at the FBI Academy.' The FBI said in a statement Monday that the bureau has 'taken significant steps over the past five years to further ensure gender equity in the training and development of all our trainees.' Many of the allegations in the lawsuit were confirmed in a 2022 internal watchdog report. Men still make up some three-quarters of the bureau's special agents despite efforts to diversify in recent years. Among the provisions of the settlement was that the FBI would offer the plaintiffs a chance to continue training toward becoming agents, with 'guaranteed placement' for those who pass in one of their top three preferred field offices. The bureau also has agreed to a review by outside experts who will work to ensure that female recruits face a fair evaluation process. Some of the women have moved on to other careers, Shaffer said, adding 'the FBI has deprived itself of some genuinely exceptional talent.' Paula Bird, a lead plaintiff in the case who is now a lawyer, said that while the experience has been 'disillusioning,' she was 'pleased that this settlement will bring a measure of justice to the women who were unfairly dismissed.' The lawsuit came amid a flurry of sexual misconduct claims within the bureau that included several against senior FBI officials identified in an Associated Press investigation who quietly left the bureau with full benefits even after allegations against them were substantiated. Those claims ranged from unwanted touching and advances to coercion. In one case, an FBI assistant director retired after the inspector general's office concluded he harassed a female subordinate and sought an improper relationship with her. In response to AP's reporting, the FBI announced a series of reforms, including a 24/7 tip line, intended to take a tougher stand against agents found to have committed misconduct and help accusers. The latest settlement comes less than six months after the Justice Department announced a $138.7 million settlement with more than 100 people who accused the FBI of grossly mishandling allegations of sexual assault against the sports doctor Larry Nassar.	https://www.voanews.com/a/fbi-to-pay-22m-to-settle-claims-of-sexual-discrimination-at-training-academy/7805680.html	2024-09-30T20:24:47-07:00	
Shanghai knife attack kills three, wounds 15 others, Xinhua reports	BEIJING — Three people were killed and 15 others injured in a knife attack at a supermarket in Shanghai on Monday, state-run Xinhua news agency reported, extending a series of stabbing incidents across China this year. The victims were immediately rushed to hospital for treatment, according to Xinhua on Tuesday, but three died. The assailant, a 37-year-old man surnamed Lin, was detained by the police who received a report of the incident at 9:47 p.m. local time (1447 GMT), Xinhua said. An investigation is underway. Public stabbing incidents have risen over the years in China, with authorities often putting the blame on mental illness. Children at schools are a common target. In September, a 10-year-old Japanese student was fatally stabbed by an attacker meters from his school in the southern Chinese city of Shenzhen. That incident along with a June knife attack on two Japanese nationals in Suzhou, a major city in eastern China, have stoked security concerns among members of the Japanese community in China. Stabbing incidents are rare in Shanghai but not unprecedented. In 2022, a man went on a stabbing spree at a major hospital in the Chinese financial hub, injuring 15 people. The man, whom authorities said was 'resentful of society' after an investment fell through, was sentenced to death a year later.	https://www.voanews.com/a/shanghai-knife-attack-kills-three-wounds-15-others-xinhua-reports/7805678.html	2024-09-30T20:14:35-07:00	
North Korea criticizes US deployment of nuclear assets in South Korea	SEOUL, South Korea — North Korea's Defense Ministry denounced the United States' deployment of nuclear strategic assets in South Korea, state media KCNA reported on Tuesday, as Seoul was gearing up for a rare military parade marking Armed Forces Day. Kim Kang Il, North Korea's vice defense minister, accused Washington of running a 'reckless military bluff' and stoking tension by sending a nuclear-powered submarine recently to South Korea and again flying a B-1B bomber for the planned parade. South Korean media reported a B-1B bomber would join the parade set for Tuesday afternoon, flying over Seoul alongside allied fighter jets and other aircraft. South Korea's military and U.S. Forces Korea have not confirmed the bomber's participation, but Seoul's Defense Ministry said the parade was partly intended to show off its military might as a deterrent to the North. Kim said the U.S. show of force highlighted its strategic disadvantage on the Korean peninsula over North Korea, as well as South Korea's 'chronic nuclear phobia.' He called for fresh measures in response. 'We can examine such fresh action plans any time and carry them out,' he said, vowing to continue improving the country's 'powerful war deterrent,' according to KCNA. Last week, Kim Yo Jong, the powerful sister of North Korean leader Kim Jong Un, criticized the presence of a U.S. nuclear submarine in South Korea, which docked at the port city of Busan to get supplies and allow crew members to rest.	https://www.voanews.com/a/north-korea-criticizes-us-deployment-of-nuclear-assets-in-south-korea/7805641.html	2024-09-30T18:13:14-07:00	
Pete Rose, baseball's banned hits leader, has died at age 83	NEW YORK — Pete Rose, baseball's career hits leader and fallen idol who undermined his historic achievements and Hall of Fame dreams by gambling on the game he loved and once embodied, has died. He was 83. Stephanie Wheatley, a spokesperson for Clark County in Nevada, confirmed on behalf of the medical examiner that Rose died Monday. Wheatley said the cause and manner of death had not yet been determined. For fans who came of age in the 1960s and '70s, no player was more exciting than the Cincinnati Reds' No. 14, 'Charlie Hustle,' the brash superstar with the shaggy hair, puggish nose and muscular forearms. At the dawn of artificial surfaces, divisional play and free agency, Rose was old school, a conscious throwback to baseball's early days. Millions could never forget him crouched and scowling at the plate, running full speed to first even after drawing a walk, or sprinting for the next base and diving headfirst into the bag. A 17-time All-Star, the switch-hitting Rose played on three World Series winners. He was the National League MVP in 1973 and World Series MVP two years later. He holds the major league record for games played (3,562) and plate appearances (15,890) and the NL record for the longest hitting streak (44). He was the leadoff man for one of baseball's most formidable lineups with the Reds' championship teams of 1975 and 1976, with teammates that included Hall of Famers Johnny Bench, Tony Perez and Joe Morgan. But no milestone approached his 4,256 hits, breaking his hero Ty Cobb's 4,191 and signifying his excellence no matter the notoriety that followed. It was a total so extraordinary that you could average 200 hits for 20 years and still come up short. Rose's secret was consistency, and longevity. Over 24 seasons, all but six played entirely with the Reds, Rose had 200 hits or more 10 times, and more than 180 four other times. He batted .303 overall, even while switching from second base to outfield to third to first, and he led the league in hits seven times. 'Every summer, three things are going to happen,' Rose liked to say, 'the grass is going to get green, the weather is going to get hot, and Pete Rose is going to get 200 hits and bat .300.' Rose was Rookie of the Year in 1963, but he started off 0 for 12 with three walks and a hit by pitch before getting his first major league hit, an eighth-inning triple off Pittsburgh's Bob Friend. It came in Cincinnati on April 13, 1963, the day before Rose's 22nd birthday. He reached 1,000 in 1968, 2,000 just five years later and 3,000 just five years after that. He moved into second place, ahead of Hank Aaron, with hit No. 3,772, in 1982. No. 4,000 was off the Phillies' Jerry Koosman in 1984, exactly 21 years to the day after his first hit. He caught up with Cobb on Sept. 8, 1985, and surpassed him three days later, in Cincinnati, with Rose's mother and teenage son, Pete Jr., among those in attendance. Rose was 44 and the team's player-manager. Batting left-handed against the San Diego Padres' Eric Show in the first inning, he smacked a 2-1 slider into left field, a clean single. The crowd of 47,000-plus stood and yelled. The game was halted to celebrate. Rose was given the ball and the first base bag, then wept openly on the shoulder of first base coach and former teammate, Tommy Helms. Baseball Commissioner Peter Ueberroth, watching from New York, declared that Rose had 'reserved a prominent spot in Cooperstown.' After the game, a 2-0 win for the Reds in which Rose scored both runs, he received a phone call from President Ronald Reagan. 'Your reputation and legacy are secure,' Reagan told him. 'It will be a long time before anyone is standing in the spot where you're standing now.' Four years later, he was gone. On March 20, 1989, Ueberroth (who would soon be succeeded by A. Bartlett Giamatti) announced that his office was conducting a 'full inquiry into serious allegations' about Rose. Reports emerged that he had been relying on a network of bookies and friends and others in the gambling world to place bets on baseball games, including some with the Reds. Rose denied any wrongdoing, but the investigation found that the 'accumulated testimony of witnesses, together with the documentary evidence and telephone records reveal extensive betting activity by Pete Rose in connection with professional baseball and, in particular, Cincinnati Reds games, during the 1985, 1986, and 1987 baseball seasons.' Betting on baseball had been a primal sin since 1920, when several members of the Chicago White Sox were expelled for throwing the 1919 World Series — to the Cincinnati Reds. Baseball's Rule 21, posted in every professional clubhouse, proclaims that 'Any player, umpire or club or league official or employee who shall bet any sum whatsoever upon any baseball game in connection with which the bettor has a duty to perform shall be declared permanently ineligible.'' As far back as the 1970s, Bench and others had worried about Rose. By all accounts, he never bet against his own team, but even betting on the Reds left himself open to blackmail and raised questions about whether a given managerial decision was based on his own financial interest. In August 1989, at a New York press conference, Giamatti spoke some of the saddest words in baseball history: 'One of the game's greatest players has engaged in a variety of acts which have stained the game, and he must now live with the consequences of those acts.' Giamatti announced that Rose had agreed to a lifetime ban from baseball, a decision that in 1991 the Hall of Fame would rule left him ineligible for induction. Rose attempted to downplay the news, insisting that he had never bet on baseball and that he would eventually be reinstated. Within weeks of his announcement, Giamatti was dead from a heart attack. But the ban remained in place and Rose never made it to the Hall in his lifetime, although he did receive 41 votes in 1992 (when 323 votes were needed), around the time the Hall formally ruled that those banned from the game could never be elected. His status was long debated. Rose's supporters including Donald Trump, who in 2015, the year before he was elected president, tweeted: 'Can't believe Major League Baseball just rejected @PeteRose_14 for the Hall of Fame. He's paid the price. So ridiculous — let him in!' Meanwhile, his story changed. In a November 1989 memoir, written with 'The Boys of Summer' author Roger Kahn, Rose again claimed innocence, only to reverse himself in 2004. He desperately wanted to come back, and effectively destroyed his chances. He would continue to spend time at casinos, insisting he was there for promotion, not gambling. He believed he had 'messed up' and that his father would have been ashamed, but he still bet on baseball, albeit legally. 'I don't think betting is morally wrong. I don't even think betting on baseball is morally wrong,' he wrote in 'Play Hungry,' a memoir released in 2019. 'There are legal ways, and there are illegal ways, and betting on baseball the way I did was against the rules of baseball.'	https://www.voanews.com/a/pete-rose-baseball-s-banned-hits-leader-has-died-at-age-83/7805631.html	2024-09-30T17:42:03-07:00

Cambodian reporter who investigated online scam centers has been arrested	PHNOM PENH, Cambodia — Cambodian freelance reporter Mech Dara, noted for investigative reporting in a country with limited press freedom, was arrested Monday, a leading local human rights organization and a journalists association said. Known especially for investigating online scam centers, Mech Dara's arrest followed posts he made about a rock quarry — that local officials denounced Monday as an attempt to foment dissent. Mech Dara managed to send an SMS message to the rights group Licadho saying he was being arrested by military police before his phone was seized, said Am Sam Ath, a Licadho spokesperson. The Associated Press was not immediately able to confirm the arrest, news of which circulated Monday night after government offices were closed. However, CamboJA News, a project run by the independent Cambodian Journalists Alliance Association, published details of the incident, citing unnamed members of Mech Dara’s family. CamboJA on its Facebook page also reported that military police spokesperson Eng Hy confirmed the arrest, saying it had been carried out with a warrant, but did not give the cause or say where Mech Dara had been taken. A family member whom CamboJA did not name said Mech Dara’s car was stopped at a toll booth at the entrance to the expressway to Phnom Penh when police arrived in a military vehicle and five other cars. The relative said the authorities cited an arrest warrant, but did not show the document. The relative said Mech Dara’s phone was seized and that his family members were asked to stay in their car and remain silent. The police action may have been related to two images Mech Dara posted on his Facebook page of a quarry operation and of the revered mountain Ba Phnom, which has a Buddhist pagoda, in the southeastern province of Prey Veng. His post may have implied that the sacred mountain is being destroyed, which appears not to be the case. On Monday, the Prey Veng provincial administration issued a statement rejecting his post and accused him of 'wanting to cause social disorder or confusion,' which can be prosecuted as a criminal offense. The province also called on the Information Ministry to take legal action against him. Mech Dara previously worked as a journalist for the Cambodia Daily and the Phnom Penh Post, two once-vibrant English-language newspapers forced to shut down under government pressure, and the Voice of Democracy radio and website, which was closed by the government last year. Mech Dara is best known for his reports in the past few years about human trafficking connected to online scam operations. The activity involves tricking people into signing up for what they believe are legitimate jobs in Cambodia, only to then keep them in virtual slavery in compounds often housing casinos as well, where they go online to target people around the world. In a scam known as 'pig butchering,' scam operators slowly build up a relationship of trust with their targets, often involving romance, before convincing them to hand over large amounts of money for fake investments. The practice has been going on for several years, based mostly in Cambodia and Myanmar, and recently has drawn heightened law enforcement attention in the United States, where people have been cheated out of millions of dollars. The U.S. State Department honored Mech Dara as a 2023 Trafficking in Persons Report Hero for his work exposing the problem. The Paris-based group Reporters Without Borders in its latest report ranked Cambodia 151st out of 180 in its international press freedom index. 'The main broadcasters and the few remaining newspapers generally toe the government line. Many subjects are impossible to cover, such as political opposition, corruption and deforestation,' said the group. 'Despite the growing number of online media outlets, few provide balanced reporting. Only a few independent Cambodian media, broadcasting from abroad, provide quality news coverage.'	https://www.voanews.com/a/cambodian-reporter-who-investigated-online-scam-centers-has-been-arrested-/7805610.html	2024-09-30T17:03:10-07:00	
Man gets life in Russian prison for car bombing that wounded writer	moscow — A Russian court Monday gave a life sentence to a man convicted in a car bombing that seriously wounded nationalist writer Zakhar Prilepin. Prosecutors said the May 2023 bombing in the Nizhny Novogorod region was conducted at the direction of Ukraine's security services. Prilepin was seriously injured, and his driver died in the bombing. The convicted defendant, Alexander Permyakov, is from Ukraine’s eastern Donbas region and once fought with the Russian-backed separatists there, news reports said. Prilepin was known for his vehement defense of both the Russia-backed eastern Ukraine rebels who rose up in 2014, and of Russia's fighting in Ukraine that began in February 2022. Since Russia sent troops into Ukraine, two prominent nationalist figures have been killed. Darya Dugina, a commentator on Russian TV channels and the daughter of Kremlin-linked ideologue Alexander Dugin, died in an August 2022 car bombing that investigators suspected was aimed at her father. Vladlen Tatarsky, a well-known military blogger, died in April 2023, when a statue given to him at a party in St. Petersburg exploded.

Thailand's latest reform party voices optimism, but questions remain	Bangkok — Thailand’s newest pro-democracy party says it is determined to continue the fight for human rights and democracy despite facing a number of legal and political obstacles. The People’s Party was formed in August after the dissolution of the reformist Move Forward Party and is already looking ahead to the 2027 general elections. But some observers and analysts are concerned whether the opposition party will survive and whether its controversial promises will ever be fulfilled. 'In the next the three years it’s a matter of how we can beat the battle for the majority seats in parliament. I have to accept it’s not an easy task to do, but I truly believe it’s possible to achieve,' Natthaphong Reungpanyawut, leader of the People’s Party, told the Foreign Correspondents’ Club of Thailand on Sept. 26. 'Our main priorities and policies will be still the same … to protect human rights and to bring full democracy to Thailand. We want to bring power back to the people, and no one can stop that. For the next election, I believe we have to get at least 20 million votes to get the majority seats in parliament,' he added. The party’s predecessors – the Future Forward Party and the Move Forward Party – received 8 million and 14 million votes, respectively, in the past two national elections. Thitinan Pondsudhirak, a renowned political scientist in Thailand, says the new party’s ambitious goal isn’t that far-fetched, given the trajectory of recent elections. 'They have good prospects at the polls,' he told VOA. 'They’re being deliberately ambitious, but at the same time, it's not unrealistic, given the jump [from] the popular votes from Future Forward to Move Forward. 'The brick wall that they're against is not the polling booth. The brick wall is against the royalist establishment,' he said. The People's Party has maintained it will continue with one of the Move Forward Party's main pledges, which is amending Thailand’s 'lese majeste' law, which prohibits criticism of the Thai royals. This is despite Thailand’s Constitutional Court dissolving the Move Forward Party on August 7 after ruling the group’s pledges threatened to overthrow the monarchy. The party’s leaders were also banned from politics for 10 years. Prior to that, Move Forward had won the most votes in the 2023 general election, before the Thai Senate blocked the party from forming a government, also because of its campaign pledges. The Future Forward Party was also dissolved in 2020 by Thailand's Constitutional Court, which ruled the party accepted a donation from its leader, violating election law. The party said it had received the money as a loan, not a donation. Natthaphong says one of his party's policy aims is to limit the powers of the judiciary. 'The article-by-article constitution amendment, to limit the power of the Constitutional Court, to not overrule the government that is elected by the people, that is a very practical thing we can do as an opposition party over the next three years,' he said. But two months into its existence, the future of the People’s Party is already in doubt after Thailand’s National Anti-Corruption Commission said it was investigating 44 lawmakers who formerly belonged to the Move Forward Party. Twenty-five of those lawmakers are current MPs for the People’s Party. The probe alleges the lawmakers broke ethics rules for supporting a bill that was to amend the lese majeste law. Sirikanya Tansakun, deputy leader of the People’s Party, is one of the lawmakers being investigated. She told the Foreign Correspondents' Club of Thailand on Sept. 26 that the case doesn’t make sense. 'We are the members of the House of Representatives, and our duty is to pass the laws,' she said. 'As we endorsed the law to amendment of Article 112 of the Criminal Code, I don’t think it’s considered a violation of ethics at all, but in this country, anything is possible and totally unpredictable and they don’t think in rational, logical sense.' Some analysts believe the People’s Party is fighting an almost impossible cause for continuing to achieve these controversial policies. 'The future of the People’s Party is, I think, very murky,' Tita Sanglee, an independent analyst, told VOA. 'There are definitely many voters willing to give it a chance, including many conservatives, who’ve become disillusioned by the whole Thaksin-joining-forces-with conservative-parties saga and are desperate for a ‘fresh’ option.' On the other hand, she added, the party will almost definitely face legal challenges. And even if they stop trying to amend the constitution, many of their proposals remain sensitive. 'Even if The People’s Party wins by a landslide and takes office in the next election, I doubt it can achieve half of what it promises,' Sanglee said. The party wants to implement more than 300 policy goals, including ending military conscription, promoting labor protections and making it legal to criticize the royal family. The party labels this as the three 'D’s' – demonopolization, demilitarization and decentralization – which began under Move Forward’s leadership. Pravit Rojanaphruk, a veteran journalist for Khaosod English in Thailand, says both voters and conservatives may not see the People’s Party as anything different to their predecessors, and that may work against the group. '[The Move Forward Party] have failed to form a government despite having won most seats in 2023 and some voters may doubt if they are really capable of forming a government after the next general election, since all major parties have basically vowed to not join a coalition with them due to their stance on the lese majeste law and the monarchy,' he said. 'The not so obvious obstacle is how they can shake off the image of being branded as the new main threat to national security by conservative people and how to keep their members motivated if they fail to form the government again in 2027,' he added. But Sirikanya remained confident that change will happen. 'Every time that the system tries to beat us, they have used up their own political capital from those funny rulings or verdicts,' he said. 'If we keep fighting this fight, and people back us more and more, someday, maybe in my next generation or the next one, if we keep fighting, we will win.'	https://www.voanews.com/a/thailand-s-latest-reform-party-voices-optimism-but-questions-remain-/7805300.html	2024-09-30T15:50:12-07:00	
US port strike by 45,000 dockworkers is all but certain to begin at midnight	New York — The union representing U.S. dockworkers has signaled that 45,000 of its members will walk off the job at midnight, kicking off a strike likely to shut down ports across the East and Gulf coasts. The coming work stoppage threatens to significantly snarl the nation's supply chain, potentially leading to higher prices and delays in goods reaching households and businesses if it drags on for weeks. That's because the strike by members of the International Longshoremen's Association could cause 36 ports — which handle roughly half of the goods shipped into and out of the U.S. — to shutter operations. ILA confirmed over the weekend that its members would hit the picket lines at 12:01 a.m. Tuesday. In a Monday update, the union blamed the United States Maritime Alliance, which represents the ports, for continuing to 'to block the path' toward an agreement before the contract deadline. 'The Ocean Carriers represented by USMX want to enjoy rich billion-dollar profits that they are making in 2024, while they offer ILA Longshore Workers an unacceptable wage package that we reject,' ILA said in a prepared statement. 'ILA longshore workers deserve to be compensated for the important work they do keeping American commerce moving and growing.' ILA also accused the shippers of 'gouging their customers' with sizeable price increases for containers over recent weeks. The union said that this will result in increased costs for American consumers. The Associated Press reached out to a USMX spokesperson for comment. If drawn out, the strike would force businesses to pay shippers for delays and cause some goods to arrive late for peak holiday shopping season — potentially impacting delivery of anything from toys or artificial Christmas trees, to cars, coffee and fruit. A strike could have an almost immediate impact on supplies of perishable imports like bananas, for example. The ports that could be affected by the strike handle 3.8 million metric tons of bananas each year, or 75% of the nation’s supply, according to the American Farm Bureau Federation. Americans could also face higher prices as retailers feel the supply squeeze. 'If the strikes go ahead, they will cause enormous delays across the supply chain, a ripple effect which will no doubt roll into 2025 and cause chaos across the industry,' noted Jay Dhokia, founder of supply chain management and logistics firm Pro3PL. Dhokia added that East Coast ports aren't the only ones at risk for disruption, as concern leading up to the strike has already diverted many shipments out West, adding to route congestion and more pressure on demand. Impacts will also be felt internationally — particularly in places like the United Kingdom, he said, where the U.S. is its largest trading partner. ILA members are demanding higher wages and a total ban on the automation of cranes, gates and container-moving trucks used in the loading or unloading of freight. The coming strike by the ILA workers — set to impact ports from Maine to Texas — will be the first by the union since 1977. West Coast dockworkers belong to a different union and aren’t involved in the strike. If a strike were deemed a danger to U.S. economic health, President Joe Biden could, under the 1947 Taft-Hartley Act, seek a court order for an 80-day cooling-off period. That would suspend the strike. All eyes are on what, if any, action the administration might take — particularly just weeks ahead of a tight presidential election. But Biden has signaled that he will not exercise this power. During an exchange with reporters on Sunday, Biden said 'no' when asked if he planned to intervene in the potential work stoppage. 'Because it’s collective bargaining, I don’t believe in Taft-Hartley,' he said. At a briefing Monday, White House press secretary Karine Jean-Pierre reiterated that the administration had never invoked Taft-Hartley 'to break a strike and are not considering doing so now.' She added that top officials were still urging both parties to return to the bargaining table and negotiate in good faith.	https://www.voanews.com/a/us-port-strike-by-45-000-dockworkers-is-all-but-certain-to-begin-at-midnight/7805288.html	2024-09-30T15:33:46-07:00	
Arkansas sues YouTube over claims it's fueling mental health crisis	little rock, arkansas — Arkansas sued YouTube and parent company Alphabet on Monday, saying the video-sharing platform is made deliberately addictive and fueling a mental health crisis among youth in the state. Attorney General Tim Griffin's office filed the lawsuit in state court, accusing them of violating the state's deceptive trade practices and public nuisance laws. The lawsuit claims the site is addictive and has resulted in the state spending millions on expanded mental health and other services for young people. 'YouTube amplifies harmful material, doses users with dopamine hits, and drives youth engagement and advertising revenue,' the lawsuit said. 'As a result, youth mental health problems have advanced in lockstep with the growth of social media, and in particular, YouTube.' Alphabet's Google, which owns the video service and is also named as a defendant in the case, denied the lawsuit's claims. 'Providing young people with a safer, healthier experience has always been core to our work. In collaboration with youth, mental health and parenting experts, we built services and policies to provide young people with age-appropriate experiences, and parents with robust controls,' Google spokesperson Jose Castaneda said in a statement. 'The allegations in this complaint are simply not true.' YouTube requires users under 17 to get their parent’s permission before using the site, while accounts for users younger than 13 must be linked to a parental account. But it is possible to watch YouTube without an account, and kids can easily lie about their age. The lawsuit is the latest in an ongoing push by state and federal lawmakers to highlight the impact that social media sites have on younger users. U.S. Surgeon General Vivek Murthy in June called on Congress to require warning labels on social media platforms about their effects on young people’s lives, like those now mandatory on cigarette boxes. Arkansas last year filed similar lawsuits against TikTok and Facebook parent company Meta, claiming the social media companies were misleading consumers about the safety of children on their platforms and protections of users’ private data. Those lawsuits are still pending in state court. Arkansas also enacted a law requiring parental consent for minors to create new social media accounts, though that measure has been blocked by a federal judge. Along with TikTok, YouTube is one of the most popular sites for children and teens. Both sites have been questioned in the past for hosting, and in some cases promoting, videos that encourage gun violence, eating disorders and self-harm. YouTube in June changed its policies about firearm videos, prohibiting any videos demonstrating how to remove firearm safety devices. Under the new policies, videos showing homemade guns, automatic weapons and certain firearm accessories like silencers will be restricted to users 18 and older. Arkansas' lawsuit claims that YouTube's algorithms steer youth to harmful adult content, and that it facilitates the spread of child sexual abuse material. The lawsuit doesn't seek specific damages, but asks that YouTube be ordered to fund prevention, education and treatment for 'excessive and problematic use of social media.'	https://www.voanews.com/a/arkansas-sues-youtube-over-claims-it-s-fueling-mental-health-crisis-/7805257.html	2024-09-30T15:12:49-07:00	
3 policemen killed in attacks in southeastern Iran	Tehran — At least three policemen were killed in separate attacks by jihadists and gunmen in Iran's southeastern Sistan-Baluchistan province, state media reported Monday. One of Iran's poorest regions, Sistan-Baluchistan on the border with Pakistan has long been plagued by unrest involving drug-smuggling gangs, rebels from the Baluchi minority and Sunni extremists. 'A border guard was killed a few hours ago in a clash with gunmen in Hirmand in Sistan-Baluchistan province,' the official IRNA news agency reported. A separate attack on law enforcement in the same region Monday left another border guard killed and two others wounded, IRNA said. The news agency also reported that a member of the police special force was killed in the town of Khash, also in Sistan-Baluchistan. The Pakistan-based Sunni jihadist group Jaish al-Adl, or Army of Justice in Arabic, claimed responsibility for the last two attacks in a message on Telegram. The group has claimed responsibility for several attacks in recent months, including a Sunday raid that killed a policeman in the same region.	https://www.voanews.com/a/three-policemen-killed-in-attacks-in-southeastern-iran-/7805278.html	2024-09-30T15:08:41-07:00	
Hunger in Haiti reaches famine levels	PORT-AU-PRINCE — Nearly 6,000 people in Haiti are starving, with nearly half the country's population of more than 11 million people experiencing crisis levels of hunger or worse as gang violence smothers life in the capital of Port-au-Prince and beyond, according to a new report released Monday. The number of Haitians facing crisis, emergency and famine levels of hunger increased by 1.2 million in the past year for a total of 5.4 million as gang violence disrupts the transportation of goods and prevents people from venturing out of their homes to buy food, according to the report by the Integrated Food Security Phase Classification. 'This is one of the highest proportions of acutely food insecure people in any crisis around the world,' said U.N. spokesman Stéphane Dujarric. The 5,636 people who are facing starvation, the worst level, live in makeshift shelters across the metropolitan area, according to the report, which noted that another 2 million Haitians face severe hunger. 'This is shocking,' said Martine Villeneuve, Haiti director for the nonprofit Action Against Hunger. 'We were not expecting that level. Two million … is massive.' Villeneuve told The Associated Press that she also was surprised that some of the 2 million people hit by hunger don't even live in places directly affected by gang violence. While much of the hunger is directly tied to gang violence, double-digit inflation also has limited what many Haitians can afford to buy, with food now representing 70% of total household expenditures. The cost of a food basket increased more than 11% in the past year, with inflation hitting 30% in July. In addition, parts of Haiti are still struggling to recover from the August 2021 earthquake, various drought episodes, and Hurricane Matthew, which struck Haiti as a Category 4 storm in 2016. Gang violence, however, accounts for most of the hunger, with gangs controlling 80% of Port-au-Prince and the roads that lead to and from northern and southern Haiti, preventing farmers from delivering goods and nonprofits from delivering aid. From April to June, at least 1,379 people were reported killed or injured, and another 428 kidnapped. In addition, gang violence has left more than 700,000 people homeless in recent years. A U.N.-backed mission led by Kenya that began in late June and is aimed at quelling gang violence in Haiti has liberated some communities. But officials say much work remains to be done as the U.S., Haiti and others call for a U.N. peacekeeping mission to secure funding and personnel that the current mission lacks. 'Haiti continues to face a worsening humanitarian crisis, with alarming rates of armed gang violence disrupting daily life, forcing more people to flee their homes and levels of acute food insecurity to rise,' the report stated. In 2014, only 2% of Haiti's population was food insecure, a number that has soared to nearly 50%, according to Mercy Corps, one of several nonprofits that called for an increase in funding Monday. Dujarric said humanitarian food agencies and nonprofits in Haiti need an additional $230 million until year's end. Seventy percent of people living in makeshift shelters are experiencing crisis levels of hunger or worse, the report found. Among those experiencing hunger is Joceline St-Louis, a 28-year-old mother of two boys, 5 and 1. 'Food doesn’t come around very often,' she said, adding that she depends on others to feed her children. 'When an organization does provide food, there’s a major fight,' she said. St-Louis said she must take her 1-year-old to a clinic so he can receive a peanut butter mix 'so that his body doesn’t collapse in my arms.' 'I’m sometimes so depressed that I sometimes want to kill the kids and myself,' she said in a soft voice as she cradled the 1-year-old in her arms while the 5-year-old played with his friends. In another shelter nearby, Judeline Auguste, 39, said she depends solely on remittances to feed herself and her 8-year-old boy, but the money barely lasts a week. 'It’s very rare that I can get a meal a day,' she said. 'My situation is hard not because of me, but because of my son. He looks at other people eating all the time, and he starts crying, ‘Mommy, I’m hungry.’' Meanwhile, those facing urgent levels of hunger live in Haiti’s northern, central and southern regions, as well as in the capital. Jean Yonel, who fled his home with his family after gangs raided their neighborhood, said there are days that he, his wife and their seven children eat only white rice or spaghetti. 'I can’t provide every day for these children,' Yonel said. 'Sometimes we take just a spoonful of food and leave the rest of the food for the kids so they don’t die.' Yonel used to work as a mason, but with construction jobs drying up, he is now forced to search for wood to make charcoal. His wife sells second-hand clothes. On days when they can’t afford a proper meal for their children, she mixes flour with spinach to keep their stomachs from rumbling.	https://www.voanews.com/a/hunger-in-haiti-reaches-famine-levels-/7805270.html	2024-09-30T15:07:02-07:00	
Iran says it will not send forces to confront Israel	tehran, iran — Iran will not deploy forces to Lebanon or Gaza to confront Israel, its foreign ministry said Monday, as Israeli strikes target its allies in the region. 'There is no need to send extra or volunteer forces of the Islamic Republic of Iran,' said foreign ministry spokesman Nasser Kanani, adding that Lebanon and fighters in the Palestinian territories 'have the capability and strength to defend themselves against the aggression.' Israel has in recent days been launching heavy airstrikes in Lebanon against the so-called 'axis of resistance,' a network of Iran-aligned militant groups in the region, including in Syria, Yemen and Iraq. An Israeli strike Friday on Beirut killed Hassan Nasrallah, the head of the Lebanese militant group Hezbollah that Iran has armed and financed for years. 'We have not received any request in this regard from any side. On the contrary, we are informed and are sure that they do not need the help of our forces,' Kanani told reporters in Tehran. Kanani nonetheless vowed that Israel 'will not remain without reprimand and punishment for the crimes it has committed against the Iranian people, military personnel and the resistance forces.' Also Monday, Iranian President Masoud Pezeshkian visited Hezbollah's office in Tehran 'to pay tribute' to Nasrallah, according to the government's website. Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, who has the final say in all matters of the state, has vowed that Nasrallah's death 'will not be in vain,' and First Vice President Mohammad Reza Aref said it would bring about Israel's 'destruction.' Iran has also vowed to avenge the killing of Abbas Nilforushan, a top commander of the Quds Force, the Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps' foreign operations arm, who died alongside the Hezbollah leader.	https://www.voanews.com/a/iran-says-it-will-not-send-forces-to-confront-israel/7805280.html	2024-09-30T15:06:03-07:00

Flash floods kill six in Iran, state news agency reports	Tehran, Iran — At least six people have been killed and eight others are missing after flash floods swept through southern Iran, a region usually parched, state media reported Monday. 'Five foreigners and one Iranian died due to flooding of Halil River in Jiroft and eight people are missing,' the official IRNA news agency said. It did not specify the nationality of those who died. Jiroft is a city located in the normally dry southern province of Kerman. Scientists say climate change amplifies extreme weather, including droughts as well as the potential for an increased intensity of rainstorms. Iran has endured repeated droughts in the past decade, but also regular floods, a phenomenon made worse when torrential rain falls on the sun-baked earth. In 2022, heavy rains in Iran's south left at least 80 people dead and caused damage estimated at about $200 million.	https://www.voanews.com/a/flash-floods-kill-six-in-iran-state-news-agency-reports/7805265.html	2024-09-30T14:54:30-07:00

Flooding deaths in Nepal reach 193 as recovery work ramps up	Kathmandu, Nepal — The number of people killed in Nepal by flooding and landslides triggered by heavy rainfall over the weekend reached 193 while recovery and rescue work increased Monday. Many of the deaths were in the capital, Kathmandu, which got heavy rainfall, and much of the southern part of the city was flooded. Police said in a statement that 31 people were still reported missing and 96 people were injured across the Himalayan nation. A landslide killed three dozen people on a blocked highway about 16 kilometers (10 miles) from Kathmandu. The landslide buried at least three buses and other vehicles where people were sleeping because the highway was blocked. Kathmandu had remained cut off all weekend as the three highways out of the city were blocked by landslides. Workers were able to temporarily open the key Prithvi highway, removing rocks, mud and trees that had been washed from the mountains. The home minister announced temporary shelters would be built for people who lost their homes and monetary help would be available for the families of those killed and to the people who were injured by the flooding and landslides. Prime Minister Khadga Prasad Oli was returning home Monday from attending the U.N. General Assembly meeting and has called an emergency meeting, his office said. Improved weather has allowed rescue and recovery work to be stepped up. Residents in the southern part of Kathmandu, which was inundated Saturday, were cleaning up houses as water levels began to recede. At least 34 people were killed in Kathmandu, which was the hardest hit by flooding. Police and soldiers were assisting with rescue efforts, while heavy equipment was used to clear the landslides from the roads. The government announced it was closing schools and colleges across Nepal for the next three days. The monsoon season began in June and usually ends by mid-September. Meanwhile, in northern Bangladesh, about 60,000 people were affected by flooding in low-lying areas because of rains and rising water from upstream India. People have taken shelter on roads and flood protection embankments in Lalmonirhat and Kurigram districts, the English-language Daily Star reported. The River Teesta that crosses the border was overflowing at some points and the Dharala and Dudhkumar rivers in the Rangpur region were rising but remained below danger levels, the Dhaka-based Flood Forecasting and Warning Center said Monday. Waters could start receding in a day or two, it said. Bangladesh is a low-lying delta nation crisscrossed by about 230 rivers, including more than 50 that cross borders.	https://www.voanews.com/a/flooding-deaths-in-nepal-reach-193-as-recovery-work-ramps-up/7805202.html	2024-09-30T13:37:47-07:00	
Biden acts to keep asylum ban at US-Mexico border in place longer	WASHINGTON — The Biden administration will toughen an asylum ban at the U.S.-Mexico border to keep it in place for longer, U.S. Department of Homeland Security officials said Monday, signaling a desire to further curb illegal crossings. The change, effective just after midnight, will leave asylum restrictions in place until arrests of migrants crossing illegally drop below a daily average of 1,500 over 28 days, lengthened from the current seven-day period, one of the officials said on a call with reporters. President Joe Biden, a Democrat, issued the asylum ban in June to drive down record numbers of migrants caught crossing illegally. Immigration is a top voter issue in the run-up to the Nov. 5 election, which is pitting Vice President Kamala Harris against Republican Donald Trump, an immigration hardliner. Harris backs making the ban even harder to lift, Reuters reported last week, but the Biden administration did not adopt her proposal. U.S. border authorities have apprehended roughly 54,000 migrants in September to date, down steeply from a peak of 250,000 in December, a DHS official said. A daily average of 1,500 over 28 days would represent a total of 42,000 migrants in that period. As part of the changes to the asylum ban, all unaccompanied children caught crossing illegally will be counted in the tally used to decide whether the restrictions can be lifted. Previously, only children from Mexico and Canada were counted. The stricter approach 'ensures that the drop in encounters is a sustained decrease' and not tied to short-term trends, a DHS official said, speaking under condition of anonymity. Immigrant rights groups led by the American Civil Liberties Union have sued over the asylum ban, arguing that it runs counter to U.S. asylum law and closely parallels a Trump ban blocked in court.	https://www.voanews.com/a/biden-acts-to-keep-asylum-ban-at-us-mexico-border-in-place-longer/7805132.html	2024-09-30T13:04:56-07:00

Analysts: Escalating conflict tests China’s Middle East approach	Taipei, Taiwan — As Israel continues to launch airstrikes against Hezbollah targets in Lebanon, China is stepping up its efforts to play the role of peacemaker in the Middle East, issuing statements of condemnation, but Beijing’s actions are also exposing the limits of its ability to de-escalate tensions, analysts say. 'Beijing wants to create an impression that it is pushing for greater peace and stability in the Middle East, but I’m not sure what all the statements amount to,' said Ian Chong, a political scientist at the National University of Singapore. After Hezbollah confirmed Saturday that its long-time leader Hassan Nasrallah was killed in an Israeli airstrike that took place in the Lebanese capital of Beirut, China's Foreign Ministry reiterated Beijing's concern over the escalating conflict and urged all sides, especially Israel, to take steps to 'cool down the situation.' 'China opposes the infringement on Lebanon’s sovereignty and security, opposes and condemns any action against innocent civilians, and opposes any move that fuels antagonism and escalates regional tensions,' a Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesperson said in a statement released Sunday. The ministry statement added that said since the escalating tension between Israel and Hezbollah is 'a spillover of the Gaza conflict,' the priority now is to 'implement relevant U.N. Security Council resolutions, end the fighting in Gaza as soon as possible, and earnestly safeguard peace and stability in the Middle East.' Sunday’s statement follows Chinese Foreign Minister Wang Yi’s meeting with his Lebanese counterpart last Monday on the sidelines of U.N. meetings in New York. During his meeting with Lebanese Foreign Minister Abdallah Bou Habib, Wang also stressed Beijing’s support for Lebanon’s efforts to safeguard its sovereignty and security and called for an immediate cease-fire in Gaza. In recent months, China has sought to play a bigger role in the Middle East as its trade and diplomatic ties with the region expand. Earlier in July, Beijing brokered meetings that led to reconciliation between rival Palestinian factions. In March 2023, Beijing helped broker a deal between Saudi Arabia and Iran to reestablish diplomatic ties between the long-time rivals. Chong said that while brokering the reestablishment of diplomatic ties between Iran and Saudi Arabia and reconciliation between rival Palestinian factions were low-hanging fruits for China, it remains unclear what Beijing may do to tackle more complicated regional issues, such as escalating tension between Israel and Hezbollah. 'It depends on what Beijing is willing to do [regarding the current conflict], and I suppose they could try to lean on Tehran, which they supposedly have good relations with,' he told VOA by phone, adding that it is unclear how far they can get with Iran on issues related to the Middle East. Leveraging conflict against US As part of the attempt to present itself as a peacemaker in the Middle East, some observers say China is focusing on depicting Israel and the United States as aggressors in the ongoing conflict while portraying themselves as siding with 'the victims.' 'They are painting this narrative that Israel and the U.S. are on the side of injustice and hegemony, and China is on the side of fairness and justice,' Tuvia Gering, a non-resident fellow at Atlantic Council’s Global China Hub, told VOA by phone. In comments to Chinese state media, some Chinese analysts have argued that it is the U.S. 'that allows, tolerates, or even instigates the escalation' of the crisis in the Middle East. The United States has been pushing for a cease fire between Israel and Hezbollah to avoid further escalation of the conflict and a wider war in the region. Chong said the ongoing conflict in the Middle East may help to amplify Beijing’s preferred narrative that Washington and its allies are creators of instability, particularly among some developing countries. 'The current situation in the Middle East certainly opens up opportunities for those narratives to perhaps take hold, especially in parts of Africa, Latin America and Asia,' he told VOA. However, he adds, while China may gain some leverage through this tactic, it needs to put forward something more concrete, such as a tangible peace plan to 'capitalize on the sentiment.' While China seeks to leverage the crisis in the Middle East against the U.S., Chong said the continued escalation of the conflict could also mean more economic pressure for Beijing, as well. China is the world’s largest importer of oil and after Russia, the Middle East is a key source of energy imports for Beijing to keep its economy running. 'If there is a wider conflict within the Middle East, at a minimum, it may affect energy prices and supplies, which could add to some of China’s ongoing economic woes,' he told VOA. However, since its primary trading partners in the Middle East are wealthier countries in the Gulf Cooperation Council and Iran, accounting for more than $300 billion in 2023 in exports and imports, some experts say the impact of the ongoing conflict on China’s economic interests is likely to be limited. 'I would imagine the current situation is very worrying for China and many other countries, but so long as the conflict is primarily limited to Israel dealing with different proxies and militias in its immediate surroundings, I don’t necessarily think that it would translate into a direct threat of Chinese interests,' Mohammed Alsudairi, a lecturer in politics and international relations at the Australian National University, told VOA in a phone interview.	https://www.voanews.com/a/analysts-escalating-conflict-tests-china-s-middle-east-approach/7805006.html	2024-09-30T11:46:48-07:00	
Lake Victoria countries working to fight crime, improve community relations	Nairobi — Officials from Kenya, Tanzania and Uganda are meeting for the fourth time in less than two years to find ways to more effectively fight transnational crimes around the Lake Victoria area. Some of the crimes are nature-related, such as illegal fishing, tree cutting and charcoal production. In other cases, criminals take advantage of porous borders to sell drugs and conduct human trafficking. In 2021, the police organization Interpol rescued 121 people trafficked in and around Lake Victoria. Speaking to reporters at the port city of Mombasa, Kenya's interior ministry principal secretary, Raymond Omollo, said the parties were looking to close gaps in policing and surveillance, while also improving social and economic relations of communities living in the lake region. 'So we are looking at how to coordinate better, how to build capacities, how to have a common understanding with the communities around the lake and also who benefits from the use of the lake on how to manage those resources better while at the same [time] trying to minimize, eradicate a crime that we know is common in the lake,' Omollo said. The International Organization for Migration (IOM) launched the Lake Victoria project in December 2022. The world’s second-largest freshwater lake covers 60,000 square kilometers and is a source of livelihood for at least 40 million people in East Africa. Uganda's assistant commissioner for migration, Marcellino Bwesigye, told conference attendees that keeping Lake Victoria safe is important for his country. 'Lake Victoria is Uganda's ocean. So, we are looking forward to working together, especially to learn about the good practices that you have from the coast,' Bwesigye said. Authorities have documented illegal fishing in the lake, driven by rising demand for Nile perch, as well as charcoal harvesting and timber smuggling. Sharon Dimanche, IOM Kenya's chief of mission, said authorities need to partner with communities to fight organized crime in the region. 'If the border communities are not informed, if they really don't know what … we need to focus on, then it becomes a bit challenging to combat any of these transnational organized crimes because they are there and they know what is happening and they know some strange faces that are coming in their communities. So it's important that we link them up, they have a good relationship with law enforcement agencies,' Dimanche said. The meeting in Mombasa ends Wednesday.	https://www.voanews.com/a/lake-victoria-countries-working-to-fight-crime-improve-community-relations-/7805027.html	2024-09-30T11:46:34-07:00	
Multinational police force for Haiti renewed for another year	united nations — The U.N. Security Council on Monday approved a one-year renewal for a multinational police force to help Haiti’s embattled national police subdue gangs in the violence-plagued Caribbean nation, and it will now consider turning the mission into a full-fledged U.N. peacekeeping operation. 'In adopting this resolution today, the Council has helped Haiti continue re-establishing security and creating the conditions necessary to holding free and fair elections,' U.S. Ambassador Linda Thomas-Greenfield said. 'So, let us work together to build on the progress of the Haiti MSS [Multinational Security Support] mission. Let us embrace a new approach that sustains it. Let us protect the fragile but inspiring opportunity to build a better future for the Haitian people.' The United States and Ecuador drafted the resolution to extend the mission through October 2, 2025. In the interim, Haiti’s transitional government has requested that the 15-nation Security Council begin discussions for transforming the non-U.N. force into a U.N. peacekeeping operation. 'The transformation of the MSS into a peacekeeping operation under the mandate of the United Nations appears not just to be necessary, but a matter of urgency,' Haitian Ambassador Antonio Rodrigue told the council. He said making it one would guarantee more stable and predictable financing and expand the force’s capacities. Currently the mission has faced a continued shortfall in funds, equipment and logistics capabilities. 'We firmly believe that this is an approach which is crucial to maintain the gains of the MSS to enhance national security and to establish necessary conditions for the conduct of free and fair elections in the near future,' Rodrigue said. He said despite some progress in the three months since the first contingent of about 400 Kenyan police deployed to Haiti, the country still faces significant and complicated challenges. 'Gang violence continues to rend the social fabric and human rights violations are multiplying, plunging thousands of families into distress,' the Haitian envoy said. 'Insecurity is omnipresent, paralyzing the economy, undermining in the institutions and fueling fear among the population.' Kenya is leading the mission and its president, William Ruto, visited Haiti about a week and a half ago to meet with officials and Kenyan and Haitian police forces. Ruto said at the U.N. General Assembly last week that he plans to deploy another Kenyan contingent to Haiti by January. So far only about 500 police have been deployed, the majority from Kenya and the rest from Jamaica and Belize. Diplomats say they expect other countries will also be deploying. Kenya’s U.N. envoy pointed to some initial progress in the capital, Port-au-Prince, including their securing important infrastructure, such as the airport and National Hospital, and several major road intersections. But he noted the mission needs to quickly reach its fully mandated level of 2,500 personnel and the political transition needs to move ahead. 'I must also emphasize that while the MSS mission is a crucial and innovative intervention, it is only a part of the solution,' Ambassador Erastus Ekitela Lokaale said. 'Haiti’s stability will only be accomplished through a multi-pronged approach that addresses the root causes of its challenges.' Haiti has been rocked by instability since 2021, when President Jovenel Moise was assassinated. Prime Minister Ariel Henry then led the country until he announced his resignation in March. A transitional government is now in place with the goal of organizing free and fair elections. Haiti has not held elections since 2016. The country is facing a massive humanitarian crisis as a result of the violence. On Monday, international food monitors said more than half the country’s population – 5.4 million people – are struggling to feed themselves. At least 6,000 displaced persons in shelters in the capital are facing catastrophic levels of hunger, while 2 million people are one step behind them.	https://www.voanews.com/a/7805031.html	2024-09-30T11:46:20-07:00	
Russian journalism archive aims to protect independent voices from media suppression	Washington — On a quiet May morning, two months after Russia launched its full-scale invasion of Ukraine in 2022, the homepage of Kremlin-owned news website Lenta.ru was flooded with anti-war and anti-government articles. The articles disappeared from the webpage within the hour, but because of the effort of internet archivists, they can still be viewed separately today. This is one of many examples of the Russian government’s attacks on free media, one that activists and archivists hope to counter. Since Russia’s full-scale invasion of Ukraine in February 2022, almost all independent media has been banned or blocked, and journalists are frequently imprisoned over trumped-up charges, according to Reporters Without Borders. To preserve over two decades of independent Russian journalism, exiled journalists and activists teamed up with PEN’s Freedom to Write Center to create the Russian Independent Media Archive, or RIMA. 'There is no freedom to write if there is no freedom to read,' Liesl Gerntholtz, director of PEN’s Freedom to Write Center, told VOA. Currently, the website houses over 6 million documents from 98 outlets, starting from the year 2000 — when Russian President Vladmir Putin first came to power. Co-founders Anna Nemzer, Ilia Veniavkin and Serob Khachatryan began the project around the time of the Ukraine invasion. The restrictive anti-war censorship laws that followed threatened press freedom and journalist safety in Russia, Nemzer told VOA. More than 1,500 journalists fled the country after the invasion and 22 were imprisoned at the end of last year, according to data from the Committee to Protect Journalists. 'I remember thinking: how can we help these people?' Nemzer told VOA. 'We couldn’t help them relocate; we couldn’t help them avoid prison if they stayed in Russia, but we thought the least we could do was save archives of their work.' At the time of the invasion, Nemzer was on a business trip outside of her home in Moscow, and she remains exiled today. Nemzer hopes the archive will protect work that is or might be 'deliberately erased' by the government. The main audience for the archive is journalists, academics and researchers who may not have access to relevant documents when they write about Russia. Gerntholtz of PEN sees this archive as the 'first draft of history,' she told VOA. But Nemzer also believes she is doing a service for the archived independent journalists, both in and outside Russia, by preserving their work. PEN’s Freedom to Write Center agreed to help develop the project because of these shared views — the organization sees media archiving as a natural extension of protecting the reporters themselves, Gerntholtz told VOA. Gerntholtz added that the organization is concerned about Russia’s 'crackdown on free expression' that has only intensified after 2022. 'Free expression in Russia has been at risk for a really long time,' Gerntholtz told VOA. 'We've seen more writers and artists who've been jailed for anti-war expression. We've seen civilian and professional journalists jailed for their activism journalism.' She cited the April 2024 arrests of journalists Konstantin Gabov and Sergey Karelin as an example of the Russian government silencing anti-corruption reporting. They were arrested on extremism charges for their work for late Russian dissident Alexei Navalny. Even before the invasion, a 'huge attack' on journalists was already underway, Nemzer told VOA. She saw Russia’s government declare many independent media outlets as undesirable organizations and prosecute her peer journalists under foreign agent charges. The Kremlin passed the undesirable-organization law in 2015, giving the government the power to shut down foreign and international organizations. However, critics say this law is a way to target government-critical news outlets. More than 175 organizations have been declared undesirable. Because of these crackdowns, Nemzer faced many hurdles in archiving decades of material. Mastering the technology to construct the archive to the scale it is today was especially challenging, and it is still a work in progress, she told VOA. The co-founders collaborated with the world’s largest internet archive, the Wayback Machine, to use the technology to create a special archived collection. The Wayback Machine archives over a billion URLs a day, according to its director, Mark Graham. RIMA has been able to access their collection efforts to preserve not just written articles, but also video and audio journalism. 'Material published on the web is not permanent or persistent,' Graham told VOA. 'The reliability of the access to that information going into the future is uncertain.' Among the millions of stories archived in RIMA, over 50,000 come from exiled independent news source The Moscow Times. Since the Ukraine invasion, The Moscow Times and its staff have 'faced nothing but challenges,' Alexander Gubsky, longtime publisher of the Times, told VOA. The staff had to relocate from Russia to Amsterdam within two weeks because of the Russian government’s hostile policies toward journalists, according to Gubsky. 'They want to shut us up,' Gubsky said. 'We tell the truth, and they cannot allow the truth.' Preserving the work of targeted individuals and outlets is one of the main reasons why Nemzer of RIMA helped create the archive, she told VOA. However, Gubsky told VOA that the Times has an archive of their own work on their website, and prefers that curious readers turn their attention there. He said that while RIMA is an 'interesting project,' the Times owns the copyright for all their own articles, and their primary source of income is from licensing and syndication. Graham of the Wayback Machine told VOA that the organization responds to legitimate requests from rights holders regarding the distribution of their material. He added that archiving public articles falls under fair use. 'RIMA is set up to facilitate a kind of exploration in a way that you simply can't do if all you have is access to a few individual websites,' Graham said. As RIMA continues to expand, Nemzer already has her sights set on the future. She hopes to take advantage of evolving artificial intelligence to help sort the archive. Nemzer also aims to create similar projects for other countries with leadership that suppresses media and has already talked to journalists from Belarus, Afghanistan and Iran. 'Writers play a particular role in challenging autocracy, in exposing human rights abuses and speaking truth to power,' Gerntholtz said. 'And journalists are crucial to challenging powerful people and governments.'	https://www.voanews.com/a/russian-journalism-archive-aims-to-protect-independent-voices-from-media-suppression/7805039.html	2024-09-30T11:46:09-07:00	
China’s Xi calls for Taiwan reunification on eve of National Day	Washington — As China prepared to mark its National Day holiday, it used the occasion to once again call for 'reunification' with Taiwan and to flex its military might. On the eve of National Day Monday, Chinese leader Xi Jinping reiterated his view that reunification was inevitable and essential for fulfilling goals of national rejuvenation. Just one day earlier, China carried out multiple missile firings that put Taiwan’s military on alert. 'It is an irreversible trend, a matter of justice, and it is in accordance with the popular will. No one can stop the march of history,' Xi said in his remarks. Since its establishment on Oct. 1 in 1949, the People’s Republic of China or PRC has never ruled Taiwan, but it views the democratically governed island as its own territory and has vowed to bring the island under its control, by force if necessary. On Tuesday, China will mark 75 years since the Communist Party defeated Kuomintang Nationalist forces, ending a bloody civil war. The Nationalists fled to Taiwan, which after decades of one-party rule by the Kuomintang eventually became a thriving democracy. According to public opinion polls in Taiwan there is very little support for unification with China, regardless of whether it is as soon as possible or in the future. 'Taiwan is sacred territory for China. People on both sides of the Taiwan Strait have blood ties, and these family ties will always be stronger than others,' Xi said. Xi’s call comes just one day after Taiwan’s Defense Ministry detected multiple waves of missile firings within China’s interior. Earlier last week, Beijing also test-fired an intercontinental ballistic missile into international waters, a drill the likes of which China has not conducted since the 1980s. On Sunday, U.S. President Joe Biden approved $567 million in military support for Taiwan, the largest aid package America has granted the island. The funding will aid Taiwanese 'military education and training' and allow for the speedy delivery of military articles, according to a statement from the White House. Some material for this report was provided by Reuters and Agence France-Presse.	https://www.voanews.com/a/china-s-xi-calls-for-taiwan-reunification-on-eve-of-national-day-/7804944.html	2024-09-30T11:09:51-07:00

Man accused of Trump assassination plot in Florida pleads not guilty	west palm beach, florida — Ryan Routh, the 58-year-old man accused of plotting to kill Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump at his Florida golf course, pleaded not guilty on Monday to several federal charges. His lawyer Kristy Militello entered the not guilty plea during a brief arraignment in a West Palm Beach federal courthouse and requested a jury trial. Wearing a beige prison uniform and shackles on his wrists and ankles, Routh answered 'yes, your honor,' when the magistrate judge asked him if he was aware of the charges against him. Routh was arrested on September 15 after a Secret Service agent saw the barrel of a rifle poking out from brush on the perimeter of the West Palm Beach golf course where Trump was playing a round. The agent opened fire and Routh, who fled in a vehicle, was arrested shortly later. He has been charged with attempted assassination of a major presidential candidate, assaulting a federal officer and firearms offenses. A federal judge ruled last week that Routh, identified as a Hawaii resident, should remain in custody. FBI analysis of Routh's phone showed he had been in Florida since August 18, and his devices were located multiple times between that date and September 15 near Trump's golf course and his Mar-a-Lago residence, according to prosecutors. Before being spotted by the Secret Service agent, Routh spent nearly 12 hours in the vicinity of the Trump International Golf Club, according to his phone location data. Court documents said Routh allegedly dropped off a box at an unidentified person's home several months before the attempted assassination containing various letters. One letter, addressed to 'The World,' allegedly said: 'This was an assassination attempt on Donald Trump but I am so sorry I failed you.' 'I tried my best and gave it all the gumption I could muster,' it said. 'It is up to you now to finish the job; and I will offer $150,000 to whomever can complete the job.' It was the second assassination attempt on Trump this summer. The first took place on July 13 at a campaign rally in Butler, Pennsylvania, when a gunman opened fire on the former president, killing one person and wounding Trump in the ear. The candidate was otherwise unharmed, and the gunman was killed at the scene. The Routh case has been assigned at random to federal District Judge Aileen Cannon — a Trump appointee who dismissed criminal proceedings against the former president earlier this year over his retention of top-secret documents at his private residence.	https://www.voanews.com/a/man-accused-of-trump-assassination-plot-in-florida-pleads-not-guilty-/7804973.html	2024-09-30T11:09:27-07:00

Botswana leader, 3 from opposition confirmed as presidential candidates	Gaborone, Botswana — Botswana’s High Court has confirmed four presidential candidates will run in the country’s general elections next month. Among them is incumbent President Mokgweetsi Masisi, who is seeking a second and final term. By law, presidential candidates in Botswana must provide proof to the chief justice that they have the required number of supporters to be eligible to run. The High Court verified four out of five possible candidates had the required support. The presidential candidates will be Masisi; Duma Boko, leader of the opposition coalition Umbrella for Democratic Change (UDC); Dumelang Saleshando of the Botswana Congress Party (BCP); and Mephato Reatile from the Botswana Patriotic Front (BPF), according to Chief Justice Terrence Rannowane. Biggie Butale, from a smaller opposition group the Botswana Republican Party, failed to meet the requirements. Masisi, addressing party supporters outside the High Court, said Monday that he is confident of victory. 'We have completed the nomination process inside the High Court,' he said. 'We are all equal before the law, but politically we are more superior to them. Let us now go out and show them (the opposition) that we are bigger than them.' Boko told reporters that his party will not stand for a rigged election. In 2019, Boko and his party claimed the ruling Botswana Democratic Party (BDP) stole the election. 'If the election is free and fair, we will accept the outcome. But if things do not go well, like what happened in 2019, we will reject the results,' he said. 'We warn those organizing the election that they should not attempt to rig the election. We urge every voter who is committed to a democratic process to be on guard and ensure that there are no irregularities.' The UDC enters the Oct. 30 polls without the BCP party, which quit the coalition last year, citing differences in the opposition alliance. BCP spokesperson Mpho Pheko said her party is well organized heading into the country’s 13th general election. 'For the BCP, 2024 presents the best opportunity to change government in Botswana,' Pheko said. 'So, completing this nomination process presents a lot of excitement and a lot of hope. Hope that Batswana heard our message. We are the first party to complete the manifesto, to complete the primary elections, to complete the nomination process. We hope that Batswana can see that this is a party that is very serious about them as a people.' Pheko used the word 'Batswana,' which collectively refers to all citizens of Botswana. The president is elected indirectly by parliament in Botswana, with recent efforts to introduce direct voting rejected following nationwide consultations.	https://www.voanews.com/a/botswana-leader-3-from-opposition-confirmed-as-presidential-candidates-/7804891.html	2024-09-30T10:41:55-07:00

US sends a few thousand more troops to Middle East to boost security	Washington — The U.S. is sending an additional 'few thousand' troops to the Middle East to bolster security and to be prepared to defend Israel if necessary, the Pentagon said Monday. The increased presence will come from multiple fighter jet squadrons, Pentagon spokeswoman Sabrina Singh told reporters. It follows recent strikes in Lebanon and the assassination of Hezbollah leader Hassan Nasrallah, a significant escalation in the war in the Middle East, this time between Israel and Hezbollah. The additional force includes squadrons of F-15E Strike Eagle, F-16, A-10 and F-22 fighter jets and the personnel needed to support them. The jets were supposed to rotate in and replace the squadrons already there. Instead, both the existing and new squadrons will remain in place to double the airpower on hand. On Sunday, Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin also announced that he was temporarily extending the USS Abraham Lincoln carrier strike group and its associated squadrons in the region. The jets are not there to assist in an evacuation, Singh said, 'they are there for the protection of U.S. forces.'	https://www.voanews.com/a/us-sends-a-few-thousand-more-troops-to-middle-east-to-boost-security/7804836.html	2024-09-30T10:17:04-07:00	
Ukrainian, Hungarian FMs have 'frank' discussion	Budapest — Ukraine's new foreign minister held a 'frank' conversation with his Hungarian counterpart on 'difficult issues' on Monday, against a backdrop of a frosty relationship between the neighboring countries. Hungarian Prime Minister Viktor Orban has been the only EU leader to maintain close ties with the Kremlin since Russia's full-scale invasion of Ukraine in 2022. He has repeatedly stalled efforts to punish Moscow and to aid war-torn Ukraine in its fight against the invading forces. Budapest refuses to approve the release of more than $7.25 billion to Kyiv, complaining about discriminatory measures against Hungarian companies. 'We had a very frank one-on-one conversation discussing difficult issues, among other things,' Andriy Sybiga told reporters after a meeting with Hungary's top diplomat, Peter Szijjarto, in Budapest. The negotiations between the two ministers 'lasted about an hour, twice as long as planned,' according to a statement from the Ukrainian ministry. Speaking at a press conference, Sybiga welcomed Orban's first visit to Kyiv at the beginning of July and called for 'the development of bilateral relations,' saying he could 'count on Budapest's support' in its EU integration process. 'Our meeting today has convinced me that ... there is a mutual and common will to develop neighborly relations,' Szijjarto added. But Hungary's foreign minister also urged Kyiv to refrain from 'unilateral, sudden steps' that could 'pose a challenge' to the central European country's energy supply. In July, Budapest accused Kyiv of threatening its energy security by barring Russian energy giant Lukoil from using the Ukrainian section of the Druzhba pipeline. Earlier this month, Hungarian energy company MOL made a deal guaranteeing the supply of Russian oil. The two ministers also agreed to accelerate efforts by an intergovernmental working group set up to address a long-running feud over minority rights in Transcarpathia, a western Ukrainian region home to an ethnic Hungarian community.	https://www.voanews.com/a/ukrainian-hungarian-fms-have-frank-discussion-/7804833.html	2024-09-30T10:16:53-07:00	
Biden spoke with governors after Hurricane Helene, will visit affected areas	washington — U.S. President Joe Biden said on Monday he has spoken with the governors of Georgia and North Carolina after the states were affected by Hurricane Helene, which has killed more than 100 people, wiping out communications and leaving millions without power. Biden said he told North Carolina Governor Roy Cooper he would visit the state later this week, and he expects to be there by Wednesday or Thursday. He added he 'may have to request' that Congress returns for a special session to pass a supplemental funding package to help those affected. He said there are reports of 100 dead, with 600 people unaccounted for after the hurricane. 'We will be there with you as long as it takes,' Biden said. 'The Biden-Harris administration will be there until the job is done.' Emergency responders in North Carolina were racing on Monday to try to reach people who remain unaccounted for three days after Hurricane Helene ripped through the southeastern United States.	https://www.voanews.com/a/biden-spoke-with-governors-after-hurricane-helene-will-visit-affected-areas-/7804819.html	2024-09-30T09:46:04-07:00	
Thai court approves Vietnam's call for rights activist’s extradition	Bangkok — A Thai court Monday approved the extradition of a human rights activist to his native Vietnam, where rights groups say he faces a high risk of torture and cannot be guaranteed a fair hearing from his country’s courts. Y Quynh Bdap says he fled to Thailand in 2018 to evade arrest for his human rights work on behalf of the Montagnards, a predominantly Christian group of ethnic minorities who live in Vietnam’s central highlands. Thai police arrested him in Bangkok in June at Vietnam’s request. Vietnam wants Bdap back for his alleged role in fomenting a riot last year that left nine people dead, including four police officers, according to state media. Bdap says he had nothing to do with the riot. A Vietnamese court convicted him on related terrorism charges in absentia in January and sentenced him to 10 years in prison. Vietnam’s government has also labeled his group, Montagnards Stand for Justice, a terrorist organization. Bdap’s lawyer, Nadthasiri Bergman, said the judge ignored Thailand’s anti-torture law, which forbids deporting people to countries where they may face torture, claiming it was up to the government — not the courts — to enforce. The government has 90 days to decide whether to carry out the extradition request now that the court has approved it, unless Bdap and his lawyer appeal the verdict. Bergman said they would appeal, and that the 90 days would then begin only after the appeals process is over, should they lose again. If Bdap is ultimately forced back to Vietnam, Bergman said her client would be at serious physical risk, adding that the threat had been corroborated by the United Nations’ refugee agency, the UNHCR. Although Thailand does not legally recognize refugees, the UNHCR’s team in Thailand had granted Bdap one of its own refugee cards after assessing his claims. 'So long as he has [U.N.] refugee status, it means that he cannot go back to his home country, the country that he fled, because there is an existing and imminent threat to his life,' said Bergman. A spokesperson for the Thai government could not be reached for comment. Sunai Phasuk, a senior researcher for Human Rights Watch in Thailand, called Monday’s decision by the court 'shocking and disappointing' for ignoring both the country’s international obligations and its own law against refoulement. 'Vietnamese authorities have a long record of mistreating political dissidents, especially those who are on the wanted list like Y Quynh Bdap. So, there are concerns that he will be mistreated in custody of Vietnamese authorities; that includes torture, that includes enforced disappearance,' he told VOA. In May, Human Rights Watch published a detailed report alleging Thailand had made itself increasingly dangerous for foreign asylum-seekers over the past decade by engaging in an informal 'swap mart' with its neighbors, forcibly returning each other’s dissidents regardless of whether they may be arrested, tortured or killed back home. The passage of Thailand’s anti-torture law in 2022 raised hopes that the practice might wane. Sunai, though, said Bdap’s case was the first major test of the law’s refoulement clause, and that Thailand had failed. 'Not only [does] the court decision today put the life of Y Quynh Bdap in danger; it also sets a very dangerous precedent,' he said. 'Now, basically, repressive foreign governments can seek cooperation with Thai authorities to hunt down and extradite dissidents who live in exile in Thailand because Thailand cannot ensure their safety.' He said countries backing Thailand’s current bid for a rotating seat on the U.N.’s Human Rights Council should use their support as leverage to urge the government not to follow through with Bdap’s extradition. Several of the U.N.’s independent rights experts have also urged Thailand to reject Vietnam’s extradition request.	https://www.voanews.com/a/thai-court-approves-vietnam-s-call-for-rights-activist-s-extradition/7804732.html	2024-09-30T09:00:41-07:00

Taliban asserts new gains against Afghan-based IS offshoot amid skepticism	Islamabad — The Taliban said Monday that their security forces had killed and captured several 'key members' of a regional Islamic State affiliate for plotting recent terrorist attacks in Afghanistan, alleging that the suspects had crossed over from Pakistan. Zabihullah Mujahid, the Taliban spokesperson, listed the claims and so-called successes against Islamic State-Khorasan, or IS-K, locally known as Daesh, in a formal statement without providing evidence to support them. The assertions came after the country’s three immediate neighbors and Russia jointly urged the de facto Kabul government this past Friday to take 'visible and verifiable actions' against transnational terrorist groups, including IS-K, on Afghan soil. Mujahid said the IS-K operatives in question had been involved in several recent attacks in Afghanistan. They included a suicide bombing in the Afghan capital earlier this month and a May gun attack in the central city of Bamiyan, he added. Both attacks resulted in the deaths of at least ten people, including three Spanish tourists, with IS-K claiming credit for them at the time. The Taliban spokesperson said that IS-K insurgents had established 'new operational bases and training camps' in the Pakistani border provinces of Baluchistan and Khyber Pakhtunkhwa after fleeing Afghan counterterrorism security operations. 'From these new bases, they continue to orchestrate attacks, both within Afghanistan and in other countries,' he claimed, noting that 'some of the arrested individuals had recently returned to Afghanistan from the Daesh Khorasan training camp' in Balochistan. Islamabad has not immediately responded to the Taliban’s allegations, which came two days after neighboring Pakistan, China, and Iran, along with Russia, at a meeting in New York this past Friday, urged the Taliban to eradicate bases of IS-K and other transnational terrorist groups in Afghanistan. The ministerial meeting warned that these Afghan-based terrorist entities 'continue to pose a serious threat to regional and global security.' According to a joint statement released after the huddle, the participants recognized the Taliban's efforts in combating IS-K. 'They called on de facto authorities to take visible and verifiable actions in fulfilling the international obligations and commitments made by Afghanistan to fight terrorism, dismantle, and eliminate all terrorist groups equally and non-discriminatory and prevent the use of Afghan territory against its neighbors, the region, and beyond,' the statement stressed. It identified the groups in question as IS-K, al-Qaida, Eastern Turkestan Islamic Movement, ETIM, which opposes China, anti-Iran Jaish ul-Adl, and the Tehrik-i-Taliban Pakistan, TTP, as well as the Baloch Liberation Army, BLA, both waging attacks on Pakistani security forces and civilians. The United Nations, in a recent security assessment, also described TTP as 'the largest terrorist group' in Afghanistan, with several thousand operatives, noting that IS-K activities in the country are also turning into a significant regional threat. It noted that the group had intensified cross-border attacks in Pakistan since the Taliban regained power three years ago and is being facilitated by the de facto Afghan rulers. A new report issued Monday documented nearly 1,000 deaths of civilians and security forces in Pakistan during the first nine months of 2024. The Islamabad-based independent Center for Research and Security Studies stated that most of the fatalities resulted from attacks by TTP and BLA-led insurgents. Pakistani authorities have consistently urged Kabul to extradite TTP leaders and militants to Islamabad for trial for instigating deadly violence in the country. The Taliban has rejected Pakistani and U.N. allegations, saying they are not allowing any foreign groups, including TTP, to threaten other countries from Afghanistan. The United States has designated TTP and BLA as global terrorist organizations.	https://www.voanews.com/a/taliban-asserts-new-gains-against-afghan-based-is-offshoot-amid-skepticism/7804677.html	2024-09-30T08:49:48-07:00

France's Le Pen denies wrongdoing as she and her party go on trial accused of embezzling EU funds	Paris — French far-right leader Marine Le Pen denied violating any rules as she and her National Rally party and two dozen others went on trial on Monday, accused of embezzling European Parliament funds, in a case that has the potential to derail her political ambitions. Arriving at the court in Paris, Le Pen said she remained confident as 'we have not violated any political and regulatory rules of the European Parliament' and vowed to present the judges with 'extremely serious and extremely solid arguments.' Le Pen and other National Rally members casually greeted each other before sitting down in the first three rows of the packed courtroom. The nine-week trial will be closely watched by Le Pen's political rivals as she is a strong contender in the race to succeed Emmanuel Macron when the next presidential election takes place in 2027. It comes as a new government dominated by centrists and conservatives just came into office in the wake of June-July legislative elections. Some observers expect the trial could prevent National Rally lawmakers, including Le Pen herself, from fully playing their opposition role in Parliament as they would be busy focusing on the party's defense. Since stepping down as party leader three years ago, Le Pen has sought to position herself as a mainstream candidate capable of appealing to a broader electorate. Her efforts have paid off, with the party making significant gains in recent elections at both the European and national levels. But a guilty verdict could seriously undermine her bid to take the Elysee. The National Rally and 27 of its top officials are accused of having used money destined for EU parliamentary aides to pay staff who instead did political work for the party between 2004 and 2016, in violation of the 27-nation bloc's regulations. The National Rally was called National Front at the time. Le Pen, whose party has softened its anti-EU stance in recent years, denies wrongdoing and claims the case is politically driven. 'Parliamentary assistants do not work for the Parliament. They are political assistants to elected officials, political by definition,' she previously said. 'You ask me if I can define the tasks I assigned to my assistants; it depends on each person's skills. Some wrote speeches for me, and some handled logistics and coordination.' If found guilty, Le Pen and her co-defendants could face up to 10 years in prison and fines of up to 1 million euros ($1.1 million) each. Additional penalties, such as the loss of civil rights or ineligibility to run for office, could also be imposed, a scenario that could hamper, or even destroy, Le Pen's goal to mount another presidential bid after Macron's term ends. Le Pen was runner-up to Macron in the 2017 and 2022 presidential elections. She served as party president from 2011 to 2021 and now heads the group of RN lawmakers at the French National Assembly. Despite her denial, her party has already paid back 1 million to the European Parliament, the Parliament's lawyer Patrick Maisonneuve said. Of that amount, 330,000 euros were directly linked to Marine Le Pen's alleged misuse of funds. A longstanding controversy The legal proceedings stem from a 2015 alert raised by Martin Schulz, then-president of the European Parliament, to French authorities about possible fraudulent use of European funds by members of the National Front. Schulz also referred the case to the European Anti-Fraud Office, which launched a separate probe into the matter. The European Parliament's suspicions were further heightened when a 2015 organizational chart showed that 16 European lawmakers and 20 parliamentary assistants held official positions within the party — roles unrelated to their supposed duties as EU parliamentary staff. A subsequent investigation found that some assistants were contractually linked to different MEPs than the ones they were actually working for, suggesting a scheme to divert European funds to pay party employees in France. Misuse of public funds alleged Investigating judges concluded that Le Pen, as party leader, orchestrated the allocation of parliamentary assistance budgets and instructed MEPs to hire individuals holding party positions. These individuals were presented as EU parliamentary assistants, but in reality, were allegedly working for the National Rally in various capacities. The European Parliament's legal team is seeking 2.7 million euros in compensation for financial and reputational damages. This figure corresponds to the 3.7 million euros allegedly defrauded through the scheme, minus the 1 million euros already paid back. During the 2014 European elections, the National Front won a record 24 MEP seats, finishing first with 24.8% of the vote, ahead of the center-right and the Socialists. This surge resulted in a substantial financial windfall for the party, which faced severe financial problems at the time. An audit of the party's accounts between 2013 and 2016 revealed that it was running a deficit of 9.1 million euros by the end of 2016. Yet, the party still had a cash balance of 1.7 million euros and had lent 1 million euros to Le Pen's 2017 presidential campaign, while also holding 87,000 euros in loans to Cotelec, its funding association. At the time, the party was also indebted to a Russian bank for 9.4 million euros, a loan taken out in 2014 for 6 million euros. Suspected systemic practice The investigation uncovered many irregularities involving prominent party members. Thierry Légier, the long-time bodyguard of Le Pen's father Jean-Marie, was listed as his parliamentary assistant. But his resume did not reference this role, and he made no mention of it in his 2012 autobiography. Légier admitted during the investigation that he was not interviewed and signed his employment contract without fully understanding his official role. Jean-Marie Le Pen, who led the National Front from 1972 to 2011, will not appear in court alongside his former colleagues due to health concerns. Now 96, he was deemed unfit to testify by a court in June. He has 11 prior convictions, including for violence against a public official and hate speech. He has denied wrongdoing during his time as party leader, stating that the 'pool' of assistants was common knowledge. 'I did not choose which assistants were assigned to me. That was decided by Marine Le Pen and others. I only signed the contracts,' he said. After hearing a judge read the charges in court on Monday afternoon, Le Pen said she will 'answer all the questions the court may ask.'	https://www.voanews.com/a/france-s-le-pen-denies-wrongdoing-as-she-and-her-party-go-on-trial-accused-of-embezzling-eu-funds-/7804507.html	2024-09-30T06:41:17-07:00

Former President Jimmy Carter Reaches Historic 100th Birthday	Atlanta — In a celebration fit for a centenarian, the historic Fox theater in Atlanta recently hosted dozens of musical acts and thousands of guests for a concert celebrating the 100th birthday of Georgia’s one-time governor, former U.S. President Jimmy Carter. 'It’s a way to be together and I think that’s who he is fundamentally,' said Jason Carter, who said he believes the concert, featuring some performers that also campaigned for his grandfather in the 1970s, is a unifying – and bipartisan – way to celebrate what one documentary film director calls the 'Rock ‘n Roll President.' 'It’s one of those fundamental human connections that brings people together across geographies, across culture, across any sort of racial dividing lines,' Jason Carter told VOA during a press event ahead of the performances. 'You’ll have both Democrats and Republicans here tonight.' Despite the many speakers, actors, musicians and former presidents who sent video tributes, the one person noticeably absent from the celebration was Jimmy Carter himself. He remains in hospice care at his home 240 kilometers south of Atlanta. 'It’s a 600-person village in the middle of nowhere, and all of his other work at the end of the road in Africa, Mali, South Sudan, has been in those same kinds of 600-person villages,' Jason Carter said. 'He feels a kinship there and he feels a connection and the way that he marks this moment is by being at home.' Jason Carter said his grandfather will watch the concert broadcast on Georgia Public Television, as he celebrates his historic milestone birthday in Plains, Georgia, not far from where his story began, at the Wise Sanitarium, where on October 1, 1924, Lillian Carter, then a nurse at the facility, gave birth to the first U.S. president to have been born in a hospital. The facility is now called the Lillian G. Carter Nursing Center. 'But the only reason he was born in a hospital was because his mother was working that day,' Jill Stuckey, a Carter family friend, told VOA. Stuckey serves as superintendent of the Jimmy Carter National Historic Site in Plains which includes Carter’s preserved Depression-era boyhood farm, the old Plains High School where Carter studied and the railroad depot Carter converted into his campaign headquarters in his successful 1976 White House bid. 'After the hospice announcement nearly a year ago, I didn’t think we’d be at this point,' Stuckey said during an interview with VOA, standing next to a replica of the famous Resolute Desk from the White House Oval Office, now a big draw for tourists who visit Plains High School. Stuckey said Plains celebrates its famous neighbor every day, but this historic birthday is marked by serving others. 'We’re naturalizing 100 new citizens in his honor. Thanks to the secretary of the Navy, we’re having four F-18 jets flyover.' She said another, smaller birthday concert in the Plains High School auditorium is also meant to help the community celebrate the man who rose from being a local peanut farmer to president of the United States. 'He definitely deserves a lot of fanfare, because he’s definitely the greatest person I’ve ever met in my life,' she told VOA. Carter’s milestone is a bittersweet occasion in Plains, though, it’s the first Carter has spent since his wife, Rosalynn, died last November. 'Seventy-seven-and-a-half years of marriage, to be without your partner, your soul mate you know it’s very, very tough times,' said Stuckey, 'It’s tough times on him, but on all of us that knew her, that loved her, the family members.' Carter’s birthday celebration, which began at the Fox theater in September and ends in Plains October 1, brought his large extended family together, including his great-grandson, Charlie Carter, who hinted it may not be the last time such a gathering occurs. 'No… maybe his 101th?' Jimmy Carter also holds the record for the longest post-presidential career. After departing the White House in 1981, he and Rosalynn founded the Atlanta-based global nonprofit Carter Center, which fights neglected tropical diseases, promotes peaceful conflict resolution, and monitors elections around the world, causes which led to Carter winning the 2002 Nobel Peace Prize.	https://www.voanews.com/a/former-president-jimmy-carter-reaches-historic-100th-birthday/7804359.html	2024-09-30T04:17:20-07:00	
12 Tunisians dead as boat capsizes off Djerba	Tunis — At least 12 Tunisians including three children were found dead after a migrant boat capsized off the coast of the southeastern island of Djerba on Monday, a judicial official said. The boat went down at dawn and 29 people were rescued, Medenine court spokesman Fethi Baccouche told AFP, adding five men and four women were among the dead, and that the cause of the sinking remained unknown. The Tunisian National Guard said it was alerted by four migrants who swam back ashore. Tunisia and neighboring Libya have become key departure points for migrants seeking better lives in Europe, often risking dangerous Mediterranean crossings. The exodus is fueled by Tunisia's stagnant economy, with only 0.4% of growth in 2023 and unemployment soaring. The North African country has also been shaken by political tensions, after President Kais Saied orchestrated a sweeping power grab in July 2021. Each year, tens of thousands of people attempt to make the crossing, with Italy — whose Lampedusa island is only 150 kilometers (90 miles) away — often their first port of call. Since January 1, at least 103 makeshift boats have capsized and 341 bodies have been recovered off Tunisia's coast, the government says. Last year, more than 1,300 people died or disappeared last year in shipwrecks off Tunisia, according to the FTDES rights group. The International Organization for Migration has said more than 30,309 migrants have died in the Mediterranean in the past decade, including more than 3,000 last year.	https://www.voanews.com/a/tunisians-dead-as-boat-capsizes-off-djerba/7804350.html	2024-09-30T04:00:57-07:00	
Oil prices set to fall for third month despite Middle East conflict	London — Oil prices were steady on Monday and on track to fall for the third month in a row as a strong supply outlook and questions around demand outweighed fears that Israeli strikes in Lebanon and Yemen could escalate conflict in the Middle East. Brent crude futures LCOc1 for November delivery, expiring on Monday, lost 10 cents to $71.88 a barrel as of 0933 GMT. The more active December contract LCOc2 rose 6 cents to $71.60. U.S. West Texas Intermediate (WTI) futures CLc1 lost 10 cents to $68.08 a barrel. Both benchmarks had earlier gained more than $1. Brent was on track to lose almost 9% month-on-month, which would be its biggest decline since November 2022. WTI was set to decline more than 7% since the end of August. On Monday prices had been supported by the possibility that Iran, a key producer and member of the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries, may be directly drawn into a widening Middle East conflict. Since last week Israel has escalated attacks, conducting strikes which have killed Hezbollah and Hamas leaders in Lebanon and hit Houthi targets in Yemen. The three groups are backed by Iran. 'We suspect that some oil market participants will look past this escalation given that there still has not been a major physical supply disruption and Iran has not demonstrated any appetite to enter this nearly year-long conflict,' said Helima Croft of RBC Capital Markets. Oil prices also had a muted response to Beijing's announcement last week of fiscal stimulus measures in the world's second-biggest economy and top oil importer. Traders question whether the measures would be enough to boost China's weaker-than-expected demand so far this year. Data on Monday was not encouraging for demand, showing China's manufacturing activity shrank for a fifth straight month and the services sector slowed sharply in September. Instead, prices have been depressed by news that half a million barrels of Libyan crude exports may come back online as a central bank dispute is resolved, and a report that Saudi Arabia may stop targeting an oil price of $100 a barrel as OPEC+ begins to unwind voluntary supply cuts from December. Later on Monday, markets will be waiting to hear from Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell for clues on the central bank's pace of monetary easing. Seven other Fed policymakers are also due to speak this week, ANZ analysts said in a note.	https://www.voanews.com/a/oil-prices-set-to-fall-for-third-month-despite-middle-east-conflict-/7804328.html	2024-09-30T03:36:57-07:00	
Senior UK judge becomes fifth to leave top Hong Kong court	Hong Kong — A British judge on Hong Kong's Court of Final Appeal will step down after his term ends on Monday, the city's judiciary said, the fifth foreign justice to leave the bench this year. Judges from common law jurisdictions are invited to sit as non-permanent members in the former British colony's top court. Their presence has long been considered by authorities as a sign of international confidence in Hong Kong's justice system, which is separate from mainland China's opaque, party-controlled legal system. However, the judiciary has seen an unprecedented exodus this year, with Nicholas Addison Phillips being the latest to leave the bench. The 86-year-old has 'indicated recently that he did not wish to have his term of appointment extended upon its expiry on 30 September 2024 due to personal reasons,' the judiciary said in a statement on Monday. Authorities in Hong Kong have enacted two national security laws to quell dissent since huge, and at times violent, pro-democracy protests were quashed in 2019. The latest came into force in March, drawing criticism from Western nations, including Britain and the United States, about the legislation further curbing freedoms in Hong Kong. Two senior British judges resigned from Hong Kong's top court in June. One of them, Jonathan Sumption, 75, wrote an opinion piece in The Financial Times that he had resigned because 'rule of law is profoundly compromised.' The other, Lawrence Collins, 83, cited Hong Kong's 'political situation' as the reason for his resignation. The other two who declined to extend their terms, an Australian judge in March and a Canadian judge in July, cited old age and personal reasons for their resignations. Phillips, a former chief justice of the United Kingdom's Supreme Court, has served for 12 years since he joined the court in 2012. The judiciary thanked him for his 'support for the rule of law in Hong Kong during his tenure.' It said on Monday that 'despite the departure of some (non-permanent judges) in recent years, an overwhelming majority of the serving and departed (judges) have publicly reiterated their continued confidence in judicial independence in Hong Kong.' Six foreign judges will remain on the Court of Final Appeal following Phillips's departure. Hong Kong had five overseas judges sitting in its top court when the city was handed back to China in 1997. The bench gradually expanded to 15 members in 2019 and 2020 before downsizing for four consecutive years.	https://www.voanews.com/a/senior-uk-judge-becomes-fifth-to-leave-top-hong-kong-court/7804284.html	2024-09-30T02:30:25-07:00	
Police chief jailed for three years over S. Korea crowd crush: Yonhap	SEOUL, South Korea — A South Korean court handed a three-year jail term Monday to a former Seoul district police chief over a crush that killed more than 150 people, the Yonhap news agency reported. Tens of thousands of people, mostly in their 20s and 30s, had been out on October 29, 2022, to enjoy the first post-pandemic Halloween celebrations in the popular Itaewon nightlife district. But the night turned deadly when people poured into a narrow, sloping alleyway between bars and clubs, the weight of their bodies and a lack of effective crowd control leading to scores of people being crushed to death. Former Yongsan district police chief Lee Im-jae was found guilty of failing to prevent the crush, the first police officer to be convicted for a direct role in the disaster. 'It was foreseeable that there would be a large crowd of people in the sloped alley of Itaewon that would lead to serious danger to life and physical safety on the Halloween weekend in 2022,' the Seoul Western District Court said in the guilty verdict, Yonhap reported. Another former officer in charge of the Yongsan police emergency center was sentenced Monday to two years in jail on the same charges. 'This ruling, which acknowledges the responsibility of police officers in connection to the tragedy, is a rightful outcome in holding those responsible for the disaster accountable,' a group of victims' families said in a statement. The Seoul court, however, found local official Park Hee-young, head of the Yongsan Ward office, not guilty on similar charges. 'The direct cause of the accident in this case was the influx of a large crowd,' the court said, according to the Korean news agency Newsis. 'There are no existing regulations granting administrative authorities the power to control the crowd influx or disperse crowds,' it said in acquitting Park and three former ward officials. Police chief verdict Earlier this year, two former senior police officers were jailed for destroying evidence linked to the crush, making them the first police to be sentenced in connection to the incident. The court found that in the aftermath of the disaster, they had ordered the deletion of four internal police reports that had identified in advance safety concerns over possible overcrowding in the area. Kim Kwang-ho, the former head of the Seoul Metropolitan Police Agency, has also been on trial and is awaiting a verdict on charges of professional negligence resulting in injury or death. Prosecutors are seeking a five-year term for the ex-chief, with a verdict expected next month. Kim has denied wrongdoing, telling the court in April: 'Instead of seeking a scapegoat, real preventive measures should be carried out,' broadcaster JTBC has reported. District-level officials have been prosecuted over the disaster, but no high-ranking members of government have resigned or faced prosecution, despite criticism from victims' families over a lack of accountability. South Korea's rapid transformation from a war-torn country to Asia's fourth-largest economy and a global cultural powerhouse is a source of national pride. But a series of preventable disasters, such as the 2022 crush and the 2014 Sewol ferry sinking that killed 304 people, has shaken public confidence in authorities.	https://www.voanews.com/a/police-chief-jailed-for-three-years-over-s-korea-crowd-crush-yonhap/7804278.html	2024-09-30T02:23:58-07:00	
Australian treasurer makes landmark visit to China	SYDNEY — Australian Treasurer Jim Chalmers has been in China on a landmark visit to stabilize his country’s relationship with its biggest trading partner. The trip, the first by an Australian treasurer to Beijing in seven years, is a sign that bilateral ties are improving after years of mistrust. But frictions persist, including tensions in the South China Sea. Chalmers' two-day trip to China has been aimed at repairing ties with Australia's largest trading partner, damaged by disagreements over trade and geopolitics. In Beijing, Chalmers has discussed boosting economic ties with his Chinese hosts. The Australian treasurer has been upbeat about prospects for the Chinese economy, despite its recent slowdown. He told the Australian Broadcasting Corp. Monday that Canberra and Beijing can do more to boost trade. 'There could not have been a more important time for us to restart our strategic economic dialogue with China,' he said. 'The Chinese authorities announced some quite substantial steps when it comes to supporting growth in the Chinese economy.' Last week, China said it carried out a rare test launch of an intercontinental ballistic missile into international waters, prompting anger in neighboring countries. Defense officials in Beijing insisted the test firing that involved a dummy warhead was a 'routine' part of its 'annual training.' Chalmers said Friday that he had voiced his concerns about the launch to Chinese government officials. Australia’s shadow foreign affairs minister Simon Birmingham told local media that the Canberra government must continue to urge Beijing to show restraint. The message of regional and global stability, and the role China can play by not undertaking aggressive military postures in the South China Sea, is important for the economy, Birmingham said. Australia's center-left government has made the stabilization of ties with China a priority since it came to power in May 2022. But it must balance its key commercial relationship with China with growing security ties with its traditional allies. The Canberra government says the AUKUS nuclear-powered submarine pact is 'on track' and will 'endure for decades' after a meeting of Australian, American and British defense ministers in London last Thursday. The 2021 trilateral accord is considered by analysts to be a response to China’s growing assertiveness in the Indo-Pacific region. It will give Australia the technology and hardware to build, run and maintain nuclear-powered submarines. Beijing has insisted the security pact undermines peace and stability.	https://www.voanews.com/a/australian-treasurer-makes-landmark-visit-to-china/7804265.html	2024-09-30T01:25:20-07:00

Austria's rightward shift puts immigration in crosshairs	VIENNA — Picknicking with friends in the park after prayers at a Vienna mosque, Saima Arab, a 20-year-old pedicurist originally from Afghanistan, is thankful for her freedoms in Austria. 'We could never do this in Afghanistan, never cook, go out, just sit in public like this,' said Arab, who came to Austria in 2017. 'Home is like a prison there.' Many Austrians, however, are worried about their country's ability to integrate migrants, especially Muslims, and their desire for stricter immigration laws was a key issue in Sunday's election which gave victory to the far-right Freedom Party (FPO) for the first time. Both the FPO and the runner-up, the ruling conservative Austrian People's Party (OVP), ran on pledges to tighten asylum laws and crack down on illegal immigration. The FPO victory added to critics' concerns about the rise of the far right in Europe after electoral gains in recent months by the Alternative for Germany and the National Rally in France. 'Whatever the government looks like after the election, I'm certain it'll work towards toughening up asylum and immigration law,' Professor Walter Obwexer, an adviser to the government on migration law, said before the vote. Arab, who also spoke to Reuters in an interview conducted before the election, said she did not like to talk about politics but hoped she too would vote in Austria one day. The number of people in Austria born abroad or whose parents were jumped by more than a third between 2015 and last year, and now account for around 27% of the population of about 9 million. Together the FPO and the OVP won over 55% of the vote and one of the two is almost certain to lead the next government, feeding expectations that Austria, like neighboring Germany and Hungary, and France, will adopt tougher rules. Opinion polls showed immigration and inflation were key voter concerns. Such is the worry that Austria is taking in migrants faster than it can integrate them that even some Austrians of Muslim origin feel Austria is stretched. 'I wonder if the system is close to collapse,' said Mehmet Ozay, a Turkish-born Austrian FPO supporter, arguing there were too many asylum seekers not contributing to state coffers. Taylor Swift concert The FPO has combined its tough talk on immigration with criticism of Islam. The issue took center stage last month when police arrested a teenager with North Macedonian roots on suspicion of masterminding a failed Islamic State-inspired attack on a Taylor Swift concert in Vienna. Running on the campaign slogan 'Fortress Austria,' the FPO promoted 'remigration,' including returning asylum seekers to their countries of origin, especially if they fail to integrate, and limiting asylum rights. That has unsettled some who feel the party, which dropped some of its more polarizing slogans in the campaign, is demonizing foreigners. The FPO, which did not reply to a request for comment, denies this. It says asylum seekers are a drain on state resources, and draws attention to crimes some of them commit. 'The FPO routinely talk about refugees and asylum seekers as rapists and thieves and drug dealers,' said Hedy, a social worker and Austrian citizen who arrived as a refugee from Afghanistan. He declined to give his last name. 'Something very similar happened to the Jews in Vienna before the Second World War,' he said, adding that the FPO, which wants to ban 'political Islam,' would embolden xenophobes. The FPO, whose first leader was a former Nazi lawmaker, has sought to distance itself from its past, and in 2019 helped pass a law allowing foreign descendants of Austrian victims of National Socialism to acquire Austrian citizenship. This month FPO leader Herbert Kickl called Adolf Hitler the 'biggest mass murderer in human history,' as he roundly denounced the Nazi dictator's legacy in a television debate. Still, Alon Ishay, head of the Austrian Association of Jewish Students, said he saw some parallels between targeting of Jews in the early Nazi era and attitudes to Muslims now. 'There are rhetorical similarities when you talk about deportation, when you talk about taking people's citizenship away,' he said, also speaking before Sunday's election. FPO-backer Ozay disagreed, saying that Muslims such as himself were free to do as they liked in Austria. 'If there were daily attacks by FPO voters I would understand the fear that things would get even more extreme if Kickl came to power,' he said. 'But that's not how it is. It's just fear stirred up by the other parties.'	https://www.voanews.com/a/austria-s-rightward-shift-puts-immigration-in-crosshairs/7804238.html	2024-09-29T23:51:08-07:00

Norway mulls building a fence on Russian border, following Finland's example	HELSINKI — Norway may put a fence along part or all the 198-kilometer (123-mile) border it shares with Russia, a minister said, a move inspired by a similar project in its Nordic neighbor Finland. 'A border fence is very interesting, not only because it can act as a deterrent but also because it contains sensors and technology that allow you to detect if people are moving close to the border,' Justice Minister Emilie Enger Mehl said in an interview with the Norwegian public broadcaster NRK published late Saturday. She said the Norwegian government is currently looking at 'several measures' to beef up security on the border with Russia in the Arctic north, such as fencing, increasing the number of border staff or stepping up monitoring. The Storskog border station, which has witnessed only a handful of illegal border crossing attempts in the past few years, is the only official crossing point into Norway from Russia. Should the security situation in the delicate Arctic area worsen, the Norwegian government is ready to close the border on short notice, said Enger Mehl, who visited neighboring Finland this summer to learn about how the entire 1,340-kilometer (830-mile) Finnish-Russian land border was closed. The Finnish government was prompted to close all crossing points from Russia to Finland in late 2023 after more than 1,300 third-country migrants without proper documentation or visas — an unusually high number — entered the country in three months, just months after the nation became a member of NATO. To prevent Moscow using migrants in what the Finnish government calls Russia’s 'hybrid warfare,' Helsinki is currently building fences with a total length of up to 200 kilometers (124 miles) in separate sections along the border zone that makes up part of NATO’s northern flank and serves as the European Union’s external border. Finnish border officials say fences equipped with top-notch surveillance equipment — to be located mostly around crossing points — are needed to better monitor and control any migrants attempting to cross over from Russia and give officials time to react. Inspired by Finland’s project, Enger Mehl said that such a fence could also be a good idea for Norway. According to NRK, her statement was supported by police chief Ellen Katrine Hætta in Norway’s northern Finnmark county. 'It’s a measure that may become relevant on all or part of the border' between Norway and Russia, Enger Mehl said. The Storskog border station is currently surrounded by a 200-meter (660-foot) -long and 3.5-meter (12-foot) -high fence erected in 2016 after some 5,000 migrants and asylum-seekers had crossed over from Russia to Norway a year earlier. Norway, a nation of 5.6 million, is a NATO member but isn't part of the European Union. However, it belongs to the EU's Schengen area, whose participants have abolished border controls at their mutual borders, guaranteeing free movement of citizens.	https://www.voanews.com/a/norway-mulls-building-a-fence-on-russian-border-following-finland-s-example/7804160.html	2024-09-29T17:35:50-07:00	
Kris Kristofferson, singer-songwriter and actor, dies at 88	Los Angeles — Kris Kristofferson, a Rhodes scholar with a deft writing style and rough charisma who became a country music superstar and A-list Hollywood actor, has died. Kristofferson died at his home in Maui, Hawaii on Saturday, family spokesperson Ebie McFarland said in an email. He was 88. McFarland said Kristofferson died peacefully, surrounded by his family. No cause was given. He was 88. Starting in the late 1960s, the Brownsville, Texas native wrote such classics standards as 'Sunday Mornin' Comin' Down,' 'Help Me Make It Through the Night,' 'For the Good Times' and 'Me and Bobby McGee.' Kristofferson was a singer himself, but many of his songs were best known as performed by others, whether Ray Price crooning 'For the Good Times' or Janis Joplin belting out 'Me and Bobby McGee.' Kristofferson, who could recite William Blake from memory, wove intricate folk music lyrics about loneliness and tender romance into popular country music. With his long hair and bell-bottomed slacks and counterculture songs influenced by Bob Dylan, he represented a new breed of country songwriters along with such peers as Willie Nelson, John Prine and Tom T. Hall. 'There's no better songwriter alive than Kris Kristofferson,' Nelson said during a November 2009 award ceremony for Kristofferson held by BMI. 'Everything he writes is a standard and we're all just going to have to live with that.' As an actor, he played the leading man opposite Barbara Streisand and Ellen Burstyn, but also had a fondness for shoot-out Westerns and cowboy dramas. He was a Golden Gloves boxer and football player in college, received a master’s degree in English from Merton College at the University of Oxford in England and turned down an appointment to teach at the U.S. Military Academy at West Point, New York, to pursue songwriting in Nashville. Hoping to break into the industry, he worked as a part-time janitor at Columbia Records’ Music Row studio in 1966 when Dylan recorded tracks for the seminal 'Blonde on Blonde' double album. At times, the legend of Kristofferson was larger than real life. Johnny Cash liked to tell a mostly exaggerated story of how Kristofferson, a former U.S. Army pilot, landed a helicopter on Cash’s lawn to give him a tape of 'Sunday Mornin’ Comin’ Down' with a beer in one hand. Over the years in interviews, Kristofferson said with all respect to Cash, while he did land a helicopter at Cash’s house, the ‘man in black’ wasn’t even home at the time, the demo tape was a song that no one ever actually cut, and he certainly couldn’t fly a helicopter holding a beer. In a 2006 interview with The Associated Press, he said he might not have had a career without Cash. 'Shaking his hand when I was still in the Army backstage at the Grand Ole Opry was the moment I’d decided I’d come back,' Kristofferson said. 'It was electric. He kind of took me under his wing before he cut any of my songs. He cut my first record that was record of the year. He put me on stage the first time.' One of his most recorded songs, 'Me and Bobby McGee,' was written based on a recommendation from Monument Records founder Fred Foster. Foster had a song title in his head called 'Me and Bobby McKee,' named after a female secretary in his building. Kristofferson said in an interview in the magazine, Performing Songwriter, that he was inspired to write the lyrics about a man and woman on the road together after watching the Frederico Fellini film, 'La Strada.' Joplin, who had a close relationship with Kristofferson, changed the lyrics to make Bobby McGee a man and cut her version just days before she died in 1970 from a drug overdose. The recording became a posthumous No. 1 hit for Joplin. Hits that Kristofferson recorded include 'Why Me,' 'Loving Her Was Easier (Than Anything I’ll Ever Do),' 'Watch Closely Now,' 'Desperados Waiting for a Train,' 'A Song I’d Like to Sing' and 'Jesus Was a Capricorn.' In 1973, he married fellow songwriter Rita Coolidge and together they had a successful duet career that earned them two Grammy awards. They divorced in 1980.	https://www.voanews.com/a/kris-kristofferson-singer-songwriter-and-actor-dies-at-88/7803884.html	2024-09-29T16:42:08-07:00	
Harris to campaign again in swing-state Nevada	Los Angeles — Vice President Kamala Harris is set to rally in Las Vegas on Sunday night as both she and Republican Donald Trump continue to make frequent trips to Nevada, looking to gain momentum in the swing state as Election Day nears. The rally is part of Harris' latest West Coast swing, which included making her first trip to the U.S.-Mexico border since taking over for President Joe Biden atop the Democratic presidential ticket. On Friday, the vice president walked alongside a towering, rust-colored border wall fitted with barbed wire in Douglas, Arizona, and met with federal authorities. She attended a San Francisco fundraiser Saturday and had plans for a Sunday event in Los Angeles before heading to Nevada, with a return to Washington set for Monday night. 'This race is as close as it could possibly be,' she said Saturday to a raucous crowd of donors. 'This is a margin-of-error race.' Harris said even if there is enthusiasm, she's running like an underdog. And she invited people to 'join our team in battleground states' to help get voters to the polls — even if it's Californians making calls from home. On Sunday, former Arizona Sen. Jeff Flake became the latest prominent Republican to endorse Harris and Walz. He credited them with a 'fine character and love of country' and said he wants a president who does not treat political adversaries as enemies or try to subvert the will of voters. Flake, a longtime critic of the former president, joins a list of anti-Trump Republicans who have said they will vote for the Democratic ticket, not just refrain from voting for Trump. Among them is Dick Cheney, the deeply conservative former vice president, and his daughter, Liz. On Sunday, Maryland Senate candidate Larry Hogan, a former Republican governor and a sharp critic of Trump, said Harris has yet to earn his vote, though Trump won't get it. In Nevada, all voters automatically receive ballots by mail unless they opt out — a pandemic-era change that was set in state law. That means most ballots could start going out in a matter of weeks, well before Election Day on Nov. 5. Harris plans to be back in Las Vegas on Oct. 10 for a town hall with Hispanic voters. Both she and Republican rival Donald Trump have campaigned frequently in the city, highlighting the critical role that Nevada, and its mere six votes in the Electoral College, could play in deciding an election expected to be exceedingly close. Trump held his own Las Vegas rally on Sept. 13 at the Expo World Market Center, where Harris is speaking Sunday. Her campaign has frequently scheduled events in the same venue where her opponent previously spoke, including in Milwaukee, Atlanta and suburban Phoenix. During his Las Vegas event, the former president singled out people crossing into the U.S. illegally, saying Harris 'would be the president of invasion.' During a campaign stop in the city in June, Trump promised to eliminate taxes on tips received by waiters, hotel workers and thousands of other service industry employees. Harris used her own Las Vegas rally in August to make the same promise. Fully doing away with federal taxes on tips would probably require an act from Congress. Still, Nevada's Culinary Union, which represents 60,000 hospitality workers in Las Vegas and Reno, has endorsed Harris. Ted Pappageorge, the culinary union's secretary-treasurer, said the difference between the dueling no-taxes-on-tips proposals is that Harris has also pledged to tackle what his union calls 'sub-minimum wage,' where employers pay service industry workers small salaries and meet minimum wage thresholds by expecting employees to supplement those with tips. Harris has no public schedule for Tuesday, when her running mate, Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz, squares off against Republican Ohio Sen. JD Vance for the first and only vice presidential debate of the campaign. But Harris and Walz will campaign jointly on Wednesday, making a bus tour with various stops through central Pennsylvania. The campaign says that during that swing, both will emphasize plans to energize U.S. manufacturing, including by using tax credits to encourage steel production and overhaul federal permitting systems to increase American construction.	https://www.voanews.com/a/harris-to-campaign-again-in-swing-state-nevada/7803883.html	2024-09-29T16:33:14-07:00	
China hails 'Queen Wen,' the tennis star who fulfilled a dream	Beijing — Zheng Qinwen's parents sold the family home to fund her tennis dreams and now she is an Olympic champion and China's biggest current sports star. The 21-year-old is playing at home for the first time since becoming the first Chinese player to win an Olympic singles tennis gold when she triumphed in Paris. She did not disappoint in her opening match at the China Open, sweeping aside 71st-ranked Russian Kamilla Rakhimova 6-1, 6-1 in front of an adoring Beijing crowd Saturday. Zheng was taken aback by the atmosphere, calling it 'insane' and saying she had hardly ever seen a crowd so full. 'I was a little bit shocked,' said Zheng, who trains in Barcelona and is at a best-ever ranking of seven in the world but tipped to go higher. Zheng has already earned more than $5 million in prize money and also has numerous endorsements from major global brands including Nike and Rolex. Off court she has also appeared on the front pages of GQ magazine and Harper's Bazaar. Known as 'Queen Wen' in China, Zheng has won three WTA Tour titles, and this year reached her first Grand Slam final at the Australian Open. She was comprehensively beaten 6-3, 6-2 by defending champion Aryna Sabalenka, who beat the Chinese again in straight sets at the recent U.S. Open. The world No. 2 from Belarus, who went on to win the U.S. Open, is the top seed in the Chinese capital this week and the two players are on course to meet in the semi-finals. Zheng says she is a better player now than she was in Melbourne and with the crowd behind her she could take some stopping. She faces Nadia Podoroska of Argentina in the third round. Michelle Zhang, a local fan at the China Open whose two children play tennis, said, 'We admire her for doing a lot for the country.' Friend Adele Xue added, 'she showed people that Chinese people can play tennis.' Never gives up Zheng grew up idolizing Li Na, the Chinese trailblazer who won two Grand Slam titles. Li's French Open triumph in 2011 made her the first player from Asia to win a major singles crown. Li is from Wuhan, where Zheng moved as a child to pursue her tennis ambitions. After the China Open, Wuhan is the next stop on the WTA Tour and Zheng would dearly love to win there. Known as approachable and friendly off court, Zheng is fiercely determined and competitive on it. She was talented in multiple sports as a child and her father Zheng Jianping was a track-and-field athlete. Jianping said Zheng's interest in tennis was sparked by a trip to Beijing to watch the Olympics when she was six years old. After returning from the capital, Zheng began learning tennis and her ability was soon noticed by local talent scouts. Two years later her father took her from their home in Shiyan to the provincial capital Wuhan for professional training. 'One of the best things about this child is that she never gives up,' her Wuhan coach, Yu Liqiao, told local media. After winning Olympic gold in Paris, Zheng revealed that her father had sold the family house to fund her budding tennis career when she was in her teens. Her mother Deng Fang sold train tickets at a railway station but gave up the job to make sure her daughter slept and ate properly during training. Zheng was among the millions of tennis fans glued to their televisions in China to see Li Na win the Australian Open in 2014. Zheng, then 11, was interviewed on television and confidently stated that she was aiming for the top. 'I want to play in the Grand Slams and fight for championships,' she said.	https://www.voanews.com/a/china-hails-queen-wen-the-tennis-star-who-fulfilled-a-dream/7803878.html	2024-09-29T16:06:07-07:00	
Russian PM to meet with Iranian president in Tehran	Moscow — Russia announced Sunday that Prime Minister Mikhail Mishustin will meet Iranian President Masoud Pezeshkian in Tehran on Monday. The announcement came as Russia has condemned Israel's 'political murder' of Iran-backed Hezbollah chief Hassan Nasrallah in Beirut. Mishustin will hold talks with Pezeshkian and First Vice President Mohammad Reza Aref, the government statement said. 'It is planned to discuss the full range of Russian-Iranian cooperation in the trade and economic and cultural and humanitarian spheres,' Russia said. The talks will focus on 'carrying out large joint projects in fields involving transport energy, industry and agriculture,' the statement added. Western governments have accused Iran of supplying both drones and missiles to Moscow for its war on Ukraine, a charge Tehran has repeatedly denied. Pezeshkian is set to hold talks with Russian President Vladimir Putin during a visit to Russia next month to attend the BRICS summit. After leaving Iran, Russian Prime Minister Mishustin will attend a meeting in Armenia on Tuesday of the Eurasian Economic Forum, the government said Sunday, referring to a body within the framework of a grouping of former Soviet states. The statement said the meeting would discuss digitalization, market operations and cooperation within the Eurasian Economic Union, made up of Armenia, Belarus, Kazakhstan, Kyrgyzstan and Russia. Russia often presents the Eurasian Economic Union (EEU) as an alternative to Western political and economic groupings.	https://www.voanews.com/a/russian-pm-to-meet-with-iranian-president-in-tehran/7803874.html	2024-09-29T15:52:49-07:00	
Iran's president denounces Israeli attacks on Tehran's regional allies	Dubai, UAE — Israel should not be allowed to attack countries in the Iran-aligned 'Axis of Resistance' one after the other, Iranian President Masoud Pezeshkian said Sunday. Israel said it had bombed Houthi targets in Yemen on Sunday, expanding its confrontation with Iran's allies in the region after killing the Hezbollah leader Sayyed Hassan Nasrallah on Friday in an escalating conflict in Lebanon. Pezeshkian, in comments carried by state media, said Lebanon should be supported. 'Lebanese fighters should not be left alone in this battle so that the Zionist regime (Israel) does not attack Axis of Resistance countries one after the other,' he said. An Iranian Revolutionary Guards deputy commander, Abbas Nilforoushan, was also killed in the attack that killed the Hezbollah leader in Beirut. 'We cannot accept such actions, and they will not be left unanswered. A decisive reaction is necessary,' Pezeshkian said. Iran's Foreign Ministry spokesperson Nasser Kanaani condemned the Israeli strikes in Yemen, saying in a statement that they had targeted 'civilian infrastructure' such as a power plant and fuel tanks. 'Iran once again warns about the consequences of the Zionist regime's (Israel) warmongering on regional and international peace and security,' spokesperson Nasser Kanaani added. In another Israeli attack on Yemen in July, fighter jets bombed 'dual-use sites such as energy infrastructure' in Hodeidah, with Israel's military spokesperson saying the port was used by the Houthis to receive Iranian weapons shipments.	https://www.voanews.com/a/iran-president-denounces-israeli-attacks-on-tehran-s-regional-allies/7803872.html	2024-09-29T15:43:55-07:00	
Stuck NASA astronauts welcome SpaceX capsule to bring them home next year	Cape Canaveral, Florida — The two astronauts stuck at the International Space Station since June welcomed their new ride home with Sunday's arrival of a SpaceX capsule. SpaceX launched the rescue mission on Saturday with a downsized crew of two astronauts and two empty seats reserved for Butch Wilmore and Suni Williams, who will return next year. The Dragon capsule docked in darkness high over Botswana as the two craft soared 420 kilometers above Earth. NASA switched Wilmore and Williams to SpaceX following concerns over the safety of their Boeing Starliner capsule. It was the first Starliner test flight with a crew, and NASA decided the thruster failures and helium leaks that cropped up after liftoff were too serious and poorly understood to risk the test pilots' return. So Starliner returned to Earth empty earlier this month. The Dragon carrying NASA's Nick Hague and the Russian Space Agency's Alexander Gorbunov will remain at the space station until February, turning what should have been a weeklong trip for Wilmore and Williams into a mission lasting more than eight months. Two NASA astronauts were pulled from the mission to make room for Wilmore and Williams on the return leg. NASA likes to replace its station crews every six months or so. SpaceX has provided the taxi service since the company's first astronaut flight in 2020. NASA also hired Boeing for ferry flights after the space shuttles were retired, but flawed software and other Starliner issues led to years of delays and more than $1 billion in repairs. Starliner inspections are underway at NASA's Kennedy Space Center, with post-flight reviews of data set to begin this week. 'We're a long way from saying, 'Hey, we're writing off Boeing,'' NASA's associate administrator Jim Free said at a pre-launch briefing. The arrival of two fresh astronauts means the four who have been up there since March can now return to Earth in their own SpaceX capsule in just over a week. Their stay was extended a month because of the Starliner turmoil. Although Saturday's liftoff went well, SpaceX said the rocket's spent upper stage ended up outside its targeted impact zone in the Pacific because of a bad engine firing. The company has halted all Falcon launches until it figures out what went wrong.	https://www.voanews.com/a/stuck-nasa-astronauts-welcome-spacex-capsule-to-bring-them-home-next-year/7803866.html	2024-09-29T15:34:31-07:00	
Top Iranian general died in Israeli strike that killed Hezbollah leader	Dubai, UAE — A prominent general in Iran's paramilitary Revolutionary Guard died in an Israeli airstrike that killed Hezbollah leader Hassan Nasrallah in Beirut, Iranian media reported Saturday. The killing of Gen. Abbas Nilforushan marks the latest casualty suffered by Iran as the nearly yearlong Israel-Hamas war in the Gaza Strip teeters on the edge of becoming a regional conflict. His death ratchets up pressure on Iran to respond, even as Tehran has signaled in recent months that it wants to negotiate with the West over sanctions crushing its economy. Nilforushan, 58, was killed Friday in the strike in Lebanon in which Nasrallah died, the state-owned newspaper Tehran Times reported. Ahmad Reza Pour Khaghan, the deputy head of Iran’s judiciary, also confirmed Nilforushan's death, describing him as a 'guest to the people of Lebanon,' the state-run IRNA news agency said. Khaghan also reportedly said that Iran had the right to retaliate under international law.Nilforushan served as the deputy commander for operations in the Guard, a role overseeing its ground forces. What he was doing in Lebanon on Friday wasn't immediately clear. The Guard's expeditionary Quds Force for decades has armed, trained and relied on Hezbollah as part of its strategy to rely on regional militias as a counterbalance to Israel and the United States. Nilforushan, like other members of the Guard that view Israel as Iran's main enemy, long mocked and criticized the country. 'The Zionist regime has many ethnic, cultural, social and military rifts. It is in vulnerable and in doom status more than before,' Nilforushan said in 2022, according to an IRNA report. The U.S. Treasury sanctioned Nilforushan in 2022 and said he had led an organization 'directly in charge of protest suppression.' Those sanctions came amid the monthslong protests in Iran over the death of Mahsa Amini following her arrest for allegedly not wearing her headscarf, or hijab, to the liking of police. At the time, Nilforushan accused Iran's enemies abroad of stoking the demonstrations led by Iranian women that challenged both the mandatory hijab and the country's theocracy. Nilforushan also served in Syria, backing President Bashar Assad in his country’s decades-long war that grew out of the 2011 Arab Spring. Like many of his colleagues, he began his military career in the Iran-Iraq war of the 1980s. In 2020, Iranian state television called him a 'comrade' of Gen. Qassem Soleimani, the head of its expeditionary Quds Force who was killed in a U.S. drone attack in Baghdad that year. Nilforushan's death comes as Iran in recent months has been signaling it wants to change its tack with the West after years of tensions stemming from then-President Donald Trump's unilateral withdrawal of America from Tehran's nuclear deal with world powers in 2018. In July, Iranian voters elected reformist President Masoud Pezeshkian following a helicopter crash that killed President Ebrahim Raisi, a hard-line protege to 85-year-old Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei. While critical of Israel, Pezeshkian has maintained that Iran is willing to negotiate over its nuclear program, which now enriches uranium to near weapons-grade levels. While Iran has been able to sell oil abroad despite sanctions, it likely was at a steep discount and energy prices have fallen farther in recent weeks. Meanwhile, Iran still threatens to retaliate for Soleimani's killing and the suspected Israeli assassination in Tehran of Hamas leader Ismail Haniyeh in July. Iran hasn't explained why it hasn't struck yet, though an unprecedented direct attack it launched in April on Israel failed to seriously damage any major target.	https://www.voanews.com/a/top-iranian-general-died-in-israeli-strike-that-killed-hezbollah-leader/7803864.html	2024-09-29T15:24:07-07:00	
Taiwan on alert over 'multiple waves' of missile firings in inland China	Taipei, Taiwan — Taiwan's Defense Ministry said Sunday it was on alert after detecting 'multiple waves' of missile firing deep in inland China, days after Beijing said it had carried out a successful test launch of an intercontinental ballistic missile. Democratically governed Taiwan, which China views as its own territory, keeps a close watch on Chinese military drills given Beijing's regular activities around the island, but only rarely releases details of what it sees taking place inside China. The ministry said that starting from 6:50 a.m. (2250 GMT Saturday) it had detected 'multiple waves of firing' by China's Rocket Force and army in the provinces and regions of Inner Mongolia, Gansu, Qinghai and Xinjiang, which all lie at least 2,000 km (1,200 miles) from Taiwan. Taiwan's forces are 'continuously monitoring relevant developments, and air defense forces have maintained a high level of vigilance and strengthened their alert,' the ministry added in a statement. China's Defense Ministry did not answer calls seeking comment outside of office hours. The Rocket Force oversees China's conventional and nuclear missile arsenal. On Thursday, Taiwan's Defense Ministry raised the alarm over a renewed surge of Chinese military activity around the island and live fire drills, accusing Beijing of policy instability. China's military responded by saying its activities around Taiwan were 'legitimate' and its drills would continue. A day earlier, China said it had successfully conducted a rare launch of an intercontinental ballistic missile, or ICBM, into the Pacific Ocean. In August 2022, China fired missiles into the waters around Taiwan during war games to express anger at a visit to Taipei by then-Speaker of the U.S. House of Representatives Nancy Pelosi. Taiwan operates powerful radar stations on some of the peaks of its central mountain range that can look far into China, according to security sources.	https://www.voanews.com/a/taiwan-on-alert-over-multiple-waves-of-missile-firings-in-inland-china/7803861.html	2024-09-29T15:14:35-07:00	
China cutting mortgage rates by end-October as cities ease home-buying curbs	Beijing — China's central bank said Sunday it would tell banks to lower mortgage rates for existing home loans before Oct. 31, as part of sweeping policies to support the country's beleaguered property market as the economy slows. Commercial banks should, in batches, reduce interest rates on existing mortgages to no less than 30 basis points (bps) below the Loan Prime Rate (LPR), the central bank's benchmark rate for mortgages, according to a statement released by the People's Bank of China (PBOC). It is expected to cut existing mortgage rates by about 50 bps on average. Across China, a slew of policies including reductions in down-payment ratios and mortgage rates have been introduced this year to support China's crisis-hit property market. But the stimulus measures have struggled to boost sales or increase liquidity in a market shunned by buyers that has remained a big drag on broader economic growth. Adding to such efforts, Guangzhou city announced Sunday the lifting of all restrictions on home purchases, while Shanghai and Shenzhen said they would ease restrictions on housing purchases by non-local buyers and lower the minimum downpayment ratio for first home buyers to no less than 15%. Reuters reported Friday that Shanghai and Shenzhen were planning to lift key remaining restrictions to attract potential buyers. The announcements Sunday come after China unveiled its biggest stimulus plan Tuesday since the COVID pandemic to pull the economy out of its deflationary funk.	https://www.voanews.com/a/china-cutting-mortgage-rates-by-end-october-as-cities-ease-home-buying-curbs/7803856.html	2024-09-29T15:02:24-07:00	
California governor vetoes bill to create first-in-nation AI safety measures	Sacramento, California — California Governor Gavin Newsom vetoed a landmark bill aimed at establishing first-in-the-nation safety measures for large artificial intelligence models Sunday. The decision is a major blow to efforts attempting to rein in the homegrown industry that is rapidly evolving with little oversight. The bill would have established some of the first regulations on large-scale AI models in the nation and paved the way for AI safety regulations across the country, supporters said. Earlier in September, the Democratic governor told an audience at Dreamforce, an annual conference hosted by software giant Salesforce, that California must lead in regulating AI in the face of federal inaction but that the proposal 'can have a chilling effect on the industry.' The proposal, which drew fierce opposition from startups, tech giants and several Democratic House members, could have hurt the homegrown industry by establishing rigid requirements, Newsom said. 'While well-intentioned, SB 1047 does not take into account whether an AI system is deployed in high-risk environments, involves critical decision-making or the use of sensitive data,' Newsom said in a statement. 'Instead, the bill applies stringent standards to even the most basic functions — so long as a large system deploys it. I do not believe this is the best approach to protecting the public from real threats posed by the technology.' Newsom on Sunday instead announced that the state will partner with several industry experts, including AI pioneer Fei-Fei Li, to develop guardrails around powerful AI models. Li opposed the AI safety proposal. The measure, aimed at reducing potential risks created by AI, would have required companies to test their models and publicly disclose their safety protocols to prevent the models from being manipulated to, for example, wipe out the state’s electric grid or help build chemical weapons. Experts say those scenarios could be possible in the future as the industry continues to rapidly advance. It also would have provided whistleblower protections to workers. The legislation is among a host of bills passed by the legislature this year to regulate AI, fight deepfakes and protect workers. State lawmakers said California must take action this year, citing hard lessons they learned from failing to rein in social media companies when they might have had a chance. Proponents of the measure, including Elon Musk and Anthropic, said the proposal could have injected some levels of transparency and accountability around large-scale AI models, as developers and experts say they still don’t have a full understanding of how AI models behave and why. The bill targeted systems that require more than $100 million to build. No current AI models have hit that threshold, but some experts said that could change within the next year. 'This is because of the massive investment scale-up within the industry,' said Daniel Kokotajlo, a former OpenAI researcher who resigned in April over what he saw as the company’s disregard for AI risks. 'This is a crazy amount of power to have any private company control unaccountably, and it’s also incredibly risky.' The United States is already behind Europe in regulating AI to limit risks. The California proposal wasn't as comprehensive as regulations in Europe, but it would have been a good first step to set guardrails around the rapidly growing technology that is raising concerns about job loss, misinformation, invasions of privacy and automation bias, supporters said. A number of leading AI companies last year voluntarily agreed to follow safeguards set by the White House, such as testing and sharing information about their models. The California bill would have mandated that AI developers follow requirements similar to those commitments, said the measure's supporters. But critics, including former U.S. House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, argued that the bill would 'kill California tech' and stifle innovation. It would have discouraged AI developers from investing in large models or sharing open-source software, they said. Newsom's decision to veto the bill marks another win in California for big tech companies and AI developers, many of whom spent the past year lobbying alongside the California Chamber of Commerce to sway the governor and lawmakers from advancing AI regulations. Two other sweeping AI proposals, which also faced mounting opposition from the tech industry and others, died ahead of a legislative deadline in August. The bills would have required AI developers to label AI-generated content and ban discrimination from AI tools used to make employment decisions. The governor said earlier this summer he wanted to protect California's status as a global leader in AI, noting that 32 of the world’s top 50 AI companies are located in the state. He has promoted California as an early adopter as the state could soon deploy generative AI tools to address highway congestion, provide tax guidance and streamline homelessness programs. The state also announced last month a voluntary partnership with AI giant Nvidia to help train students, college faculty, developers and data scientists. California is also considering new rules against AI discrimination in hiring practices. Earlier in September, Newsom signed some of the toughest laws in the country to crack down on election deepfakes and measures to protect Hollywood workers from unauthorized AI use. But even with Newsom's veto, the California safety proposal is inspiring lawmakers in other states to take up similar measures, said Tatiana Rice, deputy director of the Future of Privacy Forum, a nonprofit that works with lawmakers on technology and privacy proposals. 'They are going to potentially either copy it or do something similar next legislative session,' Rice said. 'So it’s not going away.'	https://www.voanews.com/a/california-governor-vetoes-bill-to-create-first-in-nation-ai-safety-measures/7803850.html	2024-09-29T14:43:41-07:00

Thousands protest 'uncontrolled immigration' to Portugal	Lisbon — Thousands of protesters waving Portuguese flags and roaring the national anthem rallied in Lisbon on Sunday to express their anger at 'illegal' and 'uncontrolled' immigration. The demonstrators marched behind banners demanding the 'end of mass immigration' and the expulsion of immigrants guilty of crimes, at the protest called by the far-right Chega party, the country's third-largest political force. Immigration is 'very good' but 'rules are needed,' said Cecilia Guimaraes, a 66-year-old teacher whose parents emigrated to Canada. 'We emigrated legally. That's how it should happen in a developed country,' she told AFP, complaining of a rise in insecurity she fears is linked to foreign arrivals. Chega lawmaker Rui Afonso said Portugal and other European countries were unable to control entries, which generated a 'feeling of insecurity' because 'we don't know their past.' Afonso added that European nations were ill-equipped to 'decently' take in immigrants who were sometimes 'forced to live on the street and fall into crime.' Among the protesters was Chega leader Andre Ventura, whose party more than quadrupled its seats at this year's election. Tensions surfaced as the market approached working-class neighborhoods with large immigrant populations. Some protesters engaged in a standoff with pro-immigration activists in favor of a Portugal open to foreigners. Posters reading 'No Portugal without immigrants' also covered walls and bus stops along the route of the march. The number of foreigners living in Portugal jumped by 33.6 percent last year to reach more than one million, about one-tenth of the total population, according to the Agency for Integration, Migration and Asylum. The center-right government toughened migration policy in June. It scrapped a measure allowing immigrants to apply for regularization if they could prove they had been working for at least one year even if they had entered the country illegally.	https://www.voanews.com/a/thousands-protest-uncontrolled-immigration-to-portugal/7803845.html	2024-09-29T13:59:13-07:00	
Supplies, emergency workers rushed to North Carolina while Florida digs out from Helene's damage	PERRY, Fla. — The U.S. Southeast grappled Sunday with rising death tolls, a lack of vital supplies in isolated, flood-stricken areas and the widespread loss of homes and property while the devastating toll of Hurricane Helene became clear to officials who warned of a lengthy and difficult rebuild. North Carolina Gov. Roy Cooper said Sunday that the death toll of 11 in the state was expected to rise from Helene as rescuers and other emergency workers reached areas isolated by collapsed roads, failing infrastructure and widespread flooding. Cooper, speaking at a press conference, said, 'We know there will be more' deaths and he asked residents to avoid traveling on roadways in western North Carolina not only to avoid dangers but to keep roads clear for emergency vehicles. More than 50 search teams have fanned out across the region in search of stranded people. 'Many people are cut off because the roads are impassable,' he said. Supplies were being airlifted to the region around Asheville, a city tucked in the western North Carolina mountains known for its arts, culture and natural beauty. The rescue efforts included saving 41 people in one mission north of Asheville and an infant. The teams were finding people through both 911 calls and messages on social media, North Carolina Adjutant General Todd Hunt said. The storm upended life throughout the Southeast. Authorities were rushing to airlift supplies and restore communications and roads in flooded Asheville on Sunday as residents along the storm-battered Florida coast gathered for church services. Hurricane Helene roared ashore in Florida’s Big Bend region as a Category 4 hurricane late Thursday with winds of 140 mph. From there, it quickly moved through Georgia, where Gov. Brian Kemp said Saturday that it 'looks like a bomb went off' after viewing splintered homes and debris-covered highways from the air. Weakened, Helene then soaked the Carolinas and Tennessee with torrential rains, sending creeks and rivers over their banks and straining dams. More than 60 people have been killed in total. Several million people were without power as of Sunday afternoon. In Texas, Jessica Drye Turner begged for someone to rescue her family members stranded on their rooftop in Asheville, surrounded by rising flood waters. 'They are watching 18 wheelers and cars floating by,' Turner wrote in an urgent Facebook post on Friday. But in a follow-up message, which became widely circulated on social media on Saturday, Turner said help had not arrived in time to save her parents, both in their 70s, and her six-year-old nephew. The roof had collapsed and the three drowned. 'I cannot convey in words the sorrow, heartbreak and devastation my sisters and I are going through nor imagine the pain before us,' she wrote. Western North Carolina was isolated because of landslides and flooding that forced the closure of Interstate 40 and other roads. There have been hundreds of water rescues, none more dramatic than in rural Unicoi County in East Tennessee, where dozens of patients and staff were plucked by helicopter from a hospital rooftop Friday. The storm hovered over the Tennessee Valley into Sunday, the National Hurricane Center said. It unleashed the worst flooding in a century in North Carolina. One community, Spruce Pine, was doused with more than 0.6 meters of rain from Tuesday through Saturday. The state is sending water supplies and other items toward Buncombe County and Asheville, but mudslides on Interstate 40 and other blocked highways are preventing the supplies from making it. The county’s own supplies of water were on the other side of the Swannanoa River, away from where most of the 270,000 people in Buncombe County live, officials said. Law enforcement was making plans to send officers to places that still had water, food or gas because of reports of arguments and threats of violence, the sheriff said. 'If you will bear with us and be patient one more day — I hate to say that but I know how desperate water is in our community — but we are pushing as hard as we can to get them up the mountain,' Buncombe County Manager Avril Pinder said. FEMA Administrator Deanne Criswell said North Carolina is seeing historic flooding, especially in the western part of the state. 'I don’t know that anybody could be fully prepared for the amount of flooding and landslides that they are experiencing right now,' she said on CBS’ 'Face the Nation.' 'But we have had teams in there for several days. We’re sending more search and rescue teams in there.' She is touring the stricken states and visits North Carolina on Monday. In Florida's Big Bend, some lost nearly everything they own, emerging from the storm without even a pair of shoes. With sanctuaries still darkened in a county whereas of Sunday morning, 97% of customers were without power, some churches canceled regular services while others like Faith Baptist Church in Perry opted to worship outside. Standing water and tree debris still covers the grounds of Faith Baptist Church. The church called on parishioners to come 'pray for our community' in a message posted to the congregation’s Facebook page. 'We have power. We don’t have electricity,' Immaculate Conception Catholic Church parishioner Marie Ruttinger said. 'Our God has power. That’s for sure.' In Atlanta, 28.24 centimeters of rain fell over 48 hours, the most the city has seen over two days since record keeping began in 1878. In Augusta, in eastern Georgia near the border with South Carolina, officials notified residents Sunday morning that water service would be shut off for 24 to 48 hours in the city and surrounding Richmond County. A news release said trash and debris from the storm 'blocked our ability to pump water.' Officials were distributing bottled water at the municipal building and said each household would receive one case. President Joe Biden said Saturday that Helene’s devastation has been 'overwhelming' and pledged to send help. He also approved a disaster declaration for North Carolina, making federal funding available for affected individuals. Dozens of utilities crews from New England states were also headed south to help with recovery. Federal funding will be critically important for rebuilding local communities, Sen. Marco Rubio said during an appearance on NBC's Meet The Press. 'There are some coastal areas, some of which are now facing their third storm in the last 12 months,' Rubio said. With at least 25 killed in South Carolina, Helene is the deadliest tropical cyclone for the state since Hurricane Hugo killed 35 people when it came ashore just north of Charleston in 1989. Deaths also have been reported in Florida, Georgia, North Carolina and Virginia. Moody’s Analytics said it expects $15 billion to $26 billion in property damage. AccuWeather’s preliminary estimate of the total damage and economic loss from Helene in the U.S. is between $95 billion and $110 billion. Among the 11 confirmed deaths in Florida were nine people who drowned in their homes in a mandatory evacuation area on the Gulf Coast in Pinellas County, Sheriff Bob Gualtieri said. Climate change has exacerbated conditions that allow such storms to thrive, rapidly intensifying in warming waters and turning into powerful cyclones sometimes in a matter of hours. Helene was the eighth named storm of the Atlantic hurricane season, which began June 1. The National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration has predicted an above-average season this year because of record-warm ocean temperatures.	https://www.voanews.com/a/supplies-emergency-workers-rushed-to-north-carolina-while-florida-digs-out-from-helene-s-damage/7803842.html	2024-09-29T13:51:19-07:00

Bangladesh at crossroads as it pursues sweeping constitutional reform	Washington — As Bangladesh pursues constitutional reform, international legal experts say a consensus-based process is vital for creating an enduring charter and ensuring political stability in South Asia’s third most populous nation. The ouster of Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina in August pushed her Awami League party out of power, raising concerns that a key player could be excluded from a process shaping Bangladesh's future. In response, the nine-week interim government, led by Nobel laureate Muhammad Yunus, recently formed a constitutional reform panel, part of a broader effort to strengthen institutions and avert a return to authoritarian rule. The panel, one of six reform commissions, faces a dilemma: amend the country's 52-year-old constitution or begin afresh. A constitutional rewrite could tackle the issues raised by the recent protests that toppled Hasina's government. Amending the document is quicker but might leave key problems unresolved. Complicating matters, key provisions of the constitution are not amendable. Regardless of the path Bangladesh takes, the lesson from other countries that have implemented change is unmistakable: Experts say successful reform requires the involvement of all major stakeholders. 'The main task of constitutions is to channel group decisions away from violence into politics,' said Tarun Khaitan, a professor of public law at the London School of Economics. 'So, what do you do if you're a group which has no share in political power and no hope of sharing political power any time in the future? You will take to violence.' Yet in a country as deeply divided as Bangladesh, building consensus over a new constitution is a tall order. Two parties — the Awami League and the Bangladesh National Party, or BNP — have dominated politics since its founding in 1971. Except for two rare moments of unity in the 1990s, each party has 'tried to game the system and lock the other out of power,' making Bangladesh perennially unstable. 'I think that is the issue that any constitutional settlement has to resolve,' Khaitan said. Three global lessons Richard Albert, an expert on constitution-making and constitutional design at the University of Texas, noted three lessons that Bangladesh can learn from other parts of the world. First, the process matters more than the document itself. This means that citizens must be engaged in every step, from providing input to enacting the Charter, Albert said. 'We know that when people are involved in the constitution-making process… that sets the stage for a stronger, more enduring, more legitimate constitution,' Albert, who sits on Jamaica’s constitutional reform committee, said in an interview with VOA. Second, resist turning the constitution into a wish list. Many countries make the mistake of including too many promises that they cannot deliver. The rules enshrined in a constitution, Albert said, 'must mean something when they're written in the text of the country's higher [or highest] law.' Third, the people are the ultimate source of legitimacy for a constitution, Albert said. The document must embody the values and aspirations of the citizens. 'They don’t have to be involved in the writing, the drafting, the deliberation of the constitution, but the people must feel and believe that the constitution represents them,' Albert said. There are other lessons too. While public participation is important, the consent of major social and political groups is paramount, Khaitan said. Without a 'consensual process,' he said, minority groups can find themselves left out. Case in point: Nepal, where the minority Madhesis were sidelined despite broad public participation in the making of the 2015 constitution. Lesson from Chile Elsewhere, a lack of consensus has led to outright rejection of a constitution. Among legal scholars, Chile is the poster child for how not to do constitutional reform. In recent years, two successive governments — one left-leaning, the other right-wing — tried and failed to replace a Pinochet-era constitution with a new one stacked with ideological priorities. To some constitutional experts, the South American country’s experience suggests that wholesale constitutional overhauls can fail in deeply polarized countries such as Bangladesh. 'Pursuing constitutional replacement processes in such an environment can become an opportunity to fuel intolerance,' Aldo Valle, a Chilean lawyer and former vice chairman of the country’s constitutional council, wrote in a blog post in 2023. Bangladesh’s constitution gives parliament the power to enact amendments. A 2011 amendment, however, bars changes to basic provisions, from citizens’ fundamental rights to Islam’s designation as the state religion. Such 'constitutional unamendability' is increasingly common around the world, with countries like Turkey and France making certain constitutional provisions unchangeable. In Bangladesh, however, the constitution allows 'one to become incredibly powerful and it has some paths for creating autocracy,' making a rewrite necessary, Ali Riaz, the country's constitution panel chief, told The Daily Star newspaper prior to his appointment earlier in September. Waris Husain, an adjunct professor of law at Howard University, said drafting a new constitution is the easier part of constitution-making, and there are many successful models that Bangladesh can draw on. The real challenge, Husain said, is securing the buy-in of all stakeholders. 'One of the things that you wouldn't want to happen is if you quickly pass a constitution and then subsequently there are so many issues that are raised about it and people haven't bought into that constitution,' Husain said in an interview with VOA. If Bangladesh were to draft a new constitution and put it to a referendum, it would likely have a higher success rate than pushing through an amendment. According to a 2019 study, 94% of referendums to approve a constitution succeed, while 40% of referendums to amend an existing document fail. 'If the plan in Bangladesh is to have recourse to a referendum, the data will be important to consider,' Albert said. As it nears its second month in office, the interim government faces growing pressure to deliver results. But experts say constitutional reform cannot be rushed through — it took Nepal seven years to enact a new charter. Yet Bangladesh’s 'constitutional moment,' a period marked by political turmoil and calls for significant change, can prove fleeting, experts say. 'Public appetite for grand, substantial changes typically remains short-lived,' said Khaitan. 'Bread and butter issues tend to come to dominate very quickly.'	https://www.voanews.com/a/bangladesh-at-crossroads-as-it-pursues-sweeping-constitutional-reform-/7803698.html	2024-09-29T09:49:21-07:00	
Suspect arrested after allegedly setting fires, driving into shops in Germany	Berlin — A man has been arrested after allegedly setting two fires in the western German city of Essen that left 30 people injured and driving a van into two shops, authorities said Sunday. Emergency services were alerted to two fires in residential buildings in quick succession shortly after 5 p.m. Saturday, police said. The injured people included eight children who were seriously hurt, and two of them were in a life-threatening condition after inhaling smoke. Shortly after the fires broke out, a van drove into two shops in the city, causing damage to property but no injuries. The suspect then allegedly threatened people with weapons, but several men managed to push him back with shovels and poles and hold him until police arrived. Police said the suspect was a 41-year-old Essen resident with Syrian citizenship. They said the man's motive appeared to be that his wife had left him, and he targeted houses and shops where people who supported her lived. The fire service said that, when it arrived at the scene of the first blaze, smoke was billowing from the entrance of the building and people were calling for help from windows. Neighbors had put up ladders to help people escape, but they weren't long enough to reach the upper floors. The suspect hasn't commented so far on what happened Saturday but was previously known to authorities for threats and damage to property, police said. Prosecutors were seeking to have him kept in custody on suspicion of arson and attempted murder.	https://www.voanews.com/a/suspect-arrested-after-allegedly-setting-fires-driving-into-shops-in-germany-/7803692.html	2024-09-29T09:18:23-07:00	
UN: Tougher measures needed to stem gang violence in Haiti	Geneva — Tougher measures are needed to stem the gang violence in Haiti that has brought the economy and government of the Caribbean Island to its knees by spreading fear and subjugating the population through killings, lootings, exploitation and brutal abuse, according to a report by the U.N. Office of the High Commissioner for Human Rights. Latest figures documented by the OHCHR show that more than 3,660 people have been killed since January. 'No more lives should be lost to this senseless criminality,' Volker Türk, the U.N.’s human rights chief said in a statement to coincide with the release of the report Friday. He welcomed 'recent positive steps,' such as the establishment of the new Transitional Presidential Council and government, and the deployment of the first contingent of the Multinational Security Support Mission, led by Kenyan police. However, Türk observed that the equipment and personnel on the ground clearly were not sufficient 'to counter the criminal gangs effectively and sustainably, and stop them spreading further and wreaking havoc on peoples’ lives.' The report, which covers the period up to June, details extremely serious patterns of human rights violations and abuses taking place across the capital of Port-au-Prince. It documents at least 860 killings and 393 injuries, including at least 36 children during police operations 'in what could constitute use of unnecessary and disproportionate force.' It says the gangs have continued 'to expand their territorial control and increase illegal revenues' outside the capital into new areas of the country 'in which they could obtain further criminal forms of income.' Ravina Shamdasani, the high commissioner’s spokesperson said gang violence has continued to increase and spread to the Artibonite Department, as well as in the southern part of West Department, which until recently had been largely unaffected by violence. 'In Artibonite, the country’s agricultural heartland, increasing gang violence and extortion have forced farmers to abandon more than 3,000 hectares of land, further imperiling Haiti’s food production, at a time when an estimated 1.6 million people in the country face emergency-level acute food insecurity,' she said. She noted that the gangs are trying to maximize territorial gain as well as financial gain through all sorts of illicit methods, including extortion, protection rackets, killings of perceived opponents, and kidnapping people for ransom. 'They are doing everything they can to maintain this control, including raping women, raping children… gangs have continued to use sexual violence to punish, spread fear and subjugate populations,' she said. According to the report, 'human rights violations and abuses have persisted at alarmingly high levels. The brutal forms of gender-based violence, including sexual violence, have reached new heights, leading to irreversible harm for victims and survivors and destroying various generations.' The report underscores the ambition of the criminal gangs to maintain control and power. It notes that gangs who have benefited from the political instability and have worked to destabilize the former government 'are demanding political influence and amnesties, threatening to resort to heightened violence if their demands are not met.' Authors of the report say the gangs are backing up their demands by warning the authorities on social media 'to prepare for an even more intense battle,' and to reassess their action in view of the arrival of the Multinational Security Support Mission. Following the deployment of the Kenyan peacekeeping troops, the report says a gang leader posted a video on social media showing dozens of armed men chanting their readiness 'to take on these foreign soldiers' who they consider to be 'invaders.' Human rights observers agree that Haiti’s gangs are able to operate their criminal enterprises and carry out large-scale attacks using firearms because of the unimpeded flow of weapons into the country. This, despite an international arms embargo imposed on Haiti by the Security Council. High Commissioner Türk is urging the international community to implement the targeted arms embargo, the travel, and asset freeze imposed by the U.N. Security Council, to stem gang violence in Haiti. He also has signed on to numerous other recommendations set forth in the report, which are aimed at strengthening the police and other state institutions 'crippled by endemic corruption, including the judiciary.' Additionally, he is calling on the authorities to protect children from gangs and to redouble efforts to tackle gender and sexual violence and to protect internally displaced people. Haiti has been in turmoil since the July 7, 2021, assassination of President Jovenel Moise at his home in the Port-au-Prince suburb of Petion-Ville. Armed gangs now control much of the capital and have spread to other parts of the country, where they have carried out massacres, kidnappings, human trafficking and sexual violence.	https://www.voanews.com/a/un-tougher-measures-needed-to-stem-gang-violence-in-haiti/7803677.html	2024-09-29T08:46:07-07:00

US boosts air support and hikes troops' readiness to deploy for Middle East	Washington — U.S. Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin has authorized the military to reinforce its presence in the Middle East with 'defensive' air-support capabilities and put other forces on a heightened readiness status, the Pentagon said on Sunday.

Search resumes for 48 missing migrants off Spanish Canaries	Puerto de la Estaca, Spain — Rescue teams on Sunday resumed searching for at least 48 migrants who went messing the day before when their boat overturned just as it was being rescued off Spain's Canary Islands, killing at least nine people. Hopes of finding survivors were slim as sea rescue teams searched the waters off El Hierro, an island in the Atlantic archipelago. It is the latest in a series of such disasters off the coast of Africa. 'The search operation is resuming,' Spain's maritime rescue organisation told AFP. The 48 are 'presumed dead,' Canaries regional president Fernando Clavijo told journalists on Saturday night. More bodies will likely appear 'over the next two, three days,' washed up by the current, he added. Twenty-seven migrants were rescued and nine bodies recovered after the boat, which had set out from Nouadhibou in Mauritania, some 800 kilometers (nearly 500 miles) away, overturned off El Hierro. The tragedy hit when rescuers arrived to assist the migrants after they themselves called emergency services, Spanish officials said. Migrants rushed to one side of the precarious boat, causing it to tip. The migrants 'had gone two days without food or water', which may have fueled their panic, Anselmo Pestana, head of the Canary Islands prefecture, told journalists in the port of La Estaca. Spanish government sources said the boat may have been carrying up to 90 people, instead of 84 as originally announced, which could put the number of missing at more than 50. This disaster follows the death of 39 migrants in early September when their boat sank off Senegal while attempting a similar crossing to the Canaries, from where migrants hope to reach mainland Europe. Thousands of migrants have died in recent years setting off from west Africa to reach Europe via the Atlantic aboard overcrowded and often dilapidated boats.	https://www.voanews.com/a/search-resumes-for-48-missing-migrants-off-spanish-canaries-/7803550.html	2024-09-29T06:10:35-07:00

US airstrikes on Syria kill 37 militants affiliated with extremist groups	BEIRUT — In Syria, 37 militants affiliated to the extremist Islamic State group and an al-Qaida-linked group were killed in two strikes, the United States military said Sunday. Two of the dead were senior militants, it said. U.S. Central Command said it struck northwestern Syria on Tuesday, targeting a senior militant from the al-Qaida-linked Hurras al-Deen group and eight others. They say he was responsible for overseeing military operations. They also announced a strike from earlier this month on Sept. 16, where they conducted a 'large-scale airstrike' on an IS training camp in a remote undisclosed location in central Syria. That attack killed 28 militants, including 'at least four Syrian leaders.' 'The airstrike will disrupt ISIS' capability to conduct operations against U.S. interests, as well as our allies and partners,' the statement read. There are some 900 U.S. forces in Syria, along with an undisclosed number of contractors, mostly trying to prevent any comeback by the extremist IS group, which swept through Iraq and Syria in 2014, taking control of large swaths of territory. U.S. forces advise and assist their key allies in northeastern Syria, the Kurdish-led Syrian Democratic Forces, located not far from strategic areas where Iran-backed militant groups are present, including a key border crossing with Iraq.	https://www.voanews.com/a/us-airstrikes-on-syria-kill-37-militants-affiliated-with-extremist-groups-/7803514.html	2024-09-29T05:15:47-07:00	
Militants kill 7 workers, kidnap 20 in southwestern Pakistan	Islamabad — Pakistani authorities said Sunday suspected insurgents killed at least seven workers and abducted 20 others at gunpoint in two attacks overnight in the country’s southwestern Balochistan province. The violence occurred in the Panjgur and Musakhail districts of the sparsely populated insurgency-hit province, which is rich in natural resources. Police said that gunmen attacked a home in Panjgur at around midnight Saturday, spraying its occupants before fleeing on motorcycles. They added that the gunfire wounded one person and that the victims were laborers from the eastern Punjab province. The second attack took place early Sunday when a group of armed men stormed a gas and oil exploration company’s site in Musakhail. Dheeraj Kalra, the local assistant police commissioner, told VOA by phone that the assailants opened fire, vandalized equipment, took 20 workers as hostages, and then escaped. 'A search operation is currently underway in the area to locate the abducted individuals,' he said. No one immediately claimed responsibility for either attack. Pakistani Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif condemned the violence and instructed provincial authorities to make all possible efforts to bring the perpetrators to justice, his office in Islamabad said. Late last month, insurgents in Musakhail killed 23 passengers from Punjab who were visiting or working in Balochistan after pulling them off trucks and passenger vehicles. The outlawed Baloch Liberation Army claimed responsibility for the attack and a series of other raids across the province on the same day, resulting in the deaths of more than 50 people. The violence marked the most widespread insurgent attacks in impoverished Balochistan in years, targeting security posts, railway lines, and passenger vehicles. Several ethnic Baloch groups, including the BLA, accuse the central government of exploiting the province’s natural resources, and claim their violent campaign is seeking an independent Balochistan. Pakistani officials reject the allegations, saying insurgent activities are aimed at halting economic development in the region. The province shares the country's border with Afghanistan and Iran and is the site of major China-funded infrastructure projects. The BLA, designated as a global terrorist organization by the United States, has recently intensified its attacks. It is known as the largest and most lethal group active in the region, repeatedly demanding that China withdraw from Balochistan and even targeting Chinese nationals working there.	https://www.voanews.com/a/militants-kill-7-workers-kidnap-20-in-southwestern-pakistan-/7803500.html	2024-09-29T04:46:08-07:00	
Japan's Ishiba opts for continuity in early Cabinet picks	TOKYO — Japan's incoming prime minister, Shigeru Ishiba, signaled continuity this weekend in his early decisions on key posts for his government, suggesting a desire for stability after an unpredictable leadership race. His picks for finance, defense and foreign minister, as well as the pivotal post of chief cabinet secretary, appear to draw on seasoned veterans from his ruling Liberal Democratic Party, as he prepares to form a government on Tuesday. Ishiba, 67, won the LDP leadership race on Friday, clinching a run-off win after a contest among an unprecedentedly large field of nine candidates. He is set to name former Defense Minister Takeshi Iwaya as foreign minister and keep Yoshimasa Hayashi as chief Cabinet secretary, a pivotal post that includes the role of top government spokesperson, sources told Reuters. Ishiba will name former Chief Cabinet Secretary Katsunobu Kato as finance minister and bring Gen Nakatani back as defense minister, Japanese media reported. Ryosei Nakasawa, the deputy minister of finance, will be minister of economic revitalization, the Yomiuri newspaper said on Sunday. Ishiba will tap former Prime Minister Yoshihide Suga as vice president of the LDP, sources said, while Japanese media said he would name Shinjiro Koizumi, a rival in the LDP race, as LDP election chief. Ishiba did not detail his Cabinet plans in a televised interview on Sunday but suggested he was willing to consider a snap election in the near future, perhaps as early as October.

125 Ukrainian drones reported in attack sparking fires across Russia, Moscow officials say	KYIV — More than 100 Ukrainian drones were shot down over Russia Sunday, officials said, sparking a wildfire and setting an apartment block alight in one of the largest barrages seen over Russian skies since Moscow invaded Ukraine in February 2022. Russia's Ministry of Defense reported that it had shot down 125 drones overnight across seven regions. The southwestern region of Volgograd came under particularly heavy fire, with 67 Ukrainian drones reportedly downed by Russian air defenses. Seventeen drones were also seen over Russia's Voronezh region, where falling debris damaged an apartment block and a private home, said local governor Aleksandr Gusev. Images on social media showed flames rising from the windows of the top floor of a high-rise building. No casualties were reported. A further 18 drones were reported over Russia's Rostov region, where falling debris sparked a wildfire, said Gov. Vasily Golubev. He said that the fire did not pose a threat to populated areas, but that emergency services were fighting to extinguish the blaze, which had engulfed 20 hectares (49.4 acres) of forest. Meanwhile, 13 civilians were injured in an overnight barrage on the southern Ukrainian city of Zaporizhzhia Sunday after Ukrainian military leaders warned that Moscow could be preparing for a new military offensive in the country's south. The city was targeted by Russian guide bombs in 10 separate attacks that damaged a high-rise building and several residential homes, regional governor Ivan Fedorov wrote on his official Telegram channel. More people could still be trapped beneath the rubble, he said. Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy also said that the Zaporizhzhia attack had damaged the city's transport links. 'Today, Russia struck Zaporizhzhia with aerial bombs. Ordinary residential buildings were damaged and the entrance of one building was destroyed. The city's infrastructure and railway were also damaged,' Zelenskyy said in a post on X, formerly Twitter. 'In total, 13 people were injured, and two were rescued from under the rubble. I thank all the emergency services for their rapid response and providing necessary assistance. The rubble clearing is still ongoing.' The attacks come after the Ukrainian military warned Saturday that Russian forces may be preparing for offensive operations in the wider Zaporizhzhia region. Vladyslav Voloshyn, spokesperson for Ukraine's southern military command, said that Russia was amassing personnel in this direction. Ukraine's air force also reported that 22 Russian drones were launched over the country overnight. It said that 15 were shot down in Ukraine's Sumy, Vinnytsia, Mykolaiv, and Odesa regions, and that five more were destroyed using electronic defenses. The fate of the remaining two drones was not specified.	https://www.voanews.com/a/ukrainian-drones-reported-in-attack-sparking-fires-across-russia-moscow-officials-say-/7803478.html	2024-09-29T04:07:08-07:00

Pope Francis, after Belgian criticism, says church has 'no place for abuse'	BRUSSELS — Pope Francis on Sunday wrapped up a weekend trip to Belgium, where he faced some of the strongest criticism yet levied during one of his foreign trips. The 87-year-old pontiff was pressed by high-profile figures at three of the five major events on his three-day visit in unusual and sometimes fierce language for a papal trip. In a meeting with Belgian dignitaries on Friday, both King Philippe and Prime Minister Alexander De Croo called for more concrete action to help survivors of abuse by Catholic clergy. And in later events at two Catholic universities, officials denounced his stance on the role of women in the church and society. Francis did not specifically mention the criticisms at his last event in Belgium on Sunday, a celebration of Mass at Brussels' King Baudouin soccer stadium. But the pope did add to the prepared text for his sermon and made a strong condemnation of Catholic clergy abuse. 'There is no place for abuse,' the pontiff said, drawing scattered applause from the estimated 37,000 attendees. 'There is no place for the cover-up of abuse. 'I ask everyone, do not cover up abuse. I ask bishops, do not cover up abuse.' The Belgian tour, which started with a one-day visit to nearby Luxembourg, was Francis's 46th trip abroad since being elected as pope in March 2013. The visit was meant to focus on the 600th anniversary of the two Catholic universities. Francis has also faced such criticism on previous tours, especially on the issue of clergy sexual abuse. On a trip to Chile in 2018 groups of demonstrators protested outside his events and Catholic churches were attacked before his visit. But the pope, leader of the world's 1.4 billion Catholics, is not usually confronted directly in public by political leaders or Catholic officials organizing his events. Professors and students at UCLouvain, where Francis gave a talk on Saturday afternoon, issued a press release moments after the pope had finished speaking, saying they wanted to express their 'disapproval' of his views. The pope's speech at the university largely called for global action on climate change, but he also responded to a letter to him from students and professors that had asked about the Catholic Church's teaching on women. Francis emphasized that the church, which bans ordination of women to the priesthood, was not run like a corporation. He described women as having 'a fertile welcome, care [and] vital devotion.' The Vatican did not respond to the university's statement. Francis apologized on Friday for sexual abuse by Catholic clergy in Belgium, saying the Church must 'be ashamed and ask forgiveness.' He also held a two-hour meeting with a group of survivors, who pressed him to provide better financial compensation for victims.	https://www.voanews.com/a/pope-francis-after-belgian-criticism-says-church-has-no-place-for-abuse-/7803471.html	2024-09-29T03:40:42-07:00	
11 wounded in southern Ukraine in Russian strikes	Kyiv — At least 11 people were wounded on Sunday in a series of Russian strikes on Zaporizhzhia in southern Ukraine, emergency services announced. The regional capital was hit by several 'massive aerial strikes' at dawn, Ukrainian emergency services said in a statement. 'A building and six houses in different city neighborhoods suffered a lot of destruction,' said the statement, adding that 42 members of the emergency services were helping those potentially trapped under the rubble. 'According to preliminary information, the number of wounded people has risen to 11,' said the emergency services, adding that rescue operations had ended. A woman dragged from the rubble was taken to the hospital. Regional governor Ivan Fedorov had earlier said that six people were wounded. He said that Zaporizhzhia was hit by 10 Russian strikes that destroyed 'one multistory building and some houses.' Andriy Yermak, the head of the office of the president, hit out in a social media post at an attempt to 'terrorize' the civilian population. Yermak also reiterated his called on Western allies to supply more weapons to intercept Russian missiles and apply more economic sanctions against Moscow. Russia annexed the Zaporizhzhia region in 2022, but the main city of the same name remains under Kyiv's control.	https://www.voanews.com/a/wounded-in-southern-ukraine-in-russian-strikes/7803467.html	2024-09-29T02:35:08-07:00	
Israel says it has killed another high-ranking Hezbollah official in an airstrike	JERUSALEM — The Israeli military said Sunday that it has killed another high-ranking Hezbollah official in an airstrike. The military said Nabil Kaouk, the deputy head of Hezbollah's Central Council, was killed in an airstrike on Saturday. There was no immediate comment from Hezbollah. Several senior Hezbollah commanders have been killed in Israeli strikes in recent weeks, including the group's overall leader, Hassan Nasrallah, in Beirut on Friday. The group has also been targeted by a sophisticated attack on its pagers and walkie-talkies, and Israel has carried out waves of airstrikes over the past week across large parts of Lebanon. Hezbollah has continued to fire hundreds of rockets and missiles into northern Israel, but most have been intercepted or fallen in open areas. Kaouk was a veteran member of Hezbollah going back to the 1980s and had previously served as Hezbollah's military commander in southern Lebanon. The United States had announced sanctions against him in 2020.	https://www.voanews.com/a/israel-says-it-has-killed-another-high-ranking-hezbollah-official-in-an-airstrike/7803466.html	2024-09-29T02:23:36-07:00	
Syrians in Austria do volunteer work to disarm doubts about migrants	KRITZENDORF, Austria — While shoveling mud out of gardens almost two weeks after torrential flooding battered the small Austrian town of Kritzendorf, Abulhkeem Alshater gestures towards a banner: 'Austro-Syrians say: Thank you, Austria.' Alshater, 45, originally from Homs, Syria, has been working with dozens of his countryfolk to help clean up the mess left by floods. The work is a gesture of gratitude to Austria at a time when immigration has become a hot topic in Sunday's general election. Alshater hopes the sight of Syrians devoting time and energy to bring relief to the hard-hit state of Lower Austria will take some steam out of the often-strident campaign rhetoric about uncontrolled immigration. 'There's an election on. We're trying to show that we're not all the same,' said Alshater, who heads the Free Syrian Community of Austria, a support group for Syrians. Fleeing war in their homeland, the number of Syrians living in Austria rose more than eightfold between 2015 and 2024, according to official data, with 95,180 there as of January. Right-wing efforts to curb immigration to Austria have gained traction since deadly attacks in Germany blamed on migrants of Muslim origin, and a foiled plot to attack a Taylor Swift concert supposedly masterminded by an ISIS-inspired teenager. For weeks, the far-right Freedom Party (FPO) has led opinion polls, just ahead of the ruling conservative Austrian People's Party (OVP). Both parties promise to enact tougher asylum laws and crack down on illegal immigration if victorious. Alshater, a painter and decorator who arrived in 2015, has spent the past few days helping locals recover from flooding in places like Kritzendorf just north of Vienna, where the deluge left houses partially submerged in muddy water. Homeowner Dinko Fejzuli, a resident of Austria who was born to parents from Croatia and Macedonia, said the Syrian volunteers had given rise to some interesting encounters. 'Yesterday, I brought some of the helpers to a lady who I know will be voting FPO,' he said. 'They helped her because she had neither friends nor family to help. It was ironic.'	https://www.voanews.com/a/syrians-in-austria-do-volunteer-work-to-disarm-doubts-about-migrants-/7802696.html	2024-09-29T00:07:19-07:00	
US suicides in 2023 still at highest level in nation's history, says data	new york — U.S. suicides last year remained at about the highest level in the nation's history, preliminary data suggests. A little more than 49,300 suicide deaths were reported in 2023, according to provisional data from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. That number that could grow a little as some death investigations are wrapped up and reported. Just under 49,500 were reported in 2022, according to final data released Thursday. The numbers are close enough that the suicide rate for the two years are the same, CDC officials said. U.S. suicide rates have been rising for nearly 20 years, aside from a two-year drop around the beginning of the COVID-19 pandemic. So 'a leveling off of any increase in suicide is cautiously promising news,' said Katherine Keyes, a Columbia University public health professor who studies suicide. Indeed, there's reason for optimism. A 2-year-old national crisis line allows anyone in the U.S. to dial 988 to reach mental health specialists. That and other efforts may be starting to pay off, Keyes said, but it 'really remains to be seen.' Experts caution that suicide — the nation's 11th-leading cause of death in 2022 — is complicated and that attempts can be driven by a range of factors. Contributors include higher rates of depression, limited availability of mental health services, and the availability of guns. About 55% of all suicide deaths in 2022 involved firearms, according to CDC data. The CDC's Thursday report said: —Suicide was the second-leading cause of death for people ages 10–14 and 20–34, and the third-leading cause for people ages 15–19. —Deaths continue to be more common among boys and men than girls and women. The highest suicide rate for any group — by far — was in men ages 75 and older, at about 44 suicides per 100,000 men that age. —Among women, the highest rate was in those who were middle-aged, about 9 per 100,000. But more dramatic increases have been seen in teens and young women, with the rate for that group doubling in the last two decades. —The overall suicide rate in 2022 and 2023 was 14.2 per 100,000. It also was that high in 2018. Before then, it hadn't been that high since 1941.	https://www.voanews.com/a/us-suicides-in-2023-still-at-highest-level-in-nation-s-history-says-data/7802649.html	2024-09-29T00:06:05-07:00	
Brick by brick, Morocco rebuilds 12th-century mosque destroyed by 2023 quake	TINMEL, Morocco — The hand-carved domes and brick-laid arches had almost all been put back together when an earthquake shook Morocco so violently that they caved in on themselves and crashed to the earth. After nearly 900 years, the Great Mosque of Tinmel lay in pieces — its minaret toppled, its prayer hall full of rubble, its outer walls knocked over. But even in ruins, it remained holy ground for the residents of Tinmel. Villagers carried the sheet-laden bodies of the 15 community members killed in the quake down the hillside and placed them in front of the decimated mosque. Among the mourners was Mohamed Hartatouch, who helped carry the remains of his son Abdelkrim, 33. A substitute teacher, he died under bricks and collapsed walls while the village waited a day and a half for rescue crews to arrive. 'It looked like a storm. I wasn't able to feel anything,' the grieving father said, remembering the day after the quake. One year later, the rubble near Hartatouch's half-standing home has been swept aside and Tinmel residents are eager to rebuild their homes and the mosque. They say the sacred site is a point of pride and source of income in a region where infrastructure and jobs were lacking long before the earthquake hit. 'It's our past,' Redwan Aitsalah, 32, a construction worker, said the week before the earthquake's anniversary as he reconstructed his home overlooking the mosque. The September 2023 quake left a path of destruction that will take Morocco years to recover from. It killed nearly 3,000 people, knocked down almost 60,000 homes and leveled at least 585 schools. Rebuilding will cost about $12.3 billion, according to government estimates. Stretches of road were left unnavigable, including Tizi N'Test, the steep mountain pass that weaves from Marrakech to Tinmel and some of the hardest-hit villages near the earthquake's epicenter. Workers are now sifting through the rubble, searching for the mosque's puzzle pieces. They are stacking usable bricks and sorting the fragments of remaining decorative elements arch by arch and dome by dome, preparing to rebuild the mosque using as much of the remains as possible. Though incomparable to the human loss and suffering, the restoration effort is among Morocco's priorities as it attempts to rebuild. The country's Ministry of Islamic Affairs and Ministry of Culture have recruited Moroccan architects, archaeologists and engineers to oversee the project. To assist, the Italian government has sent Moroccan-born architect Aldo Giorgio Pezzi, who had also consulted on Casablanca's Hassan II Mosque, one of Africa's largest. 'We will rebuild it based on the evidence and remains that we have so it returns to how it was,' Morocco's Minister of Islamic Affairs Ahmed Toufiq told The Associated Press. The Great Mosque was a marvel of North African architecture with lobed arches, hand-carved moldings and the adobe-style bricks used to construct most the area's structures. It was undergoing an 18-month restoration project when the quake struck, causing its ornate domes and pillars to cave in. Its clay-colored remnants lay in pieces beneath scaffolding erected by restoration workers from villages throughout the region, five of whom also died. 'The mosque withstood centuries. It's the will of God,' Nadia El Bourakkadi, the site's conservationist, told local media. The temblor leveled it months before repairs and renovations were to be completed. Like in many of the area's villages, residents of Tinmel today live in plastic tents brought in as temporary shelter post-earthquake. Some are there because it feels safer than their half-ruined homes, others because they have nowhere else to go. Officials have issued more than 55,000 reconstruction permits for villagers to build new homes, including for most of the homes in Tinmel. The government has distributed financial aid in phases. Most households with destroyed homes have received an initial $2,000 installment of rebuilding aid, but not more. Many have complained that isn't enough to underwrite the initial costs of rebuilding. Fewer than 1,000 have completed rebuilding, according to the government's own figures. Despite the extent of their personal losses, Moroccans are also mourning the loss of revered cultural heritage. Centuries-old mosques, shrines, fortresses and lodges are scattered throughout the mountains. Unlike Tinmel, many have long been neglected as Morocco focuses its development efforts elsewhere. The country sees Tinmel as the cradle of one of its most storied civilizations. The mosque served as a source of inspiration for widely visited sacred sites in Marrakech and Seville. Pilgrims once trekked through the High Atlas to pay their respects and visit. Yet centuries ago it fell into disrepair as political power shifted to Morocco's larger cities and coastline. 'It was abandoned by the state, but materials were never taken from it,' said Mouhcine El Idrissi, an archaeologist working with Morocco's Ministry of Culture. 'People here have long respected it as a witness to their glorious and spiritual past.' Some of the historic sites of the High Atlas have long been a lure to tourists. But the earthquake shone a spotlight on the vast disparities plaguing the primarily agricultural region. Poverty and illiteracy rates are higher than the nationwide average, according to census data and an October 2023 government report on the five earthquake-hit provinces. 'The mountainous areas most affected were those already suffering from geographical isolation,' Civil Coalition for the Mountain, a group of Moroccan NGOs, said in a statement on the earthquake's anniversary. 'The tragedy revealed structural differences, and a situation caused by development policies that have always kept the mountains outside the scope of their objectives.' 'There's a Morocco that exists in Rabat and Marrakech, but we're talking about another Morocco that's in the mountains,' added Najia Ait Mohannad, the group's regional coordinator. 'Right now, the most urgent need is rebuilding houses.' The government has promised 'a well-thought-out, integrated and ambitious program' for the reconstruction and general upgrading of the affected regions, both in terms of infrastructure reinforcement and improving public services. It has also pledged to rebuild 'in harmony with the region's heritage and respecting its unique architectural features' and 'to respect the dignity and customs' of the population. For the village's residents, the landmark could stand as a symbol of reinvestment in one of Morocco's poorest regions, as well as a tribute to a glorious past. For now, it stands in disrepair, its enchanting ruins upheld by wooden scaffolding, while down the hill, villagers hang laundry and grow vegetables amid the remnants of their former homes and the plastic tents where they now live.	https://www.voanews.com/a/brick-by-brick-morocco-rebuilds-12th-century-mosque-destroyed-by-2023-quake-/7801343.html	2024-09-29T00:05:34-07:00	
Alcohol-free beer is gaining popularity, even at Oktoberfest	MUNICH — The head brewmaster for Weihenstephan, the world's oldest brewery, has a secret: He really likes alcohol-free beer. Even though he's quick to say he obviously enjoys real beer more, Tobias Zollo says he savors alcohol-free beer when he's working or eating lunch. It has the same taste but fewer calories than a soft drink, he said, thanks to the brewery's process of evaporating the alcohol. 'You can't drink beer every day — unfortunately,' he joked last week at the Bavarian state brewery in the German town of Freising, about 30 kilometers north of Munich. Zollo isn't alone in his appreciation for the sober beverage. Alcohol-free beer has been gaining popularity in recent years as beer consumption shrinks. At Weihenstephan, which was founded as a brewery in 1040 by Benedictine monks, non-alcoholic wheat beer and lager now make up 10% of the volume. The increase over the last few years, since they started making alcohol-free drinks in the 1990s, mirrors the statistics for the rest of Germany's beer industry. 'The people are unfortunately — I have to say that as a brewer — unfortunately drinking less beer,' Zollo said Friday, the day before Oktoberfest officially started. 'If there's an alternative to have the crisp and fresh taste from a typical Weihenstephan beer, but just as a non-alcoholic version, we want to do that.' Even at Oktoberfest — arguably the world's most famous ode to alcohol — alcohol-free beer is on the menu. All but two of the 18 large tents at the festival offer the drink through the celebration's 16 days. The sober beverage will cost drinkers the same as an alcoholic beer — between 13.60 and 15.30 euros ($15.12 and $17.01) for a 1-liter mug — but save them from a hangover. 'For people who don't like to drink alcohol and want to enjoy the Oktoberfest as well, I think it's a good option,' Mikael Caselitz, 24, of Munich said Saturday inside one of the tents. 'Sometimes people feel like they have more fun with alcohol, which is not a good thing because you can also have fun without alcohol.' He added: 'If you want to come and drink alcohol-free beer, nobody will judge you.' This year marked the first time an alcohol-free beer garden opened in Munich. 'Die Null,' which means 'the zero' in German, served non-alcoholic beer, mocktails and other alcohol-free drinks near the city's main train station this summer but was scheduled to close a few day before Oktoberfest opened. Walter König, managing director of the Society of Hop Research north of Munich, said researchers have had to breed special hops varieties for alcohol-free beer. If brewers use the typical hops for alcohol-free beer, the distinct aroma gets lost when the alcohol is reduced during the brewing process. But customers don't care about that, König said Friday as he prepared for Oktoberfest. 'They only want to know that what they are tasting is as good as traditional beers with alcohol,' he said.	https://www.voanews.com/a/alcohol-free-beer-is-gaining-popularity-even-at-oktoberfest/7799892.html	2024-09-29T00:04:26-07:00	
Attacks by Islamic extremists are rampant in Africa's Sahel	DAKAR, Senegal — Extremist attacks in Sahel, an arid swath of land south of the Sahara in Africa, have proliferated in recent months: Last week, Islamic militants attacked Bamako, the capital of Mali, for the first time in almost a decade, demonstrating their capacity to carry out large scale assaults. And last month, at least 100 villagers and soldiers were killed in central Burkina Faso during a weekend attack on a village by al-Qaida-linked jihadis, as they were forcibly helping security forces dig trenches to protect security outposts and villages. Here's what we know about the security situation in Sahel: A region characterized by uprisings and coups Over the last decade, the region has been shaken by extremist uprisings and military coups. Three Sahelian nations, Mali, Niger and Burkina Faso, are now ruled by military leaders who have taken power by force, on the pledge of providing more security to citizens. But the security situation in Sahel has worsened since the juntas took power, analysts say, with a record number of attacks and a record number of civilians killed both by Islamic fighters and government forces. Over the first six months of this year, 3,064 civilians were killed by the violence, according to the Armed Conflict Location and Event Data Project, a 25% increase compared to the previous 6 months. Extremist groups operating in Sahel, and what they want The main two groups operating in the region are the al-Qaida-linked militant group Jama'at Nusrat al-Islam wal-Muslimin (JNIM), and the Islamic State in the Sahel. Over the last year, the JNIM has strengthened its presence in Mali and Burkina Faso, by becoming a more coherent political grouping. 'The local populations support (JNIM) more than IS-affiliated groups,' said analyst Shaantanu Shankar of the Economist Intelligence Unit. 'They have integrated local rebel groups, which have close community ties.' Unlike JNIM, Islamic State in the Sahel is a loose coalition of anti-government forces that is much less entrenched politically, he said. They are much more dominant in the Lake Chad region. These groups attack, terrorize and kill local populations and their actions likely amount to war crimes, according to rights organizations. In addition, there are also a number of local militia groups on the ground, which are not affiliated with IS or al-Qaida, as violence has exploded between rival ethnicities and local self-defense groups resulting in a self-perpetuating spiral of violence. Why the extremists in Sahel are getting stronger The military juntas in three countries have capitalized on popular discontent with the former democratically elected governments, which they saw as corrupt and propped up by France. After coming into power, all three juntas left the Economic Community of West African States, the nearly 50-year-old regional bloc known as ECOWAS, and created their own security partnership, the Alliance of Sahel States, in September. They have cut ties with the traditional Western allies, ousting French and American military forces, and instead sought new security ties with Russia. 'There is a huge security vacuum after the withdrawal of the French and American military' from the region, said Shankar, which cannot be filled by Russia. Troops from the Wagner Group, the Russian private military company, present in the region are being financed by the junta governments, Shankar added, with fewer financial resources. But experts say the other factor fueling instability is the worsening economic situation, as well as the lack of job opportunities, which contribute to the rising popularity of extremist groups. In all three countries, Islamic extremists have been recruiting among groups marginalized and neglected by the central governments. 'There are very few opportunities for people in rural Sahel, especially the youth,' said Heni Nsabia, the Armed Conflict Location and Event Data Project analysis coordinator for West Africa. 'But the other aspect is that people whose families and communities were targeted by state forces seek security, status and vengeance.' How the groups finance themselves Despite being affiliated with al-Qaida and the Islamic State group, extremist groups in the Sahel mostly get financial resources within their own strongholds, analysts said. They impose taxes on the local population, take control of the management of natural resources, especially of gold, and steal cattle. They also impose sieges on towns and use kidnappings, improvised explosive devices and landmines as they seek to control supply routs and resources. The extremists are also involved in trafficking, especially of drugs, said Aaryaman Shah, a security analyst who specializes in the financing of extremist groups. And they profit from people smuggling — which might bring them even more money in the future. 'We are concerned about the recent turmoil in Libya, and how that could actually affect the migrant flow,' said Shah. 'We are also looking at Niger, where the junta disbanded the law stopping people from crossing into Libya.' The business model that these groups developed is very diversified, analysts said. 'This is why it is difficult to destroy them economically,' said Nsabia from ACLED. 'If you target one aspect, they have other sources of revenues.' The outlook for the future Analysts predict that the situation in the Sahel is going to worsen in the coming months, with the military governments becoming increasingly desperate as they focus on preserving their political existence, and no way of holding them accountable. 'It's a very volatile phase, security is projected to get worse in the next two years,' said Shankar of the Economist Intelligence Unit. And the violence has been spilling outside the Sahel borders: Extremists believed to be linked to al-Qaida have crossed into Benin and the north of Nigeria, the latest trend in the militants' movements to wealthier West African coastal nations. 'It's undeniable that things are getting worse, and the scope of the threat has been expanding,' said Nsabia. 'Today, we should not be talking only about Sahel, but also about Benin and Togo, where the JNIM have done excursions as far as 200 kilometers inland.' Europe and United States are seeking to support the governments of these coastal nations in their counter-terrorism efforts. Michael Langley, the top U.S. commander for Africa, told reporters last week the U.S. was in talks with Ivory Coast, Ghana and Benin as the country starts 'to reset and recalibrate some of our assets.' A major challenge has been, and will continue to be, access to information, experts said. All juntas significantly restricted journalism, so now they are in complete control of the narrative, including of who is defined as a jihadi. In Mali, the government branded all Touaregs an ethnic group which staged a rebellion against the government, as jihadis, although only some of them allied with JNIM.	https://www.voanews.com/a/attacks-by-islamic-extremists-are-rampant-in-africa-s-sahel/7799880.html	2024-09-29T00:03:26-07:00	
Israel carries out raids on 'dozens' of Hezbollah targets in Lebanon: IDF	Jerusalem — The Israeli military said Sunday it conducted strikes against 'dozens' of Hezbollah targets in Lebanon, two days after an air strike killed the group's chief Hassan Nasrallah. The Israel Defense Forces 'attacked dozens of terrorist targets in the territory of Lebanon in the last few hours,' the army said in a statement on Telegram. The statement said the strikes targeted 'buildings where weapons and military structures of the organization were stored.' Israel has attacked 'hundreds' of Hezbollah targets in the last day, it added, as it aims to disable the group. On Friday, an Israeli air strike on a suburb of Beirut killed Hezbollah's longtime leader Nasrallah, sparking fears of an all-out war in the region. More than 700 people have been killed in Israeli strikes on Lebanon, according to health ministry figures, since the bombardment of Hezbollah strongholds began earlier this month. Hezbollah began low-intensity cross-border strikes on Israeli troops a day after its Palestinian ally Hamas staged its unprecedented attack on Israel on October 7, triggering war in the Gaza Strip.	https://www.voanews.com/a/israel-carries-out-raids-on-dozens-of-hezbollah-targets-in-lebanon-idf/7803432.html	2024-09-28T22:24:38-07:00	
Nepal closes schools after heavy rains kill 100	KATHMANDU, Nepal — Nepal has shut schools for three days after landslides and floods triggered by two days of heavy rain across the Himalayan nation killed 100, with 67 missing, officials said Sunday. Flooding brought traffic and normal activity to a standstill in the Kathmandu valley, where 37 deaths were recorded in a region home to 4 million people and the capital. Authorities said students and their parents faced difficulties as university and school buildings damaged by the rains needed repair. 'We have urged the concerned authorities to close schools in the affected areas for three days,' Lakshmi Bhattarai, a spokesperson for the education ministry, told Reuters. Some parts of the capital reported rain of up to 32.2. centimeters, pushing the level of its main Bagmati river up 2.2 meters past the danger mark, experts said. But there were some signs of respite on Sunday morning, with the rains easing in many places, said Govinda Jha, a weather forecaster in the capital. 'There may be some isolated showers, but heavy rains are unlikely,' he said. Kathmandu weather officials blamed the heavy downpours on a low-pressure system in the Bay of Bengal extending over parts of neighboring India close to Nepal. Haphazard development amplifies climate change risks in Nepal, say climate scientists at the International Centre for Integrated Mountain Development. 'I’ve never before seen flooding on this scale in Kathmandu,' said Arun Bhakta Shrestha, an environmental risk official at the center. In a statement, it urged the government and city planners to 'urgently' step up investment in, and plans for, infrastructure, such as underground stormwater and sewage systems, both of the 'grey,' or engineered kind, and 'green,' or nature-based type. The impact of the rains was aggravated by poor drainage due to unplanned settlement and urbanization efforts, construction on floodplains, lack of areas for water retention, and encroachment on the Bagmati river, it added. The level in the Koshi river in Nepal's southeast has started to fall, however, said Ram Chandra Tiwari, the region's top bureaucrat. The river, which brings deadly floods to India's eastern state of Bihar nearly every year, had been running above the danger mark at a level nearly three times normal, he said.	https://www.voanews.com/a/nepal-closes-schools-after-heavy-rains-kill-100/7803430.html	2024-09-28T21:59:27-07:00	
In US, it’s time to roll up sleeves for new COVID, flu shots	WASHINGTON — Fall means it's time for just about everybody to get up to date on their flu and COVID-19 vaccines – and a lot of older adults also need protection against another risky winter virus, RSV. Yes, you can get your flu and COVID-19 shots at the same time. Don't call them boosters — they're not just another dose of last year's protection. The coronavirus and influenza are escape artists that constantly mutate to evade your body's immune defenses, so both vaccines are reformulated annually to target newer strains. 'Right now is the best time' to get all the recommended fall vaccinations, said Dr. Mandy Cohen, director of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, as she got her flu shot Wednesday. She has an appointment for her COVID-19 shot, too. It's 'the single most effective thing you can do to protect yourself, your family, your community.' While they're not perfect, vaccinations offer strong protection against a bad case of flu or COVID-19 — or dying from it. 'It may not prevent every infection but those infections are going to be less severe,' said CDC's Dr. Demetre Daskalakis. 'I would rather have my grandmother or my great-grandmother have a sniffle than have to go to the emergency room on Thanksgiving.' The challenge: Getting more Americans to roll up their sleeves. Last year, just 45% of adults got a flu vaccination and even fewer, 23%, got a COVID-19 shot. A survey released Wednesday by the National Foundation for Infectious Diseases shows an equally low number intend to this fall. And the coronavirus still killed more Americans than flu last year. 'Maybe we believe that it's not going to be me but let's not take a chance,' said Dr. Michael Knight of George Washington University. 'Why not get a vaccine that's going to help you reduce that risk?' Who needs a fall COVID-19 or flu vaccination? The CDC urges both an updated COVID-19 shot and yearly flu vaccine for everyone ages 6 months and older. If you recently had COVID-19, you can wait two or three months but still should get an updated vaccination because of the expected winter surge. Both viruses can be especially dangerous to certain groups including older people and those with weak immune systems and lung or heart disease. Young children also are more vulnerable. The CDC counted 199 child deaths from flu last year. Pregnancy also increases the chances of serious COVID-19 or flu – and vaccination guards mom plus ensures the newborn has some protection, too. What's new about the COVID-19 shots? Last fall's shots targeted a coronavirus strain that's no longer spreading while this year's are tailored to a new section of the coronavirus family tree. The Pfizer and Moderna shots are formulated against a virus subtype called KP.2 while the Novavax vaccine targets its parent strain, JN.1. Daskalakis said all should offer good cross protection to other subtypes now spreading. The Pfizer and Moderna mRNA vaccines can be used by adults and children as young as 6 months. The Novavax shot is a more traditional protein vaccine combined with an immune booster, and open to anyone 12 and older. Which flu vaccine to choose? High-dose shots and one with a special immune booster are designed for people 65 and older, but if they can't find one easily they can choose a regular all-ages flu shot. For the shot-averse, the nasal spray FluMist is available for ages 2 to 49 at pharmacies and clinics — although next year it's set to be available for use at home. All flu vaccinations this year will guard against two Type A flu strains and one Type B strain. Another once-common form of Type B flu quit spreading a few years ago and was removed from the vaccine. What about that other virus, RSV? RSV, or respiratory syncytial virus, is a coldlike nuisance for most people but it, too, packs hospitals every winter and can be deadly for children under 5, the elderly and people with certain high-risk health problems. The CDC recommends an RSV vaccination for everyone 75 and older, and for people 60 to 74 who are at increased risk. This is a one-time shot, not a yearly vaccination – but only 24% of seniors got it last year. It's also recommended late in pregnancy to protect babies born during the fall and winter. And while 'your arm may hurt and you may feel crummy for a day,' it's also fine to get the RSV, flu and COVID-19 vaccines at the same time, Daskalakis said. What will it cost? The vaccines are supposed to be free under Medicare, Medicaid and most private insurance plans if people use an in-network provider. About 1.5 million uninsured adults got free COVID-19 vaccinations through a federal program last year but that has ended. Instead, the CDC is providing $62 million to health departments to help improve access -- and states and large cities are starting to roll out their plans. Call your local health department to ask about options because in many areas, 'availability of vaccine at lower or no cost is expected to trickle in over the next couple of weeks,' advised Dr. Raynard Washington, who heads the Mecklenburg County, North Carolina, health department. Check the government website, vaccines.gov, for availability at local pharmacies.	https://www.voanews.com/a/in-us-it-s-time-to-roll-up-sleeves-for-new-covid-flu-shots-/7801310.html	2024-09-28T21:51:36-07:00	
Trump lists his grievances in a Wisconsin speech intended to link Harris to illegal immigration	PRAIRIE DU CHIEN, Wisconsin — Former President Donald Trump meandered Saturday through a list of grievances against Vice President Kamala Harris and other issues during an event intended to link his Democratic opponent to illegal border crossings. A day after Harris discussed immigration at the U.S.-Mexico border, Trump spoke to a crowd in Prairie du Chien, Wisconsin, about immigration. He blamed Harris for migrants committing crimes after entering the U.S. illegally, alleging she was responsible for 'erasing our border.' 'I will liberate Wisconsin from the mass migrant invasion,' he said. 'We're going to liberate the country.' Trump hopes frustration over illegal immigration will translate to votes in Wisconsin and other crucial swing states. The Republican nominee has denounced people who cross the U.S.-Mexico border as 'poisoning the blood of the country' and vowed to stage the largest deportation operation in American history if elected. And polls show Americans believe Trump would do a better job than Harris on handling immigration. Trump shifted from topic to topic so quickly that it was hard to keep track of what he meant at times. He talked about the two assassination attempts against him and blamed the U.S. Secret Service for not being able to hold a large outdoor rally instead of an event in a smaller indoor space. But he also offered asides about climate change, Harris' father, how his beach body was better than President Joe Biden's, and a fly that was buzzing near him. 'I wonder where the fly came from,' he said. 'Two years ago, I wouldn't have had a fly up here. You're changing rapidly. But we can't take it any longer. We can't take it any longer.' Trump repeatedly brought up Harris' Friday event in Douglas, Arizona, where she announced a push to further restrict asylum claims beyond Biden's executive order announced earlier this year. Harris denounced Trump's handling of the border while president and his opposing a bipartisan border package earlier this year, saying Trump 'prefers to run on a problem instead of fixing a problem.' 'I had to sit there and listen' to Harris last night Trump said, eliciting cheers. 'And who puts it on? Fox News. They should not be allowed to put it on. It's all lies. Everything she says is lies.' The Republican nominee also intensified his personal attacks against Harris, insulting her as 'mentally impaired' and a 'disaster.' Trump professed not to understand what Harris meant when she said he was responsible for taking children from their parents. Under his administration, border agents separated children from their parents at the U.S.-Mexico border in a policy that was condemned globally as inhumane and one that Trump himself ended under pressure from his own party. Harris, at a rally in San Francisco, told supporters there were 'two very different visions for our nation' and voters see it 'every day on the campaign trail.' 'Donald Trump is the same old tired show,' she said. 'The same tired playbook we have heard for years.' She said Trump was 'a very unserious man.' 'However, the consequences of putting him back in the White House are extremely serious.' At Trump's event, on either side of the stage were poster-sized mug shots of men in the U.S. illegally accused of a crime, including Alejandro Jose Coronel Zarate, a case Trump cited in his speech. Wisconsin Republicans in recent days have cited the story of Coronel Zarate's arrest in Prairie du Chien as more evidence that people in the country illegally are committing crimes across the United States, not just in southern border states. Prosecutors charged Coronel Zarate on September 18 with sexual assault, child abuse, strangulation and domestic abuse. His lawyers declined to comment.	https://www.voanews.com/a/trump-lists-his-grievances-in-a-wisconsin-speech-intended-to-link-harris-to-illegal-immigration/7803421.html	2024-09-28T19:44:38-07:00	
Protesters rally to dispute Maduro's claim he won July presidential election in Venezuela	Caracas, Venezuela — Small groups of opposition protesters rallied Saturday in Venezuela, joined by supporters outside the country, marking two months since the country's disputed election that President Nicolas Maduro claimed to have won. Opposition leader Maria Corina Machado, in hiding after denouncing the proclaimed results as fraudulent, called for smaller gatherings to avoid security crackdowns seen at earlier protests. About 30 people shouted slogans at a Caracas plaza, including Leida Brito, known as 'Red Helmet Grandmother' from her years of anti-government activism. 'Nicolas Maduro should leave because he lost,' she said, holding a sign that read: 'To defend the vote is a right.' 'The freedom of Venezuela is in danger,' Hidalgo Valero, a retired colonel, told AFP. 'Today our people are afraid to be in the streets because there is tremendous repression.' Machado addressed supporters in a voice note released by her team: 'Here we are standing firm, advancing every day with more strength and enthusiasm, gathered here as the brave and good Venezuela.' Dozens of opposition leaders have been arrested since the contested poll, along with more than 2,400 other Venezuelans accused of terrorism for allegedly taking part in protests. Twenty-seven people were killed in the post-election clashes. The opposition says its candidate, Edmundo Gonzalez Urrutia, won the July 28 election with 67% of the vote, releasing its own tally of polling station results. Maduro, however, was declared the winner with 52% of the vote by the pro-government National Electoral Council, which has yet to release detailed voting results, as required by law. Gonzalez Urrutia, a 75-year-old retired diplomat, left Venezuela this month for asylum in Spain after spending weeks in hiding. Larger protests also took place outside Venezuela, including in Mexico City, Buenos Aires, Panama City and Montevideo. In Madrid, Gonzalez Urrutia greeted supporters who were waving the Venezuelan flag. Meanwhile, hundreds of Maduro supporters marched in Caracas to proclaim victory in the election. Maduro told the crowd the 'supposed queen bee,' in reference to Machado, 'is beginning to pack her Gucci suitcases ... she is preparing to leave, too.' 'We are not in Madrid, we are not hiding, we are in the street,' he declared. On Thursday, about 30 countries led by the United States and Argentina urged Maduro to engage in dialogue with the opposition. In a joint statement, the countries called for 'constructive and inclusive discussions' on a democratic transition and to immediately release Venezuelans detained in the election aftermath.	https://www.voanews.com/a/protesters-rally-to-dispute-maduro-s-claim-he-won-july-presidential-election-in-venezuela/7803418.html	2024-09-28T19:16:25-07:00	
12 dead in strikes targeting pro-Iranian fighters in Syria, monitor says	beirut — Twelve pro-Iranian fighters have been killed in airstrikes in eastern Syria, a war monitor said Sunday, adding that a large number of people were wounded. Twelve pro-Iranian fighters were killed in airstrikes of unknown origin targeting their positions in the city of Deir El Zour and to the east of the city, as well as the Boukamal region, near the border with Iraq, the Syrian Observatory for Human Rights said. The strikes were not immediately claimed by any entity, according to the monitor. Five strikes targeted military positions near Deir El Zour airport, it added. Iran has been providing military aid to Syria since the civil war there began in 2011, while Israel has carried out hundreds of strikes targeting pro-Iranian groups in eastern Syria. The United States has also targeted such groups in the country's east. Israeli authorities rarely comment on individual strikes in Syria but have repeatedly said they will not allow archenemy Iran to expand its presence there. Israel has launched an intense bombing campaign against Hezbollah strongholds in Lebanon in recent days, intensifying fears of a regional war. The Israeli army has also repeatedly targeted the movement's arms supply routes on the Syrian-Lebanese border, according to the Syrian Observatory for Human Rights.	https://www.voanews.com/a/dead-in-strikes-targeting-pro-iranian-fighters-in-syria-monitor-says/7803414.html	2024-09-28T18:37:21-07:00	
Austria holds tight election with far-right bidding for historic win	VIENNA — Austrians elect a new parliament Sunday with the far-right Freedom Party (FPO) aiming to secure its first general election win in a neck-and-neck race with the ruling conservatives that has been dominated by economic worries and immigration. Having led opinion polls for months, the FPO's edge over the Austrian People's Party (OVP) has shrunk to almost nothing as Chancellor Karl Nehammer casts himself as a statesman and depicts his rival, FPO leader Herbert Kickl, as a toxic menace. Whoever wins will fall well short of an absolute majority, polls show but claim the right to lead a coalition government. Projections are due minutes after polls close at 5 p.m. (1500 GMT), with results being finessed over the ensuing hours. 'What's at stake is whether the FPO will appoint the chancellor or not,' said Kathrin Stainer-Haemmerle, political science professor at the Carinthia University of Applied Sciences. 'Should that happen, then I have to say the role of Austria in the European Union would be significantly different. Kickl has often said that (Hungarian Prime Minister) Viktor Orban is a role model for him and he will stand by him.' The Eurosceptic, Russia-friendly FPO, which is critical of Islam and pledges tougher rules on asylum-seekers, won a national vote for the first time in June when it beat the OVP by less than a percentage point in European elections. An FPO victory would make Austria the latest European Union country to register surging far-right support after gains in countries including the Netherlands, France and Germany. President Alexander Van der Bellen, who oversees the formation of governments, has voiced reservations about the FPO because of its criticism of the EU and its failure to condemn Russia's invasion of Ukraine. The party also opposes EU sanctions on Moscow, citing Austria's neutrality. He has hinted he might thwart Kickl, noting the constitution does not require him to ask the first-placed party to form a government, even though that has long been the convention. The OVP, which like the FPO backs tougher immigration rules and tax cuts, is the only party open to forming a coalition with the far-right party. Polls suggest they could muster a majority together, but Nehammer says his party won’t join a government with Kickl. 'Ideally I would vanish into thin air for you, but I won't do you that favor, Mr. Nehammer,' Kickl, 55, said this week when asked if he would stand aside to let his party be junior partner under the OVP. 'Fortress Austria' Kickl has relished the role of opposition firebrand but has at times appeared uncomfortable trying to moderate his tone to widen his leadership appeal. The FPO wants to stop granting asylum altogether and build a 'fortress Austria' preventing migrants from entering, even though that would be widely viewed as illegal or impractical. In his closing campaign speech, Kickl said sanctions against Moscow were hurting Austria even more than Russia, adding, 'if you look at Germany, VW for example, the threat of mass unemployment and everything that then spills over into Austria.' Nehammer has sought to depict Kickl as a conspiracy theorist shouting from the sidelines while he is running Austria. The 51-year-old Nehammer has since 2021 led a coalition with the left-wing Greens, but the alliance has proved fractious with the economy struggling and inflation worrying voters. Some voters think Nehammer's crisis-management efforts against severe flooding that struck Austria this month probably helped him regain ground in the election race. Susanne Pinter, 55, a Greens supporter in Vienna said the floods had helped Nehammer look statesman-like, as she fretted about the prospect of a far-right victory. 'If the FPO wins ... it'll have bad consequences for women, people of migrant origin and climate change,' she said.	https://www.voanews.com/a/austria-holds-tight-election-with-far-right-bidding-for-historic-win/7803410.html	2024-09-28T18:19:26-07:00	
SpaceX launches rescue mission for 2 NASA astronauts stranded in space	CAPE CANAVERAL, Florida — SpaceX launched a rescue mission for the two stuck astronauts at the International Space Station on Saturday, sending up a downsized crew to bring them home but not until next year. The capsule rocketed into orbit to fetch the test pilots whose Boeing spacecraft returned to Earth empty earlier this month because of safety concerns. The switch in rides left it to NASA's Nick Hague and Russia's Alexander Gorbunov to retrieve Butch Wilmore and Suni Williams. Because NASA rotates space station crews approximately every six months, this newly launched flight with two empty seats reserved for Wilmore and Williams won't return until late February. Officials said there wasn't a way to bring them back earlier on SpaceX without interrupting other scheduled missions. By the time they return, the pair will have logged more than eight months in space. They expected to be gone just a week when they signed up for Boeing's first astronaut flight that launched in June. NASA ultimately decided that Boeing's Starliner was too risky after a cascade of thruster troubles and helium leaks marred its trip to the orbiting complex. The space agency cut two astronauts from this SpaceX launch to make room on the Dragon capsule's return leg for Wilmore and Williams. Wilmore and Williams watched the liftoff via a live link sent to the space station, prompting a cheer of 'Go Dragon!' from Williams, NASA deputy program manager Dina Contella said. Williams has been promoted to commander of the space station, which will soon be back to its normal population of seven. Once Hague and Gorbunov arrive Sunday, four astronauts living there since March can leave in their own SpaceX capsule. Their homecoming was delayed a month by Starliner's turmoil. Hague noted before the flight that change is the one constant in human spaceflight. 'There's always something that is changing. Maybe this time it's been a little more visible to the public,' he said. Hague was thrust into the commander's job for the rescue mission based on his experience and handling of a launch emergency six years ago. The Russian rocket failed shortly after liftoff, and the capsule carrying him and a cosmonaut catapulted off the top to safety. Rookie NASA astronaut Zena Cardman and veteran space flier Stephanie Wilson were pulled from this flight after NASA opted to go with SpaceX to bring the stuck astronauts home. Promised a future space mission, both were at NASA's Kennedy Space Center, taking part in the launch livestream. Gorbunov remained on the flight under an exchange agreement between NASA and the Russian Space Agency. 'Every crewed launch that I have ever watched has really brought me a lot of emotion. This one today was especially unique,' a teary-eyed Cardman said following the early afternoon liftoff. 'It was hard not to watch that rocket lift off without thinking, 'That's my rocket and that's my crew.'' Moments before liftoff, Hague paid tribute to his two colleagues left behind: 'Unbreakable. We did it together.' Once in orbit, he called it a 'sweet ride' and thanked everyone who made it possible. Earlier, Hague acknowledged the challenges of launching with half a crew and returning with two astronauts trained on another spacecraft. 'We've got a dynamic challenge ahead of us,' Hague said after arriving from Houston last weekend. 'We know each other and we're professionals and we step up and do what's asked of us.' SpaceX has long been the leader in NASA's commercial crew program, established as the space shuttles were retiring more than a decade ago. SpaceX beat Boeing in delivering astronauts to the space station in 2020, and it is now up to 10 crew flights for NASA. Boeing has struggled with a variety of issues over the years, repeating a Starliner test flight with no one on board after the first one veered off course. The Starliner that left Wilmore and Williams in space landed without any issues in the New Mexico desert on September 6, and has since returned to Kennedy Space Center. A week ago, Boeing's defense and space chief was replaced. Delayed by Hurricane Helene pounding Florida, the latest SpaceX liftoff marked the first for astronauts from Launch Complex 40 at Cape Canaveral Space Force Station. SpaceX took over the old Titan rocket pad nearly two decades ago and used it for satellite and station cargo launches, while flying crews from Kennedy's former Apollo and shuttle pad next door. The company wanted more flexibility as more Falcon rockets soared.	https://www.voanews.com/a/spacex-launches-rescue-mission-for-2-nasa-astronauts-stranded-in-space/7803409.html	2024-09-28T18:19:01-07:00	
Europeans, Arab and Muslim nations launch initiative for Palestinian state	UNITED NATIONS — European, Arab and Islamic nations have launched an initiative to strengthen support for a Palestinian state and prepare for a future after the war in Gaza and escalating conflict in Lebanon, Norway's foreign minister said Friday. Espen Barth Eide told The Associated Press that 'there is a growing consensus in the international community from Western countries, from Arab countries, from the Global South, that we need to establish a Palestinian Authority, a Palestinian government, a Palestinian state — and the Palestinian state has to be recognized.' Eide said many issues need to be addressed, including the security interests of Israel and the Palestinians, recognition and normalization of relations after decades of conflict and the demobilization of Hamas as a military group. 'These are pieces of a bigger puzzle,' Norway's chief diplomat said. 'And you can't just come in there with one of these pieces, because it only works if all the pieces are laid in place.' But even if the puzzle is completed, it's unlikely to gain traction with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu. Still, Eide believes that after decades of failed or stalled negotiations, 'we need to take a new approach' to achieving an independent Palestinian state. To accelerate work on these issues, Eide said almost 90 countries attended a meeting Thursday on the sidelines of the U.N. General Assembly's current gathering of world leaders. He and Saudi Arabia's foreign minister co-chaired the session to launch 'The Global Alliance for the Implementation of a Palestinian State and a Two-State Solution.' 'We have to see how we can come out of this deadlock and try to use this deep crisis also as an opportunity to move forward,' Eide told a U.N. Security Council meeting on Gaza later Friday. Norway is the guarantor of the 1993 Oslo Accords, hailed as a breakthrough in the decades-long conflict between Arabs and Jews, which created the Palestinian Authority and set up self-rule areas in the Palestinian Authority. Eide said more than 30 years later, Israel's 'occupation' is continuing, and there are no negotiations leading to a final settlement and an independent Palestinian state, which led to Norway's decision in May to recognize a Palestinian state. Eide brought up the alliance again Saturday during his address to the annual meeting of world leaders at the U.N. General Assembly, stressing that 'while cease-fires in Gaza and Lebanon are most urgently needed, ending hostilities must not be confused with lasting solutions.' He again called on the 44 U.N. member nations that haven't done so to recognize the state of Palestine and allow it to become a full member of the United Nations. And he called on 'everyone who can, to help to build Palestine's institutions, and on regional actors to help embed a political settlement in a broader regional framework.' Saudi Foreign Minister Prince Faisal bin Farhan Al-Saud told the U.N. Security Council on Friday that his country, the joint Islamic-Arab ministerial committee, Norway and the European Union launched the alliance 'because we feel responsible to act to change the reality of the conflict without delay.' He told the assembly Saturday that the coalition aimed 'to promote the two-state solution,' calling on all countries to join the group and to recognize the Palestinians as an independent state. EU foreign policy chief Josep Borrell urged all countries to take practical measures 'to bring about the free Palestine next to a secure Israel.' First meetings will be in Saudi Arabia and Belgium Eide said this new effort is built on the 2002 Arab Peace Initiative, 'but updated to today's reality.' The 2002 initiative, endorsed by the Arab League and the 57-member Organization of Islamic Cooperation, offered Israel normalized relations in exchange for a full withdrawal from territories captured in 1967.	https://www.voanews.com/a/europeans-arab-and-muslim-nations-launch-initiative-for-palestinian-state/7803405.html	2024-09-28T17:51:08-07:00

Marburg virus kills 6 in Rwanda, health minister says	KIGALI, Rwanda — Rwanda has confirmed six deaths and 20 cases of Marburg disease, the country's health minister Sabin Nsanzimana said late on Saturday. The majority of victims are health workers in the intensive care unit, Nsanzimana said in a video statement posted on X. 'We are counting 20 people who are infected, and six who have already passed away due to this virus. The large majority of cases and deaths are among healthcare workers, mainly in the intensive care unit,' the health minister said. Marburg disease, a viral hemorrhagic fever, can cause death among some patients, with symptoms including severe headache, vomiting, muscle aches and stomach aches, the ministry has said. Institutions and partners are working to trace those who have been in contact with the virus-affected individuals, the minister added. With a fatality rate of as high as 88%, Marburg is from the same virus family as the one responsible for Ebola and is transmitted to people from fruit bats. It then spreads through contact with bodily fluids of infected people. Neighboring Tanzania had cases of Marburg in 2023, while Uganda had similar ones in 2017.	https://www.voanews.com/a/marburg-virus-kills-6-in-rwanda-health-minister-says/7803399.html	2024-09-28T17:21:10-07:00	
48 dead in 2 days of Sudan paramilitary attacks on Darfur city, doctor says	Port Sudan, Sudan — Two days of attacks by Sudanese paramilitaries on the Darfur city of El Fasher killed 48 people, a medical source told AFP on Friday, after world leaders appealed for an end to the country's suffering. Artillery fire from the Rapid Support Forces killed 30 people and wounded dozens on Friday, a medical source at El Fasher Teaching Hospital told AFP, as the paramilitaries and regular army vie for control of the North Darfur state capital. The shelling comes a day after an assault on a market brought '18 dead to the hospital' on Thursday, 'some of them burned and others killed by shrapnel,' the source said, requesting anonymity for their protection in light of repeated attacks on health workers and hospitals. The plight of Sudan, and El Fasher in particular, has been under discussion this week at the U.N. General Assembly in New York after 17 months of devastating fighting between the RSF and the regular army. 'We must compel the warring parties to accept humanitarian pauses in El Fasher, Khartoum and other highly vulnerable areas,' the U.S. ambassador to the United Nations, Linda Thomas-Greenfield, said Wednesday. The Teaching Hospital is one of the last still receiving patients in El Fasher, where reports of a 'full-scale assault' by RSF last weekend led U.N. chief Antonio Guterres to call for an urgent cease-fire. The paramilitaries have besieged El Fasher since May, and famine has been declared in Zamzam refugee camp near the city of 2 million. The war has killed tens of thousands of people. The World Health Organization has cited a toll of at least 20,000, but U.S. envoy Tom Perriello has said some estimates reach 150,000. U.S. President Joe Biden, who raised particular concern over the assault on El Fasher, on Tuesday urged all countries to cut off weapons supplies to the country's warring generals, armed forces chief Abdel Fattah Burhan and RSF commander Mohamed Hamdan Dagalo. 'The world needs to stop arming the generals,' Biden told the U.N. General Assembly. On the sidelines of the U.N. talks, Guterres met with Burhan, expressing concern about escalation and the risk of 'a regional spillover,' the UN said. Both sides have been repeatedly accused of war crimes. The RSF, which has its origins in Darfur's notorious Arab tribal militias, the Janjaweed, has been specifically accused of crimes against humanity and ethnic cleansing. Darfur, a region the size of France, is home to around a quarter of Sudan's population but more than half of its 10 million people are internally displaced.	https://www.voanews.com/a/dead-in-2-days-of-sudan-paramilitary-attacks-on-darfur-city-doctor-says/7803207.html	2024-09-28T17:07:07-07:00	
Belgian Catholic university denounces pope's views on women's roles in society	brussels — Pope Francis' burdensome trip through Belgium reached new lows Saturday when defiant Catholic university women demanded to his face a 'paradigm change' on women's issues in the church and then expressed deep disappointment when Francis dug in. The Catholic University of Louvain, the Francophone campus of Belgium's storied Catholic university, issued a scathing statement after Francis visited and repeated his view that women are the 'fertile' nurturers of the church, inducing grimaces in his audience. 'UC Louvain expresses its incomprehension and disapproval of the position expressed by Pope Francis regarding the role of women in the church and society,' the statement said, calling the pope's views 'deterministic and reductive.' Francis' trip to Belgium, ostensibly to celebrate the university's 600th anniversary, was always going to be difficult, given Belgium's legacy of clerical sexual abuse and secular trends that have emptied churches in the once staunchly Catholic country. Francis got an earful Friday about the abuse crisis starting with King Philippe and Prime Minister Alexander Croos and continuing on down to the victims themselves. But it's one thing for the pope to be lambasted by the liberal prime minister for the church's mishandling of priests who raped children. It's quite another to be openly criticized by the Catholic university that invited him and long was the Vatican's intellectual fiefdom in Belgium. Church needs 'paradigm shift,' say students The students made an impassioned plea to Francis for the church to change its view of women. It is an issue Francis knows well: He has made some changes during his 11-year pontificate, allowing women to serve as acolytes, appointing several women to high-ranking positions in the Vatican, and saying women must have greater decision-making roles in the church. But he has ruled out ordaining women as priests and has refused so far to budge on demands to allow women to serve as deacons, who perform many of the same tasks as priests. He has taken the women's issue off the table for debate at the Vatican's upcoming three-week synod, or meeting, because it's too thorny to be dealt with in such a short time. He has punted it to theologians and canonists to chew over into next year. In a letter read aloud on stage with the pope listening attentively, the students noted that Francis' landmark 2015 environmental encyclical Laudato Si (Praised Be) made virtually no mention of women, cited no women theologians and 'exalts their maternal role and forbids them access to ordained ministries.' 'Women have been made invisible. Invisible in their lives, women have also been invisible in their intellectual contributions,' the students said. 'What, then, is the place of women in the church?' they asked. 'We need a paradigm shift, which can and must draw on the treasures of spirituality as much as on the development of the various disciplines of science.' Francis said he liked what they said, but repeated his frequent refrain that 'the church is woman,' only exists because the Virgin Mary agreed to be the mother of Jesus, and that men and women were complementary. 'Woman is fertile welcome. Care. Vital devotion,' Francis said. 'Let us be more attentive to the many daily expressions of this love, from friendship to the workplace, from studies to the exercise of responsibility in the church and society, from marriage to motherhood, from virginity to the service of others and the building up of the kingdom of God.' Louvain said such terminology had no place in a university or society today. It emphasized the point with the entertainment for the event featuring a jazz rendition of Lady Gaga's LGBTQ+ anthem 'Born This Way.' 'UC Louvain can only express its disagreement with this deterministic and reductive position,' the statement said. 'It reaffirms its desire for everyone to flourish within it and in society, whatever their origins, gender or sexual orientation. It calls on the church to follow the same path, without any form of discrimination.' The comment followed a speech Friday by the rector of the Dutch campus of the university in which he ventured that the church would be a much more welcoming place if women could be priests. The university's back-to-back criticism was especially significant as Francis was long held up in Europe as a beacon of progressive hope following the conservative papacies of St. John Paul II and Pope Benedict XVI. Pope prays at king's tomb Yet Francis toed the conservative line earlier in the day too. He went to the royal crypt in the Church of Our Lady to pray at the tomb of King Baudouin, best known for having refused to give royal assent, one of his constitutional duties, to a parliament-approved bill legalizing abortion. Baudouin stepped down for one day in 1990 to allow the government to pass the law, which he would otherwise have been required to sign, before he was reinstated as king. Francis praised Baudouin's courage when he decided to 'leave his position as king to not sign a homicidal law,' according to the Vatican summary of the private encounter, which was attended by Baudouin's nephew, King Philippe, and Queen Mathilde. The pope then referred to a new legislative proposal to extend the legal limit for an abortion in Belgium, from 12 weeks to 18 weeks after conception. The bill failed at the last minute because parties in government negotiations considered the timing inopportune. Francis urged Belgians to look to Baudouin's example in preventing such a law and added that he hoped the former king's beatification cause would move ahead.	https://www.voanews.com/a/belgian-catholic-university-denounces-pope-s-views-on-women-s-roles-in-society-/7803197.html	2024-09-28T16:09:30-07:00	
Biden, Harris call Israeli killing of Hezbollah's Nasrallah 'measure of justice'	REHOBOTH BEACH, Delaware — The Israeli strike that killed Hezbollah's Hassan Nasrallah was a 'measure of justice' for victims of a four-decade 'reign of terror,' President Joe Biden said Saturday. The comments came after Lebanon's Hezbollah group confirmed earlier Saturday that Nasrallah, one of the group's founders, was killed in an Israeli airstrike in Beirut the previous day. Biden noted that the operation to take out Nasrallah took place in the broader context of the conflict that began with Hamas' massacre of Israelis on October 7, 2023. 'Nasrallah, the next day, made the fateful decision to join hands with Hamas and open what he called a 'northern front' against Israel,' Biden said in a statement. He also noted that Hezbollah under Nasrallah's watch has been responsible for the deaths of thousands of Americans, Israelis and Lebanese. Hezbollah attacks against U.S. interests include the truck bombing of the U.S. Embassy and multinational force barracks in Beirut in 1983 and the kidnapping of the Central Intelligence Agency chief of station in Beirut, who died while held captive. The U.S. said Hezbollah leaders armed and trained militias that carried out attacks on U.S. forces during the war in Iraq. The White House sees the death of Nasrallah as a huge blow to Hezbollah. At the same time, the administration has sought to tread carefully as it has tried to contain Israel's war with Hamas, which, like Hezbollah, is backed by Iran, from exploding into an all-out regional conflict. The White House and Pentagon were quick Friday, shortly after the strike, to say publicly that Israel offered it no forewarning of the operation. 'President Biden and I do not want to see conflict in the Middle East escalate into a broader regional war,' Vice President Kamala Harris said in a statement Saturday that echoed Biden's description of a 'measure of justice.' She added, 'diplomacy remains the best path forward to protect civilians and achieve lasting stability in the region.' The confirmation of Nasrallah's death comes during a week that began with Biden's top national security aides working on the sidelines of the United Nations General Assembly to build support for a 21-day Israel-Hezbollah cease-fire that they hoped might also breathe new life into stalled efforts to secure a truce in Gaza. Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu delivered a defiant speech Friday to the United Nations, vowing to keep up operations against Hezbollah until tens of thousands of Israeli citizens displaced by rocket attacks can return home. Shortly after, Israel carried out the strike that killed Nasrallah. Biden reiterated Saturday that he wants to see cease-fires both in Gaza and between Israel and Hezbollah. 'It is time for these deals to close, for the threats to Israel to be removed, and for the broader Middle East region to gain greater stability,' Biden said. Iranian President Masoud Pezeshkian accused the United States of supporting the killing that took out Nasrallah and dozens of others. 'The world community will not forget that the order of the terrorist strike was issued from New York and the Americans cannot absolve themselves from complicity with the Zionists,' Pezeshkian was quoted as saying in a statement read on Iranian state television.	https://www.voanews.com/a/biden-harris-call-israeli-killing-of-hezbollah-s-nasrallah-measure-of-justice-/7803193.html	2024-09-28T15:36:25-07:00	
At UN, Russian foreign minister dismisses Zelenskyy's peace plan as 'doomed'	united nations — Russia's foreign minister reinforced the Kremlin's disagreements with the West in his United Nations General Assembly remarks Saturday and showed no interest in a genuine peace with Ukraine. 'I'm not going to talk here about the senselessness and the danger of the very idea of trying to fight to victory with a nuclear power, which is what Russia is,' Sergey Lavrov said. Earlier this week, Russian President Vladimir Putin revised his government's nuclear doctrine, in a clear attempt to discourage the West from lifting its restrictions on Ukraine using long-range weapons to strike inside Russian territory. Lavrov dismissed Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy's 10-point peace formula as 'doomed,' and said a resolution of the conflict is not possible unless the root causes of the crisis, as Moscow sees them, are addressed. The veteran diplomat also took the opportunity to repeat complaints about NATO, Washington, London and the European Union. His speech came a few hours after Lebanese Hezbollah acknowledged the death of their leader, Hassan Nasrallah, following a series of targeted Israeli airstrikes in Beirut. 'We are particularly concerned by the now almost commonplace practice of political killings, as once again, took place yesterday in Beirut,' he told the assembly. At a news conference following his speech, Lavrov expressed concerns about a wider regional war. 'A lot of people say that Israel wants to create the grounds to drag the U.S. directly into this,' he said. 'And so, to create these grounds, is trying to provoke Iran and Hezbollah. So the Iran leadership, I think, are behaving extremely responsibly, and this is something that we should take due note of.' War in Ukraine In February 2022, Russia and China declared a 'no limits partnership,' just days before President Putin launched his full-scale invasion of Ukraine. The United States has repeatedly accused China of assisting the Kremlin with its war. 'China, another permanent member of this council, is the top provider of machine tools, microelectronics, and other items that Russia is using to rebuild, to restock, to ramp up its war machine and sustain its brutal aggression,' U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken said Tuesday at a high-level U.N. Security Council meeting on Ukraine that President Zelenskyy attended. Beijing denies the charge and has sought to distance itself publicly from Moscow on the war. 'The top priority is to commit to no expansion of the battlefield, no escalation of fighting, and no provocation by any party, and push for de-escalation of the situation as soon as possible,' Foreign Minister Wang Yi told the General Assembly on Saturday. Beijing says it is committed to playing 'a constructive role' in ending the conflict. China and 'multipolar world' On the margins of the annual U.N. meetings, China and Brazil launched what they are calling the group of friends for peace for Ukraine, which includes several other countries from the global south. In a sign of China's desire to be recognized as a global economic and political power, Wang said international relations should be 'more democratic.' 'Gone are the days when one or two major powers call the shots on everything,' he said. 'We should advocate an equal and orderly multipolar world and see that all countries, regardless of their size, have their own place and role in the multipolar system.' Wang also called for full U.N. membership for the Palestinians and urged implementation of a two-state solution. 'There must not be any delay in reaching a comprehensive cease-fire, and the fundamental way out lies in the two-state solution,' he said. Indonesian Foreign Minister Retno Marsudi asked the assembly how the international community could believe Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's claim on Friday that 'Israel yearns for peace.' 'Yesterday, while he was here, Israel conducted an unprecedented, massive air attack on Beirut. Prime Minister Netanyahu wants the war to continue. We must stop that! I repeat, we must stop that! We must pressure Israel to come back to a political solution for a two-state solution,' she said to much applause. Saudi Arabia's foreign minister also expressed concern about regional stability following the escalation in Lebanon. 'We call on all parties to show wisdom and to show restraint in order to avoid a true war breaking out in the region,' Prince Faisal bin Farhan Al-Saud said.	https://www.voanews.com/a/at-un-russian-foreign-minister-dismisses-zelenskyy-s-peace-plan-as-doomed-/7803182.html	2024-09-28T14:55:33-07:00

Hundreds rally in Paris to support world abortion rights	paris — Hundreds of people came out Saturday in Paris, marching in support of the right to abortion for women across the world, just six months after France became the first country to guarantee in its constitution a woman's right to voluntarily terminate a pregnancy. The protest, organized by civil society groups to mark International Safe Abortion Day, also called for greater and easier access to abortion in France, denouncing budget cuts, staff reductions and the closure of abortion centers and maternity wards, which organizers say all contribute to penalizing women. Sarah Durocher, president of France's not-for-profit family planning services, said French women sometimes must travel to another region to access the medical services needed to abort, denouncing the 'obstacle course' they sometimes face. Thibault Thomas, 28, said the ongoing trial of a man who has confessed to drugging his wife so that dozens of men could rape her while she was unconscious, was one of the reasons that motivated him to attend the protest Saturday. 'There's a mood in France, a particular context with the Mazan trial,' he said, referring to the name of the small Provence town where the couple had bought their retirement home, and where the repeated rapes occurred. 'This sweeps away all the excuses, or all the mitigating circumstances that we thought could have existed before,' Thomas said. 'In fact, it is something broader, generalized.' Earlier this year, France became the only country to explicitly guarantee a woman's right to voluntarily terminate a pregnancy, when lawmakers overwhelmingly approved a bill to enshrine abortion rights in the constitution. Abortion in France has been legal since 1975 and enjoys wide support across most of the political spectrum. Enshrining the right in the Constitution sought to prevent the kind of rollback seen in the United States in recent years. Still, many in the protest Saturday said the right to abort could never be taken for granted, especially at a time when far-right nationalist parties are gaining influence in France and other European countries. 'Every time the far right comes to power, sexual and reproductive rights are threatened. I don't see why there would be a French exception,' said Durocher, stressing that every nine minutes, a woman dies somewhere in the world for not having been able to access safe abortion. 'So obviously these rights are threatened.' Also in the Saturday march was a small organization representing Colombian women in Paris, carrying a large purple banner with a feminist sign. 'In France, fortunately, it is enshrined in the constitution. But we know that when we exert pressure in France or in Latin America, we also help all women to say, 'We are not alone,'' said 49-year-old Talula Rodriguez. 'We're all going to fight for rights, rights over our bodies.'	https://www.voanews.com/a/hundreds-rally-in-paris-to-support-world-abortion-rights-/7803144.html	2024-09-28T12:55:49-07:00	
Poland's flooding death toll rises after more bodies found	WARSAW, Poland — The death toll in Poland from recent floods rose to nine after two more bodies were found, the national police chief said Saturday. One person is still missing, police chief Marek Boron said during a government meeting on the effects of the floods that hit southwestern Poland earlier this month. The floods following torrential rains inundated houses and damaged bridges and roads in the towns of Stronie Slaskie, Nysa and many villages in the area. More than 20 people have died in Poland and elsewhere in Central Europe from the floods. A German citizen is among the dead in Poland, Prime Minister Donald Tusk said earlier this week. In the wake of the floods, Poland's 2025 draft budget will set aside $836 million as a reserve for dealing with natural disasters, the government said Saturday. The worst floods in at least two decades left many towns in southwestern Poland submerged, and the government plans to free up millions of dollars from the budget and European Union funds to deal with the aftermath. The deluge has also compounded the financial worries of a government facing the prospect of EU budget discipline measures. In a statement published after the government adopted the 2025 budget with changes due to the floods, it said that the reserve for counteracting and removing the effects of natural disasters would be increased. It said that around $5 million in EU funds would be allocated to helping regions affected by the floods. Finance Minister Andrzej Domanski said that no decision has been made on whether changes to the 2024 budget would be necessary.	https://www.voanews.com/a/poland-s-flooding-death-toll-rises-after-more-bodies-found/7803127.html	2024-09-28T12:21:15-07:00	
Czech opposition party wins most seats in election for third of Senate	prague — The main Czech opposition group led by former populist Prime Minister Andrej Babis won an election Saturday for a third of the seats in Parliament's upper house, the Senate. The ruling coalition of Prime Minister Petr Fiala still retained a majority in the Senate. With all the votes from the two-day ballot counted, Babis' ANO, or YES in English, won eight of the 27 seats up for grabs in the 81-seat Senate in the two-round election. It's the first time the centrist movement won that many seats in the chamber. The results are a boost for Babis ahead of next year's parliamentary elections. ANO has been the most popular party and is favored to win that vote. The candidates linked to the coalition won 15 seats. Parliament's lower house dominates the legislative process, but the Senate plays an important role in passing constitutional amendments and approving Constitutional Court judges. In a separate vote last week, ANO dominated Czech regional elections, winning 10 of the 13 regions contested. The current Czech government firmly stands behind Ukraine after it was invaded by Russia. The country has donated arms, including heavy weapons, to the Ukrainian armed forces and is behind a plan to acquire artillery shells Ukraine badly needs from countries outside the European Union. Some 320,000 refugees from Ukraine currently live in Czechia.	https://www.voanews.com/a/czech-opposition-party-wins-most-seats-in-election-for-third-of-senate-/7803106.html	2024-09-28T11:36:56-07:00	
6 killed by bomb blasts in Somalia after leader addresses UN	WASHINGTON — Bomb blasts in Mogadishu and a town in the country's Middle Shabelle region killed at least six people and injured 10 others Saturday, police said and witnesses confirmed to VOA. 'An explosives-laden vehicle, which was parked on the road near a restaurant in the busy Hamar Weyne district, went off. I could see the dead bodies of at least three people, two of them women,' Mohamed Haji Nur, a witness, told VOA. The explosion site is opposite of Somalia’s National Theater, about one kilometer from the president's office. The target of the attack is still unknown, but the affected Gel Doh restaurant is frequented by government staff and people from the diaspora for serving traditional Somali food. In a separate incident, a bomb planted in a livestock market in Jowhar city in Somalia's Middle Shabelle region killed one person and injured three other civilians, Jowhar police Commander Bashir Hassan told a news conference. It was not immediately clear who had carried out the attacks. However, the Islamist militant group al-Shabab is known for orchestrating bombings and gun attacks in Mogadishu and elsewhere in the Horn of Africa country. Barre addressed UN General Assembly Somalian Prime Minister Hamza Abdi Barre publicly accused Ethiopia before the U.N. General Assembly on Friday of actions that he says 'flagrantly violate' Somalia's territorial integrity. This accusation comes as tensions continue to escalate between the two neighboring countries since January, when Ethiopia struck a controversial maritime deal with the breakaway region of Somaliland. This region, at the northern tip of the country, declared independence in 1991 but lacks international recognition. Under the deal, Somaliland would lease 20 kilometers of shoreline to Ethiopia in return for recognition, a move that raised alarms in Mogadishu. 'Somalia currently faces a serious threat from Ethiopia's recent actions, which flagrantly violate our territorial integrity,' Prime Minister Barre stated at the U.N. General Assembly. Somalia has accused Ethiopia of unlawfully attempting to build a naval base and commercial port in Somaliland. 'Ethiopia's attempt to annex part of Somalia under the guise of securing sea access is both unlawful and unnecessary,' Barre emphasized, highlighting the gravity of the situation. Ethiopia, a landlocked nation, has long sought access to the sea, but its move to deal with Somaliland infuriated the Somali government. Barre elaborated on the implications of Ethiopia's actions, saying, 'Somalia ports have always been accessible for Ethiopia’s legitimate commercial activities, reflecting our commitment to regional trade and cooperation.' He warned, though, that 'Ethiopia's aggressive maneuvers undermine Somalia’s sovereignty and embolden secessionist movements, which could threaten national unity.' 'These actions also serve as propaganda for terrorist groups like al-Shabab, who exploit Ethiopia’s provocations to recruit and radicalize vulnerable individuals,' he said. Ethiopia denies accusations Addressing the General Debate of the 79th Session of the United Nations General Assembly, Taye Atske-Selassie, minister for foreign affairs of Ethiopia, denied Somalia’s accusation. 'Ethiopia’s memorandum of understanding with Somaliland is based on existing political dispensation in Somalia,' he said. 'Our objective is a shared growth and prosperity in the region. Similar agreements have been concluded by other states, and there is no reason for the government of Somalia to incite hostility that obviously intends to cover internal political tensions. I therefore reject the unfounded allegations leveled against my country.' In a show of defiance, several times Somalia has threatened to expel Ethiopian troops who have been part of an African Union mission against al-Shabab militants since 2007. Afyare Abdi Elmi, a Mogadishu-based professor of international affairs, told VOA that recent Egyptian military cooperation with Somalia raised concerns in Addis Ababa. 'The stakes are raised further, as Mogadishu has signed a military deal with Cairo and received weapons shipments that have alarmed Ethiopian officials.' 'I am afraid that the unfolding events signal a crucial moment in the Horn of Africa, with the potential to reshape the region's geopolitical landscape and security dynamics,' said Somalia analyst Abdiqafar Abdi Wardhere, who is based in Virginia. Last week, the Somali government accused Ethiopia of sending an 'unauthorized shipment of arms and ammunition' to Somalia's semiautonomous region of Puntland. 'Ethiopia must be held accountable for actions threatening to destabilize the Horn of Africa,' Barre warned in his speech to the U.N. General Assembly. As the African Union mission prepares to transform at the end of the year, Egypt has offered to replace Ethiopian troops for the first time. Somalia may also push for the removal of the estimated 10,000 Ethiopian troops stationed in Somalia’s regions along the border, aimed at preventing incursions by Islamist militants. Although he did not name Egypt, Ethiopia’s foreign minister said that other actors’ actions are undermining regional stability. 'The recent maneuvers of actors from the outside of the Horn of Africa region undermine these efforts. Ethiopia will not be deterred from its resolute commitment to combating terrorism,' Atske-Selassie said. 'I am confident that the government of Somalia will reckon and recognize the sacrifice we made to Somalia’s liberation from the grip of terrorist groups.'

Hezbollah deputy Qassim tapped to replace slain Nasrallah	CAIRO — Lebanese media is reporting that Hezbollah has named its deputy leader, Naim Qassim, to succeed Hassan Nasrallah, who was killed after Israeli planes bombed the organization's headquarters in Beirut's southern suburbs Friday. It wan't clear if the interim appointment would be revised, amid reports that another Hezbollah leader, Hashim Safieddine, is seeking the position. Hezbollah officially announced the death of its veteran leader Hassan Nasrallah on Saturday, after initially denying reports that he had been killed Friday in an Israeli attack on the group's bunker in Beirut's southern suburbs. Iran's Revolutionary Guard also told Iranian media that Quds Force Deputy Commander Abbas Niloforoshan was killed alongside Nasrallah and several other top Hezbollah commanders, including the group's rocket expert, Ali Karaki, during the Israeli bomb attack Friday. Iranian media reported that Supreme Leader Ali Khamenei was moved to a more secure location, amid fears that Israel might target him, as well. Israel assassinated Hamas leader Ismail Haniyeh in Tehran in August. More than 200,000 Lebanese reportedly have fled their homes in parts of the country to escape possible Israeli attacks, and many are sleeping in parks and outdoor locations according to Lebanese media. UNHCR head Filippo Grandi wrote in a post on social media platform X that 20,000 Lebanese also have fled to Syria. Lebanese media showed video of the Syrian border post along the highway from Beirut to Damascus overwhelmed by Lebanese and Syrians fleeing Lebanon. Lebanese Health Minister Firaas Abiad told hospitals in Beirut and north of the capital 'not to take unessential cases during the next week' in order to deal with the current wave of casualties from Israeli attacks. Abiad also told Arab media that Lebanon has a four-month supply of medicine and other hospital necessities to deal with the current emergency but that it was requesting aid from other countries to deal with possible shortages. The Lebanese army reportedly has deployed in many parts of the country that have been Hezbollah strongholds in recent years, but it wasn't clear if the government received a green light from the group to do so.	https://www.voanews.com/a/hezbollah-deputy-qassim-tapped-to-replace-slain-nasrallah/7803092.html	2024-09-28T11:02:30-07:00	
9 die in migrant boat shipwreck off Spanish island; 48 missing	Madrid — A boat carrying migrants capsized off Spain's Canary Islands overnight, killing at least nine people and leaving 48 missing, the national maritime rescue service said Saturday. Eighty-four people were on board and 27 were saved after rescuers responded to a distress call received shortly after midnight from off El Hierro, one of the islands in the Atlantic archipelago, a statement said. This follows the death of 39 migrants in early September when their boat sank off Senegal while attempting a similar crossing to the Canaries, from where migrants hope to reach mainland Europe. Thousands of migrants have died in recent years setting off into the Atlantic to reach Europe onboard overcrowded and often dilapidated boats. The latest tragedy 'again underlines the dangerousness of the Atlantic route,' Canaries regional President Fernando Clavijo wrote on X. 'We need Spain and the EU to act decisively in the face of a structural humanitarian tragedy' as lives are lost 'meters from Europe's southern border,' he said. In late August, Spain's Prime Minister Pedro Sanchez visited Mauritania and Gambia to sign cooperation agreements to crack down on people smugglers while expanding pathways for legal immigration. As of August 15, some 22,304 migrants had reached the Canaries since the start of the year, up from 9,864 in the same period the previous year. Almost 40,000 migrants entered the Canaries in 2023, a record on course to be broken this year as easier navigation conditions from September tend to lead to a spike in crossing attempts. The Atlantic route is particularly deadly, with many of the crowded and poorly equipped boats unable to cope with the strong ocean currents. Some boats depart African beaches as far as 1,000 kilometers from the Canaries. The International Organization for Migration, a U.N. agency, estimates that 4,857 people have died on this route since 2014. Many aid organizations say that is a massive undercount, with Caminando Fronteras, a Spanish nongovernmental organization that aids migrants, saying 18,680 have died trying to reach Europe.	https://www.voanews.com/a/die-in-migrant-boat-shipwreck-off-spanish-island-48-missing/7803078.html	2024-09-28T10:34:36-07:00

Thai MP Rome urges reform to fix Myanmar migration crisis, corruption	Bangkok — As Thailand faces a growing influx of refugees from Myanmar following the military coup, MP Rangsiman Rome, chair of the Thai House Committee on National Security and deputy leader of the People’s Party, emphasizes the need for urgent reform. 'The immediate step is to register the people,' Rome tells VOA, citing corruption and the lack of legal recognition that leave many refugees vulnerable. 'By recognizing them, we can give them access to education and work, while ensuring they contribute by paying taxes.' In this exclusive interview with VOA, Rome discusses Thailand’s challenges with migration, corruption and the need for coordinated government action to address the crisis. The following interview has been edited for length and clarity. VOA: What are your criticisms of the government’s handling of this crisis, and what should they do differently? Rangsiman Rome: The civil war in Myanmar is devastating, forcing many to flee into Thailand. Unfortunately, Thailand wasn’t prepared, and refugees now live in the shadows without legal status. We can’t return them due to international and domestic laws, so we’ve been working with [nongovernmental organizations] to provide humanitarian aid, but a long-term solution is necessary. Thailand shares a 2,400-kilometer border with Myanmar, and instability there allows for illegal activities like drug smuggling and human trafficking, affecting Thailand and the region. ASEAN [the Association of Southeast Asian Nations] must pressure the State Administration Council [SAC], Myanmar’s junta, to support peace and democracy in Myanmar. In the short term, Thailand must register the 6 million Myanmar people here, providing them with legal status, work and education. Right now, the government’s policy on this issue remains unclear. VOA: What immediate steps should be taken? Rome: Registering the Myanmar people who are in Thailand would be a good first step. One of the problems that we are facing is corruption. A lot of refugees have to pay the money to the police or other authorities in order to work. If the Thai government would recognize these people living in Thailand, it would make it so they can not only access health care and education, but also they will be able to work and therefore have the responsibility to pay taxes. At the same time, we need to reach out to our friends like Japan, the U.S. and Australia for help with managing this situation, such as humanitarian aid. VOA: A recent Lower House report highlighted legal loopholes contributing to human rights violations. What changes do you propose? Rome: When we register them, we can make sure that our law will protect them. Abuses can happen because we don’t recognize them. So, [if] anything happens to them, they cannot report it; but if they are registered, they can earn, can live like normal people in Thailand. At the same time, if you want to solve this, we have to talk about how it starts. In Myanmar we find out that as many as 2 million refugees are in the IDP [internally displaced people] camps because of the ongoing bombardment by the SAC. If everyone in the international community would come together to pressure the SAC to stop this, maybe a million refugees could return to their homes again. So, we need to not just manage the refugees in Thailand, but we have to deal with the situation in Myanmar. VOA: Ministries have been criticized for working in 'silos.' How do you plan to improve coordination? Rome: As chair of the National Security Committee, I ensure that our recommendations benefit Thailand. We aim to play a larger role in the U.N. Human Rights Council, but we must manage the refugee situation appropriately to maintain our reputation. We are working with the Ministry of Foreign Affairs to ensure Myanmar refugees can live safely in Thailand. Additionally, the SAC has been using Thailand’s banking system to launder money for weapons, and we’ve been pushing the foreign minister to take action on this. VOA: Access to health care, education and basic services for migrants remain major issues. How do you assess the government’s efforts, and what would you do differently? Rome: The policy around education in Thailand is not very clear. For example, there have been cases where the government closed a day care because they were singing a song to the children in Burmese and they found that unacceptable. The problem is that it’s very hard for refugee children to access school in Thailand and not every school has the same policies. The people at the border, they cannot have a Thai education, so the Thai authority is trying to create a separate Burmese program for them, but it doesn’t make sense to me. How can the Thai government make a Burmese program? I think one of the very important things is we need to change this policy. Kids are innocent. They should have access to the Thai education system, and actually, we have space for them. We are an aging society. Schools are actually closing due to a lack of enrollment because of low birth rates. I think Thailand must change, and if I controlled the government, absolutely we would open the education system for Myanmar people to study in Thailand. I believe that if they are better educated, it benefits not only themselves but all of Thailand. VOA: There was a protest in front of the Myanmar Embassy a few days ago where protesters were complaining about the large number of Myanmar refugees in Thailand. What do you think is driving this protest? Rome: Thailand’s struggling economy has led to job losses, and with over 6 million Myanmar refugees here, tensions are rising. Corruption adds to the issue, with refugees forced to pay bribes just to live. Crimes involving Myanmar refugees are often publicized more, worsening relations between Thai and Myanmar people. Registering the refugees would reduce corruption and ensure equal treatment under the law. Right now, Thai law restricts foreigners from working in many sectors, but if managed properly, Myanmar workers could contribute significantly to our economy. They are essential to Thailand and bringing them out of the shadows will help us all. VOA: Given the current situation, what message would you like to share with the Myanmar migrants living in Thailand? Rome: I understand that the people from Myanmar seek peace and safety here, hoping to provide for their families. The crisis in Myanmar forced them to flee and find opportunities elsewhere. As an MP, I want Thailand to uphold human rights, but that’s difficult due to many factors — history, education and the economy. Still, I believe that Myanmar and Thailand, as neighbors, must work together. Real change requires improving the situation in Myanmar. I know the Myanmar people want peace and democracy, and I hope we can achieve that together.	https://www.voanews.com/a/thai-mp-rome-urges-reform-to-fix-myanmar-migration-crisis-corruption/7803047.html	2024-09-28T09:55:10-07:00	
China warns against 'expansion' of Ukraine war	United Nations — China 's Foreign Minister Wang Yi warned Saturday against the expansion of the war in Ukraine, which has accused Beijing of assisting Russia in its war. Kyiv has been particularly scornful of Beijing's calls for talks to resolve the conflict, but Wang reiterated China 's offer to help broker an end to fighting. 'The top priority is to commit to no expansion of the battlefield, no escalation of fighting, and no provocation by any party, and push for de-escalation of the situation as soon as possible,' he told the U.N. General Assembly. 'China is committed to playing a constructive role, engaging in shuttle mediation and promoting talks for peace, not throwing oil on the fire or exploiting the situation for selfish gains.' Wang also called for an immediate cease-fire in the fighting between Israel and Hamas in Gaza, but only noted the resumption of fighting in Lebanon without commenting on the death of Hezbollah leader Hassan Nasrallah, who was killed in an Israeli strike. 'There must not be any delay in reaching a comprehensive cease-fire, and the fundamental way out lies in the two-state solution,' Wang said. 'China has always been a staunch supporter of the just cause of the Palestinian people to regain their legitimate national rights, and a staunch supporter of Palestine's full U.N. membership.'	https://www.voanews.com/a/china-warns-against-expansion-of-ukraine-war/7803015.html	2024-09-28T09:01:21-07:00	
US, Asia-Pacific nations hold joint exercises in South China Sea	MANILA, PHILIPPINES — The armed forces of five countries conducted joint maritime exercises in a portion of the South China Sea on Saturday as China carried out its own military drills in the disputed waterway. The exercises involving the Philippines, United States, Australia, Japan and — for the first time — New Zealand took place in Manila's exclusive economic zone and sought to improve the militaries' interoperability, the Philippine armed forces said in a statement. Saturday's exercises included a Philippine warship, the United States' USS Howard, Japan's JS Sazanami and New Zealand's HMNZS Aotearoa, the statement said. Australia's Department of Defense said the drills demonstrated 'our collective commitment to strengthen regional and international cooperation in support of a peaceful, stable and prosperous Indo-Pacific.' The exercises follow a series of air and sea encounters between the Philippines and China, which have sparred over disputed areas of the South China Sea, including the Scarborough Shoal, one of Asia's most contested features. The shoal has been occupied by China's coast guard for more than a decade. On Wednesday, naval vessels from New Zealand and Australia sailed through the Taiwan Strait, part of the South China Sea. China, which claims democratically governed Taiwan as its own, says it alone exercises sovereignty and jurisdiction over the strait. The U.S. and Taiwan say the strait — a major trade route through which about half of global container ships pass — is an international waterway. Australia has 'consistently pressed China on peace and stability in the South China Sea and Taiwan Strait,' Australian Foreign Minister Penny Wong said in a speech to the U.N. General Assembly on Saturday. 'We have welcomed the resumption of leader- and military-level dialogue between the U.S. and China,' Wong said, according to a transcript. Chinese air and naval forces conducted maneuvers in a disputed area of the sea hours after the country's top diplomat discussed ways of reducing regional tension with his U.S. counterpart. China claims nearly all of the South China Sea, despite overlapping maritime claims by Brunei, Malaysia, the Philippines and Vietnam, angering its neighbors.	https://www.voanews.com/a/us-asia-pacific-nations-hold-joint-exercises-in-south-china-sea/7803002.html	2024-09-28T08:50:50-07:00	
17 people killed in 2 mass shootings in same South African town	JOHANNESBURG — Seventeen people, including 15 women, were killed in two mass shootings that took place near each other in a rural town in South Africa, police said Saturday. A search was under way for the suspects, national police spokesperson Brigadier Athlenda Mathe said in a statement. The victims were 15 women and two men, she said. One other person was in critical condition in the hospital. The shootings took place Friday night in the town of Lusikisiki in Eastern Cape province in southeastern South Africa. Video released by police showed that the shootings occurred at two houses in the same neighborhood, which is a collection of rural homesteads on the outskirts of the town. Twelve women and a man were killed in one house, and three women and a man were killed in the other house, police said. Four women, one man and a 2-month-old baby survived. 'A manhunt has been launched to apprehend those behind these heinous killings,' Mathe said. Local media reported that the people were attending a family gathering at the time of the shooting, but the motive for the killings remains unknown. Police minister Senzo Mchunu told media on Saturday that a team of detectives and forensic experts had been deployed. 'We have full faith and confidence in the team that has been deployed to crack this case and find these criminals. Either they hand themselves over or we will fetch them ourselves,' Mchunu said. South Africa, a country of 62 million, recorded 12,734 homicides in the first six months of this year, according to official crime statistics from the police. That’s an average of more than 70 a day. Firearms are by far the biggest cause of deaths in those cases. Mass shootings have become increasingly common in recent years, sometimes targeting people in their homes. Ten members of the same family, including seven women and a 13-year-old boy, were killed in a mass shooting at their home in the neighboring KwaZulu-Natal province in April 2023. Firearm laws are somewhat strict in South Africa, but authorities have often pointed to the large number of illegal, unregistered guns in circulation as a major problem.	https://www.voanews.com/a/people-killed-in-2-mass-shootings-in-same-south-african-town/7802974.html	2024-09-28T08:17:53-07:00	
Floods, landslides kill at least 38 people in Nepal	KATHMANDU, NEPAL — At least 38 people have been killed in Nepal since early on Friday as persistent downpours triggered more flooding and landslides, closing major roads and disrupting domestic air travel, officials said on Saturday. The death toll could rise, they added, with an additional 29 people reported missing over the last 30 hours. Most of the deaths took place in the Kathmandu valley, which is home to 4 million people and the country's capital, where the flooding brought traffic and normal activity to a standstill. Rescue workers used helicopters and rubber boats to help people stranded on rooftops or elevated ground as some parts of Kathmandu reported up to 322.2 millimeters of rain over the last day. Most rivers in the Himalayan nation have swollen, spilling over roads and bridges, authorities said, after nearly a week's delay in the retreat of South Asia's annual monsoon rains brought torrential downpours across the region. Police were working to clear debris and reopen roads after landslides blocked highways in 28 places, said police spokesperson Dan Bahadur Karki. The earliest let-up in the rains might not come until Sunday, said Binu Maharjan, a weather forecasting official in Kathmandu, who said a low-pressure system over parts of neighboring India had caused this year's extended rains. 'Heavy rains are likely to continue until Sunday morning, and the weather is likely to clear after that,' Maharjan told Reuters. Most central and eastern areas had received moderate to extremely heavy rainfall, ranging from 50 millimeters to more than 200 millimeters, she added, with moderate levels recorded elsewhere. International flights are operating, but many domestic flights have been disrupted, said Rinji Sherpa, a spokesperson for Kathmandu airport. The Koshi River in the southeast, which causes deadly floods in India's eastern neighboring state of Bihar almost every year, was running above the danger level at 450,000 cusecs, versus the normal figure of 150,000 cusecs, one official said. A cusec is a measurement of water flow equivalent to one cubic foot a second. The river level is still rising, added Ram Chandra Tiwari, the area's top bureaucrat. Hundreds of people die in the monsoon season every year in landslides and flash floods common in the mountainous nation. Authorities said at least 254 people have died and 65 gone missing in landslides, floods and lightning strikes since mid-June, when annual monsoon rains started.	https://www.voanews.com/a/floods-landslides-kill-at-least-38-people-in-nepal/7802966.html	2024-09-28T08:10:15-07:00	
Sexual violence used as weapon of war throughout conflict in Sudan	GENEVA — Sudan’s warring parties are using sexual violence as a weapon of war, and 'gender-based violence has increased more than two-fold' since the conflict erupted in April 2023, according to U.N. Women, a United Nations agency that focuses on women’s rights and social progress, in its new report. 'Sexual violence is being used as a weapon of war throughout this conflict,' Hodan Addou, U.N. Women’s regional director for East and Southern Africa, told journalists in Geneva at the launch of the report Friday. 'The ongoing violent conflict has exacerbated the risks faced by women and girls in Sudan, with rising reports of conflict-related sexual violence, sexual exploitation and abuse, particularly in Khartoum, Al Jazeera, Darfur and Kordofan states,' she said, speaking from South Sudan via a video link. Authors of the report have issued what they call a 'Gender Alert' to highlight the catastrophic impacts of Sudan’s conflict on women and girls. They note that nearly 5.8 million internally displaced women are particularly vulnerable, with many cases of sexual violence going unreported 'due to fear of stigma, retribution and the lack of adequate support.' 'It is ... despicable' Addou observed that rape and sexual violence is used as 'a way of breaking communities and tarnishing the social fabric of a community by targeting the most vulnerable.' 'It is a despicable and human rights violation,' she said. 'The impact this conflict has had on the lives of women and children is horrendous. 'Many of them are seeing their loved ones killed in front of their eyes. They have seen brutal sexual violence against children, against women used as a way of putting more trauma, more fear on communities.' The report finds more than 6.7 million people needed services related to gender-based violence by December 2023, underscoring that 'this figure is estimated to be much higher today.' 'While men and boys also are victims of gender-based violence, most of these cases involve women and girls,' it says. The United Nations calls Sudan one of the world’s worst humanitarian crises. Since rival generals of the Sudanese Armed Forces and paramilitary Rapid Support Forces plunged the country into war more than 17 months ago, an estimated 20,000 people have been killed and tens of thousands injured. Some 10.8 million people are displaced inside Sudan and an additional 2 million as refugees in neighboring countries, making Sudan the largest displacement crisis in the world. According to the U.N., Sudan now is also the world’s largest hunger crisis, with nearly 26 million people facing acute hunger. 'Women and girls are eating least and last' Addou said women and children are suffering most from the looming famine gripping the country. 'With 64% of female-headed households experiencing food insecurity compared to 48% of male-headed households in 10 states, women and girls are eating least and last,' she said, adding that they also are disproportionately affected by the lack of safe and easily accessible water, sanitation and hygiene. The World Health Organization reports people lack access to health care services because of insecurity, attacks on medical facilities and a shortage of medicines and medical supplies. The U.N. health agency says critical services, including maternal and child health care, the management of severe acute malnutrition, and the treatment of patients with chronic conditions have been discontinued in many areas because 70% to 80% of hospitals are not functional. 'Across Sudan, women are dying from pregnancy or childbirth-related complications, whether or not those pregnancies are a result of gender-based violence, or whatever,' Dr. Margaret Harris, WHO spokesperson, said. 'Women are not getting the standard care that saves your life and saves the life of your child during childbirth or before childbirth.' She added that childhood vaccinations have been disrupted, as have disease surveillance and vector control, and this 'has created the perfect conditions for the spread of disease outbreaks.' 'Calling for protection' U.N. Women is calling for urgent action to protect women and girls and to provide them with access to food, safe water, and sexual and reproductive health services. 'We are calling for protection for all women and girls, in particular the retributions that they need to address. We are calling for accountability and the provision of justice to all of the victims,' Addou said. 'The high-level sexual violence and exploitation being used as a weapon of war is preventing women from accessing much-needed resources … and the psychosocial support they need because of the chaotic nature of this conflict. 'All those engaged in this violent conflict must be held to account,' she said. 'We cannot let Sudan become a forgotten crisis.'	https://www.voanews.com/a/sexual-violence-used-as-weapon-of-war-throughout-conflict-in-sudan/7802951.html	2024-09-28T08:00:19-07:00	
Ukraine says Russian attacks on medical center in Sumy kill 9	KYIV, Ukraine — Russian forces hit a medical center in Sumy in northeastern Ukraine on Saturday morning, then struck again as the building was being evacuated, killing a total of nine people, Ukrainian officials said. Ukrainian prosecutors said that at the time of the attacks, 86 patients and 38 staff members were in the hospital. 'The first attack killed one person and damaged the ceilings of several floors of the hospital,' Interior Minister Ihor Klymenko said on Telegram. As people were being evacuated, the Russians struck again, killing five more people, he said. Ukrainian emergencies service later said nine people were killed and 10 wounded in all. 'Everyone in the world who talks about this war should pay attention to where Russia is hitting. They are fighting hospitals, civilian objects, and people's lives,' Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy said on Telegram. 'Only force can force Russia to peace. Peace through force is the only right way.' Klymenko did not specify what weapons were used in Saturday's attacks, but the regional administration and air forces said the strike was carried out by drones. Attacks on Sumy city and the Sumy region have become much more frequent since Ukrainian forces launched an operation in Russia's Kursk region in August and captured dozens of settlements. Sumy city is located just 32 kilometers from the Russian border. Russian forces, which began a full-scale invasion of Ukraine in February 2022, have been attacking the region and the city with drones and guided bombs. Ukrainian air forces earlier on Saturday said they shot down 69 of 73 drones during an overnight Russian attack that included two ballistic and two cruise missiles. About 15 Russian attack drones were destroyed by air defenses in the capital, Kyiv, and on its outskirts, the military administration there said.	https://www.voanews.com/a/ukraine-says-russian-attacks-on-medical-center-in-sumy-kill-9/7802942.html	2024-09-28T07:40:40-07:00	
Dozens dead, millions without power after Helene's march across southeastern US	PERRY, Florida — Hurricane Helene caused dozens of deaths and billions of dollars of destruction across a wide swath of the southeastern United States, and more than 3 million customers went into the weekend without power and, for some, a continued threat of floods. Helene blew ashore in Florida's Big Bend region as a Category 4 hurricane late Thursday packing winds of 225 kilometers per hour and then quickly moved through Georgia, the Carolinas and Tennessee. The storm uprooted trees, splintered homes and sent creeks and rivers over their banks and straining dams. Western North Carolina was essentially cut off because of landslides and flooding that forced the closure of Interstate 40 and other roads. There were hundreds of water rescues, none more dramatic than in rural Unicoi County in eastern Tennessee, where dozens of patients and staff were plucked by helicopter from the roof of a hospital that was surrounded by water from a flooded river. The storm, now a post-tropical cyclone, was expected to hover over the Tennessee Valley on Saturday and Sunday, the National Hurricane Center said. Several flood and flash flood warnings remained in effect in parts of the southern and central Appalachian Mountains, while high wind warnings also covered parts of Tennessee and Ohio. Among the at least 44 people killed in the storm were three firefighters, a woman and her 1-month-old twins, and an 89-year-old woman whose house was struck by a falling tree. According to an Associated Press tally, the deaths occurred in Florida, Georgia, North Carolina, South Carolina and Virginia. When the water hit knee-level in Kera O’Neil’s home in Hudson, Florida, she knew it was time to escape. 'There’s a moment where you are thinking, ‘If this water rises above the level of the stove, we are not going to have much room to breathe,’' she said, recalling how she and her sister waded through chest-deep water with one cat in a plastic carrier and another in a cardboard box. Evacuations and record rainfall In North Carolina, a lake featured in the movie 'Dirty Dancing' overtopped a dam and surrounding neighborhoods were evacuated, although there were no immediate concerns it would fail. People also were evacuated from Newport, Tennessee, a town of about 7,000 people, amid concerns about a dam near there, although officials later said the structure had not failed. Tornadoes hit some areas, including one in Nash County, North Carolina, that critically injured four people. Atlanta received a record 28.24 centimeters of rain in 48 hours, the most the city has seen in a two-day period since recordkeeping began in 1878, Georgia’s Office of the State Climatologist said on the social platform X. Some neighborhoods were so badly flooded that only car roofs could be seen poking above the water. Moody’s Analytics said it expects $15 billion to $26 billion in property damage. Climate change has exacerbated conditions that allow such storms to thrive, rapidly intensifying in warming waters and turning into powerful cyclones sometimes in a matter of hours. Big Bend region hit hard Florida's Big Bend is a part of the state where salt marshes and pine flatwoods stretch into the horizon, and where the condo developments and strip malls that have carved up so much of the state's coastlines elsewhere are largely absent. It’s a place where Susan Sauls Hartway and her 4-year-old Chihuahua mix, Lucy, could afford to live within walking distance of the beach on her salary as a housekeeper. At least, until her house was carried away by Helene. Friday afternoon, Hartway wandered around her street near Ezell Beach, searching for where the storm may have deposited her home. 'It’s gone. I don’t know where it’s at. I can’t find it,' she said of her house. Born and raised in rural Taylor County, Hartway said there is nowhere in the world she would rather be, even after Helene. But she’s watched as wealthier residents from out of state have bought up second homes here. She wonders how many of them will sell out — and what will happen to the locals who have nowhere else to go. 'There’s so many people down here ... this was all they had,' she said. The community has taken direct hits from three hurricanes since August 2023. All five who died in one Florida county were in neighborhoods where residents were told to evacuate, said Bob Gualtieri, the sheriff in Pinellas County in the St. Petersburg area. Some who stayed ended up having to retreat to their attics to escape the rising water. He said the death toll could rise as crews go door-to-door in flooded areas. More deaths were reported in Georgia and the Carolinas, including two South Carolina firefighters and a Georgia firefighter who died when trees struck their trucks. Virginia Governor Glenn Youngkin reported at least one death in his state. Power loss and infrastructure damage President Joe Biden said he was praying for survivors, and the head of the Federal Emergency Management Agency headed to the area. The agency deployed more than 1,500 workers, and they helped with 400 rescues by late Friday morning. Officials urged people who were trapped to call for rescuers and not tread floodwaters, warning they can be dangerous due to live wires, sewage, sharp objects and other debris. In Georgia, an electrical utility group warned of 'catastrophic' damage to utility infrastructure, with more than 100 high-voltage transmission lines damaged. And officials in South Carolina, where more than 40% of customers were without power, said crews had to cut their way through debris just to determine what was still standing in some places. The hurricane came ashore near the mouth of the Aucilla River, about 30 kilometers northwest of where Hurricane Idalia hit last year at nearly the same ferocity. Florida Governor Ron DeSantis said the damage from Helene appears to be greater than the combined effects of Idalia and Hurricane Debby in August. The destruction extended far beyond Florida. Historic flooding expected A mudslide in the Appalachian Mountains washed out part of an interstate highway at the North Carolina-Tennessee state line. Another slide hit homes in North Carolina, and occupants had to wait more than four hours to be rescued, said Ryan Cole, the emergency services assistant director in Buncombe County. His 911 center received more than 3,300 calls in eight hours Friday. 'This is something that we’re going to be dealing with for many days and weeks to come,' Cole said. Forecasters warned of flooding in North Carolina that could be worse than anything seen in the past century. The Connecticut Army National Guard sent a helicopter to help. Helene was the eighth named storm of the Atlantic hurricane season, which began June 1. The National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration has predicted an above-average season this year because of record-warm ocean temperatures.	https://www.voanews.com/a/dozens-dead-millions-without-power-after-helene-s-march-across-southeastern-us/7802925.html	2024-09-28T07:21:51-07:00	
Kazakh journalists worry as new media rules come into force	ALMATY, KAZAKHSTAN — Media watchdogs and journalists in Kazakhstan have raised fears that new regulations governing reporters, adopted outside a new media law, leave room for authorities to obstruct access to information and limit journalists’ ability to work. President Kassym-Jomart Tokayev signed the media law in June, expanding the definition of media subject to the law to include 'internet resources' without specifying what that means. Many journalists distribute information on such channels as Telegram, YouTube and Facebook, which are separate from their accredited outlets. The law allows the Culture and Information Ministry, which oversees media, to set the rules for accrediting journalists. The regulations, which came into force last month, limit journalists to publishing information in outlets to which they are accredited, preventing them from publishing it in other outlets, and require them to comply with new and unspecified 'rules and regulations established by accrediting organization.' Two violations of the rules can lead to suspension of accreditation for six months. 'Any document adopted by a government body, including the Ministry of Culture and Information, undergoes legal expert examination. This means all provisions, all points, comply with the constitution and don’t contradict laws,' Culture and Information Minister Aida Balayeva told journalists this month after they raised concerns over the legality of the new regulations. 'When we see that we drift away from the topic of a press briefing and, in fact, our briefings and news conferences shift to some other planes … when there is improper behavior by journalists — here we need regulation,' she said. Astana-based freelance journalist Tamara Vaal, who writes for the country’s leading vlast.kz news site and other outlets, said in a Facebook post that the rules 'are a violation of the constitution, direct censorship and a ban on the trade of journalist.' In addition, she said, what the ministry is doing 'is nothing but ultimately killing the profession' — journalists in Kazakhstan frequently must supplement their regular income with work for outlets other than the news organizations to which they are accredited. 'Not only do these rules ban us from raising additional income, but also they deprive us of our job because just two violations of rules and regulations and you lose your accreditation for six months,' Vaal told VOA. Vaal said in her post that journalists write for several outlets because 'they want to have children, save up for home and live a life at the end of the day, but this is not possible, unfortunately, on just one wage.' Vaal and others VOA spoke to cite the constitutional provisions banning censorship and ensuring citizens’ rights to access information and to work. Ainur Koskina, another Astana freelance journalist, said she believes the requirement that journalists write for only their accredited outlets would hurt journalists working outside the current and former capitals of Astana and Almaty. 'They write for several outlets, and thanks to this, they can ensure a decent existence for themselves. This opportunity has now been taken away from them. I am afraid local journalism will go extinct, first of all, because of these accreditation rules,' Koskina told VOA. In a statement issued in July when the rules were put up for public discussion, the Almaty-based Adil Soz International Foundation for Freedom of Speech Protection said the new accreditation rules implied that information received from government bodies was not the public domain and was protected by copyright, so it should not be distributed to third parties. 'Adil Soz believes that the rules regulating the work of journalists and media should facilitate access to information, not complicate it,' the statement said. Karlygash Jamankulova, the head of Adil Soz, told VOA that media outlets and journalists — as employers and employees, respectively — could regulate their labor relations themselves and decide whether journalists could work for other outlets. She suggested that while the new rules were vague, it remains to be seen how they would be implemented and how they would affect journalists. 'This kind of issue cannot be disputed by public organizations,' she said. 'It should be journalists themselves who can take it to court, and if we will have this kind of journalist in Kazakhstan, we are ready to stand by [that journalist] and provide all required legal support.' The head of the Media Qoldau, or Support, legal service, Gulmira Birzhanova, cited what she believes is a recent tendency toward tightening media legislation in Kazakhstan. 'Accrediting organizations, which are state-owned companies along with government bodies, will establish their own rules and regulations, and I am afraid this could be used against journalists in the future,' Birzhanova told VOA. Vaal concluded: 'This is a very bad trend, and I don’t know what future holds for Kazakh journalists.'	https://www.voanews.com/a/kazakh-journalists-worry-as-new-media-rules-come-into-force/7802843.html	2024-09-28T05:43:04-07:00	
Nasrallah, who Israel says it has killed, led Hezbollah to become regional force	BEIRUT — Lebanon's Sayyed Hassan Nasrallah, who Israel said on Saturday it has killed, has led Hezbollah through decades of conflict with Israel, overseeing its transformation into a military force with regional sway and becoming one of the most prominent Arab figures in generations — with Iranian backing. The Iran-backed Hezbollah has yet to issue any statement on the status of Nasrallah, who has led the group for 32 years. The Israeli military said it killed Nasrallah in an airstrike on the group's central headquarters in the southern suburbs of Beirut a day earlier. The Israeli military 'eliminated ... Hassan Nasrallah, leader of the Hezbollah terrorist organization,' Israeli army spokesperson Avichay Adraee wrote in a statement on X. If the Israeli claim of his death is confirmed by Hezbollah, Nasrallah will be remembered among his supporters for standing up to Israel and defying the United States. To enemies, he has been the head of a terrorist organization and a proxy for Iran's Shi'ite Islamist theocracy in its tussle for influence in the Middle East. His regional influence has been on display over nearly a year of conflict ignited by the Gaza war, as Hezbollah entered the fray by firing on Israel from southern Lebanon in support of its Palestinian ally Hamas. Yemeni and Iraqi groups followed suit, operating under the umbrella of 'The Axis of Resistance.' 'We are facing a great battle,' Nasrallah said in an August 1 speech at the funeral of Hezbollah's top military commander, Fuad Shukr, who was killed in an Israeli strike on the Hezbollah-controlled southern suburbs of Beirut. Yet when thousands of Hezbollah members were injured and dozens killed as their communications devices exploded in an apparent Israeli attack last week, that battle began to turn against his group. Responding to the attacks on Hezbollah's communications network in a September 19 speech, Nasrallah vowed to punish Israel. 'This is a reckoning that will come, its nature, its size, how and where? This is certainly what we will keep to ourselves and in the narrowest circle even within ourselves,' he said. He has not given a broadcast address since then. Israel has meanwhile dramatically escalated its attacks, killing several senior Hezbollah commanders in targeted strikes and unleashing a massive bombardment in Hezbollah-controlled areas of Lebanon, which has killed hundreds of people. Recognized even by his enemies as a skilled orator, Nasrallah's speeches are followed by friend and foe alike. Wearing the black turban of a sayyed, or a descendent of the Prophet Mohammad, Nasrallah uses his addresses to rally Hezbollah's base but also to deliver carefully calibrated threats, often wagging his finger as he does so. He became secretary general of Hezbollah in 1992 at age 35, the public face of a once shadowy group founded by Iran's Revolutionary Guards in 1982 to fight Israeli occupation forces. Israel killed his predecessor, Sayyed Abbas al-Musawi, in a helicopter attack. Nasrallah led Hezbollah when its guerrillas finally drove Israeli forces from southern Lebanon in 2000, ending an 18-year occupation. 'Divine victory' Conflict with Israel has largely defined his leadership. He declared 'divine victory' in 2006 after Hezbollah waged 34 days of war with Israel, winning the respect of many ordinary Arabs who had grown up watching Israel defeat their armies. But he became an increasingly divisive figure in Lebanon and the wider Arab world as Hezbollah's area of operations widened to Syria and beyond, reflecting an intensifying conflict between Shi'ite Iran and U.S.-allied Sunni Arab monarchies in the Gulf. While Nasrallah painted Hezbollah's engagement in Syria — where it fought in support of President Bashar al-Assad during the civil war — as a campaign against jihadists, critics accused the group of becoming part of a regional sectarian conflict. At home, Nasrallah's critics said Hezbollah's regional adventurism imposed an unbearable price on Lebanon, leading once friendly Gulf Arabs to shun the country — a factor that contributed to its 2019 financial collapse. In the years following the 2006 war, Nasrallah walked a tightrope over a new conflict with Israel, hoarding Iranian rockets in a carefully measured contest of threat and counterthreat. The Gaza war, ignited by the October 7 Hamas attack on Israel, prompted Hezbollah's worst conflict with Israel since 2006, costing the group hundreds of its fighters, including top commanders. After years of entanglements elsewhere, the conflict put renewed focus on Hezbollah's historic struggle with Israel. 'We are here paying the price for our front of support for Gaza, and for the Palestinian people, and our adoption of the Palestinian cause,' Nasrallah said in the August 1 speech. Nasrallah grew up in Beirut's impoverished Karantina district. His family hails from Bazouriyeh, a village in the Lebanon's predominantly Shi'ite south, which today forms Hezbollah's political heartland. He was part of a generation of young Lebanese Shi'ites whose political outlook was shaped by Iran's 1979 Islamic Revolution. Before leading the group, he used to spend nights with frontline guerrillas fighting Israel's occupying army. His teenage son, Hadi, died in battle in 1997, a loss that gave him legitimacy among his core Shi'ite constituency in Lebanon. Powerful enemies He has had a track record of threatening powerful enemies. As regional tensions escalated after the eruption of the Gaza war, Nasrallah issued a thinly veiled warning to U.S. warships in the Mediterranean, telling them: 'We have prepared for the fleets with which you threaten us.' In 2020, Nasrallah vowed that U.S. soldiers would leave the region in coffins after a U.S. drone strike in Iraq killed Iranian General Qassem Soleimani. He expressed fierce opposition to Saudi Arabia over its armed intervention in Yemen, where, with U.S. and other allied support, Riyadh sought to roll back the Iran-aligned Houthis. As regional tensions rose in 2019 following an attack on Saudi oil facilities, he said Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates should halt the Yemen war to protect themselves. 'Don’t bet on a war against Iran because they will destroy you,' he said in a message directed at Riyadh. On Nasrallah's watch, Hezbollah has also clashed with adversaries at home in Lebanon. In 2008, he accused the Lebanese government — backed at the time by the West and Saudi Arabia — of declaring war by moving to ban his group's internal communication network. Nasrallah vowed to 'cut off the hand' that tried to dismantle it. It prompted four days of civil war pitting Hezbollah against Sunni and Druze fighters.

China calls for stable Japan relations after Ishiba election victory	TAIPEI, TAIWAN — China has urged Japan to maintain a 'healthy and stable' relationship with Beijing after former Japanese Defense Minister Shigeru Ishiba won the ruling Liberal Democratic Party's leadership race Friday. Ishiba is set to become Japan’s next prime minister when Japanese lawmakers convene on October 1. Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesperson Lin Jian told reporters Friday that the 'sustained, sound and steady' development of China-Japan relations is in both countries’ interests, characterizing the path as 'the only right choice.' China, he said, hopes Japan will 'have an objective and right perception of China, take an active and rational China policy, take concrete efforts to comprehensively advance the strategic relationship of mutual benefit, and work with China to promote the sustained, sound and steady development' of bilateral relations. Beijing’s remarks come amid rising tension between China and Japan. China has increased the frequency of its military activities in waters and airspace near Japan in recent weeks, sailing its aircraft carrier Liaoning through the 'contiguous zone' near Japan’s westernmost island of Yonaguni on September 18 and conducting large-scale military exercises near the Sea of Japan. Meanwhile, a Japanese battleship sailed through the Taiwan Strait for the first time Wednesday, prompting Beijing to reiterate its strong opposition to such 'freedom of navigation' operations. Japan also expressed concern after China test-fired an intercontinental ballistic missile into the Pacific Ocean for the first time in 40 years Wednesday. The Japanese government said Beijing did not notify it before the missile test and described China’s increasing military activity in the region as 'a serious concern.' Analysts say the Chinese Foreign Ministry statement shows Beijing remains cautious about Ishiba’s stance on relations with China. 'Beijing is very cautious and concerned about Ishiba’s stance because he has been very assertive and hardline about Japan’s security policy,' Kyoko Hatakeyama, an international relations professor at the University of Niigata Prefecture, said in a phone interview with VOA. Before Friday’s leadership election, Ishiba proposed the creation of an 'Asian NATO,' which he said could pave the way for a nuclear-sharing arrangement among like-minded countries or a return of U.S. nuclear tactical weapons to the Indo-Pacific region. During a live debate held by Japan’s Fuji News Network on September 22, Ishiba said it is time to allow Japan’s Self-Defense Forces to fire warning shots at foreign forces intruding Japan’s territorial airspaces and waters. Hatakeyama said Ishiba would likely continue to deepen Japan’s defense and security relationship with like-minded democracies, including the United States, South Korea, Australia, and the Philippines. Unlike outgoing Japanese Prime Minister Fumio Kishida, she said, Ishiba wants Japan to have more autonomy in shaping its security policies. 'He thinks it’s not good for Japan to follow Washington’s lead and he believes Japan should become more independent in working with other like-minded countries in the region,' Hatakeyama told VOA by phone. Some Chinese analysts say Beijing should keep an eye on Ishiba’s policies toward China, based on his previous remarks and proposals. 'China needs to stay alert to Ishiba as he reportedly had called for creation of an 'Asian NATO' by combining the U.S.-Japan alliance and U.S.-South Korea alliance,' Da Zhigang, director of the Institute of Northeast Asian Studies at China’s Heilongjiang Provincial Academy of Social Sciences, told China’s state-run tabloid Global Times. Xiang Haoyu, a research fellow at the China Institute of International Studies, told Global Times he expects Japan to keep using 'the Taiwan question' and its alignment with the U.S. to 'contain China.' While Ishiba will likely uphold Japan’s current defense and security policies, some experts say he may also seek to adjust Tokyo’s overall policies toward China. 'In his recently released book, Ishiba said some members of the Japanese government play up the idea of the China threat and the need for more military without really explaining them to the Japanese people,' Jeffrey Hall, an expert on Japan studies at Kanda University of International Studies. He said while Ishiba has highlighted the need for Japan to maintain deterrence against China, the incoming Japanese prime minister will try to put less emphasis on threats by China to help Japan avoid 'a security dilemma.' 'He has many big ideas about it, but in the next year, he will continue foreign policy as it was under Kishida,' Hall told VOA in a video interview. While Ishiba may seek to adjust Japan’s policies toward China, Hall said he will also continue Tokyo’s approach of maintaining close relations with Taiwan, as it did under Kishida and deceased former prime minister Shinzo Abe. 'Ishiba’s visit to Taiwan in August was strategically timed because he wanted to show conservatives in Japan that he would stand with Taiwan if he becomes prime minister,' he told VOA, adding that Ishiba will not sacrifice commitment to Taiwan for the sake of friendlier relations with China. Despite the heightened tension between Japan and China, caused mainly by Beijing’s military actions and the death of a 10-year-old Japanese boy in the Chinese city of Shenzhen, Hatakeyama said Tokyo and Beijing will both try to play a balancing act in managing bilateral relations in the near future. 'China has recently agreed to gradually resume imports of Japanese seafood and Japan’s Cabinet Office didn’t declare the Japanese warship’s passage through the Taiwan Strait, which signals that Tokyo and Beijing both want to prevent bilateral tensions from further escalating,' she told VOA.	https://www.voanews.com/a/china-calls-for-stable-japan-relations-after-ishiba-election-victory/7802773.html	2024-09-28T02:43:15-07:00	
Landslide leaves 12 dead, 2 missing at illegal gold mine in Indonesia	SUNGAI ABU, Indonesia — Mud, rugged terrain and lack of telecommunications hampered rescue efforts Saturday after a landslide set off by torrential rains smashed down into an unauthorized gold mining operation on Indonesia's Sumatra Island, killing at least 12 people. Villagers had been digging for grains of gold in the remote village in the Solok district of West Sumatra province when mud plunged down the surrounding hills and buried them on Thursday. Several people managed to escape and some were pulled out by rescuers, said local search and rescue agency chief Abdul Malik. Eleven people were injured. Malik said rescuers recovered 12 bodies, revising an earlier death toll of 15 after officials discovered that lack of communications and the remoteness of the village had affected the counting of the victims. Two other people are believed still missing under tons of mud, he said. Rescuers earlier said the devastated area could only be reached by walking for four hours from the nearest settlement. 'Relief efforts for the dead and missing were hampered by rugged terrain and blocked roads covered by thick mud and debris,' Malik said, adding that many residents also did not want outsiders, including search and rescue officers, to enter their traditional mining areas. Informal mining operations are common in Indonesia, providing a tenuous livelihood to thousands who labor in conditions with a high risk of serious injury or death. Landslides, flooding and collapses of tunnels are just some of the hazards facing miners. Much of gold ore processing involves highly toxic mercury and cyanide and workers frequently use little or no protection. The country's last major mining-related accident occurred in July when a landslide crashed onto an illegal traditional gold mine in Gorontalo province on Sulawesi island, killing at least 23 people. In April 2022 a landslide hit another gold mine in North Sumatra's Mandailing Natal district, killing 12 women. In February 2019, a makeshift wooden structure in an illegal gold mine in North Sulawesi province collapsed partly due to shifting soil. More than 40 people were buried.	https://www.voanews.com/a/landslide-leaves-12-dead-2-missing-at-illegal-gold-mine-in-indonesia-/7802754.html	2024-09-28T01:04:14-07:00	
Case of Mexico's 43 missing students persists 10 years later	MEXICO CITY — All countries have crimes that resonate. In Mexico, one of the modern day ones is the disappearance of 43 students from a rural teachers college in 2014. Ten years later, it's still not clear where the students from the Rural Normal School at Ayotzinapa are. Authorities believe they were killed but have only turned up small bone fragments from three of them. The families, with the support of the school known for its radical activism, continue to demand justice. They maintain a lack of political will is responsible for not finding the truth. If it was a 'state crime' as the current administration says, the government must know what happened and who is hiding information. The families marked the painful anniversary Thursday, disillusioned after what they say was a decade of unfulfilled government promises. Thousands marched with the families in the rain through Mexico's capital, demanding the truth about what happened and justice for the missing. 'The first time we came through here, who could have imagined that all of this time would pass and (we're) here again without answers,' said Margarito Guerrero, the father of missing student Jhosivani Guerrero de la Cruz. Why is the case still alive? In a country with more than 115,000 registered disappearances, this case continues to hold the public's attention because it combined cartel violence and corrupt authorities and remains stubbornly unresolved. It's considered an emblematic case and another example of abuses that occurred decades ago in Mexico's dirty war and were never corrected. What happened on September 26? The students were attacked by security forces linked to a local drug gang, Guerreros Unidos, in Iguala, when the students were stealing buses to transport themselves to a protest. During the administration of Enrique Peña Nieto (2012-18), authorities said the students had gone to Iguala, Guerrero to protest at an event — the mayor, now jailed, was linked to local gang Guerreros Unidos. They were allegedly mistaken for members of a rival gang. The Peña Nieto administration said that Guerreros Unidos had abducted and killed the students, burned their bodies in a huge fire and tossed their ashes into a river. But investigations by the Inter-American Commission on Human Rights, the successor Attorney General's Office and a Truth Commission created in 2019, found that the fire at a dump was a lie built on false statements extracted under torture and manipulated evidence. Those subsequent investigations found that an enormous operation was put in motion that night involving members of Guerreros Unidos, but also local, state and federal police. And the army was aware of everything that was happening because it had a base in Iguala, soldiers in the streets and spies among the students. Investigators said members of the army were involved with the gang in smuggling heroin from the mountains of Guerrero on buses to the United States. Prosecutors said the decision to hide the truth was taken at the highest levels of government. Has anyone been held accountable? There are more than 100 people in custody and dozens have been charged, but no one has been convicted. At the end of the previous administration, Mexican courts determined that the investigation was plagued by errors and manipulation. There were dozens of cases of torture. Those abuses and missteps led to many of those involved being released. Some have been arrested again under the current administration. The highest-ranking person charged is former Attorney General Jesús Murillo Karam, who is accused of torture, forced disappearance and obstruction of justice. There are also 16 soldiers, most of whom are awaiting trial on house arrest, which infuriates the students' families. When did attitudes shift on the current administration? López Obrador had promised to find the students and hold those responsible accountable. But in 2022, when more and more evidence pointed toward the military's involvement in the attack and cover-up the administration's tone changed. The president had ordered the military to open its archives to investigators. That didn't happen. Instead, López Obrador shifted more power and responsibility to the military than any president in recent history. The prosecutor leading the investigation, Omar García Trejo, was suddenly demoted after he sought arrest orders for two dozen soldiers. He was replaced by someone unfamiliar with the case. There was also growing political pressure to show results, said Santiago Aguirre, one of the families' lawyers. The administration presented some evidence that did not appear to come from reliable sources and the government's searches turned slipshod. Where do the families want the investigation to go? Their lawyers point out key arrests are still lacking, among them the man who led the investigation during the Peña Nieto administration, Tomás Zerón. In videos, Zerón is seen interrogating and threatening prisoners. He sought refuge in Israel, which has not agreed to extradite him despite Mexico's request. They also say they want to see military intelligence records from that night that they still haven't had access to. They want too more cooperation from the United States government, which has prosecuted members of Guerreros Unidos in drug trafficking cases that also revealed their ties to the military.	https://www.voanews.com/a/case-of-mexico-s-43-missing-students-persists-10-years-later/7799872.html	2024-09-28T00:05:26-07:00	
Glock pistols popular among US criminals because they're easily modified, report says	BALTIMORE — Glock pistols are a popular choice for people committing gun crimes, in part because they can be easily converted into fully automatic weapons using a small device, according to a new report based on data from nearly three dozen U.S. cities. Often called Glock switches or auto sears, the devices have received heightened attention in recent years because they're increasingly turning up at crime scenes. They effectively turn semiautomatic weapons, which fire one bullet per trigger pull, into machine guns that can spray continuous gunfire. Authorities believe the shooters who killed four people and injured 17 others in Birmingham, Alabama, last weekend were using conversion devices to make their guns more powerful. About 100 shell casings were recovered from the scene. A report by the anti-violence organization Everytown for Gun Safety says criminals often choose Glocks because they're relatively cheap and easy to operate and modify. But the brand is perhaps best known for its popularity among law enforcement officers, who almost exclusively carry Glock handguns. The report was released this week ahead of a conference Thursday in Baltimore hosted by Mayors Against Illegal Guns, a group that falls under Everytown's umbrella. The organization called on Glock and other weapons manufacturers to take responsibility for their products and do more to prevent violence. 'We have to build that level of accountability for them as well,' Baltimore Mayor Brandon Scott said in an interview. 'At some point, as a country, the sanctity of the lives of Americans has to begin to outweigh the sanctity of American guns.' A spokesperson for Glock didn't respond to an email seeking comment. Scott and other mayors said while local elected officials are often at the forefront of pushing for better gun policies, Congress must also step up and address the issue. Researchers found that four gun manufacturers accounted for more than 40% of the recovered guns they studied, with Glock alone accounting for 18%. The team compiled data from 34 U.S. cities about guns recovered from crime scenes in 2023. 'They're basically profiting off of pain,' said John Feinblatt, president of Everytown. 'They're prioritizing profits over safety.' Meanwhile, the prevalence of machine gun conversion devices has increased dramatically — 570% between 2017 and 2021, according to the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives. The devices are banned under federal law. Most are small pieces of metal or plastic made with a 3D printer or ordered online. The report also found that recoveries of Polymer80 ghost guns — untraceable, unassembled firearms that can be purchased online — increased nearly 1,200% across 28 cities over the past five years. Those numbers have started trending downward following the implementation of a new federal rule and a wave of state legislation banning the weapons, according to the report. Polymer80, once a leading manufacturer of ghost guns in the U.S., also shut down operations last month after a deluge of lawsuits. The city of Baltimore was among those who filed suit. City officials announced a settlement agreement in February after the Nevada-based company agreed to stop selling its products to Maryland residents. The city's lawsuit accused Polymer80 of intentionally undermining federal and state firearms laws by designing, manufacturing and providing gun assembly kits without serial numbers to buyers who don't undergo background checks. It was filed the same day Maryland's statewide ban on ghost guns went into effect in 2022 following a law change that expanded the definition of a firearm to include 'an unfinished frame or receiver.' A year later, recoveries of ghost guns in Baltimore had dropped 25%, according to the report. Gun violence has also decreased significantly in the city over roughly the past two years, a positive trend that experts and officials attribute to a wide range of factors, including expanded anti-violence programs and ongoing police reform. Violence is trending downward nationally as well following a sharp spike during the COVID-19 pandemic. The report suggests several actions that manufacturers could take to keep their firearms out of the hands of criminals, including through increased oversight of the gun dealers they work with. Manufacturers could also focus on producing safer weapons that aren't easily modified and fund advertising campaigns to increase public awareness of gun safety. 'I think common sense can get through to people. I think wanting to save the lives of our children can get through to people,' said Kansas City Mayor Quinton Lucas. 'Manufacturers could do things tomorrow that would make guns safer and save lives.'	https://www.voanews.com/a/glock-pistols-popular-among-us-criminals-because-they-re-easily-modified-report-says-/7802670.html	2024-09-28T00:04:43-07:00	
Probe finds Beijing seeking to mislead, sow distrust ahead of US election	washington — U.S. intelligence agencies this week emphasized that Russia, Iran and China remain the primary external forces attempting to influence American voters ahead of the November presidential election. The Office of the Director of National Intelligence reported that the Kremlin is the most active player, using artificial intelligence, fake accounts and fabricated images to promote narratives favorable to Donald Trump’s candidacy. In contrast, China has not sought to directly influence the outcome of the 2024 presidential race. Sarah Cook, an independent analyst specializing in disinformation, noted that this restraint stems partly from a strong bipartisan consensus in Washington regarding the threat posed by China's authoritarian government. With less than 40 days remaining until the U.S. elections, what narratives is China promoting on social media, and how might these affect American voters? Amplifying polarization A joint investigation by Voice of America and the Doublethink Lab, a Taiwanese social media analytics firm, is tracking 201 China-related accounts on the social media platform X. One of the main themes of these accounts is amplifying controversial domestic issues in the United States, aiming to deepen societal polarization and sow distrust. Through both genuine and AI-generated images and videos, Chinese operatives are intensifying divisive social issues, including LGBTQ+ rights, abortion, immigration, race, gun control and crime rates. One prominent account, CongCong, frequently originates posts that are then shared by others, describing herself as 'a sweet and salty little girl who takes life seriously and shares positive energy.' However, her posts are far from positive. One pinned post features a provocative image of a gun pointed at Gaza, captioned with claims of genocide, depicting Israel as the gunman, the U.S. as the weapon, and the EU as the silencer. The post was amplified by 40 accounts in the network of China-related accounts VOA is tracking. Another so-called seeder account, Little Sister Muxi, shared a comparative graphic highlighting the burdens faced by Americans, such as student loans and health care costs, versus the benefits enjoyed by Israelis. The Israel-Gaza conflict has become a sharply polarizing issue in the U.S. Some Americans support Israel's right to self-defense, while others express strong discontent with what they see as excessive violence. Recently, the network has sought to amplify discussions surrounding Intel's announcement of a 15% workforce reduction, with seeder account CongCong asserting, 'This is the decline of the United States, a recession created by the United States itself.' This message was shared by 36 accounts. Other examples include sharing cartoons from China’s state-owned Global Times that mock the U.S. for its financial support of Ukraine. AI-generated images depict homeless Americans, implying that U.S. citizens are neglected while the government spends billions on overseas conflicts. Fake videos illustrating America's drug epidemic are also common, pushed by the Spamouflage network — a much larger state-sponsored operation aimed at supporting the Chinese government while undermining critics. This approach mirrors Russia's tactics during the 2016 U.S. elections, employing information warfare to fracture Western alliances and deepen societal divisions. MAGAflage Our investigation has uncovered two 'MAGAflage' networks consisting of a total of 25 accounts posing as supporters of Republican candidate Trump, seeking to engage with real American voters. One network, labeled MAGAflage 1 and consisting of 10 accounts, began sharing pro-Trump content extensively following a July 13 assassination attempt. Using stolen bios and sourced photos, these accounts focused on pro-China content and polarizing U.S. issues while promoting Trump as the savior of America. After VOA’s report, X suspended these accounts for 'violating X’s rules.' Whereas the seeder account in the MAGAflage 1 network aggressively posted pro-China content and frequently cited state media outlets, the seeder of MAGAflage 2 takes a more careful approach. Apart from a few exceptions, this person rarely posts about topics directly related to China and stays closer to U.S. election topics. All accounts use emoticons in their usernames. Twelve of the 15 accounts use the American flag as one of the emoticons. They criticize the Biden administration’s immigration policy, promote conspiracy theories and claim that former House Speaker Nancy Pelosi is responsible for the January 6 Capitol riot. 'These accounts are noteworthy because they go to a great extent to pretend to be American citizens and tried to hide their connection to China,' Jasper Hewitt, a digital intelligence analyst at Doublethink Lab, told VOA Mandarin. Notably, these accounts do not promote anti-Israel content that other trolls frequently share. Trump recently touted himself as Israel’s 'protector,' warning Jewish voters against supporting Vice President Kamala Harris. 'I think this shows that the people behind these operations have a good understanding of the type of content that might resonate with the users they are trying to interact with,' Hewitt added. Meanwhile, researchers continue to uncover accounts attacking candidates from both parties. Microsoft recently reported a Chinese-linked threat actor, Storm-1852, which has engaged with election-related content on social media, emphasizing a highly interactive approach that includes reposting content, replying to comments and polling users. This network does not appear to favor any specific candidate. 'It is true that most of the Spamouflage content we have seen so far expresses criticism for both candidates. However, the fact that we found two MAGAflage networks and have not yet encountered any similar accounts that support Harris is still very relevant,' Hewitt from Doublethink Lab added. Local candidates In their latest assessment, the U.S. intelligence officials have said most Chinese efforts are aimed not at Trump or Harris, but at state and local candidates perceived as hostile to Beijing. Our investigation identified a TikTok video criticizing Republican U.S. Senator Josh Hawley, mocking his persistent questioning of Intel executives about forced labor in Xinjiang and labeling him an 'anti-China senator.' Hawley is up for re-election this year. Another video ridicules Democratic U.S. Representative Jerry Nadler from New York, suggesting he appeared to doze off during a hearing while victims' families testified. Alongside the presidential election, all 435 House seats and 33 Senate seats will be contested this year. Lawmakers critical of China are likely to become targets of online influence campaigns. These include members of the Congressional-Executive Commission on China, or CECC. Its chair, Massachusetts Representative Jim McGovern, has been outspoken about human rights abuses in China and was barred from entry to China this past July. New Jersey Republican Representative Chris Smith, co-chair of the commission, has long focused on human rights and religious freedom in China. In the Senate, Ohio Democratic Senator Sherrod Brown is seeking re-election this year and has faced attacks from Chinese state media for advocating a ban on Chinese-made electric vehicles.	https://www.voanews.com/a/probe-finds-beijing-seeking-to-mislead-sow-distrust-ahead-of-us-election/7802653.html	2024-09-28T00:04:02-07:00	
Cambodia’s new canal could boost trade but risks harming key river	PREK TAKEO, Cambodia — The Mekong River is a lifeline for millions in the six countries it traverses on its way from its headwaters to the sea, sustaining the world's largest inland fishery and abundant rice paddies on Vietnam's Mekong Delta. Cambodia's plan to build a massive canal linking the Mekong to a port on on its own coast on the Gulf of Thailand is raising alarm that the project could devastate the river's natural flood systems, worsening droughts and depriving farmers on the delta of the nutrient-rich silt that has made Vietnam the world's third-largest rice exporter. Cambodia hopes that the $1.7 billion Funan Techo canal, being built with Chinese help, will support its ambition to export directly from factories along the Mekong without relying on Vietnam, connecting the capital Phnom Penh with Kep province on Cambodia's southern coast. At an August 5 groundbreaking ceremony, Cambodian Prime Minister Hun Manet said the canal will be built 'no matter what the cost.' By reducing costs of shipping to Cambodia's only deep-sea port, at Sihanoukville, the canal will promote, 'national prestige, the territorial integrity and the development of Cambodia,' he said. Along with those promises comes peril. Here is a closer look. The threat to the Mekong The Mekong River flows from China through Myanmar, Thailand, Laos, Cambodia and Vietnam. It supports a fishery that accounts for 15% of the global inland catch, worth more than $11 billion annually, according to the nonprofit World Wildlife Fund. Flooding during the wet season makes the Mekong Delta one of the world's most productive farm regions. The river already has been disrupted by dams built upstream in Laos and China that restrict the amount of water flowing downstream, while rising seas are gnawing away at the southern edges of the climate-vulnerable Mekong Delta. Brian Eyler, director of the Washington-based Stimson Center's Southeast Asia Program, warns that high embankments along the 100-meter-wide, 5.4-meter-deep canal will prevent silt-laden floodwater from flowing downstream to Vietnam. That could worsen drought in Vietnam's rice bowl and Cambodia's floodplains, an area stretching over roughly 1,300-square kilometers. The view from Vietnam's rice bowl A drier Mekong Delta is a concern for Vietnam's agricultural sector, which powers 12% of its economy. The southwestern provinces of An Giang and Kien Giang would likely be most impacted. The delta's latticework of rivers crisscrossing green fields is vital for Vietnam's own plans of growing 'high quality, low emission rice' on 1 million hectares of farmland by 2030. The aim is to cut earth-warming greenhouse gases, lower production costs and increase farmers' profits. Water from the river is 'essential' not just for Vietnam's more than 100 million people but also for global food security, said Nguyen Van Nhut, director of rice export company Hoang Minh Nhat. Vietnam's exports of 8.3 million metric tons of rice in 2023 accounted for 15% of global exports. Most was grown in the Mekong Delta. The amount of silt being deposited by the river has already dropped and further disruptions will worsen salinity in the area, hurting farming, Nhat said. 'This will be a major concern for the agriculture sector of the Mekong delta,' he said. Cambodia's view Cambodia says the canal is a 'tributary project' that will connect to the Bassac River near Phnom Penh. President Hun Sen claimed on social media platform X that this means there would be 'no impact on the flow of the Mekong River.' But blueprints show the canal will connect to the Mekong's mainstream and in any case the Bassac consists entirely of water from the Mekong, Eyler said. Cambodian authorities are downplaying the potential environmental impacts of the project. 'This is their logic-defying basis for justifying no impact to the Mekong River,' he said. A document submitted in August 2023 to the Mekong River Commission — an organization formed for cooperation on issues regarding the Mekong — does not mention using water from the canal for irrigation, though Cambodia has since said it plans to do so. The Stimson Center added it was 'logical' that irrigation would be needed during dry months, but that would require negotiating an agreement with the other Mekong countries. The Mekong River Commission told The Associated Press all major projects on the Mekong River 'should be assessed for their potential transboundary impacts.' It said it was providing technical support to 'increase transparency and cooperation among concerned countries.' Sun Chanthol, the Cambodian deputy prime minister who oversees the project, didn't respond to a request for comments. Nationalistic rhetoric and tense neighbors Cambodia has rejected criticism of the canal, which is widely seen as an effort by the country's ruling elite to curry support for Prime Minister Hun Manet, who succeeded his father Hun Sen, who led Cambodia for 38 years. The canal is to be built jointly by Chinese state-owned construction giant China Road and Bridge Corporation and Cambodian companies. But it is enveloped in nationalistic rhetoric. The canal would provide Cambodia a 'nose to breathe through' by reducing its dependence on Vietnam, Hun Sen has said. Vietnam has avoided openly criticizing its neighbor, instead communicating its concerns quietly. Vietnamese Foreign Ministry spokesperson Pham Thu Hang said at a press conference in May that Hanoi had asked Cambodia to share information and assess the environmental impacts of the project to 'ensure the harmony of interests' of Mekong countries. Many Cambodians remain suspicious of Vietnam's intentions, believing it may want to annex Cambodian territory. Given the contentious past between the two countries, bigger and richer Vietnam is taking care not to appear to be impinging on Cambodian sovereignty, said Nguyen Khac Giang, an analyst at Singapore's ISEAS-Yusof Ishak Institute. 'Although in Vietnam, there are big concerns,' he said. Lost in Cambodia's nationalistic rhetoric are the concerns of people like Sok Koeun, 57, who may lose her home. The tin-roofed cottage where she has lived with her family since 1980 is right where the canal is due to be built. The river provides her with fish to feed her family when she struggles to get by selling sugarcane juice and recycling plastic cans. No one has been in touch, she says, to answer her mounting questions: Will she get compensated? Will she get land? Or cash? Where will they go? 'I only learned about it (the canal) just now,' she said.	https://www.voanews.com/a/cambodia-s-new-canal-could-boost-trade-but-risks-harming-key-river/7801366.html	2024-09-28T00:02:57-07:00

Rhino numbers are up a bit, but poaching has increased, too	NAIROBI, Kenya — The rhino population around the world has increased slightly but so have the killings, mostly in South Africa, as poaching fed by huge demand for rhino horns remains a top threat, conservationists said in a recent report. The number of white rhinos increased from 15,942 in 2022 to 17,464 in 2023, but numbers of the black and greater one-horned rhino stayed the same, according to the report published by the International Rhino Foundation ahead of World Rhino Day, observed each year on September 22. Another subspecies, the northern white rhino, is technically extinct with only two females being kept in a secure private conservancy in Kenya, known as Ol Pejeta. A trial is ongoing to develop embryos in the lab from an egg and sperm previously collected from white rhinos for transferring into a surrogate female black rhino. A total of 586 rhinos were killed in Africa in 2023, most of them in South Africa — which has the highest population of rhinos at an estimated 16,056. The killings increased from 551 reported in 2022, according to the International Union for Conservation of Nature. With all five subspecies combined, there are just under 28,000 rhinos left in the world, from 500,000 at the beginning of the 20th century. Poaching is top threat Rhinos face various environmental threats like habitat loss due to development and climate change, but poaching, based on the belief that their horns have medicinal uses, remains the top threat. Philip Muruthi, the vice president for species conservation at the Africa Wildlife Foundation, said protection has played a big role in increasing rhino population. In Kenya, their numbers rose from 380 in 1986 to 1,000 last year, he said. 'Why has that happened? Because the rhinos were brought into sanctuaries and were protected.' Muruthi advocates for a campaign that will end the demand for rhino horn as well as adoption of new technology in tracking and monitoring rhinos for their protection while also educating communities where they live on the benefits of rhinos to the ecosystem and the economy. Known as mega herbivores that mow the parks and create inroads for other herbivores, rhinos are also good for establishing forests by ingesting seeds and spreading them across the parks in their dung. Murithi lamented that the northern white rhino should have never gotten so close to the brink of extinction. 'Don't get the numbers to where it's very expensive to recover and we are not even sure that it will happen,' he said. The body of the last male northern white rhino – named Sudan – that died in 2018 has been preserved and displayed at the Museums of Kenya in Nairobi. A research scientist and curator of mammals at the museum, Bernard Agwanda, said preserving Sudan will tell the story of how the species lived among humans and why conservation is important. 'So we expect that the northern white rhino behind us here is going to live for one or two centuries to be able to tell its story for generations to come,' he said.	https://www.voanews.com/a/rhino-numbers-are-up-a-bit-but-poaching-has-increased-too/7801316.html	2024-09-28T00:01:39-07:00	
The price of gold keeps climbing to unprecedented heights. Here's why	NEW YORK — The rush for gold just keeps coming. Gold hit another all-time high this week. Recent gains for the precious metal are largely credited to ongoing economic uncertainty, geopolitical tensions and strong demand from central banks around the world. If trends continue, analysts have bullish outlooks on the price of gold for the months ahead. But the future is never promised. Here's what you need to know. Where does the price of gold stand today? The New York spot price of gold closed Tuesday at just over $2,657 per Troy ounce — the standard for measuring precious metals, which is equivalent to 31 grams — the highest recorded to date, per FactSet. That would make a gold bar or brick weighing 400 Troy ounces worth more than $1.06 million today. This week's record high means that the price of gold has climbed hundreds of dollars per Troy ounce over the last year. Tuesday's price is up nearly $145 from a month ago and more than $740 from this time in 2023. The price of gold is up nearly 30% year to date, analysts note — outpacing the benchmark S&P 500's roughly 20% gain since the start of 2024. Why is the price of gold going up? There are a few factors behind the recent gains. Interest in buying gold often comes at times of uncertainty — with potential concerns around inflation and the strength of the U.S. dollar, for example, causing some to look for alternative places to park their money. Gold also surged in the early days of the COVID-19 pandemic. Among sources of uncertainty today are geopolitical tensions — which escalated over recent days with Israel's deadly strikes in Lebanon. And the ongoing wars in Gaza and Ukraine have continued to fuel fears about the future worldwide. In markets like the U.S., there's also particular concern about the health of the job market. Last week's larger-than-usual half-point cut by the Federal Reserve signals a new focus on slowing employment numbers, and more rate cuts are expected before the end of the year. And such action arrives in the midst of a tumultuous election year — which could prove crucial to economic policy in the road ahead, too. In the near future, people are considering 'any case of turbulence in the economy,' FxPro senior market analyst Michel Saliby explained. 'This is why they're keeping a decent portion of gold in their portfolio as a 'safe haven.'' Analysts also point to strong demand from central banks around the world. Joe Cavatoni, senior market strategist at the World Gold Council, noted last month that central bank demand was well-above the five year average — reflecting 'heightened concern with inflation and economic stability.' Recent stimulus measures in China aimed at boosting consumer spending are also expected to up retail investments, Saliby added, further boosting gold's performance. Is gold worth the investment? Advocates of investing in gold call it a 'safe haven,' arguing the commodity can serve to diversify and balance your investment portfolio, as well as mitigate possible risks down the road. Some also take comfort in buying something tangible that has the potential to increase in value over time. Experts caution against putting all your eggs in one basket. Both retail and institutional investors shouldn't be influenced by the 'FOMO effect,' or fear of missing out, Saliby notes — explaining that people should not risk all their money just because they are seeing others rake in gains. He advises investors to watch the market and always have a clear risk management strategy for their position. If geopolitical tensions cool, Saliby expects the price of gold to correct slightly, perhaps falling around $50 to $80. But he remains bullish overall for the near future — expecting gold's spot price to soon surpass the $2,700 mark previously predicted for 2025, and perhaps reach as high as $2,800 or $2,900 if trends continue. Still, future gains are never promised and not everyone agrees gold is a good investment. Critics say gold isn't always the inflation hedge many say it is — and that there are more efficient ways to protect against potential loss of capital, such as through derivative-based investments. The Commodity Futures Trade Commission has also previously warned people to be wary of investing in gold. Precious metals can be highly volatile, the commission said, and prices rise as demand goes up — meaning 'when economic anxiety or instability is high, the people who typically profit from precious metals are the sellers.' If you do choose to invest in gold, the commission adds, it's important to educate yourself on safe trading practices and be cautious of potential scams and counterfeits on the market.	https://www.voanews.com/a/the-price-of-gold-keeps-climbing-to-unprecedented-heights-here-s-why/7799908.html	2024-09-28T00:00:18-07:00

Israeli airstrikes rock Beirut; Hezbollah command center hit	BEIRUT/JERUSALEM — A wave of air raids hit Beirut's southern suburbs early Saturday as Israel stepped up attacks on Hezbollah, after a massive strike on the Iran-backed movement's command center that apparently targeted leader Hassan Nasrallah. Reuters witnesses heard more than 20 airstrikes before dawn on Saturday. Abandoning their homes in the southern suburbs, thousands of Lebanese congregated in squares, parks and sidewalks in downtown Beirut and seaside areas. 'They want to destroy Dahiye, they want to destroy all of us,' said Sari, a man in his 30s who gave only his first name, referring to the suburb he had fled after an Israeli evacuation order. Nearby, the newly displaced in Beirut's Martyrs Square rolled mats onto the ground to tried to sleep. Israel's military said early Saturday that about 10 projectiles had crossed from Lebanon into Israeli territory and that 'some' had been intercepted. A statement from the military did not identify the projectiles, which it said were detected after sirens sounded in the Upper Galilee area. An unprecedented five hours of continuous strikes early Saturday followed Friday's attack, by far the most powerful by Israel on Beirut during nearly a year of war with Hezbollah. It marked a sharp escalation of a conflict that has involved daily missile and rocket fire between the two sides. The latest escalation has sharply increased fears the conflict could spiral out of control, potentially drawing in Iran, Hezbollah's principal backer, as well as the United States. There was no immediate confirmation of Nasrallah's fate after Friday's heavy strikes, but a source close to Hezbollah told Reuters he was not reachable. The Lebanese armed group has not made a statement. Israel has not said whether it tried to hit Nasrallah, but a senior Israeli official said top Hezbollah commanders were targeted. 'I think it's too early to say... Sometimes they hide the fact when we succeed,' the Israeli official told reporters when asked if the strike Friday had killed Nasrallah. Earlier, a source close to Hezbollah told Reuters that Nasrallah was alive. Iran's Tasnim news agency also reported he was safe. A senior Iranian security official told Reuters that Tehran was checking his status. The Israeli military said in a statement that it had killed the commander of Hezbollah's missile unit, Muhammad Ali Ismail, and his deputy Hossein Ahmed Ismail. Death toll rises Hours before the latest barrage, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu told the United Nations that his country had a right to continue the campaign. 'As long as Hezbollah chooses the path of war, Israel has no choice, and Israel has every right to remove this threat and return our citizens to their homes safely,' he said. Several delegations walked out as Netanyahu approached the lectern. He later cut short his New York trip to return to Israel. Lebanese health authorities confirmed six dead and 91 wounded in the initial attack on Friday -- the fourth on Beirut's Hezbollah-controlled southern suburbs in a week and the heaviest since a 2006 war. The toll appeared likely to rise much higher. There was no word on casualties from the later strikes. More than 700 people were killed in strikes over the past week, authorities said. Hezbollah's al-Manar television reported seven buildings were destroyed. Security sources in Lebanon said the target was an area where top Hezbollah officials are usually based. Hours later, the Israeli military told residents in parts of Beirut's southern suburbs to evacuate as it targeted missile launchers and weapons storage sites it said were under civilian housing. Hezbollah denied any weapons or arms depots were located in buildings that were hit in the Beirut suburbs, the Lebanese armed group's media office said in a statement. Alaa al-Din Saeed, a resident of a neighborhood Israel identified as a target, told Reuters he was fleeing with his wife and three children. 'We found out on the television. There was a huge commotion in the neighborhood,' he said. The family grabbed clothes, identification papers and some cash but were stuck in traffic with others trying to flee. 'We're going to the mountains. We'll see how to spend the night -- and tomorrow we'll see what we can do.' Around 100,000 people in Lebanon have been displaced this week, increasing the number uprooted in the country to well over 200,000. Israel's government has said that returning some 70,000 Israeli evacuees to their homes is a war aim. Fear the fighting will spread Hezbollah has fired hundreds of rockets and missiles against targets in Israel, including Tel Aviv. The group said it fired rockets on Friday at the northern Israeli city of Safed, where a woman was treated for minor injuries. Israel's air defense systems have ensured the damage has so far been minimal. Iran, which said Friday's attack crossed 'red lines,' accused Israel of using U.S.-made 'bunker-busting' bombs. U.S. Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin said Washington was not informed of that strike beforehand. President Joe Biden was being kept abreast of developments. At the U.N., where the annual General Assembly met this week, the intensification prompted expressions of concern including by France, which with the U.S. has proposed a 21-day cease-fire. 'This must be brought to an end immediately,' French Ambassador Nicolas de Riviere told a Security Council meeting. At a New York news conference, U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken said: 'We believe the way forward is through diplomacy, not conflict... We will continue to work intentionally with all parties to urge them to choose that course.' Hezbollah opened the latest bout in a decades-long conflict with a missile barrage against Israel immediately following the October 7 attack on Israel by the Palestinian militant group Hamas in Gaza last year.	https://www.voanews.com/a/israeli-airstrikes-rock-beirut-hezbollah-command-center-hit/7802738.html	2024-09-27T22:55:53-07:00	
Australian treasurer, visiting Beijing, welcomes Chinese efforts to stimulate its economy	BEIJING — Australian Treasurer Jim Chalmers on Friday welcomed Chinese efforts to stimulate its slowing economy, noting that its recent weakness has hurt Australia. Chalmers was wrapping up a two-day visit to Beijing, the first to China by an Australian treasurer in seven years, as strained bilateral relations mend. He told reporters that Australia’s economy was slowing because of global economic uncertainty, high interest rates and China’s slowdown. 'Those three things are combining to slow our own economy considerably and when steps are taken here to boost economic activity and to boost growth in the Chinese economy, subject to the details that will be released in good time, we see that as a very, very good development for Australia,' Chalmers said. China is the biggest buyer of Australia’s most lucrative exports: iron ore and coal. 'Our resilience and prosperity are closely connected to China’s economy and the global economy,' Chalmers wrote in an opinion piece published Friday in The Australian newspaper. He noted that his department forecasts Chinese annual economic growth at below 5% for the next three years, the weakest expansion since the late 1970s. While in Beijing the two sides held meetings for the Australia-China Strategic Economic Dialogue, reviving the once annual talks aimed at growing trade and investment after a seven-year hiatus. In 2020, China introduced a series of official and unofficial trade bans on Australian commodities, including coal, that cost Australian exporters more than 20 billion Australian dollars ($14 billion) a year. Such 'trade impediments' now cost Australian exporters less than AU$1 billion ($690 million) a year, Chalmers says. At the outset of Thursday's meetings, Zheng Shanjie, chair of China’s National Development and Reform Commission, noted how relations had improved since Chalmers’ center-left Labor Party government was elected in 2020, ending nine years of conservative rule in Australia. 'Our development represents opportunities rather than challenges with each other,' Zheng said through an interpreter. 'At a time when the international situation is intricate and turbulent, it is of great significance for both countries to discuss economic development and cooperation opportunities together,' Zheng added. Two-way bilateral trade reached a record AU$327 billion ($225 billion) last year, more than double its value when a free trade deal was struck in 2015. During his visit, Chalmers was expected to raise the Chinese restrictions on imports of Australian lobsters and red meat from two Australian processors. Chalmers confirmed he had raised the lobster trade in discussions and said Australia was seeking a 'speedy resolution of the restrictions.' He blamed 'technical issues' between bureaucracies of the two nations for the delay. China raised concerns about Australian foreign investment rules. Chalmers said he had explained to Zheng that Australia's regulations did not target China and had agreed to further discuss the restrictions. 'Ours is a non-discriminatory regime which is about managing risks in foreign investment,' Chalmers said. 'Rejecting proposals is a very rare thing and it isn't just (proposals) from one country,' Chalmers added. China wants to invest in Australian critical minerals, but Australia shares U.S. concerns over China’s global dominance in critical minerals and control over supply chains in the renewable energy sector. Citing Australia’s national interests, in June Chalmers ordered five Chinese-linked companies to divest their shares in the rare earth mining company Northern Minerals. China has been grappling with a lagging economy post-COVID, with weak consumer demand, persistent deflationary pressures and a contraction in factory activity. Earlier this week, China announced a series of new measures to boost the economy and revive its ailing property sector. The central bank lowered bank reserve requirements by 0.5% as of Friday. It also has slashed interest rates on its loans to commercial banks and lowered the minimum down payments for some mortgages. Unconfirmed reports Thursday by the South China Morning Post and Bloomberg said the government plans to spend about 1 trillion yuan ($142 billion) on recapitalizing six big state-owned banks. While China is growing economically closer to Australia, Beijing is becoming militarily more belligerent in the Asia-Pacific region. On security issues, Chalmers said he raised in his discussions a Chinese aircraft carrier accompanied by two destroyers entering an area near Japan’s shores for the first time last week. He also raised international concerns over China test-firing an intercontinental ballistic missile into the Pacific Ocean this week. 'I was able to reiterate in the meetings yesterday afternoon our expectations of safe and professional conduct of all militaries operating in our region,' Chalmers said. 'But as you would expect, the overwhelming focus of our discussions here have been the economy,' he added.	https://www.voanews.com/a/australian-treasurer-visiting-beijing-welcomes-chinese-efforts-to-stimulate-its-economy/7802708.html	2024-09-27T20:05:46-07:00	
Chinese nuclear attack submarine sank during construction, US official says	WASHINGTON — Satellite imagery showed that China’s newest nuclear-powered attack submarine sank alongside a pier while under construction, a senior U.S. defense official said Thursday. The sinking of China's first Zhou-class submarine represents a setback for Beijing as it continues to build out the world's largest navy. Beijing has become increasingly assertive in pursuing its claim to virtually the entire South China Sea, which is crucial to international trade. Meanwhile, China faces longtime territorial disputes involving others in the region including Brunei, Malaysia, the Philippines, Taiwan and Vietnam. The United States has sought to strengthen ties to its allies in the region and regularly sails through those waters in operations it says maintains the freedom of navigation for vessels there, angering Beijing. The submarine likely sank between May and June, when satellite images showed cranes that would be necessary to lift it off the bottom of the river, said the official, who spoke on condition of anonymity to provide details about the submarine loss. China has been building up its naval fleet at a breakneck pace, and the U.S. considers China’s rise one of its main future security concerns. A Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesperson said Friday he was not familiar with the topic and did not provide any information when asked about it at a Beijing press conference. The U.S. official said it was 'not surprising' that China's navy would conceal it. The submarine's current status is unknown. The identification of the sunken nuclear submarine was first reported by The Wall Street Journal. Thomas Shugart, a former U.S. Navy submariner and an analyst at the Center for a New American Security, first noticed the incident involving the submarine in July, though it wasn’t publicly known at the time that it involved the new Zhou-class vessel. Satellite images from Planet Labs PBC analyzed by The Associated Press show what appears to be a submarine docked at the Shuangliu shipyard on the Yangtze River before the incident. An image taken June 15 appears to show the submarine either fully or partially submerged just under the river’s surface, with rescue equipment and cranes surrounding it. Booms surround it to prevent any oil or other leaks from the vessel. A satellite image taken August 25 shows a submarine back at the same dock as the submerged vessel. It's not clear if it was the same one. It remains unclear if the affected submarine had been loaded with nuclear fuel or if its reactor was operating at the time of the incident. However, there has been no reported release of radiation in the area in the time since. China as of last year operated six nuclear-powered ballistic missile submarines, six nuclear-powered attack submarines and 48 diesel-powered attack submarines, according to a U.S. military report. News of the submarine's sinking comes as China this week conducted a rare launch of an intercontinental ballistic missile into international waters in the Pacific Ocean. Experts say it marked the first time Beijing had conducted such a test since 1980.	https://www.voanews.com/a/chinese-nuclear-attack-submarine-sank-during-construction-us-official-says/7802700.html	2024-09-27T19:49:48-07:00	
Brazil imposes new fine, demands payments before letting X resume	SAO PAULO/BRASILIA BRAZIL — Brazil's Supreme Court said on Friday that social platform X still needs to pay just over $5 million in pending fines, including a new one, before it will be allowed to resume its service in the country, according to a court document. Earlier this week, the Elon Musk-owned U.S. firm told the court it had complied with orders to stop the spread of misinformation and asked it to lift a ban on the platform. But Judge Alexandre de Moraes responded on Friday with a ruling that X and its legal representative in Brazil must still agree to pay a total of $3.4 million in pending fines that were previously ordered by the court. In his decision, the judge said that the court can use resources already frozen from X and Starlink accounts in Brazil, but to do so the satellite company, also owned by Musk, had to drop its pending appeal against the fund blockage. The judge also demanded a new $1.8 million fine related to a brief period last week when X became available again for some users in Brazil. X, formerly known as Twitter, did not immediately respond to a request for comment. According to a person close to X, the tech firm will likely pay all the fines but will consider challenging the fine that was imposed by the court after the platform ban. X has been suspended since late August in Brazil, one of its largest and most coveted markets, after Moraes ruled it had failed to comply with orders related to restricting hate speech and naming a local legal representative. Musk, who had denounced the orders as censorship and called Moraes a 'dictator,' backed down and started to reverse his position last week, when X lawyers said the platform tapped a local representative and would comply with court rulings. In Friday's decision, Moraes said that X had proved it had now blocked accounts as ordered by the court and had named the required legal representative in Brazil.	https://www.voanews.com/a/brazil-imposes-new-fine-demands-payments-before-letting-x-resume/7802694.html	2024-09-27T19:01:57-07:00	
Taliban push back against allegations of gender bias, rights abuses	Islamabad — Taliban leaders in Afghanistan have defended their Islamist rule amid intensified accusations of 'gender-based' discrimination against women and girls at this week's U.N. General Assembly. 'The situation is not as it is portrayed and propagated abroad,' Maulavi Abdul Kabir, the Taliban deputy prime minister for political affairs, asserted in an interview with an Afghan television channel aired Friday. Kabir's comments came a day after nearly two dozen countries jointly supported Germany, Canada, the Netherlands and Australia in their initiative to hold the Taliban accountable for their alleged campaign to systematically exclude women from public life since the Taliban regained power in 2021. The de facto Afghan rulers have imposed a strict interpretation of Islamic law, known as Sharia. The enforcement includes banning girls' secondary school education, prohibiting Afghan women from most workplaces, and requiring them not to speak aloud and to cover their faces and bodies in public. Kabir, while speaking to the local Ariana News station on Friday, asserted that Western allegations of the Taliban driving women out of public spaces were misplaced, insisting that the human rights of all Afghans are protected under Islamic principles. 'Education for girls beyond the sixth grade and at universities is currently suspended,' he responded when asked when secondary schools would reopen for girls. 'The Islamic Emirate has not decided to keep them closed indefinitely, nor has the cabinet approved any such policy,' Kabir reiterated, using the official title of their government in Kabul. However, the Taliban deputy prime minister said that women are allowed to pursue education in religious seminaries, known as madrassas, across Afghanistan, including in the capital. 'There are female teachers. It is a single-sex Islamic educational system that requires hijab under the prevailing societal norms. It also permits women to pursue medical education,' Kabir stated. He said that the Taliban government employs 85,000 women in health, immigration, education, passport and other departments. 'There are hospitals in Kabul being run by female directors,' Kabir said. Nations urge Taliban to address concerns Countries such as Spain, Sweden, Belgium, Bulgaria, Chile, Croatia, Finland, Honduras, Ireland, Iceland, Latvia, Luxembourg, Malawi, Morocco, Moldova and Romania are supporting the four-nation push to start proceedings against the Taliban at the International Court of Justice in The Hague. The United States in not a member of the ICJ. In their joint statement issued in New York on Thursday, these countries urged the Taliban to respect international treaties on eliminating discrimination against women, to which Afghanistan is a party. They hailed the initiative spearheaded by Germany, Australia, Canada and the Netherlands to push proceedings against the Taliban, urging the de facto Taliban authorities to address international concerns or face the legal challenge. 'This action is without prejudice to our firm position that we do not politically recognize the Taliban de facto authorities as the legitimate representation of the Afghan population,' the statement stressed. 'Afghanistan's failure to fulfill its human rights treaty obligations is a key obstacle to normalization of relations.' The Taliban government is not formally recognized by any country, nor is it allowed to represent Afghanistan at the United Nations, mainly over human rights concerns. U.N. Secretary-General Antonio Guterres said on the sidelines of this week's General Assembly that the Taliban's treatment of women can be compared to 'some of the most egregious systems of oppression in recent history.' 'We will continue to amplify the voices of Afghan women and call for them to play a full role in the country's life, both inside its borders and on the global stage,' he said. Kabir criticized the U.N. for not granting the Afghanistan seat at the world body to the Taliban. 'We have met our obligations,' he said. 'The Islamic Emirate controls the entire geographical territory of the country. People are satisfied with us, and we are governing with the help of the people.'	https://www.voanews.com/a/taliban-push-back-against-allegations-of-gender-bias-rights-abuses/7802661.html	2024-09-27T18:48:16-07:00

Blinken dismisses China's Ukraine peace plan over material support for Russia	new york — U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken said Friday that China's words and actions regarding ending Russia's war on Ukraine do not 'add up,' as the Beijing government continues to allow Chinese companies to 'fuel Russia's war machine.' The United States and China are planning a call between President Joe Biden and President Xi Jinping in the coming days, with China's material support for Russia in the war on Ukraine expected to be a key topic on the U.S. agenda. Friday afternoon, Blinken held talks with Chinese Foreign Minister Wang Yi on the sidelines of the U.N. General Assembly in New York. Ukraine Following talks that lasted more than an hour, Blinken told reporters at a news conference that any peace plan to end Russia's war on Ukraine must be based on the principles of the U.N. Charter, particularly territorial integrity, sovereignty and independence. 'A peace in which the aggressor gets everything that it sought, and the victim does not have its rights upheld, is not a recipe for a lasting peace, and certainly not a just one,' Blinken said when asked about a peace proposal by China and Brazil. Earlier on Friday, China and Brazil pushed forward with efforts to rally developing countries behind a plan to end Russia's war in Ukraine, despite Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy's rejection of the initiative, viewing it as favorable to Moscow's interests. The meeting between Blinken and Wang came amid growing U.S. concerns over Chinese firms supplying semiconductor chips and drones to Moscow, which have significantly bolstered Russia's battlefield capabilities in its war against Ukraine. Blinken said, 'Roughly 70% of the machine tools that Russia's importing, coming from China, Hong Kong. Ninety percent of the microelectronics, from China, Hong Kong. And this is materially helping the Russians produce the missiles, the rockets, the armored vehicles, the munitions that they need to perpetuate the war, to continue their aggression.' In New York, Wang told reporters that China had discussed with other countries the importance of preventing escalation in Russia's war on Ukraine. 'Russia and Ukraine are neighbors that cannot be moved away from each other and amity is the only realistic option,' Wang said, emphasizing that other nations should support an international peace conference involving Russia and Ukraine. Taiwan On Friday, Blinken said he also 'emphasized the importance of maintaining peace and stability across the Taiwan Strait' during the meeting with his Chinese counterpart. Rick Waters, former deputy assistant secretary of state for China and Taiwan, said the United States and China share an interest in maintaining diplomatic and military communication. 'You're not going to resolve disputes over Taiwan or the South China Sea in those channels, but I don't think either leader wants a military mishap to put them in a corner where they might have to contend with escalation or, even worse, conflict,' Waters, now managing director of Eurasia Group's China practice, said in a recent interview with VOA. The People's Republic of China (PRC) will celebrate its National Day on Tuesday, commemorating the founding of the country in 1949. Taiwan celebrates October 10, known as 'Double 10,' as the anniversary of the founding of the Republic of China (ROC) in 1912. The Republic of China is Taiwan's formal name. Taiwan has been self-ruled since 1949, when Mao Zedong's communists took power in Beijing after defeating Chiang Kai-shek's Kuomintang nationalists in a civil war, prompting the nationalists' relocation to the island. PRC leaders usually carefully watch the speeches from leaders in Taiwan during its Double 10 celebrations. Since Taiwan's democratically elected President Lai Ching-te took office in May, Beijing has increased military pressure against Taiwan. The PRC has deemed Lai a separatist. U.S. officials have stressed to their Chinese counterparts that the more pressure China applies to Taiwan, the more it risks pushing Taiwan further away, according to sources familiar with recent diplomatic discussions between Washington and Beijing. Analysts indicate they do not expect Lai to advocate for issues considered taboo by China in the coming months. 'Taiwan President Lai has been quite careful not to touch China's red lines in his public remarks since becoming the president of Taiwan,' Dennis Wilder, senior fellow for the Initiative for U.S.-China Dialogue on Global Issues at Georgetown University, told VOA. 'I would guess that he will try again to reach out to Beijing and do not expect him to push independence themes.' Wilder added, 'The Chinese leadership came to the conclusion long ago that because of Lai's deep green background they would never be able to trust him. Thus, there is very little he can do, as was the case as well with former President Tsai [Ing-wen], to convince Beijing that they should improve cross-strait relations while he is in office.' He was referring to Taiwan’s political coalition known for its pro-independence platform.

Harris visits Border Patrol leaders in Arizona	DOUGLAS, Arizona — U.S. Vice President Kamala Harris walked a scrubby stretch of fence line along Arizona's border with Mexico on Friday, seeking to project an image of strength against illegal migration as she confronts one of her biggest vulnerabilities in the November election. In her first trip to the international boundary since becoming the Democratic presidential nominee, Harris chatted with local Border Patrol leaders as they strode along a rust-colored stretch of wall built during Barack Obama's presidency. Temperatures in Douglas, Arizona, neared 37.7 degrees Celsius during a conversation that lasted about half an hour. 'They've got a tough job, and they need, rightly, support to do their job,' Harris said of the Border Patrol as she entered the Douglas port of entry for a briefing on efforts to block the flow of fentanyl across the border. 'They are very dedicated. And so I'm here to talk with them about what we can continue to do to support them. And also thank them for the hard work they do.' Later, she was expected to call for further tightening asylum restrictions, moving beyond President Joe Biden's policy on an issue where her rival, former President Donald Trump, has an edge with voters. Hundreds of people packed into a gymnasium to hear her speak. Trump and his fellow Republicans have pounded Harris relentlessly over the Biden administration's record on migration and fault the vice president for spending little time visiting the border during her time in the White House. Harris will outline her plan to crack down further on asylum claims and keep the restrictions in place longer compared with the executive order that Biden signed this summer, according to a campaign official who spoke on condition of anonymity because Harris had not yet made the announcement. The official briefed reporters aboard Air Force 2 en route to Arizona. Harris arrived by helicopter in Douglas, where she met with Mayor Donald Huish, Cochise County Sheriff Mark Dannels and County Supervisor Ann English, along with Senator Mark Kelly and Attorney General Kris Mayes. Immigration and border security are top issues in Arizona, the only battleground state that borders Mexico and one that contended with a record influx of asylum-seekers last year. Voters favor Trump on migration, and Harris has gone on offense to improve her standing on the issue and defuse a key line of political attack for Trump. In nearly every campaign speech she gives, Harris recounts how a sweeping bipartisan package aiming to overhaul the federal immigration system collapsed in Congress earlier this year after Trump urged top Republicans to oppose it. 'The American people deserve a president who cares more about border security than playing political games,' Harris plans to say, according to an excerpt of her remarks previewed by her campaign. After the immigration legislation stalled, the Biden administration announced rules that bar migrants from being granted asylum when U.S. officials deem that the southern border is overwhelmed. Since then, arrests for illegal border crossings have fallen. Harris will also use her trip to remind voters about her work as attorney general of California in confronting crime along the border. During an August rally in Glendale, outside Phoenix, she talked about helping to prosecute drug- and people-smuggling gangs that operated transnationally and at the border. 'I prosecuted them in case after case, and I won,' Harris said then. The vice president's trip to Douglas thrusts the issue of immigration into the brightest spotlight yet less than six weeks before Election Day. Trump didn't wait for her to arrive there before pushing back. He pointed Friday to purported data about criminals entering the U.S. illegally in a bid to link Harris to violent crimes committed by migrants. In a scathing diatribe, he said 'blood is on her hands.' 'These are hard, tough, vicious criminals that are free to roam in our country,' Trump said at a manufacturing plant in Michigan. Earlier in the week, he told voters that 'when Kamala speaks about the border, her credibility is less than zero.' The Trump campaign has also countered with its own TV ads deriding the vice president as a failed 'border czar.' 'Under Harris, over 10 million illegally here,' said one spot. However, estimates on how many people have entered the country illegally since the start of the Biden administration in 2021 vary widely. Harris also never held the position of border czar. Instead, her assignment was to tackle the 'root causes' of migration from three Central American nations — El Salvador, Guatemala and Honduras — that were responsible for a significant share of border crossers. The vice president took a long-term approach to an immediate problem, helping persuade multinational corporations and Latin American businesses to invest in the region. That, she argued, would create jobs and give locals more reasons to stay home rather than take the arduous trek north. Still, Trump has continued to decry an 'invasion' of border crossers. Douglas, where Harris appeared, is an overwhelmingly Democratic border town in GOP-dominated Cochise County, where the Republicans on the board of supervisors are facing criminal charges for refusing to certify the 2022 election results. Trump was in the area last month, using a remote stretch of border wall and a pile of steel beams to draw a contrast between himself and Harris on border security. The town of 16,000 people has strong ties to its much larger neighbor, Agua Prieta, Mexico, and a busy port of entry that's slated for a long-sought upgrade. Many locals are as concerned with making legal border crossings more efficient as they are with combatting illegal ones.	https://www.voanews.com/a/harris-visits-border-patrol-leaders-in-arizona/7802688.html	2024-09-27T18:28:49-07:00

Myanmar military urges armed groups to stop fighting, join elections	washington — Myanmar's military has called on ethnic armed groups and anti-junta resistance forces to end their armed struggle and participate in proposed national elections. While this call to cease fighting was quickly rejected by opposition forces, it marked a significant development in Myanmar's three-year civil war. Ye Myo Hein, a senior expert on Myanmar at the United States Institute of Peace, said the military's call to cease fighting, made public in a statement Thursday, was aimed to appease China. 'The SAC [State Administration Council] is making overtures to Beijing,' he posted on social media, pointing out recent statements in which the military referred to China as Myanmar's closest ally. The statement posted by the SAC, Myanmar's military regime, proposed that ethnic groups, including the People's Defense Forces (PDF) — the armed wing of the anti-junta movement — resolve political issues through peaceful means and electoral participation. Though the SAC did not mention the National Unity Government (NUG), the PDF is largely aligned with the shadow government formed by former lawmakers and junta opponents. The SAC argued that the ongoing conflict has caused significant losses to the country. 'Considering the losses of the state due to armed struggle and terrorism, ethnic armed organizations and PDF terrorists are invited to contact the state to resolve political issues through party politics,' the SAC stated. Opposition response Opposition leaders swiftly dismissed the military's appeal to cease fighting. Sui Khar, foreign minister of the Chinland government, which controls much of Chin state in western Myanmar, and vice chairman of the NUG-affiliated Chin National Front, told VOA the military's statement was not a genuine invitation, as it was limited to political parties and elections. 'It sounded like they were forcing others to join their own agenda,' Sui Khar said. The NUG also rejected the junta's invitation, calling it a ploy to create disunity among resistance forces, and vowed to continue the Spring Revolution — the resistance movement against military rule — and to work toward establishing a federal democratic union. Soe Thuya Zaw, a commander of the Mandalay PDF, described the offer as deceptive. 'It's like hanging a goat's head but selling dog meat,' he wrote on Facebook, using a Myanmar proverb to highlight the military's history of broken promises. Escalation in Lashio The Myanmar National Democratic Alliance Army (MNDAA), an ethnic armed group with close ties to China, has frustrated the military by capturing key territories along the Myanmar-China border. Despite the junta's attempts to negotiate, ongoing airstrikes cast doubt on the prospects for peace. On Friday, fighter jets bombed Lashio, a major city in northern Shan state and a critical trade route to China, currently under MNDAA control. According to the MNDAA, the strikes targeted civilian areas, killing two people and injuring six. 'They talk about resolving political problems through dialogue, yet continue bombing. So, the offer is impossible,' said Tu Maung Nyo, a writer and political analyst based on the Thailand-Myanmar border. 'The military is calling for negotiations because they can't win on the battlefield. It's just a way out of a crisis.' China's role in path forward Analysts say Beijing has been pressuring both Myanmar's SAC and ethnic armed groups to stabilize the situation, primarily to protect its interests along the shared border and safeguard investments. Chinese Foreign Minister Wang Yi's visit to Myanmar earlier this year signaled Beijing's desire for a stable Myanmar under military control without prolonged conflict. 'China wants stability,' said Hla Kyaw Zaw, a China-Myanmar relations expert based in China. 'Their top priorities are ensuring bombs don't fall near their territory, preventing refugees from crossing into China, and protecting Chinese investments in Myanmar. China also wants to ensure the safety of its people in Myanmar.' But the situation remains complicated. While China provides political and economic backing to the junta, analysts argue that it also covertly supports some ethnic armed groups along its border. The MNDAA, for example, is widely believed to receive Chinese support. The military's recent warmth toward China is seen by many as a survival tactic. Tu Maung Nyo said the stakes are high for China. Beijing seeks stability but recognizes that as long as the SAC remains in power, peace may be elusive. Although China continues to support the military, it is likely applying pressure behind the scenes for a resolution, especially as regional powers, including the Quad nations — Australia, India, Japan and the United States — express concern over Myanmar's future. 'China may even use its leverage by withholding weapons sales or cutting off the military's jet fuel supply,' Hla Kyaw Zaw said, noting that such actions would align with recent calls from the Quad members. Tu Maung Nyo said outside influences have always played a role in Myanmar, which occupies a strategic position on the Indian Ocean. 'The events in Myanmar, from the start of the civil war to today, have always seen the participation of major powers. While some may call it interference, I see it as inevitable participation,' he said. 'But now, the military seems to have a big problem deciding which side to rely on.'	https://www.voanews.com/a/myanmar-military-urges-armed-groups-to-stop-fighting-join-elections/7802421.html	2024-09-27T17:54:54-07:00	
Kenyan president discusses Haiti, UN reform, Gen-Z protests	New York — On the sidelines of the U.N. General Assembly, Kenyan President William Ruto sat down with VOA’s Peter Clottey for an in-depth conversation Thursday. Ruto discussed his recent visit to Haiti, where he met with the top police commanders leading efforts to combat gangs and restore order in the Caribbean nation. He also addressed the proposal for Africa to secure two permanent seats on the U.N. Security Council, as well as the growing protests by Kenya’s Gen-Z demanding reforms in the East African country. The following has been edited for length and clarity. VOA’s Peter Clottey: Thank you very much, Mr. President, for having us this morning. What was your overarching message during your speech at the U.N. General Assembly? Kenyan President William Ruto: Three messages: the ravaging war around the world, tensions and conflict — you know, from Ukraine, Darfur, Sudan, DRC [Democratic Republic of the Congo] — and the failure of the multilateral system, especially the U.N. General Assembly and specifically the U.N. Security Council, to be a force of good and a place where we resolve issues. In fact, it has become a gridlock and part of the problem. There is urgency in reforming the U.N. Security Council so that it reflects the dynamics and responds to the urgency of the situation that we face at the moment. It is our position that the U.N. needs to be reformed yesterday — to make it democratic, representative and agile — so that it can respond to the times of challenges of our time. Number two is the challenge we have about the debt situation, the economic situation globally, and the fact that many countries in the Global South, many countries are facing the possibility of debt default. And a need to reform the international financial system, deal with credit rating agencies, ensure that there is longer-term financing, there is concessional financing, there is financing that is at scale to make sure that countries can be able to push their development programs, pay for social services and manage the serious challenges of debt. Thirdly, climate change and the huge potential and opportunity that we have, especially in the Global South, and more particularly in Africa, for the huge resources, energy resources that we have, mineral resources that are in plenty, and the human capital that exists, that we can use to turn the climate change that is ravaging the world into an opportunity for Africa to industrialize, to create jobs, and to decarbonize the whole world. So, these were my very three pointed messages. Of course, not forgetting the challenge we have in Haiti and what Kenya is doing about it. VOA: You were there recently and met with Kenyan police officers. What were your observations, and what did the Kenyan police officers tell you about the challenges they face in Haiti? Ruto: I met with Haiti's political leadership, and we had a candid conversation. I was supposed to be there for an hour but stayed for four. I also met the commanders of the Kenyan contingent, the Multinational Security Support Mission [MSS] and the Haitian police leadership. My assessment was more positive than I initially thought. The reports I received indicated that the pessimists and critics who saw no hope in Haiti are changing their tune. The airport, which used to be under gunfire, is now safe, with more flights coming in and out. The palace is secure, the National Hospital is in good hands, and the National Police Academy, which had been overrun by gangs, is now training officers. I see a very positive trajectory. The Kenyan commanders on the ground and the Haitian police confirmed this to me, though they still face logistical challenges and need more resources and personnel. VOA: Will Kenya provide that additional support? Ruto: I immediately made the decision that Kenya is going to have another 600 security officers sent to Haiti to add on to the 400 already there — 300 next month, and 300 in November. And I am going to mobilize the rest of the global community to make sure that by January, we have 2,500 police officers so that we can execute the mandate that was given to us by the U.N. resolution setting up the MSS in Haiti. VOA: There are suggestions that perhaps the U.N. should lead this effort. Where does Kenya stand on that? Ruto: Whichever way we go, so long as we deploy the requisite personnel on the ground, mobilize resources necessary, the logistics that are needed for us to do the job in Haiti, whatever name we call it, whatever color we give it, my position is that we must focus on making sure that within a year. VOA: What is your plan for the youth of Kenya in terms of listening to them instead of coming up with specific plans to meet their calls and demands? And how do you react when they said, 'Mr. President must go. He has not kept his promises. He has to go'? Ruto: Kenya is a robustly democratic country. I mean, because we are a democracy, I see people even in New York here demonstrating and making all manner of statements, and that is the beauty, that is the diversity of democracy. I have a very clear, elaborate plan on job creation, our housing plan. Our digital footprint plan, our plan on export of labor. We just signed today here in New York a bilateral labor agreement with Austria, where Kenyan young people, the best resource we have, will find jobs in Austria. I came last week from, the other week, from Germany, doing the same thing, creating opportunities for the young people of Kenya to work in Kenya and to work abroad. This is my plan. It is elaborate, understood, and I'm rolling out, and I'm confident that before leaving Nairobi, I launched Climate Works. That is going to hire another 200,000 young people across Kenya on climate action and make sure that we deal with the environmental issues and climate change that is threatening humanity and having significant adverse effects on the people of Kenya swinging from drought to floods, and that program is now on its way beginning 1st of October. This Q&A originated in VOA’s English to Africa Service.	https://www.voanews.com/a/kenyan-president-ruto-talks-haiti-un-reform-and-gen-z-protests/7802309.html	2024-09-27T17:45:19-07:00

US, Taiwan look to boost drone collaboration	taipei, taiwan — Drone companies from Taiwan and the U.S. are exploring ways to work together in a market dominated by China, bringing together Taiwanese enterprises and more than two dozen American companies and officials this week in Taipei. Attacks by swarms of drones have become an almost daily occurrence in Russia’s war in Ukraine, with both Kyiv and Moscow using unmanned aerial vehicles, or UAVs, to carry out strikes and defend themselves from attacks. As the threat China poses to Taiwan grows, many see drones playing a crucial role in a potential conflict there as well. China’s leader, Xi Jinping, has tasked his troops to be prepared for an invasion of Taiwan by 2027. And with Chinese companies dominating the market and critical resources used in making drones, analysts say it is important for Taiwan and the U.S. to find ways to create a China-free supply chain. At a drone expo at National Taiwan University in Taipei this week, hundreds of Taiwanese producers met with several officials from the U.S. Department of Defense and Raymond Greene, director of the American Institute in Taiwan, which serves as the de facto U.S. embassy on the island. Patrick Mason, the deputy assistant secretary of the Army for defense exports and cooperation, and Andrew Hong, deputy director of the cyber portfolio of the Defense Department's Defense Innovation Unit, or DIU, spoke at the expo. Mason spoke about 'The Pathway to U.S.-Taiwan Defense Industrial Cooperation' and Hong’s remarks centered on 'Defense Innovation with Taiwan.' For U.S. drone companies, the forum offered the potential to expand business ventures with Taiwan and grow the bilateral trade partnership, according to a statement from the American Institute in Taiwan on Wednesday. Demand for drone technology in Taiwan is large, especially given China’s drone production prowess. Chinese drone company DJI held 76% of the consumer market for household drones in 2021. These drones have also been deployed on the battlefield in places like Ukraine and Myanmar, a practice that the Chinese government and DJI have condemned. Hsu Chih-hsiang, an assistant researcher at the Institute of National Defense and Security Research in Taipei, described drones as 'combat force-multipliers,' and explained that, even in peacetime, China has already begun sending large drones into Taiwanese territory and even uses small civilian drones to hover in Taiwanese airspace in the Kinmen Islands. In 2022, former Taiwanese President Tsai Ing-wen made the drone industry a development priority in Taiwan. Since then, Taiwan has established the 'Drone National Team' program, subsidizing domestic production of these systems. Taiwanese Minister of National Defense Wellington Koo revealed in mid-September that Taiwan would procure 3,422 units of six types of domestically produced military drones, including mini-drones, before 2028, and that Taiwan would also separately acquire two types of missile-type attack drones, totaling 976 units, before 2026, to enhance precision strikes and anti-armor capabilities. Wang Shiow-wen, who is also an assistant researcher at the Institute of National Defense and Security Research, said American support of Taiwanese drone modernization presents an opportunity for Taiwan to break through barriers in production capacity and ensure the security of the supply chain for drones. Taiwan’s government has set a goal for domestic manufacturers to produce 15,000 drones per month by 2028. That is three times current production levels, according to Taiwan’s government-funded Central News Agency. Ja Ian Chong, a political scientist at the National University of Singapore, said the three most important considerations for the U.S. and Taiwan in the future of drone production without Chinese components are cost, mass production capacity, and the impact that this might have on American and Taiwanese budgets, technology transfer and scientific development. China strongly opposes collaboration and engagement between Taiwan and the United States, and it was watching the gathering in Taipei closely. Chinese state media criticized the visit to Taiwan by the delegation of American companies and defense officials, as well as efforts to create a 'China-free' drone supply chain. Liu Heping, a Chinese commentator, said that by attempting to make Taiwan the 'democratic drone supply chain center,' the United States and Taiwan were preparing for a 'vigorous arms race' with China. Katherine Michaelson contributed to this report.	https://www.voanews.com/a/us-taiwan-look-to-boost-drone-collaboration/7802406.html	2024-09-27T15:54:51-07:00	
LGBTQ advocates struggle for visibility in Eswatini	MBABANE, ESWATINI — Eswatini Sexual and Gender Minorities, an LGBTQ advocacy group, was denied registration by authorities in 2019, and even after seeking relief from the Supreme Court, which had ruled the group must be registered, its efforts have been unsuccessful. Human rights lawyer Sibusiso Nhlabatsi said the harsh legal environment for LGBTQ individuals in the southern African kingdom causes significant problems. 'There is denial that they exist, so they do not have any form of protection as a group,' Nhlabatsi said. 'They only rely on protection from the law or enjoyment of any rights from the law as human beings under Chapter 3 of our Bill of Rights of our Constitution. So I can say it’s quite challenging, because there’s no instrument that seeks to protect them. There’s no instrument that seeks to recognize them as a group of people that exist. I don’t think there’s any progress that has been made.' Besides the lack of legal recognition, LGBTQ individuals in Eswatini often face discrimination in gaining access to services, high rates of intimate partner violence, and exclusion from public discussions. Sisanda Mavimbela, executive director of Eswatini Sexual and Gender Minorities, said the idea of LGBTQ rights is considered contradictory to traditional African values and religious beliefs, perpetuating a climate of exclusion and marginalization. 'The community cannot equally enjoy rights like all Swazis do, as per their birthright,' Mavimbela said. ESGM has been denied 'a right to associate, which is a right to all Swazis as per the Constitution.' Eswatini is also known by its former official name, Swaziland. In the LGBTQ community, 'justice comes hard and sometimes is not reached at all,' for what are usually quoted as 'non-African, unreligious or cultural' reasons, Mavimbela said. Colonial-era laws In refusing to register Eswatini Sexual and Gender Minorities, the government cited the country’s colonial-era laws, which still have a profound influence on the country’s legal framework. Registration of the group would allow it to operate as a nonprofit organization with the ability to, among other things, open a bank account and receive international funding. If the Ministry of Commerce, Trade and Industry continues to refuse to register ESGM despite the Supreme Court ruling, the court could issue a mandamus order requiring the government to carry out the action. However, no such order has been issued, and it remains to be seen if the court will do so. The ESGM case reached the Supreme Court after the group appealed a ruling by the High Court, a lower-level body. The appellants argued that the High Court had erred in law, and in fact, by stating that the applicants sought to create rights that don't exist. On June 16, 2023, a five-panel bench of the Supreme Court set aside the High Court’s decision to dismiss ESGM’s application to register as a nonprofit organization. But on September 27, 2023, the Minister of Commerce, Trade and Industry ordered the Registrar of Companies not to register ESGM, citing the organization’s name and objectives and asserting that it offends the customs and principles of Eswatini. Despite the opposition to LGBTQ rights in Eswatini, Bishop Zwanini Shabalala, the former secretary-general of the Council of Swaziland Churches, has called for understanding and acceptance of the LGBTQ community without discrimination. 'This is an area that still needs more and more dialogue in churches and in society. ... Our position as the church is that we should welcome everyone who comes to church and also advocate for access to services that are rendered by the country from government to all other institutions,' Shabalala said. LGBTQ citizens 'should also be treated like anyone else, without looking at their sexual orientation.' With little to no local support, the LGBTQ community finds solace and support in the Eswatini offices of the European Union and the U.N. Development Program. The EU and the U.S. Embassy to Eswatini backed LGBTQ residents throughout the court battle, and the development program continues to run dialogue sessions and workshops. The situation remains dire, however, as the community faces a lack of recognition, acceptance and equal rights.	https://www.voanews.com/a/lgbtq-advocates-struggle-for-visibility-in-eswatini/7802336.html	2024-09-27T14:40:09-07:00	
Exiled opposition leader: ‘We want Belarus to return to family of European countries’	New York — Among those in New York City for the 79th United Nations General Assembly is exiled Belarusian opposition leader Sviatlana Tsikhanouskaya. On Monday, Tsikhanouskaya and Evgenia Kara-Murza, the Russian human rights activist and wife of former political prisoner Vladimir Kara-Murza, received the annual human rights prize awarded by the Lantos Foundation for Human Rights and Justice, founded by the late Tom Lantos, who was the only Holocaust survivor ever elected to the U.S. Congress. Addressing the U.N. Human Rights Council in Geneva that same day via video link, Tsikhanouskaya said she was speaking on behalf of the more than 1,400 Belarusians imprisoned for political reasons by Belarusian President Alexander Lukashenko’s government. 'Many of them are held in complete isolation, incommunicado … no letters, no phone calls, no contact with the outside world,' she said. 'My husband, Syarhei, has been cut off for over a year. I do not know if he is alive.' Tsikhanouskaya was interviewed in New York by Victoria Kupchinetsky of Voice of America’s Russian Service. This interview has been edited for clarity and brevity. VOA: What is the purpose of you coming here to New York to the General Assembly? Sviatlana Tsikhanouskaya: The U.N. is a good platform where you can meet not only your allies, but also the countries who might be useful to your cause. We are, as Belarusians ... fighting for the restoration of democracy in Belarus, for the release of our political prisoners. And we are looking for world leaders who can somehow assist us with these questions. People in Belarusian prisons are dying. This is the most painful topic for us in the democratic movement. And I think that countries who still have some relationship with this [Lukashenko] regime, they can assist us in solving the humanitarian crisis. VOA: Why do you think Lukashenko released those dozens of political prisoners? Do you know if there are any negotiations about an exchange similar to the recent prisoner exchange with Russia? Tsikhanouskaya: Lukashenko wants to sell the release of about 100 people as an act of humanity. But it has nothing in common with this. I think this release is connected with the pressure that is imposed on Lukashenko’s regime. They want to have the sanctions lifted, they want to be relevant in the political world, but they are not. Our task is to make sure that the policy of our democratic allies will not change toward Belarus. And, of course, putting pressure on the regime, strengthening Belarusian civil society, agents of democratic forces. We are looking for venues how we can release political prisoners [for] humanitarian reasons. … People are dying. We are looking for countries, for organizations, that can be mediators on this issue. VOA: Are you collecting materials, evidence, against Lukashenko to present in The Hague, at the international tribunal? Tsikhanouskaya: I’m totally sure that in the world, justice has to be restored, and Lukashenko has a long list of crimes — crimes against humanity, crimes of the deportation of Belarusians, crimes of the abduction of Ukrainian children, the immigration crisis, the hijacking of airplanes, bringing our country into the war [against Ukraine], and so on and so forth. And, of course, for years we have been collecting evidence of these crimes, and we want to use international mechanisms — the ICC [International Criminal Court], ICJ [International Court of Justice, aka World Court] — [words indistinct] to bring Lukashenko and his cronies to account, though these instruments are rather slow, honestly speaking. But we are consistent in our approach, and hopefully very soon will start a special investigation against the crimes. VOA: What is the ultimate goal of your struggle — to actually remove Lukashenko from power or something else? Tsikhanouskaya: Our goal is to restore justice in Belarus, hold free and fair elections in my homeland, but I understand that we can’t do this while Lukashenko is there. So, our ultimate goal is to release political prisoners, hold free and fair elections, but before this, of course, we have to weaken the regime as much as possible and strengthen national identity, civil society, democratic forces, to have a smooth and fast transition period. And of course, we want Belarus to return to the family of European countries.	https://www.voanews.com/a/exiled-opposition-leader-we-want-belarus-to-return-to-family-of-european-countries-/7802307.html	2024-09-27T14:05:35-07:00	
African leaders at UN warn against dwindling malaria funding	Abuja, Nigeria — Leaders in Africa say the fight against malaria on the continent is facing significant funding gaps due to the ongoing global financial crisis and the impact of climate change. African leaders this week met in New York on the sidelines of the United Nations General Assembly and called for a concerted effort to avert a funding crisis they say could set back decades of progress in the fight against malaria. The African Leaders Malaria Alliance, or ALMA, which hosted the high-level meeting, said if malaria funding continues to shrink, there will be an expected additional 112 million cases and some 280,000 deaths by the year 2029. Africa already accounts for an estimated 236 million malaria cases — or 95% of the global total — and 97% of deaths. Nigeria accounts for nearly a third of that burden. Guinea-Bissau President Umaro Sissoco Embalo, who serves as chair of ALMA, said that Africa stands at a critical moment in the fight against malaria. 'We must act urgently to protect lifesaving malaria intervention,' he said. 'This is very important because our target is to finish with malaria in Africa.' Experts said Africa needs up to $6.3 billion in malaria funding annually to eliminate the disease and called for continued support for malaria financing within the global funding framework. ALMA also said the impact of climate change and growing resistance to insecticide and antimalarials are further hampering progress against the disease in Africa. Ngashi Ngongo, head of the Executive Office at the Africa Union, said, 'Achieving the elimination of malaria alongside progress toward other endemic diseases such as HIV and TB will lay the foundation for reducing Africa's disease burden and further propel the achievement of universal health coverage on the continent. 'This progress is essential for strengthening health systems, and it is a necessity as we prepare for future pandemics, which are inevitable,' he said. Following the World Health Organization’s approval last year, the first malaria vaccines are being introduced into routine child immunization schedules across Africa. And on Thursday in New York, Nigerian health authorities signed a deal with U.S.-based drone company Zipline to use artificial intelligence-powered drones to expand access to medical supplies, including blood and vaccines. Abdu Muktar, who is the national coordinator of Nigeria’s Unlocking Healthcare Value-Chain Initiative, commended the 'very bold agenda' for producing health care products locally. 'But now we also have to be able to deliver,' he said. 'What Zipline is doing is using technology to make sure you deliver. You'll be able to reduce wastage in whatever it is — vaccines, therapeutics. You'll be able to be accountable. ... You are able to reach more people.' In 2022, governments of malaria-endemic countries contributed about $1.5 billion toward combatting the disease.	https://www.voanews.com/a/african-leaders-at-un-warn-against-dwindling-malaria-funding/7802287.html	2024-09-27T13:39:35-07:00	
Zimbabwe currency plunges after central bank move to allow more flexibility	Harare, Zimbabwe — The value of Zimbabwe's gold-backed currency plunged 44% Friday on the official market. The sudden drop of the gold backed currency, known as ZiG, began Friday shortly after the Reserve Bank of Zimbabwe’s monetary committee met and bank governor John Mushayavanhu said that after looking at 'the recent macroeconomic and financial developments and economic outlook,' the bank was ready to 'allow greater exchange rate flexibility, in line with the increased demand for foreign currency in the economy.' Immediately after, the ZiG started trading at 25 to 1 U.S. dollar, down from 14, where it had been since it was introduced in April. Tapiwa Mupandawana, a Zimbabwean independent economist and doctoral student at Africa Research University in Zambia, said allowing the ZiG to plunge is an adjustment toward its real value and a reflection of the actual state of Zimbabwe’s economy. 'The value of a currency is the derivative of the productive capacity of the country,' Mupandawana said. 'So, in any case, you cannot have a stable currency if you do not have a stable economy.' Prosper Chitambara, senior economist with the Labor and Economic Development Research Institute of Zimbabwe, said the decision to allow the ZiG to drop could be positive for the economy and a sign the central bank is allowing market forces to play more of a role in determining the value of the country’s currency. '[It] should have some stabilizing effect on the exchange rate,' Chitambara said. 'I don't think it is going to have a major impact in terms of pricing on the economy, given that most businesses were already indexing their ... ZiG pricing based on the parallel market or based on the black-market premium.' The gold-backed ZiG is the sixth type of currency Zimbabwe has tried to use since the Zimbabwean dollar collapsed amid hyperinflation in 2009. After Friday’s official devaluation, the ZiG was trading at around 50 on the black market. Before Friday it was trading at 35 ZiG to 1 U.S. dollar.	https://www.voanews.com/a/zimbabwe-currency-plunges-after-central-bank-move-to-allow-more-flexibility/7802167.html	2024-09-27T12:33:43-07:00

US charges Iranians with hacking attempt to disrupt US election	WASHINGTON — The U.S. government said Friday it filed criminal charges against three members of Iran's Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps for hacking attempts aimed at disrupting the U.S. presidential election. The indictment is the latest effort by President Joe Biden’s administration to counter foreign efforts to interfere in the November 5 presidential election between Republican Donald Trump and his Democratic rival, Vice President Kamala Harris. The U.S. Treasury Department also said it was imposing sanctions on seven members of Iran's Revolutionary Guard Corps. Iran has previously denied involvement. The Trump campaign said in August it had been hacked by Iran but said the perpetrators were not able to get private information. Several news outlets have said they declined to publish internal campaign documents that were offered to them.	https://www.voanews.com/a/us-charges-iranians-with-hacking-attempt-to-disrupt-us-election/7802020.html	2024-09-27T10:26:48-07:00	
A defiant Netanyahu addresses UN General Assembly	United Nations — Israel’s prime minister told the U.N. General Assembly Friday that Israel is 'winning' in its fight against terrorists and their patrons in Iran who perpetrated the October 7 terror attacks on his country. 'I have a message for the tyrants of Tehran,' Benjamin Netanyahu said. 'If you strike us, we will strike you. There is no place – there is no place in Iran that the long arm of Israel cannot reach, and that's true of the entire Middle East.' He said Israel’s soldiers have fought with 'incredible courage and with heroic sacrifice' for the past 11 months. 'And I have another message for this assembly and for the world outside this hall: We are winning,' said Netanyahu. The Israeli prime minister took the stage to a mix of boos and cheers from the gallery, where some visitors are permitted. A stream of diplomats rose from their seats and left the hall as he strode onto the stage. But Netanyahu was not fazed. He said Hamas must go, and he would not accept their participation in any post-war Gaza governing structure. 'Just imagine, for those who say, well, Hamas has to stay, it has to be part of a post-war Gaza. Imagine in a post-war situation in World War II. Imagine allowing the defeated Nazis in 1945 to rebuild Germany,' he told the U.N. General Assembly. 'It's inconceivable. It's ridiculous. It didn't happen then, it's not going to happen now.' Turning to Lebanon, where there has been a dangerous and deadly escalation between Israel and Iranian-backed Hezbollah fighters in the past week, Netanyahu said Israel must also defeat them so thousands of Israeli citizens can return to their homes in northern Israel. 'I've come here today to say enough is enough!' he said. 'We won’t rest until our citizens can return safely to their homes. We will not accept a terror army perched on our northern border able to perpetrate another October 7-style massacre.' Shortly after Netanyahu spoke, the Israel Defense Forces hit what they said is Hezbollah's headquarters in Beirut's southern suburbs. The Israeli leader characterized the situation in the region as a battle between the forces of good and evil – Israel battling the evil forces of terrorism in the Middle East. 'Yes, we're defending ourselves, but we're also defending you against the common enemy that, through violence and terror, seeks to destroy our way of life,' he said. The prime minister condemned countries that have accused Israel of genocide in Gaza. And he sought to get ahead of possible arrest warrants from the International Criminal Court at The Hague – they have been sought by the chief prosecutor for Netanyahu and his defense minister Yoav Gallant over their prosecution of the war and civilian suffering, saying it all comes down to antisemitism. 'The real war criminals are not in Israel, they're in Iran. They're in Gaza, in Syria, in Lebanon, in Yemen,' said Netanyahu. Despite his hard line, the Israeli prime minister said his government wants peace. He pointed to the success of the Abraham Accords, brokered by former U.S. President Donald Trump, that led to peace pacts with the UAE, Morocco, Bahrain and Sudan. While landmark agreements, they are all nations Israel has never fought a war with. Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas addressed the assembly the day before Netanyahu and called for an end to his people’s suffering. 'Stop this crime. Stop it now. Stop killing children and women. Stop the genocide. Stop sending weapons to Israel,' said Abbas. 'This madness cannot continue. The entire world is responsible for what is happening to our people in Gaza and the West Bank.' Shortly before Netanyahu spoke Friday, Slovenian Prime Minister Robert Golob told the assembly that he had met two Palestinian girls – Sara and Rand – who told him they just wanted a normal life and asked for his help. He said he was fulfilling his promise to bring their message to New York. 'I want to say this out loud and clear to the Israeli government: Stop the bloodshed! Stop the suffering! Bring the hostages home and end the occupation!' Golob said to loud applause. 'Mr. Netanyahu, stop this war now!' he said, slamming his hand on the podium. Pakistan’s prime minister spoke just before Netanyahu. He said the war in Gaza is the 'systematic slaughter of innocent people.' 'We must act now and demand an immediate end to this bloodshed,' Muhammad Sharif said to applause.	https://www.voanews.com/a/a-defiant-netanyahu-addresses-un-general-assembly-/7802014.html	2024-09-27T10:14:01-07:00

Ethnic Chin refugees in Malaysia accuse UN agency of mistreatment	Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia — Ethnic Chin refugees from Myanmar in Malaysia are accusing the United Nations refugee agency UNHCR of abuse and of not providing necessary protection, potentially putting lives at risk. Hundreds of members of the Alliance of Chin Refugees held a demonstration Thursday outside the UNHCR office in Malaysia’s capital, Kuala Lumpur. Chins, most of whom are Christians, are an ethnic and religious minority in Buddhist-majority Myanmar who face repression that has led to violent conflicts there. In recent decades, waves of ethnic Chins have fled the country, many to Malaysia. U.N. figures from last month show there are about 27,250 ethnic Chin refugees and asylum-seekers in Malaysia registered with UNHCR. But James Bawl Thang Bik, chairman of the Alliance of Chin Refugees, told VOA on Thursday there are tens of thousands more who are not registered. He also said the UNHCR takes too long to make decisions for asylum-seekers who have applied for refugee status. 'The process can take years,' he said. VOA asked UNHCR Malaysia how long it typically takes for an applicant to get a decision on their case but did not receive an immediate answer. Further complicating matters, Malaysia has not signed the United Nations refugee convention and does not officially recognize refugees, viewing them as illegal immigrants. UNHCR registration provides some protection that typically prevents arrest, but the refugees are still not allowed to attend government schools or work legally — although many take off-the-books jobs, leaving them vulnerable to exploitation by employers, according to migrant rights groups. James Bawl Thang Bik said that after Myanmar’s 2021 coup approximately 50 ethnic Chin Myanmar soldiers and police officers fled to Malaysia because they refused to fight for Myanmar's military. He said some of them have been arrested and are in detention in Malaysia because they lack UNHCR documentation. 'If these former soldiers and policemen get sent back to Myanmar their lives could be in danger,' he said. 'UNHCR needs to prioritize these types of cases and register them quickly.' UNHCR documentation also gives refugees access to medical care at public hospitals for lower prices than what foreigners typically pay but the Alliance of Chin Refugees said asylum-seekers without UNHCR documentation frequently need medical treatment but cannot get it. 'The UNHCR needs to meet with these people immediately and give them the necessary status and documentation,' Bik said, mentioning cases of people with broken bones and serious infections. Responding to media inquiries after Thursday’s demonstration, the United Nations refugee agency released a written statement that said: 'UNHCR wishes to emphasize that we recognize the frustration felt by many refugee communities living in the complex protection environment in Malaysia where they lack legal status, are unable to access legal work or formal education. … UNHCR is doing its utmost to protect and assist refugees. This includes prioritizing protection and assistance interventions for highly vulnerable refugees.' Additionally, Bik said he has received reports about security guards outside the UNHCR office punching and kicking ethnic Chins trying to get in without appointments. UNHCR responded in its written statement saying it has 'zero tolerance' for this type of treatment but also said: 'At this time, we have not received any reports of abuse by security personnel from any individual refugee from the Chin Community.' The alliance chairman dismissed the UNHCR’s response as false. 'We have told them about mistreatment many times,' he said.	https://www.voanews.com/a/ethnic-chin-refugees-in-malaysia-accuse-un-agency-of-mistreatment/7801860.html	2024-09-27T08:43:40-07:00	
Trump to meet Zelenskyy amid tension, Republican criticism of Ukraine	Washington — Former President Donald Trump is set to meet with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy in New York on Friday, amid increased skepticism of U.S. support for Ukraine’s war efforts from the Republican presidential nominee and lawmakers loyal to him. Trump announced the meeting at a press conference Thursday, which was confirmed for VOA by Zelenskyy’s team. The meeting comes a day after the Ukrainian leader met with President Joe Biden and Vice President Kamala Harris Thursday to discuss U.S. support for the war in Ukraine. Tension has been brewing between the two leaders. Trump is known for his skeptical remarks on U.S. involvement in Ukraine and claims that he can quickly end the conflict by making a deal between Ukraine and Russia, if elected. During a campaign event on Wednesday, Trump slammed Zelenskyy for making 'little, nasty aspersions' toward him. He appeared to be referring to Zelenskyy’s comments in a recent New Yorker magazine article that Trump 'doesn’t really know how to stop the war even if he might think he knows how.' Trump suggested the Ukrainian leader together with the Biden administration are at fault for prolonging the war that followed Moscow’s invasion of Ukraine in February 2022. 'Biden and Kamala allowed this to happen by feeding Zelenskyy money and munitions like no country has ever seen before,' Trump said in North Carolina. He argued that Kyiv should have made concessions to Moscow before Russian troops attacked, asserting that Ukraine is now 'in rubble' and in no position to negotiate the war’s end. 'Any deal — the worst deal — would’ve been better than what we have now,' said Trump. The former U.S. president has repeatedly said he wants the Russia-Ukraine war to end but has not stated whether he wants Kyiv to win or keep all its territories. His position stands in contrast with that of Biden and Harris, who have championed American aid and military support for the embattled country. 'Ukraine will prevail, and we'll continue to stand by you every step of the way,' Biden said Thursday as he met with Zelenskyy at the White House. During her meeting with Zelenskyy, Harris, the Democratic presidential nominee, reiterated the administration’s support for Kyiv’s war efforts and underscored that it is up to Ukraine to decide how the war will end. Without mentioning his name, Harris criticized Republican vice-presidential nominee JD Vance, whose proposal to end the war would mean Ukraine had less territory and would not join NATO. 'These proposals are the same of those of Putin, and let us be clear, they are not proposals for peace,' she said. 'Instead, they are proposals for surrender, which is dangerous and unacceptable.' Vance suggested in a recent interview that Ukraine and Russia halt fighting and create a demilitarized zone at the current battle lines. Kyiv would need to adhere to a neutral status and stop its bid to join NATO. Zelenskyy, in the same New Yorker interview, said that Vance’s plan would 'give up' Ukrainian territory, calling Trump’s running mate 'too radical.' 'His message seems to be that Ukraine must make a sacrifice,' he said. 'The idea that the world should end this war at Ukraine’s expense is unacceptable.' Zelenskyy, who has been in the United States since Sunday to attend the United Nations General Assembly in New York, was scheduled to depart Thursday but extended his visit as Trump announced the meeting. Partisan politics On Wednesday, congressional Republicans loyal to Trump demanded that the Ukrainian leader fire his ambassador to the United States, Oksana Markarova, for organizing Zelenskyy's visit earlier this week to an ammunition factory in Pennsylvania, a hotly contested battleground state in the November U.S. presidential election. Zelenskyy met with the Democratic governor of the state, Josh Shapiro. In a letter to Zelenskyy, Republican House of Representatives Speaker Mike Johnson said the visit to the factory that made munitions for Ukraine was a 'partisan campaign event designed to help Democrats' that amounts to 'election interference.' The White House called Johnson’s letter a 'political stunt' and pointed out that Zelenskyy recently met the Republican governor of Utah, Spencer Cox, in a 'similar event.' Ahead of Zelenskyy’s visit, the U.S. administration announced $8 billion in new aid for Ukraine. In a statement, Biden said the aid includes a Patriot missile battery and missiles, as well as air-to-ground munitions and a precision-guided glide bomb with a range of up to 130 kilometers. The White House said no announcement was imminent regarding Ukraine’s request for weapons donors to allow Ukrainian forces to use the weapons to strike targets deeper inside Russia.	https://www.voanews.com/a/trump-to-meet-zelenskyy-amid-tension-republican-criticism-of-ukraine/7801726.html	2024-09-27T07:05:19-07:00

As Ukraine war enters a critical period, the EU moves ahead without the US	BRUSSELS — s the war in Ukraine enters a critical period, the European Union has decided that it must take responsibility for what it sees as an existential threat to security in its own neighborhood and is preparing to tackle some of the financial burden, perhaps even without the United States. EU envoys have been working in Brussels this week on a proposal to provide Ukraine with a hefty loan package worth up to $39 billion. It was announced by European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen during a trip to Kyiv last Friday. 'Crucially, this loan will flow straight into your national budget,' she told President Volodymyr Zelenskyy. 'It will provide you with significant and much-needed fiscal space. You will decide how best to use the funds, giving you maximum flexibility to meet your needs.' Zelenskyy wants to buy weapons and bomb shelters and rebuild Ukraine's shattered energy network as winter draws near. In international matters, particularly involving major conflicts, the EU rarely moves ahead without the U.S., but it hopes this decision will encourage others to come forward. Russian troops and an election close in Almost 1,000 days since their full-scale invasion, Russian forces are making advances in the east. Ukraine’s army has a shaky hold on part of the Kursk region in Russia, which has provided a temporary morale boost, but as casualties mount it remains outmanned and outgunned. On the political front, Zelenskyy hopes to secure support for a 'victory plan' that might force Russian President Vladimir Putin to the negotiating table. He’s trying to persuade U.S. President Joe Biden and other allies to help strengthen Ukraine’s hand in any future talks. But a U.S. election looms, and polls suggest that Donald Trump might return to the White House in January. Trump has been critical of U.S. aid to Ukraine. On Wednesday, he said Zelenskyy should have made concessions to Putin before the invasion began in February 2022. Most of the 27-nation EU fears that a Putin victory would lead to deep uncertainty. Russia’s armed forces are depleted and currently incapable of another war, but the prospect of a future land grab in Estonia, Latvia, Lithuania or Poland remains. Reworking a G7 loan plan The EU loans are part of a plan by the Group of Seven major industrialized nations to take advantage of interest earned on about $250 billion worth of frozen Russian assets, most of them held in Europe. These windfall profits are estimated at around $5 billion to $6 billion a year. The profits underpin the G7 plan. The EU would stump up $20 billion, the U.S. $20 billion, and Canada, Japan and the U.K. $10 billion together, for a combined total of $50 billion. The scheme expires at the end of the year, before the next U.S. president takes office. Now, amid differences over how long the Russian asset freeze should be guaranteed, the EU has decided to go it alone. Its offer of up to $39 billion in loans accounts for almost the entirety of the U.S. share as well. The U.S. wants to ensure that the assets are locked away for at least three years to guarantee the income. But EU member Hungary insists this should only happen in 6-month increments. Hungarian Prime Minister Viktor Orbán styles himself as a peacemaker and is too close to Putin for many of his partners' comfort. The other 26 EU countries feel they must move now because time is running out. Evolving alliance with the United States The U.S. election is just weeks away. The Europeans are wary of Trump’s unpredictability and are testing scenarios to help protect themselves from the kind of battering, like tariff hikes, their economies received during his past presidency. But they also see the Democrats as more inward looking these days. Biden’s Inflation Reduction Act left European leaders fuming over rules that favored American products. China and war in the Middle East are the foreign policy priorities of Democrat or Republican candidates alike, and for now the U.S. is in the grip of election campaign fever. The EU hopes that Vice President Kamala Harris, if she is elected president, would enter the loan program as previously planned and reduce the EU's financial burden. But that remains an open question for now, and EU members say Ukraine’s position is too precarious to hesitate. Political delays in the U.S. Congress last year over a $60 billion support package starved Ukrainian troops of weapons and ammunition for months, resulting in 'real consequences on the battlefield,' in the words of NATO Secretary-General Jens Stoltenberg. Pressing ahead on pressing needs Helping Ukraine in military terms is a challenge for the Europeans. They could not do it alone, and cannot match the U.S. transport, logistics and equipment superiority, despite progress in ramping up their defense industries to supply arms and ammunition. But the world’s biggest trading bloc does wield economic might. It has already given Ukraine about $132 billion since the full-scale invasion started. Within weeks it appears ready to provide tens of billions more, even though going it alone is not in the EU's DNA. 'I do not know what the Americans, the United States with the new presidency, will do or not,' EU foreign policy chief Josep Borrell said on Tuesday. But, he said, 'as long as the Ukrainians want to resist, we have to support them. Otherwise, we will make a historical mistake.' The Biden administration did announce Wednesday that the U.S. will send Ukraine a major military aid package, including cluster bombs and an array of rockets, artillery and armored vehicles. A U.S. official also said billions of dollars more in assistance would arrive over the coming months. Meanwhile, deliberations on the EU's share of the G7 loan package will be high on the agenda of a summit of the bloc's leaders in Brussels on October 17-18.	https://www.voanews.com/a/as-ukraine-war-enters-a-critical-period-the-eu-moves-ahead-without-the-us-/7801558.html	2024-09-27T04:56:58-07:00	
Israel to continue cease-fire discussions for Lebanon, Netanyahu says	JERUSALEM/BEIRUT — Israel will continue to discuss cease-fire proposals for Lebanon in the days ahead, Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said on Friday, as Washington warned that further escalation would only make it harder for civilians on both sides to return home. Israel's foreign minister on Thursday rejected global calls for a cease-fire with the Iran-backed Hezbollah group and pressed ahead with airstrikes that have killed hundreds in Lebanon and heightened fears of a regional war. An Israeli strike on Friday killed nine members of a family, including four children, in the Lebanese border town of Shebaa, mayor Mohammad Saab told Reuters. Israeli attacks have killed more than 600 people in Lebanon since Monday, the health ministry says. Hezbollah said it had fired rockets into Israel on Friday at Kiryat Ata near the city of Haifa some 30 kilometers from the border, and the city of Tiberias, declaring the attacks a response to Israel strikes on villages, cities and civilians. Though Israeli air defenses have shot down many of Hezbollah's rockets, limiting the damage they've done, the group's attacks have shut down normal life across much of northern Israel as more areas fall into its crosshairs. The Israeli military said it had intercepted four unmanned aircraft that crossed from Lebanese territory into the maritime space off the coast of Rosh Hanikra at the Lebanese border. The conflict between Israel and the heavily armed Hezbollah is their worst in more than 18 years and part of the spillover that has swept through the Middle East as a result of the Gaza War. Syrian state media reported that an Israeli airstrike on Friday killed five soldiers in Syria, where Israel has intensified a years-long campaign aimed at rolling back the influence of Iran and Hezbollah. The United States and France proposed on Wednesday an immediate 21-day truce across the Lebanese-Israeli border, and said negotiations continued, including on the sidelines of a United Nations meeting in New York. Netanyahu said on Friday that Israeli teams had meetings to discuss the U.S. ceasefire proposals on Thursday and would continue discussions in the days ahead, adding that he appreciated the U.S. efforts. 'Our teams met [September 26] to discuss the U.S. initiative and how we can advance the shared goal of returning people safely to their homes. We will continue those discussions in the coming days,' he said in a statement. On Thursday, after Netanyahu left for New York where he is attending the United Nations General Assembly, his office issued a statement saying the prime minister had ordered Israeli troops to continue fighting with full force in Lebanon. His statement made no reference to the comments of Foreign Minister Israel Katz, who on Thursday rejected ceasefire proposals, or other Israeli politicians who have echoed that position, saying only that there had been 'a lot of misreporting around the U.S.-led ceasefire initiative.' Blinken stresses importance of cease-fire Israel says its campaign aims to secure the return home of tens of thousands of Israelis who have been forced to evacuate areas near the Lebanese border over the last year of hostilities. Hezbollah began firing at Israel on October 8 as the Gaza war began, declaring solidarity with the Palestinians. Hezbollah has said it will only cease fire when Israel's Gaza offensive ends. In Lebanon, more than 90,000 people have been reported as newly displaced this week, according to the U.N. International Organization for Migration, or IOM, adding to more than 111,000 already uprooted by the conflict. The U.N. refugee agency UNHCR said 30,000 people had crossed from Lebanon into Syria in the last few days, 80% of them Syrians. Well over a million Syrians fled to Lebanon during the Syrian civil war that erupted in 2011. U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken told Israel further escalation would only make it harder for civilians to return home on both sides of the border, the State Department said. 'The Secretary discussed the importance of reaching an agreement on the 21-day cease-fire across the Israel-Lebanon border,' the State Department said in a statement on Thursday, referring to talks between Blinken and Israeli Minister for Strategic Affairs Ron Dermer. 'He underscored that further escalation of the conflict will only make that objective [of civilian return] more difficult.' The State Department added that Blinken also discussed efforts to reach a cease-fire in Gaza and steps that Israel needs to take to improve delivery of humanitarian assistance in the enclave where nearly the entire 2.3 million population is displaced and faces a hunger crisis.	https://www.voanews.com/a/israel-to-continue-cease-fire-discussions-for-lebanon-netanyahu-says-/7801552.html	2024-09-27T04:40:28-07:00	
Trump and Zelenskyy will meet as tensions rise over US backing for Ukraine	NEW YORK — Donald Trump is set to meet with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy as public tensions have been rising between the two over Ukraine's defense against Russia's invasion. Trump said Zelenskyy asked for the meeting. The visit is set for about 9:45 a.m. Eastern Time at Trump Tower in New York, less than a day after Vice President Kamala Harris, Trump’s Democratic opponent, met with the Ukrainian leader and expressed unwavering support. 'I look forward to seeing him tomorrow,' Trump said in a press conference Thursday. 'I believe I will be able to make a deal between President [Vladimir] Putin and President Zelenskyy, quite quickly.' The meeting is highly anticipated and comes as Election Day nears, with Trump and Harris taking sharply different positions on backing Ukraine in the third year of its war with Russia. Trump argues Putin would never have invaded had he been president while derisively calling Zelenskyy a 'salesman' for getting U.S. assistance for Ukraine. Trump has in recent days praised Russia’s historic military victories and insisted the U.S. needs 'to get out' and end its involvement with Ukraine. Friday's meeting almost wasn't scheduled despite Zelenskyy’s office saying something had been planned during the Ukrainian leader’s visit to the U.N. General Assembly, during which he is making his endgame pitch to allies. In an interview with The New Yorker magazine that was published earlier this week, Zelenskyy implied Trump does not understand and oversimplifies the conflict. The Ukrainian leader said Trump's running mate JD Vance was 'too radical' and had essentially advocated for Ukraine to 'make a sacrifice' by 'giving up its territories.' Trump ripped Zelenskyy and Ukraine on two separate occasions this week. Speaking Wednesday in North Carolina, Trump referred to Ukraine as 'demolished' and its people as 'dead.' 'Any deal — the worst deal — would’ve been better than what we have now,' Trump said. 'If they made a bad deal, it would’ve been much better. They would’ve given up a little bit and everybody would be living, and every building would be built and every tower would be aging for another 2,000 years.' Meanwhile, Harris on Thursday stood alongside Zelenskyy and said Trump's push for Ukraine to quickly cut a deal to end the war were 'not proposals for peace,' but 'proposals for surrender.' Trump on Thursday said he was not advocating for a surrender. While Trump and Vance have long been skeptics of U.S. backing for Ukraine, other Republican allies of the former president have backed Kyiv's defense against Moscow's invasion and argue supporting Ukraine is in America's interest. One ally of both Ukraine and Trump is Sen. Lindsey Graham, R-S.C. At a closed-door meeting Zelenskyy had with senators on Capitol Hill, also on Thursday, Graham stood up and said he had been talking to Trump about the Ukrainian president, according to a person familiar with the situation and granted anonymity to discuss the private meeting. Graham told those in the room he would talk to Zelenskyy privately about his conversations with Trump, the person said. As the meeting came to a close, Graham pulled Zelenskyy aside and the two had a private conversation. Graham is close to the former president, despite an on-again-off-again relationship, and has often played a role as an intermediary on various subjects. He did not respond to a message seeking comment Thursday.	https://www.voanews.com/a/trump-and-zelenskyy-will-meet-as-tensions-rise-over-us-backing-for-ukraine-/7801544.html	2024-09-27T04:23:53-07:00	
Is China-US competition driving the Africa proposal in the UN?	Johannesburg — This week at U.N. meetings in New York, the United States said that two African countries should have permanent seats on one of the world’s major decision-making bodies, the United Nations Security Council. For years, numerous African leaders have called for the continent to have representation on the U.N. Security Council, which since World War II has had just five permanent members: the U.S., France, the UK, Russia and China. This week, the top representative of one of those permanent seats, U.S. President Joe Biden, threw his weight behind the idea. However, there was one major caveat, which Kenyan analyst Cliff Mboya said is not going over well on the continent. The new African members would not have veto power on decisions. 'We’ve already seeing a lot of backlash… like this is a big joke, the question is what is the point in joining the Security Council if you don’t have veto powers, what are you going to do there?' asked Mboya. That could play in China’s favor, as it has long positioned itself as a fellow developing country and leader of what’s become known as the Global South, while disparaging the West for its colonial past, said Mboya, a postdoctoral fellow at the Center for Africa-China Studies at the University of Johannesburg. 'So I don’t think this helps the U.S. and the West in terms of perception and narratives, and it will only embolden African countries to lean more to the East because it just speaks to the hypocrisy,' he said. 'China’s been able to, you know, build this coalition of emerging and developing countries against the U.S. and Western-led world order.' But Paul Nantulya, a research associate with the Africa Center for Strategic Studies, said he thought the announcement was a 'win’’ for U.S. diplomacy and would mostly be welcomed by African nations as it opens the door to further negotiations. 'Regarding China, China has been very, you know, kind of like sitting on the fence. So rhetorically China has said all the right things, supporting Africa’s, what it calls Africa’s legitimate interests in the United Nations, including the United Nations Security Council,' he said. But its plan for that has been hazy, he added. 'When it comes to specific details, in terms of whether China supports permanent African representation on the council with veto power, when it comes to that China has not articulated a position.' Among those in New York this week calling for U.N. reform was South African President Cyril Ramaphosa. He said, quote: 'Africa and its 1.4 billion people remain excluded from its key decision-making structures.' U.N. Secretary-General Antonio Guterres has also called for reform, saying the UNSC hasn’t kept up with a changing world and Africa is underrepresented. Some African countries want veto power in the Security Council dispensed with entirely. If there is reform, and Africa gets the two seats on the Security Council that the U.S. proposes, key contenders could include the continent’s largest economy, South Africa; most populous country, Nigeria; or North African heavyweight Egypt, Nantulya told VOA. However, analysts say any future process of adding African countries as permanent members is likely to face hurdles, as there will be problems reaching consensus. Nantulya said some African politicians think it could even drive a wedge between countries on the continent. There are also concerns the U.S. statement could just be rhetoric — and so far no timeline has been given regarding the next steps. Under U.N. rules, any change to Security Council membership would need approval from two-thirds of the General Assembly, including all five permanent members.	https://www.voanews.com/a/is-china-us-competition-driving-the-africa-proposal-in-the-un-/7801507.html	2024-09-27T04:04:26-07:00	
Veteran lawmaker Ishiba set to become Japan PM	TOKYO — Former Defense Minister Shigeru Ishiba was set on Friday to become Japan's next prime minister after winning a closely fought contest in his fifth and final attempt to lead the ruling Liberal Democratic Party. The 67-year-old prevailed over hardline nationalist Sanae Takaichi in a run-off vote in what was one of the most unpredictable leadership elections in decades with a record nine candidates in the field. The leader of the LDP, which has ruled Japan for almost all of the post-war era, is essentially assured of becoming the next premier because of its majority in parliament. The scramble to replace current premier Fumio Kishida was sparked in August when he announced his intention to step down over a series of scandals that plunged the LDP's ratings to record lows. 'We must believe in the people, speak the truth with courage and sincerity, and work together to make Japan a safe and secure country where everyone can live with a smile once again,' an emotional Ishiba said in a brief speech to lawmakers after the result. Ishiba must quell anger at home over rising living costs and navigate a volatile security environment in East Asia fueled by an increasingly assertive China and nuclear-armed North Korea. His approach to diplomacy with Japan's closest ally, the United States, will be in focus given he has repeatedly called for a more balanced relationship. In his campaign, he also called for the creation of an Asian NATO, an idea that could draw ire from Beijing and has already been dismissed by a senior U.S. official as hasty. U.S. ambassador to Japan, Rahm Emanuel, congratulated Ishiba in a post on X saying he looked forward to working with him to strengthen the U.S.-Japan alliance. Ishiba entered parliament in 1986 after a short banking career, but his outspoken views have earned him enemies in the LDP. He was sidelined by outgoing prime minister Kishida, instead becoming a dissenting voice in the party who enjoyed broad support from the public and rank-and-file members. He has rebelled on policies including the increased use of nuclear energy and has criticized his party for not allowing married couples to use separate surnames. His contrarian views and spats with colleagues contributed to four previous failed leadership bids. He has said this was his 'final battle.'	https://www.voanews.com/a/veteran-lawmaker-ishiba-set-to-become-japan-pm/7801443.html	2024-09-27T01:00:54-07:00	
Dozens of children drown while bathing during 3-day Hindu festival in eastern India	PATNA, India — Dozens of children drowned while bathing in rivers and ponds in rituals that were part of a three-day Hindu festival in eastern India's Bihar state, officials said. Heavy monsoon rains recently had raised the levels of waterways across the state. At least 46 people, including 37 children, drowned in separate incidents across the state's 15 districts, a statement from Bihar's disaster management department said. Authorities have recovered 43 bodies so far, and the three missing people are presumed to be dead. During the annual festival, mothers fast for 24 hours for the well-being of their children. The women are sometimes accompanied by their children when they visit rivers and ponds for cleansing rituals. The festival concluded Thursday. The state government has announced a compensation of 400,000 rupees ($4,784) for the families of each of the dead. Deadly accidents like drownings and stampedes during religious festivals are common in India. In July, at least 121 people were killed after severe overcrowding and a lack of exits contributed to a stampede at a religious festival in northern India.	https://www.voanews.com/a/dozens-of-children-drown-while-bathing-during-3-day-hindu-festival-in-eastern-india/7801431.html	2024-09-27T00:19:22-07:00
