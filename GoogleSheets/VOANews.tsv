Pentagon chief calls on NATO partners to increase role in Europe’s defense	PENTAGON — U.S. Secretary of Defense Pete Hegseth has called for NATO’s European members to increase their role in the defense of Europe as the United States focuses on defending the alliance’s Pacific flank. It is a move that he says will likely require European allies to significantly increase defense spending from 2% of GDP to about 5% of GDP. 'We can talk all we want about values. Values are important, but you can't shoot values, you can't shoot flags, and you can't shoot strong speeches. There is no replacement for hard power,' Hegseth told reporters on Thursday at NATO headquarters in Brussels. Last year, NATO’s European allies collectively spent 2% of their GDP, amounting to about $380 billion, for the first time after setting a 2% defense spending goal in 2014. The U.S. currently spends about 3.5% of its GDP on defense. Canada, the other non-European NATO ally, currently spends about 1.4% of its GDP on defense. 'NATO is a great alliance, the most successful defense alliance in history, but to endure for the future, our partners must do far more for Europe's defense,' Hegseth said. He emphasized that deterrence of Chinese aggression 'in the Pacific is one that really can only be led by the United States.' He said the U.S. does not seek conflict with China, nor does it feel that conflict with China is inevitable, but he contended the administration must work with allies to ensure deterrence in the Indo-Pacific is 'hard power deterrence, not just reputational.' Russia-Ukraine war On Wednesday, Hegseth said keeping Ukraine’s pre-invasion boundaries is an 'unrealistic objective' in its war against Russian aggression, as was the expectation that Ukraine would join NATO. He advocated for a negotiated end to the war with security guarantees backed by European and non-European troops that would not include U.S. forces. German Defense Minister Boris Pistorius said Ukraine’s potential membership in NATO and whether it should concede any territory should not be decided before peace talks start, referring to Hegseth’s comments as 'concessions' made by the United States. 'Vladimir Putin responds to strength,' Hegseth said on Thursday when asked whether the U.S. was decreasing Ukraine’s leverage. 'No one's going to get everything that they want, understanding who committed the aggression in the first place,' he added, referring to Putin. NATO Secretary General Mark Rutte reiterated his support for higher defense spending and appeared to defend Hegseth’s comments on Ukraine not joining the alliance. Rutte said on Thursday that while NATO must 'make sure that Vladimir Putin never ever tries again to attack Ukraine,' he said, 'it has never been a promise to Ukraine that as part of a peace deal, they would be part of NATO.' The European Union’s top diplomat warned that any peace deal struck between the United States and Russia — without Ukraine or the EU — will fail. 'Trump says that the killing should stop. Putin can stop the killing by stopping bombing Ukraine. This is doable if there is a will,' said Kaja Kallas, the EU high representative for foreign affairs and security policy. She added that any agreement without Ukraine at the table amounts to appeasement. Kallas’ comments reflected those of many NATO allies at Thursday’s meeting following U.S. President Donald Trump’s call with Putin and Trump's signaling that talks on Ukraine between the two were imminent. After Thursday’s NATO ministerial gathering, Hegseth travels to Poland for what the Pentagon said will be talks with leaders about 'bilateral defense cooperation, continued deterrence efforts along NATO's eastern flank and Poland's leadership as a model ally in defense investment and burden-sharing in NATO.' Some information for this report was provided by The Associated Press, Agence France-Presse and Reuters.	https://www.voanews.com/a/pentagon-chief-calls-on-nato-partners-to-increase-role-in-europe-s-defense/7974207.html	2025-02-13T13:10:12-08:00	
Turkey awaits possible breakthrough in long war with Kurdish separatists	Kurds in Turkey are expecting their imprisoned leader to announce a ceasefire soon, ending decades of war between Kurdish rebels and the Turkish government.

Number of accused 'high-threat' migrants at Guantanamo Bay rising	WASHINGTON — The U.S. military is now housing about 68 detainees at its prison at Guantanamo Bay, Cuba, as part of an effort to assist the Department of Homeland Security with mass deportations. The commander of U.S. Southern Command, which oversees the U.S. naval base at Guantanamo Bay, shared the updated figure with lawmakers Wednesday, but said he could not yet provide details on how much it will cost to house the growing number of individuals. Admiral Alvin Holsey said those efforts include both the detention of individuals described by DHS officials as 'high-threat criminal aliens' and eventually holding up to 30,000 non-violent migrants slated for deportation. 'We're doing a phased approach,' Holsey told members of the Senate Armed Services Committee, adding that the base has the capacity now to hold about 2,500 non-violent migrants. 'We’re working with DHS to understand the flow of migrants,' he said. 'We’re not going to go to 30,000 unless we know that migrant flow will come. So, we're waiting at this point.' U.S. Transportation Command told VOA on Monday that there have been at least five flights of migrants to Guantanamo Bay, each aboard a C-17 or C-130 military cargo plane. Most of the flights, according to multiple officials, have carried between 10 and 15 detainees. Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem, who visited the prison facility last Friday and oversaw the transfer of the third flight of detainees to the detention center, has repeatedly described the men as 'murderers and vicious gang members' from Venezuela and as 'the worst of the worst.' In one social media post, Noem said that at least one of the migrants sent to Guantanamo Bay had confessed to murder, while others were wanted for attempted murder, assault, weapons trafficking and impersonation. One official, speaking to VOA on the condition of anonymity to discuss the deportation efforts, said that all of the individuals held at Guantanamo Bay have been issued final deportation orders. But DHS has not yet provided charging documents or other details regarding the crimes the detainees are accused of committing. On Wednesday, the American Civil Liberties Union, along with several immigration rights groups, filed a lawsuit against DHS, alleging the detainees being held at the Guantanamo Bay prison facility have been improperly denied access to lawyers. 'By hurrying immigrants off to a remote island cut off from lawyers, family, and the rest of the world, the Trump administration is sending its clearest signal yet that the rule of law means nothing to it,' according to a statement from ACLU lead attorney Lee Gelernt. 'It will now be up to the courts to reaffirm that the rule of law governs our nation,' he added. According to the ACLU and the other groups, one of the plaintiffs in the lawsuit, Eucaris Carolina Gomez Lugo, learned her brother had been sent to Guantanamo Bay only after seeing him in a photo. The group also said she was shocked to learn that the government was alleging he was a member of the Tren de Aragua Venezuelan street gang. DHS dismissed the lawsuit’s allegations. 'There is a system for phone utilization to reach lawyers,' said a senior Homeland Security official in a written statement shared with VOA. 'If the AMERICAN Civil Liberties Union cares more about highly dangerous criminal aliens including murderers & vicious gang members than they do about American citizens—they should change their name,' the official added, responding to the lawsuit only on the condition of anonymity.	https://www.voanews.com/a/number-of-accused-high-threat-migrants-at-guantanamo-bay-rising/7974147.html	2025-02-13T12:30:38-08:00

How new scanners at US-Mexico border detect fentanyl	The Trump administration is seeking Mexico’s assistance in stemming the flow of fentanyl across the border into the U.S. Last year, high-tech scanners were installed at a port of entry in Arizona to detect the illegal drug.

UN report: China expands forced labor in Xinjiang, Tibet	WASHINGTON — A newly released report from the United Nations’ International Labor Organization states that authorities in China are not only using 'vocational skills training and education centers' for forced labor in Xinjiang and Tibet, but also the large-scale transfer of 'surplus' rural workers to state-led labor programs across the country. China called the report 'baseless' and 'false.' Released Monday, the ILO report details how Chinese authorities have intensified efforts to investigate and monitor poverty levels, setting higher targets for cross-provincial labor transfers while pressuring ethnic smallholder farmers to cede their land to large state-led cooperatives. Framed as 'liberating' rural workers, the report said, this process has forced tens of thousands of Uyghurs, Tibetans and other ethnic minorities in Xinjiang and Tibet into industries such as solar panel production, battery manufacturing, seasonal agriculture and seafood processing under coercive conditions. The Xinjiang Uyghur Autonomous Region and the Tibet Autonomous Region are two of China’s five provincial-level autonomous regions. Both are located in the country's western regions. Two systems Adrian Zenz, a senior fellow in China studies at the Victims of Communism Memorial Foundation, described the report as 'very up to date' in its assessment of forced labor practices. 'The new report not only corrected previous conceptual errors [the 2022 version], but is very up to date in its assessment,' Zenz told VOA in an emailed response Wednesday. 'ILO attributed all forced labor in Xinjiang to the internment camps' in its previous report. Zenz noted that in February 2022, an ILO report cited observations by the International Trade Union Confederation, or ITUC, on forced labor in Xinjiang but inaccurately suggested that the region’s entire system of coercive labor was based solely on 'internment or ‘re-education’ camps,' or what Beijing calls vocational skills training and education centers, or VSTECs. The ILO’s latest report cites allegations from the ITUC regarding two major coercive labor systems operating in Xinjiang. The first involves the mass arbitrary detention of Uyghurs and other ethnic minorities in VSTECs, which have since transitioned to long-term imprisonment in regular prisons. Released detainees from the centers, according to the report, are often subjected to forced labor in industries such as textiles and electronics. The second system, as detailed by the report, involves the mass transfer of 'surplus' rural workers into state-led labor programs, moving them away from traditional livelihoods into industries such as solar panel production, battery manufacturing, seasonal agriculture and seafood processing. 'In recent years, based on an intensified campaign of investigating and monitoring the poverty status of millions of rural households, the authorities had raised targets leading to increased cross-provincial labor transfers,' the report states. 'At the same time, local authorities had ‘actively guided’ ethnic smallholder farmers to transfer their agricultural plots to large state-led cooperatives, thus ‘liberating’ ‘surplus’ rural workers for transfer into manufacturing or the service sector.' Coercive labor transfers in Tibet The ILO report also highlights concerns over government-mandated labor transfers of Tibetans. 'These policies would apply coercive methods such as military-style vocational training methods and the involvement of political cadres to have Tibetan nomads and farmers swap their traditional livelihoods for jobs providing measurable cash income in industries such as road construction, mining, or food processing, thereby diluting ‘the negative influence of religion,’' the report said. The ITUC estimates that labor transfers in Tibet have increased significantly, affecting as many as 630,000 workers in 2024. Incentives for local labor brokers and companies have contributed to this rise, reinforcing concerns that Tibetans are being forcibly removed from their ancestral lands and cultural traditions. International response In recent years, human rights organizations, government bodies and U.N. agencies have repeatedly called for accountability and transparency regarding labor conditions in Xinjiang and Tibet, urging countries and international companies to reassess their ties to supply chains linked to these regions. The United States has taken a strong stance against Uyghur forced labor with the Uyghur Forced Labor Prevention Act, which took effect in 2022. The law bans imports from Xinjiang unless companies can prove they were not made with forced labor, operating on a 'rebuttable presumption' that all goods from the region are tainted by forced labor. Additionally, the U.S. has imposed sanctions and export controls on Chinese entities linked to forced labor, reinforcing its commitment to human rights and ethical trade while pressuring Beijing to end coercive labor programs. While China has maintained that its policies are aimed at poverty alleviation and economic development, the ILO findings reinforce concerns that these initiatives are mechanisms of repression and control. The ILO Committee of Experts has formally requested China to provide detailed explanations and clarify the measures it has taken to address these allegations. The report concludes by urging Beijing to amend national and regional policies to ensure that ethnic and religious minorities are not subjected to forced labor under the guise of employment and deradicalization programs. China’s response Liu Pengyu, spokesperson at the Chinese Embassy in Washington, dismissed the ILO report as 'baseless' and labeled the information as 'false,' aimed at attempting to 'deceive the international community and disrupt the stable development' of Xinjiang and Tibet. 'Some forces keep spreading lies that there are 'forced labor' in Xinjiang and Xizang. The aim is only to smear China's image, denigrate the Chinese government's policies governing Xinjiang and Xizang [Chinese spelling of Tibet], interfere in China's internal affairs, and attempt to deceive the international community and disrupt the stable development of Xinjiang and Xizang,' Liu told VOA in an emailed response late Tuesday.	https://www.voanews.com/a/un-report-china-expands-forced-labor-in-xinjiang-tibet/7974064.html	2025-02-13T11:40:02-08:00	
AI-driven biometric fraud surges in Africa, fueling financial crimes	Nairobi, Kenya — A new report says the emergence of cheap artificial intelligence tools is leading to a wave of biometric fraud in Africa. The report says fraudsters are using AI to create fake documents, voices, and images that facilitate identity theft and financial crimes. In July 2024, Japhet Ndubi, a Kenyan journalist, lost his phone and could not trace it. He replaced the SIM card, bought a new phone, and went on with his life. Four days later, while on a lunch break, he received a text alerting him that he had sent money to a certain number. 'Now I am using a new phone. When I saw money was sent to a certain number, I was surprised because I have my phone here. I called Safaricom to inquire, ‘How come some money is sent to a certain number without my authorization?’ It's when they told me, ‘Are you sure you are not the one who has withdrawn? Because we see a transaction has been carried out and sent to this number, and we can see you have used your fingerprints to withdraw the money,’' he said. The fraudsters even took out a loan that took him months to pay off. Authorities never made an arrest even though his phone was recovered. Nudbi was a victim of biometric fraud — a type of criminal activity where someone copies another person's unique characteristics, like their voice or fingerprints, to impersonate them and gain access to their devices or financial accounts. Smile ID is a U.S.-based company with offices in Kenya that develops software to protect people’s privacy. A report it released late last month says cases of document forgery and deepfakes are on the rise across Africa, as are simpler phishing attempts — all in an effort to steal money from innocent victims. The Smile ID researchers found that fraudsters especially targeted vulnerable people in low-literacy regions through phishing, data breaches, and making purchases through illicit sources. Stolen data is then exploited to create fraudulent bank accounts to be used for money laundering operations. Joshua Kumah, a Ghanaian, received a fake text claiming that money had been transferred to his mobile banking account. The text led to him losing control of his account and SIM card. 'The person told me to follow a short code that the money would be transferred back to him, so I did that without paying attention to the details. So, by the time I realized it was already too late, I had already given him access to my sim card, so I had to report to cancel that sim card. So, I lost the money I had on that sim. I had to start all over again,' he said. Ndubi is still in shock at how his fingerprints were used to access money through his mobile phone. He says that has changed how he uses the device. 'I was very surprised that they were able to use fingerprints, and I kept asking the telecom provider how they were able to access it but they were not able to tell me. So, I even lost faith in the Mpesa mobile banking application; actually, I have never used it,' he said. To prevent fraud, authorities and businesses now sometimes insist that people present themselves physically and produce valid identification cards to prove their identities. As for average Kenyans, many are trying to avoid using mobile apps on their phones, and are checking with banks and telecom operators about any transactions made in and out of their accounts.	https://www.voanews.com/a/ai-driven-biometric-fraud-surges-in-africa-fueling-financial-crimes/7973925.html	2025-02-13T10:36:10-08:00	
US aircraft carrier collides with merchant ship near Egypt	WASHINGTON — The aircraft carrier USS Harry S. Truman was involved in a collision at sea with a merchant vessel near Port Said, Egypt, the Navy said Thursday. The collision occurred late Wednesday while both ships were moving. It did not result in flooding or injuries aboard the carrier, and there was no damage to the ship's propulsion systems, the Navy said in a statement. None of the crew on the merchant ship, the Besiktas-M, were injured either, according to a defense official who spoke on the condition of anonymity to provide details that had not yet been made public. The Truman, which is based in Norfolk, Virginia, deployed in September to the Mediterranean and the Middle East. It had just completed a port call in Souda Bay, Greece.	https://www.voanews.com/a/us-aircraft-carrier-collides-with-merchant-ship-near-egypt/7973912.html	2025-02-13T10:31:06-08:00	
15 wounded in grenade attack in French bar	French police were searching Thursday for an unidentified man who threw a grenade into a bar late Wednesday in the southeastern Alpine city of Grenoble, wounding 15 people, at least two of them seriously, according to health officials. Regional prosecutor Francois Touret de Coucy told reporters witness at the scene reported that shortly after 8 p.m. local time, the man entered the Aksehir bar in what the prosecutor described as a 'rough' part of the city, tossed in a grenade and fled, without saying a word. The suspect was also reported to have been carrying an assault rifle but did not use it. The prosecutor told the French news agency AFP there was no reason to think the attack was related to terrorism, but the motive is still unknown. He said they are exploring the possibility the attack was drug-related. French Health Minister Yannick Neuder spoke with reporters Thursday at the Grenoble University Hospital where many of the victims were being treated. He described the wounds as mostly 'cuts and organ perforations.' He condemned the attack, which he described as an 'an act of unimaginable violence.' Grenoble Mayor Eric Piolle also spoke to reporters Thursday, expressing his shock at the nature of the attack, calling it 'a new kind of violence.' He said he intended to discuss the incident and the general increase in violent crime with French Interior Minister Bruno Retailleau, who was reportedly due to visit the crime scene. The bar is in a neighborhood that was part of the Olympic Village when Grenoble hosted the 1968 Winter Olympic Games. Deputy Mayor Chloe Pantel told AFP the bar is 'a spot where locals and people from outside the neighborhood gather, especially to watch soccer matches.' Several Champions League matches were being played Wednesday night.	https://www.voanews.com/a/wounded-in-grenade-attack-in-french-bar/7973924.html	2025-02-13T10:29:16-08:00	
Zelenskyy rejects bilateral US-Russia pact to end Moscow's war against Ukraine	Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy said Thursday that his country would not accept any agreement on its fate decided bilaterally by Russia and the United States on how to end Moscow’s three-year war on Ukraine without Kyiv’s involvement. 'We, as an independent country, simply will not be able to accept any agreements without us,' Zelenskyy told reporters as he visited a nuclear plant on his way to the Munich Security Conference, where he plans to meet Friday with U.S. Vice President JD Vance and Secretary of State Marco Rubio. U.S. President Donald Trump spoke Wednesday with Russian President Vladimir Putin, and they agreed that negotiations to end the war should start immediately, with Trump suggesting the two of them might soon hold a summit in Saudi Arabia. Trump later talked with Zelenskyy and informed him of his discussions with Putin. On Thursday, Zelenskyy said, 'Today it's important that everything does not go according to Putin's plan, in which he wants to do everything to make his negotiations bilateral' with the U.S. Still, on Wednesday, Zelenskyy said after talking with Trump, 'We discussed many nuances, diplomatic, military, economic, and President Trump informed me of what Putin told him. We believe that America’s power is enough to, together with us, together with all partners, pressure Russia and Putin toward peace.' Zelenskyy said he talked with Polish Prime Minister Donald Tusk on Thursday, telling him that 'no negotiations with Putin can begin without a united position from Ukraine, Europe, and the U.S. I emphasized that Ukraine must negotiate from a position of strength, with strong and reliable security guarantees, and that NATO membership would be the most cost-effective for partners.' 'Another key guarantee is serious investment in Ukraine’s defense industry. I also warned world leaders against trusting Putin’s claims of readiness to end the war,' Zelenskyy said. Trump said, in all caps on his Truth Social media platform on Thursday, 'Great talks with Russia and Ukraine yesterday. Good possibility of ending that horrible, very bloody war!!!' Trump’s phone call with Putin came after U.S. Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth told other NATO defense chiefs that Ukraine’s goal of restoring its 2014 borders was unrealistic and that the U.S. does not foresee Ukraine joining NATO, the West’s key military alliance, as part of a negotiated settlement of Russia’s war on Ukraine. Moscow’s forces now hold about 20% of Ukrainian territory, including the Crimean Peninsula it unilaterally annexed in 2014. Zelenskyy said it was important for the United States and Ukraine to draw up a plan to end the war before talking to the Russian side. Ukraine has said it is working on a Zelenskyy-Trump meeting, but nothing firm has been announced. Zelenskyy said he did not discuss the possibility of NATO membership during his phone call with Trump, although he said he knew that the United States was against the idea. NATO’s 32-nation bloc says it is committed to eventual Ukraine NATO membership but not while the Russia-Ukraine war rages. Russian officials and state-backed media appeared triumphant after Wednesday’s call between Trump and Putin that lasted more than an hour. 'To us, the position of the current [U.S.] administration is much more appealing,' Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov said Thursday. Dmitry Medvedev, the deputy chair of Russia’s National Security Council, said in an online statement, 'The presidents of Russia and the U.S. have talked at last. This is very important in and of itself.' Trump in the past has declined to say he wants Ukraine to win the war against Russia. On Wednesday, after talking with Putin and Zelenskyy, he said, 'I’m backing Ukraine, but I do want security for our money,' with U.S. officials suggesting recently that Ukraine agree to supply the U.S. with rare earth minerals for manufacture of technology products in exchange for continued military support.	https://www.voanews.com/a/zelenskyy-rejects-bilateral-us-russia-pact-to-end-moscow-s-war-against-ukraine-/7973916.html	2025-02-13T10:26:11-08:00	
Trump hosts India's leader, pushes US defense, energy sales	THE WHITE HOUSE — U.S. President Donald Trump hosts Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi at the White House on Thursday, where administration officials say he will seek to boost U.S. defense and energy sales and further strengthen Washington’s relationship with the world’s most-populous nation as China flexes its muscles in the region. 'We will aim to build on defense sales to India to ensure they are prioritizing the use of American technology,' said an administration official in a briefing with reporters Thursday morning. As is custom when briefing journalists, the official is not being named. 'The president is also focused on unleashing American energy to the rest of the world and will prioritize India as a key importer of America's natural resources to power their economy,' the official said. 'The two leaders will discuss how we can improve our trade relationship that brings down our bilateral trade deficit and ensure an expanded fair-trade relationship.' When asked directly about New Delhi’s largest concern — of being caught in the wave of reciprocal tariffs Trump has recently imposed as part of an escalating trade war with the world — a second administration official said, 'What you'll see coming out of a meeting today is further momentum towards a solidified, fair — and I emphasize that word ‘fair’ — bilateral trade arrangement between our two dynamic and growing economies. And the hope would be to have such a deal in place in the calendar year 2025.' That official also touted announcements on 'semiconductors, critical minerals, supply chain resilience and diversification.' Modi said on X that he was 'looking forward to meeting @POTUS Donald Trump and building upon the India-USA Comprehensive Global Strategic Partnership. Our nations will keep working closely for the benefit of our people and for a better future for our planet.' Analysts say China also looms large in these talks, and the White House added that the two leaders would discuss the elevation of the Quad grouping of the United States, India, Australia and Japan. 'The sharp deterioration in India-China relations after the 2020 Galwan Valley incident,' in which Indian and Chinese troops clashed over road construction in disputed territory, 'undoubtedly encouraged New Delhi to be more enthusiastic about its strategic partnership with Washington,' said Daniel Markey, a senior adviser at the U.S. Institute of Peace. And India-focused analyst Rick Rossow at the Center for Strategic and International Studies told VOA about India’s goals. 'As President Trump kind of initiates a trade war against the world, India's got bigger stakes than a lot of countries do in that, and they need to make sure that the relations remain stable,' Rossow said. 'So, they want to be here. They want to be in front. They want to talk about things they can buy from the United States. They want to talk about policies they can resolve and try to make sure that things remain on an even keel, because this relationship, it's important for us. It's vital for India.'

Taliban chief claims Afghan governance rooted in divine commands	ISLAMABAD — The leader of Afghanistan’s governing radical Taliban has defended his policies, including banning female access to education and employment, asserting that they are derived from the 'commands of Allah.' Hibatullah Akhundzada's assertions came days after the chief prosecutor of the International Criminal Court announced he was seeking arrest warrants for the reclusive Taliban leader, holding him 'criminally responsible for persecuting Afghan girls and women.' A Taliban statement said that Akhundzada addressed teachers, staff and students at a public university in the southern province of Kandahar on Wednesday during his first known visit to a modern education institution, where he also discussed the significance of his edicts. 'The esteemed supreme leader stated that every decree he issues is based on consultation with scholars and derived from the Quran and Hadith [sayings of Islam’s prophet], and represents commands of Allah,' the Taliban chief was quoted as saying. Akhundzada seldom leaves his office in Kandahar and rules impoverished Afghanistan from there through numerous decrees he has issued over the past three years. He has barred girls from attending school beyond the sixth grade and blocked female students from accessing university education. Afghan women are banned from most public and private sector employment nationwide. They are not allowed to travel by road or air without a chaperone and cannot visit public places such as parks, gyms or beauty salons. The Taliban supreme leader stated in his speech on Wednesday that religious schools and universities are essentially the same and emphasized the importance of supporting and safeguarding both types of educational institutions in the country. 'Now it is your turn to make Afghanistan competitive globally with your knowledge and wisdom. Work hard so that foreigners come here to learn from you and use your knowledge to succeed globally,' Akhundzada said. 'Professors and students, you must acquire religious and worldly education but serve religion solely.' The Taliban government, not recognized by any country, has established dozens of new Islamic seminaries, known as madrasas, to promote their strict interpretation of Islamic beliefs and laws, according to observers. In his Jan. 23 declaration, ICC Prosecutor Karim Khan stated that his decision to seek Akhundzada’s arrest warrants was based on a thorough investigation and evidence collected. 'Our action signals that the status quo for women and girls in Afghanistan is not acceptable. Afghan survivors, in particular women and girls, deserve accountability before a court of law,' Khan said. The Taliban condemned Khan’s action as 'devoid of just legal basis, duplicitous in nature and politically motivated.' The international community has refused to accept the Taliban as the legitimate rulers of Afghanistan, mainly over their harsh treatment of women and other human rights concerns. The United States and other Western countries have slapped economic sanctions on the country and primarily isolated the Afghan banking sector since the Taliban takeover. Several senior leaders of the Taliban are still listed as terrorist entities by the United Nations. An international conference of Muslim leaders hosted by Pakistan last month condemned 'extremist ideologies' and religious edicts, known as fatwas, that are rooted in cultural norms obstructing girls' education as a 'grave misuse of religious principles to legitimize policies of deprivation and exclusion.' The conference declaration, without naming the de facto Afghan rulers, noted that anyone who rejects or opposes Islamic principles mandating equal education for men and women 'is considered outside the framework of the Islamic Ummah’s [Islamic world’s] concepts and cannot be regarded as part of it.'	https://www.voanews.com/a/taliban-chief-claims-afghan-governance-rooted-in-divine-commands/7973832.html	2025-02-13T09:30:34-08:00	
Senate panel advances nomination of Kash Patel, Trump's pick to lead FBI	WASHINGTON — The Senate Judiciary Committee voted along party lines on Thursday to advance the nomination of Kash Patel, Donald Trump's pick for FBI director, pushing past Democratic concerns that he would operate as a loyalist for the president and target perceived adversaries of the White House. The committee voted 12-10 to send the nomination to the Republican-controlled Senate for full consideration. It was not immediately clear when the final confirmation vote will occur, but so far even nominees once seen as having uncertain prospects — including new Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth and Tulsi Gabbard, the director of national intelligence — have been able to marshal sufficient support from Republicans eager to fall in line with Trump's agenda. Patel has raised alarm for his lack of management experience compared to other FBI directors and because of a vast catalog of incendiary past statements, which include calling investigators who scrutinized Trump 'government gangsters' and describing at least some defendants charged in the Jan. 6, 2021, riot at the U.S Capitol as 'political prisoners.' At his confirmation hearing last month, Patel said Democrats were taking some of his comments out of context or misunderstanding the broader point that he was trying to make, such as when he proposed shutting down the FBI headquarters in Washington and turning it into a museum for the so-called 'deep state.' And Patel denied the idea that a list in his book of government officials, who he said were part of a 'deep state,' amounted to an 'enemies list,' calling that a 'total mischaracterization.' Patel, who was selected by Trump in November to replace Christopher Wray as FBI director, would inherit an agency riven by turmoil amid the recent forced departures of a group of senior executives and by a highly unusual Justice Department demand for the names of all agents who participated in investigations related to Jan. 6. A letter this week from Senator Dick Durbin, the top Democrat on the committee, cited undisclosed sources in saying that Patel was covertly involved in that process despite telling the panel at his confirmation hearing that he was unaware of any plans to fire agents. A Patel spokeswoman called the allegations 'gossip' aimed at pushing what she said was a 'false narrative.' Democrats portrayed Patel as a dangerous and inexperienced loyalist who would abuse the FBI's law enforcement powers at a time when the country is facing an escalated threat including from China and international terrorism. 'This is a guy whose judgment is beyond questionable. It's appallingly bad,' said Democratic Senator Sheldon Whitehouse of Rhode Island. He added: 'Mark my words: this Patel guy will come back to haunt you.' Durbin told his colleagues 'we are inviting a political disaster if we put Kash Patel into this job.' Addressing Republicans on the committee, Durbin said, 'I know you want to vote for all these nominations. I know none of you want a call from Elon Musk reminding you what he might do to somebody who votes the wrong way, but this really gets down to the heart of the future of an agency that is critical to the security of this nation.' Republicans, by contrast, praised Patel as the right person for the job, insisting he was needed to fix an FBI that they claim has been tainted by bias amid criminal investigations into Trump. 'The American people are sick and tired of two tiers of access, tiers of treatment and two tiers of justice. And during the Biden years, this was writ large in the acts of the DOJ and the FBI,' said Republican Senator Marsha Blackburn of Tennessee. Senator Ashley Moody, a Republican from Florida, said that Patel 'might not have served in the upper echelons of the FBI, but aren't we asking this agency to set a new course? Don't we want a nontraditional candidate at this moment in time, with extensive federal experience?' A former Justice Department prosecutor, Patel attracted Trump's attention during his first term when, as a staffer on the Republican-led House Intelligence Committee, he helped author a memo with pointed criticism of the FBI's investigation into ties between Russia and Trump's 2016 campaign. Patel later joined Trump's administration, both as a counterterrorism official at the National Security Council and as chief of staff to the Defense Department.	https://www.voanews.com/a/senate-panel-advances-nomination-of-kash-patel-trump-s-pick-to-lead-fbi/7973808.html	2025-02-13T09:10:09-08:00	
Senate confirms Kennedy for top US health post after close vote	WASHINGTON — The U.S. Senate on Thursday confirmed Robert F. Kennedy Jr. as President Donald Trump's health secretary, putting the prominent vaccine skeptic in control of $1.7 trillion in federal spending, vaccine recommendations and food safety as well as health insurance programs for roughly half the country. Republicans fell in line behind Trump despite hesitancy over Kennedy’s views on vaccines, voting 52-48 to elevate the scion of one of America's most storied political — and Democratic — families to secretary of the Health and Human Services Department. Republican Senator Mitch McConnell, who had polio as a child, was the only 'no' vote among Republicans, mirroring his stands against Trump's picks for the Pentagon chief and director of national intelligence. All Democrats opposed Kennedy. The GOP has largely embraced Kennedy's vision to 'Make America Healthy Again' by directing the public health agencies to focus on chronic diseases such as obesity. Kennedy, 71, whose name and family tragedies have put him in the national spotlight since he was a child, has earned a formidable following with his populist and sometimes extreme views on food, chemicals and vaccines. His audience only grew during the COVID-19 pandemic, when Kennedy devoted much of his time to a nonprofit that sued vaccine makers and harnessed social media campaigns to erode trust in vaccines as well as the government agencies that promote them. With Trump's backing, Kennedy insisted he was 'uniquely positioned' to revive trust in those public health agencies, which include the Food and Drug Administration, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, and the National Institutes for Health. Last week, Senator Thom Tillis, a Republican, said he hoped Kennedy 'goes wild' in reining in health care costs and improving Americans' health. But before agreeing to support Kennedy, potential holdout Senator Bill Cassidy, a Republican a doctor who leads the Senate Health, Education, Labor and Pensions Committee, required assurances that Kennedy would not make changes to existing vaccine recommendations. During Senate hearings, Democrats tried to prod Kennedy to deny a long-discredited theory that vaccines cause autism. Some lawmakers also raised alarms about Kennedy financially benefiting from changing vaccine guidelines or weakening federal lawsuit protections against vaccine makers. Kennedy made more than $850,000 last year from an arrangement referring clients to a law firm that has sued the makers of Gardasil, a human papillomavirus vaccine that protects against cervical cancer. If confirmed as health secretary, he promised to reroute fees collected from the arrangement to his son. Kennedy will take over the agency amid a massive federal government shakeup, led by billionaire Elon Musk, that has shut off — even if temporarily — billions of taxpayer dollars in public health funding and left thousands of federal workers unsure about their jobs. On Friday, the NIH announced it would cap billions of dollars for medical research given to universities and hospitals to develop treatments for diseases such as cancer and Alzheimer's. Kennedy, too, has called for a staffing overhaul at the NIH, FDA and CDC. Last year, he promised to fire 600 employees at the NIH, the nation's largest funder of biomedical research.	https://www.voanews.com/a/senate-confirms-kennedy-for-top-us-health-post-after-close-vote/7973781.html	2025-02-13T09:05:28-08:00	
Vance visits Dachau concentration camp ahead of Zelenskyy meeting	DACHAU, GERMANY — U.S. Vice President JD Vance visited the Dachau concentration camp memorial on Thursday, walking the solemn halls with a group that included a Holocaust survivor once held at the site of so much suffering and mass murder and experiencing firsthand a powerful symbol of World War II. The tour came amid an ongoing war in Europe in which Vance is serving as a key conduit for the Trump administration. The vice president on Friday has critical talks with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy about the three-year Russia-Ukraine conflict. A light rain and sleet mix fell as the vice president and his wife, Usha Vance, spoke to a group of dignitaries near one of the concentration camp's gates. The couple then listened intently to details about the camp from its director and other museum officials. Among those participating was Abba Naor, a Holocaust survivor who was held at Dachau. The second couple, holding hands, eventually moved inside and to a long concrete room in front of a large map plotting concentration camps. The area was Dachau's administrative room. They next saw the intake room, where those interred arrived at the camp. It included a series of museum cases filled with personal belongings of those who were held there, like watches and government ID cards. 'That's where you started?' Vance said to Naor. Both Joe Biden, during the administration of President Barack Obama, and Mike Pence, in Trump's first term, also visited the Dachau memorial as vice presidents. Vance laid a wreath with a red, white and blue ribbon stenciled with 'We remember' and 'United States of America' embossed in gold lettering at a large sculpture known as the International Monument. Inaugurated in 1968, the monument was designed by Nandor Glid, who was persecuted as a Jew by the Nazis in his home country Yugoslavia and joined the resistance to Nazi occupation forces. On Friday, Vance and Secretary of State Marco Rubio, are set to sit down with Zelenskyy on the sidelines of the Munich Security Conference. They'll discuss Trump's intensifying push for Ukraine and Russia to begin negotiations to end Europe's deadliest conflict since World War II. Talk of the current conflict followed Vance getting a firsthand look at the memorial demonstrating Nazis' World War II-era atrocities and the U.S. and Western allies' slowness to take decisive action to confront Adolf Hitler and the rise of his violent nationalist ideology. Dachau was established in 1933, the year Hitler took power, as one of the first concentration camps. More than 200,000 people from across Europe were held at the camp, and more than 40,000 prisoners died there in horrendous conditions. U.S. soldiers completed the liberation on April 29, 1945. Vance, a Republican, is on a five-day visit to France and Germany, his first overseas travel since becoming vice president last month. The moment at Dachau gave Vance a chance to reflect on the scourges of war just as Trump is ratcheting up his efforts to end the current conflict between Russia and Ukraine. Trump on Wednesday spoke separately with Russian President Vladimir Putin and Zelenskyy. Trump said that he and Putin agreed it was time to 'start negotiations immediately' to end the war. And, as Trump announced his agreement on negotiations with Putin, U.S. Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth said that NATO membership for Ukraine was unrealistic and suggested Kyiv should abandon hopes of winning all its territory back from Russia and instead prepare for a negotiated peace settlement to be backed up by international troops. Trump subsequently said he thought that analysis was correct, and he was noncommittal about if Ukraine should be an equal partner if the U.S. and Russia engage in more substantive negotiations to end the war on its soil. Besides his talks with Zelenskyy, Vance is scheduled to deliver a Friday address to the security conference. The war in Europe and NATO members' defense spending are expected to be front and center for the world leaders gathering in Munich. Vance, like Trump, has been a sharp critic of U.S. allies' spending what the administration deems too little on their defense budgets. 'The Trump administration has been clear that we care a lot about Europe,' Vance said during a meeting this week with European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen. 'But we also want to make sure that we're engaged in a security partnership that's both good for Europe and the United States.' Over nearly three years of war, 50 countries, known as the Ukraine Contact Group, have collectively provided Ukraine with more than $126 billion in weapons and military assistance, including more than $66.5 billion from the U.S., which has served as chair of the group since its creation. Trump in his 2024 campaign derided the enormous amount of U.S. military aid poured into Ukraine and vowed to end the conflict within 24 hours of returning to the White House. Since his November election victory over Democrat Kamala Harris, Trump and his advisers have dialed back on their boldest timelines and set a goal of ending the war in about six months.	https://www.voanews.com/a/vance-visits-dachau-concentration-camp-ahead-of-zelenskyy-meeting/7973772.html	2025-02-13T08:52:16-08:00	
Ukraine, US weigh critical minerals agreement	Ukraine and the United States are considering a crucial minerals deal at this week's Munich Security Conference, according to officials from the two countries. After meeting with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy, U.S. Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent described the proposed agreement as a potential 'long-term security shield' for Ukraine when its war with Russia comes to an end. Zelenskyy confirmed that Ukraine had received the first draft of the agreement and expressed hope that a final deal could be reached in Munich. Ukraine aims to secure continued U.S. support as it tries to stand strong against the ongoing Russian invasion. U.S. President Donald Trump, meanwhile, has stated his desire to strike a deal for Ukraine’s rare earth mineral resources in return for continued U.S. backing of the Ukrainian war effort. 'I told them (Ukraine) that I want the equivalent [of] like $500 billion worth of rare earth,' Trump told Fox News in an interview aired Monday. Strategic resources in shifting global landscape Global competition for critical raw materials essential for industry has intensified in recent years. CRMs in demand include uranium, titanium, lithium, graphite, nickel and aluminum, as well as rare earth minerals used in an array of high-tech devices. Currently, China is the world’s top supplier of rare earth minerals. According to a recent World Economic Forum report, China supplies about 40% of the European Union’s demand for those resources. Other significant suppliers include Australia, South Africa, Canada and Brazil. The United States and the European Union have worked for years to reduce their reliance on China for the minerals. That’s where Ukraine comes in. The United States maintains a list of 50 critical raw materials, and Ukraine possesses at least 22 of the elements, according to Serhii Voitsehovskyi, a board member of Ukrainian mining investment company BGV. That includes significant deposits of rare earth materials, although the minerals are so far mostly untapped due to the war and a lack of sufficient geological data. Proven reserves include some of the world’s largest deposits of graphite, uranium, titanium and lithium — materials essential for many industries, including renewable energy and defense. 'We have the largest lithium deposits in Europe and significant uranium reserves, which are becoming increasingly valuable as nuclear energy experiences a global resurgence,' Voitsehovskyi said. Roman Opimakh, former general director of the Ukrainian Geological Survey, said that the U.S. has become increasingly desperate for reliable sources of CRMs. 'Over the past few years, the U.S. has seen a 24% reduction in CRM production,' he told VOA. 'At the same time, China has moved to ban direct exports of certain materials, favoring value-added products instead. This creates an urgent need for alternative sources, and Ukraine is well-positioned to fill this gap.' Geological diversity The World Economic Forum estimates that Ukraine's rich geological diversity ranks it among the world’s top 10 mineral resource suppliers, holding about 5% of global reserves. China’s dominance in CRM markets stems from decades of strategic investment. Ukraine hopes to develop a similar long-term vision, using its resources to bolster its economy and enhance integration with Western economies. 'For Ukraine, developing this sector is not just about exports — it’s about building a strong local economy that provides jobs and stability. For our international partners, it’s about securing a reliable and democratic source of these essential materials,' Voitsehovskyi said. The continuing Russian invasion — and any peace deal that left Russia in control of Ukraine’s eastern provinces — might complicate those plans. Opimakh says five to 10 key deposits of critical raw materials are in areas occupied by Russian troops. 'These deposits have reserves, proven reserves,' he said. 'Among them are earth elements and lithium, at least, and manganese.' However, he added, 'a majority of critical minerals are located in territory controlled by the Ukrainian government.' Ukraine’s CRM industry needs development Historically, Ukraine has been a significant player in the mining industry, with substantial operations in coal, iron and other commodities. However, the country’s CRM sector is still in its early stages. Unlike established industries, the development of CRM mining requires advanced exploration and processing technologies, areas in which Ukraine is seeking international investment and expertise. 'Mining and processing CRMs in Ukraine can have a transformative effect on Ukraine's economy, providing jobs, infrastructure development and technological advancements,' Opimakh said. 'At the same time, it enhances global security by reducing dependence on a single supplier.' BGV has already invested $100 million in CRM projects; however, Voitsehovskyi said that scaling up operations requires additional financing. 'Developing a graphite mining project in Balakhivka (Kirovohrad region), for example, requires approximately $450 million in capital expenditures,' he said. As Ukraine seeks to establish itself as a key player in the CRM sector, partnerships with the U.S. and other Western countries will be essential, analysts say. The partnerships would be strategic as well as economic; they would ensure a stable and diversified supply of critical materials for the global market while strengthening Ukraine’s post-war recovery and economic growth resilience. 'We believe in a win-win strategy. Ukraine has the resources, and our partners require these materials. Together, we can develop a sustainable, high-value industry that benefits everyone,' Voitsehovskyi said.

Thai lawyers' council to investigate alleged killing by soldiers	Bangkok — An influential lawyers’ association in Thailand said Thursday it is launching an investigation into the alleged killing of a Myanmar man by Thai soldiers last year, a move it says could lead to lawsuits against any officers involved. The Lawyers Council of Thailand, which accredits the country’s attorneys, announced the probe after accepting a formal complaint about the case from Fortify Rights, an international advocacy group that previously carried out an investigation into the case. In a report published last year, Fortify Rights alleged that three unidentified soldiers brutally beat Aung Ko Ko to death with bamboo rods in Baan Tai village, near the Myanmar border, on January 12, 2024, after disputing his membership in a security patrol team made up of local civilians. The courts never charged any soldiers in the case, but convicted another civilian and Myanmar national, Sirachuch, who goes by one name, with manslaughter in September. Fortify Rights claims Sirachuch is being used as a scapegoat. Sirachuch has said he saw the soldiers attack Aung Ko Ko. 'After the Lawyers Council has taken the complaint, we will then investigate the nature and circumstances of the death of Aung Ko Ko. After that, we will take appropriate legal action,' Council President Wichien Chubthaisong told a press conference in Bangkok announcing the move. 'We will set up a subcommittee to conduct a fact-finding operation, hoping this will lead to the consideration of legal aid services and ensure that justice prevails for the family of Aung Ko Ko,' he added. 'Everyone has the right to have their human rights protected and respected under the law. Citizens in general should not be punished arbitrarily,' the chairman said. Afterward, Wichien told VOA the evidence that Fortify Rights has gathered implicating the army appeared credible and that the council could pursue civil or criminal charges against any soldiers it identifies as suspects. 'With credible evidence and a strong case, I think what we can continue to do is to prosecute other people involved in this case,' he said. Neither the Royal Thai Armed Forces nor the Royal Thai Police, which investigated Aung Ko Ko’s death last year and filed the charges that led to Sirachuch’s conviction, replied to VOA’s requests for comment. Fortify Rights says the army has denied any responsibility for Aung Ko Ko’s death, both to local media and a House of Representatives committee hearing, claiming he was tortured on the Myanmar side of the border before his body was dumped on Thai soil. The rights group denies the army’s claim and says it undermines the authorities’ case against Sirachuch, which rests on Thailand having jurisdiction over an attack by Sirachuch on Aung Ko Ko in Thailand. Sirachuch, who is now serving a prison sentence of three years and four months, confessed to striking Aung Ko Ko once on the back and twice on the shins. Fortify Rights, though, says that falls well short of manslaughter. It says the post-mortem report by the hospital that examined Aung Ko Ko’s body states he died of 'head injuries caused by physical assault,' and that three eyewitnesses to the attack, Sirachuch included, claim it was the soldiers who beat Aung Ko Ko on the head. 'This is a grave miscarriage of justice at multiple levels and we are very heartened to see Thai leaders like Dr. Wichien willing to take a closer look at this case,' Fortify Rights CEO Matthew Smith said at Thursday’s press conference. Afterward, Smith said his group pursued the council’s help because of its influence and connections with Thai authorities, especially its links to the Department of Special Investigation, or DSI. The department is a special Ministry of Justice unit that investigates some of the country’s highest profile and sensitive cases, including those that may involve public corruption and abuse of power. Wichien is on the department’s board of special cases, which guides its work and is chaired by Prime Minister Paetongtarn Shinawatra. 'So, the fact that the Lawyers Council is willing to take a closer look at this case, we hope, is one important step closer to DSI also doing a formal investigation,' Smith told VOA. 'This is the type of situation where DSI can get involved and actually uncover the truth and ensure actual justice takes place,' he added. 'In some ways, DSI can unravel coverups, and DSI has the skills and ability and the influence and power to ensure justice in these really difficult cases.' In its report on Aung Ko Ko’s death, Fortify Rights says it interviewed 23 people during its investigation, including witnesses, acquaintances and relatives, and spoke with local police. It says he had been living in Thailand for many years and was a well-known member of the community’s civilian security team, known locally as Chor Ror Bor, which is trained and organized by Thai authorities. The report says the soldiers who detained Aung Ko Ko the day he died, and who later beat him, disputed his membership in the team, even after other members arrived to vouch for him. After the attack, it adds, Aung Ko Ko, badly bruised and bloodied, was being helped to the Myanmar border by other locals, on orders from the soldiers, when he collapsed and died of his wounds.	https://www.voanews.com/a/thai-lawyers-council-to-investigate-alleged-killing-by-soldiers/7973681.html	2025-02-13T07:43:51-08:00	
Archaeologists unearth remains of Roman basilica on site of new London skyscraper	LONDON — Work to give 21st-century London yet another skyscraper has uncovered traces — in fact chunks — of the city's origins almost 2,000 years ago. Archaeologists exploring the site of a planned 32-story office tower announced Thursday that they have unearthed the remains of a Roman basilica that once stood at the heart of the city known as Londinium. Excavations in the basement of a building slated to be demolished for the tower at 85 Gracechurch St. uncovered flint, brick and ragstone walls and foundations, up to 1 meter (over 3 feet) wide, 4 meters (13 feet) deep and two millennia old. Sophie Jackson of Museum of London Archaeology called it 'one of the most significant discoveries' in years in London's oldest quarter, the City – the square-mile financial district where modern glass high-rises stand atop the remnants of Victorian, medieval and even earlier structures. What's been uncovered are the foundations of a two-story building, almost as big as an Olympic swimming pool. It was constructed between 78 and 84 A.D., about three decades after Roman troops invaded Britain and some 20 years after forces of the Celtic warrior queen Boudicca sacked the fledgling settlement. The basilica was part of the forum — the social, political and commercial heart of Roman London — where people went to shop, mingle, seek justice and hear the latest edicts from political leaders. The newly discovered remains are believed to form part of the tribunal, a raised area of the forum where politicians and officials made decisions about the city's governance. It's the 'beating heart of the city,' said Andrew Henderson-Schwartz, head of public impact at Museum of London Archaeology. 'It kind of towers above the city. And so it's a real symbol of Roman power and authority. 'We're talking about the early stages of London here, but it's a real sign of investment in the city, even in its early infancy,' he said. Developer Hertshten Properties, which owns the site and has planning permission for a new office tower, has agreed to incorporate the remains into its plans and put them on display in a visitor center. Henderson-Schwartz said the extent of the 'absolutely massive' foundations discovered in several test pits suggests an 'extraordinary' level of preservation. Further digging could answer intriguing questions, including why the original forum was only used for 20 years before being replaced by a much larger one, which remained in use until the collapse of Roman rule in Britain three centuries later. Items such as writing tablets, styluses, and even ancient trash could give glimpses into the daily lives of Roman Londoners. Property developers in Britain routinely have to consult archaeologists as part of their planning process, a practice that has uncovered finds from Saxon jewelry to medieval ice skates to the skeletons of 14th-century plague victims. The latest discovery adds to the scant traces of Roman London that can be seen around the city, including a section of ancient wall, a portion of amphitheater beneath the Guildhall and a temple to the god Mithras which lies incongruously under the modern headquarters of information company Bloomberg. 'We do have these little windows into Roman London that are all over the city,' Henderson-Schwartz said. 'But this is really in some ways the site that connects them all together. This is the heart of Rome in London, where all the decisions were made.'	https://www.voanews.com/a/archaeologists-unearth-remains-of-roman-basilica-on-site-of-new-london-skyscraper-/7973638.html	2025-02-13T07:42:14-08:00

UNICEF says armed men in eastern DR Congo raped hundreds of children	Dakar, Senegal — Armed men in the eastern Democratic Republic of Congo raped hundreds of children and recruited child soldiers at unprecedented levels, the U.N. children's fund said Thursday, as the conflict in the mineral-rich region intensified in recent weeks. 'In the North and South Kivu provinces, we are receiving horrific reports of grave violations against children by parties to the conflict, including rape and other forms of sexual violence at levels surpassing anything we have seen in recent years,' UNICEF's Executive Director Catherine Russell said in a statement. 'One mother recounted to our staff how her six daughters, the youngest just 12 years old, were systematically raped by armed men while searching for food,' Russell added. More than 100 armed groups are vying for control of Congo's mineral-rich east in a decades-long conflict that has created one of the world's largest humanitarian crises. The M23 rebels — the most prominent armed group in the region— captured Goma, the region's largest city, in late January in a major escalation of the yearslong fighting with government forces. During the week of Jan. 27 to Feb. 2, health facilities in the restive region reported 572 rape cases, a more than fivefold increase compared to the previous week, Lianne Gutcher, Chief of Communications at UNICEF in the Democratic Republic of Congo, told The Associated Press. 170 of those treated were children, she added. Armed men perpetrated the rapes but it was unclear what specific armed group or army they belonged to, Gutcher said. 'It is suspected that all parties to the conflict committed sexual violence,' she added. Last week, the United Nations Human Rights Council launched a commission that will investigate the atrocities, including rapes and summary executions, committed by both Congo's army and M23 in eastern Congo since the beginning of the year. On Monday, 84 Congolese soldiers accused of murder, rape and other crimes against civilians in the country's conflict-battered east were put on trial.	https://www.voanews.com/a/unicef-says-armed-men-in-eastern-dr-congo-raped-hundreds-of-children/7973628.html	2025-02-13T07:04:54-08:00	
Pakistan, Turkey to boost strategic ties	ISLAMABAD — Pakistan and Turkey pledged to deepen cooperation in defense, mining, energy and other sectors during the seventh round of the Pakistan-Turkey High Level Strategic Cooperation Council in Islamabad on Thursday. Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan co-chaired the highest-level bilateral discussion forum with Pakistani Prime Minister Shahbaz Sharif. After the closed-door delegation-level talks Thursday, the two sides exchanged 24 signed documents, including a joint declaration, a few agreements, and several memoranda of understanding. 'We have agreed to further strengthen our relations,' Erdogan said in remarks broadcast live after the talks. The text of the joint declaration was not released. However, a brief statement from Pakistan’s Ministry of Foreign Affairs said it 'gives a roadmap for further deepening, diversifying and institutionalizing the strategic partnership between Pakistan and Turkey.' Sharif and Pakistani President Asif Ali Zardari welcomed the Turkish leader Wednesday night at a military airbase near the capital with much fanfare. From a 21-gun salute to a fighter jet flyby and traditional Pakistani dancers on the motorcade’s route, to a special song honoring Erdogan blaring across TV channels, Islamabad pulled out all the stops for the Turkish president, who returned after five years for a brief visit ending Thursday night. Broad cooperation Both sides agreed to cooperate in air force electronic warfare and to collaborate on defense production, with a memorandum of understanding, or MoU, signed between Turkey’s Secretariat of Defense Industries and Pakistan’s Ministry of Defense Production and another MoU between Turkey’s state-owned Aerospace Industries and Pakistan’s Naval Research and Development Institute. Over the last decade Pakistan and Turkey have ramped up defense production cooperation. That cooperation includes joint production of four MILGEM corvette warships for delivery to Pakistan, helping the South Asian country upgrade its aging fighter jet fleet, and the sharing and transfer of defense technologies. Pakistan and Turkey also agreed to upgrade their existing trade agreement and reiterated a past pledge to boost annual bilateral trade volume to $5 billion from roughly $1.5 billion. In May 2023, the two signed a Preferential Trade Agreement, reducing Pakistani tariffs on 130 product categories, while Turkey cut down tariffs on 261 product lines. Sharif announced Turkish firms will build a special economic zone in Pakistan for industrial production, despite Pakistan’s struggle to attract investment to special economic zones set up as part of the China-Pakistan Economic Corridor. Both sides agreed on a protocol to amend their existing agreement of cooperation in the field of hydrocarbons and signed an MoU to help Pakistan’s energy transition. The South Asian country is aiming to decrease reliance on expensive foreign fuel and transition to affordable and abundant green energy. Pakistan reached an MoU with Turkey on mining cooperation as well, a sector Islamabad is anxious to bring foreign investment to. Under the bilateral strategic cooperation council, six joint standing committees cover a broad array of sectors, including trade, investment, banking, finance, culture, tourism, energy, defense, agriculture, transportation, communication, IT, health, science and technology, and education. Both sides signed cooperation documents in almost all the fields. In his brief remarks after the talks, Sharif pledged to fight terrorism jointly with Turkey. The Pakistani leader then singled out Afghanistan as a source of the violence. 'Afghanistan is a neighboring country, and we expect that Afghanistan will cooperate in fighting terrorism and not spreading terrorism and in that we are together,' Sharif said. Although Erdogan expressed support for Pakistan’s fight against terrorism in his remarks, the Turkish leader stopped short of naming Afghanistan as a root cause. Afghanistan’s Taliban rulers reject accusation of harboring anti-Pakistan fighters on their soil. Critical timing The two allies held their highest-level dialogue at a critical time in the Middle East. 'We discussed not only our bilateral relations but also regional and global developments extensively,' Erdogan said. The fall of Bashar al-Assad's regime in Syria has strengthened Ankara’s position in the region, but it has also put Turkey in direct competition with Israel, whose troops have advanced into Syrian territory. 'Turkey understands that increasing defense and strategic ties with countries like Pakistan, another established middle-sized defense power, are even more for interest for Turkey,' Umer Karim, a researcher at the University of Birmingham, told VOA. 'Sharing bilateral defense production technologies and learning is a key aspect,' Karim said. The civil war in Syria also has deeply affected militancy in Pakistan and Afghanistan. Fighters from those countries fought alongside Syrian militias. But Islamic State Khorasan, or ISIS-K, a regional offshoot of the terror outfit IS, has brought more violence to the two South Asian neighbors. With Hayat Tahrir Al-Sham, or HTS, a U.S.-designated foreign terrorist organization, now controlling Syria, security observers say Ankara and Islamabad need help from each other to manage nonstate actors. 'With Shia militias and movement from various nonstate actors, from Sunni militias moving into Syria as well, and now that the conflict has subsided, their ultimate return and its impact on the region is going to play a tremendous amount of role,' Iftikhar Firdaus, editor of The Khorasan Diary, told VOA. The online platform monitors militant activity. A delegation of Turkish corporate leaders joined Erdogan on the visit to boost trade ties with Pakistan. Sharif and Erdogan also addressed the Pakistan-Turkey Business Forum in Islamabad on Thursday. 'Turkey can explore Pakistan in two ways,' Khurram Schehzad, advisor to Pakistan’s finance minister, told VOA. 'One is as an investment corridor; the second is that Pakistan can become Turkey’s export hub into the Asia-Pacific region.' Schehzad acknowledged that despite deep strategic and people-to-people ties, Pakistan and Turkey have failed to develop a strong economic relationship. 'What I would like to have is, how the follow-up is done post-MoUs and how that MoU is converted into value,' Schehzad said. The previous session of the Pakistan-Turkey High Level Strategic Cooperation Council was held in Islamabad in February 2020.	https://www.voanews.com/a/pakistan-turkey-to-boost-strategic-ties/7973580.html	2025-02-13T06:48:11-08:00	
China's fuel demand may have passed its peak, IEA says	London — China's demand for road and air transport fuels may have passed its peak, the International Energy Agency (IEA) said Thursday, citing data showing that the country's consumption of gasoline, gasoil and jet fuel declined marginally in 2024. Combined consumption of the three fuels in China last year was at 8.1 million barrels per day (bpd), which was 200,000 bpd lower than in 2021 and only narrowly above 2019 levels, the IEA said in a monthly report. 'This strongly suggests that fuel use in the country has already reached a plateau and may even have passed its peak,' it said. After decades of leading global oil demand growth, China's contribution is sputtering as it faces economic challenges as well as making a shift to electric vehicles (EVs). The decline in China's fuel demand is likely to accelerate over the medium term, which would be enough to generate a plateau in total China oil demand this decade, according to the Paris-based IEA. 'This remarkable slowdown in consumption growth has been achieved by a combination of structural changes in China's economy and the rapid deployment of alternative transportation technologies,' the IEA said. A slump in China’s construction sector and weaker consumer spending reduced fuel demand in the country, it said, adding that uptake of EVs also weighed. New EVs currently account for half of car sales and undercut around 250,000-300,000 bpd of oil demand growth in 2024, while use of compressed and liquified natural gas in road freight displaced around 150,000 bpd, it said.	https://www.voanews.com/a/china-s-fuel-demand-may-have-passed-its-peak-iea-says/7973458.html	2025-02-13T04:53:27-08:00	
Driver hits crowd in Munich, injuring 20	A driver drove a car into a crowd in Munich, Germany, on Thursday, injuring at least 20 people. Police said the driver was detained and no longer presented a danger. The incident took place as members of a service workers' union held a demonstration. Authorities said two of the people hurt had serious injuries. It was not immediately clear if the incident was intentional or an accident. The city is due to host the Munich Security Conference beginning Friday. Conference organizers issued a statement saying they were 'deeply saddened' by the incident. Some information for this report was provided by The Associated Press, Agence France-Presse and Reuters.	https://www.voanews.com/a/driver-hits-crowd-in-munich-injuring-20/7973430.html	2025-02-13T04:25:32-08:00	
Anti-government protest halts air traffic in Belgium	Brussles — Thousands of Belgians took to the streets on Thursday in protest over the new government's planned pension reforms in the first day of a multi-day strike that halted all air traffic in the country. Brussels airport canceled 430 flights on Thursday, a spokesperson said, adding that the disruption to the air traffic sector would last just one day. Protesters held signs with slogans such as 'We're not lemons,' and some displayed plaques featuring Latin phrases, a nod to new Prime Minister Bart De Wever's tendency to include Latin quotes whenever possible. The strike was also expected to disrupt public transport and postal services, with firefighters and military personnel joining the protests as well. The planned pension reform rewards those who work past retirement age, with 35 years of service, while early retirees without 35 years, face a penalty. The new system is less favorable for lower-income earners compared to the previous one, which provided a lump sum based on career length. Flemish nationalist Bart De Wever's government was sworn in on Feb. 3, after eight months of negotiations that resulted in a five-party coalition including right-wing, centrist, and socialist party, Vooruit. The socialist union had warned that a strike would be called if Vooruit joined the predominantly center-right government.	https://www.voanews.com/a/anti-government-protest-halts-air-traffic-in-belgium/7973406.html	2025-02-13T03:53:57-08:00	
South Korea's Yoon back in court for impeachment hearing	Seoul — South Korea's suspended President Yoon Suk Yeol will get another hearing next week before judges decide on whether to formally remove him from office over his martial law decree, the country's Constitutional Court said Thursday. The former prosecutor has remained defiant throughout weeks of hearings, blaming a 'malicious' opposition for his December bid to suspend civilian rule. The attempt only lasted six hours as the opposition-led parliament voted the declaration down and later impeached him over the move. Yoon was detained last month on insurrection charges, becoming the first sitting South Korean head of state to be arrested. Thursday's hearing was widely expected -- but not officially confirmed -- to be Yoon's last before the judges go behind closed doors to deliberate upholding his impeachment. But as proceedings wrapped up, the court said it would add another hearing next Tuesday. Prosecutors had argued the 'time was ripe' for the case to be decided while Yoon's lawyer Yoon Kap-keun told the hearing that the impeachment trial 'continues to be conducted in an unlawful and unfair manner.' Yoon's legal team also warned they would 'make a serious decision' if that persists, though they did not specify what action would be taken. 'Unanimous ruling' expected Following the trial, the process could take up to a fortnight. Previously impeached presidents Park Geun-hye and Roh Moo-hyun had to wait 11 and 14 days, respectively, to learn their fates. If the court upholds the impeachment, an election must be held within 60 days to choose a new president. 'Many legal scholars and experts agree that a unanimous ruling in favor of impeachment will be made by the Constitutional Court judges,' Kim Hyun-jung, a researcher at the Korea University Institute of Law, told AFP. But experts had warned that political wrangling could hold up the trial -- prominent Yoon supporters have called for more hearings. Much of Yoon's impeachment trial has centered on the question of whether he violated the constitution by declaring martial law, which is reserved for national emergencies or times of war. Yoon's lawyers told reporters on Thursday that his martial law declaration was 'an act of governance and cannot be subject to judicial review.' Yoon also suggested last week that even if he had ordered the arrest of MPs to prevent them from voting down his decree, it would not legally matter because it had not been carried out. The suspended president's supporters have gathered outside the court throughout his weeks-long trial. Some have held 'Stop the Steal' signs -- borrowing U.S. President Donald Trump's rhetoric to support unproven claims that recent South Korean elections were manipulated by shadowy foreign forces. Yoon's legal team announced it would officially launch a 'citizen defense team' of supporters seeking to 'save' him and have him reinstated. According to the lawyers, 15,000 people have applied to join the team. Yoon is also facing a separate criminal trial on insurrection charges, for which he faces a prison sentence or the death penalty. That trial is set to begin next Thursday.	https://www.voanews.com/a/south-korea-s-yoon-back-in-court-for-impeachment-hearing/7973402.html	2025-02-13T03:45:54-08:00	
Chinese apps face scrutiny in US but users keep scrolling	Seoul — As a high school junior in the Maryland suburbs of Washington, Daneel Kutsenko never gave much thought to China. Last month, though, as the U.S. government prepared to ban TikTok – citing national security concerns about its Chinese ownership – Kutsenko downloaded RedNote, another Chinese video-sharing app, which he felt gave him a new perspective on China. 'It just seems like people who live their life and have fun,' Kutsenko told VOAof RedNote, which reportedly attracted hundreds of thousands of U.S. users in the leadup to the now-paused TikTok ban. Kutsenko’s move is part of a larger trend. Even as U.S. policymakers grow louder in their warnings about Chinese-owned apps, they have become a central part of American life. TikTok, owned by China’s ByteDance, boasts 170 million U.S. users. China’s AI chatbot DeepSeek surged to the top of Apple’s App Store rankings, including those in the United States, for several days after its release last month. Another major shift has come in online shopping, where Americans are flocking to digital Chinese marketplaces such as Temu and Shein in search of ultra-low prices on clothes, home goods, and other items. According to a 2024 survey by Omnisend, an e-commerce marketing company, 70% of Americans shopped on Chinese platforms during the past year, with 20% doing so at least once a week. Multifaceted threat U.S. officials warn that Chinese apps pose a broad range of threats – whether to national security, privacy, human rights, or the economy. TikTok has been the biggest target. Members of Congress attempting to ban the app cited concerns that China’s government could use TikTok as an intelligence-gathering tool or manipulate its algorithms to push narratives favorable to Beijing. Meanwhile, Chinese commerce apps face scrutiny for their rock-bottom prices, which raise concerns about ethical sourcing and potential links to forced labor, Sari Arho Havrén, an associate fellow at the Royal United Services Institute, a London-based research organization, said in an email conversation with VOA. 'It raises questions of how sustainably these products are made,' Havrén, who focuses on China’s foreign policy and great power competition, said. Moreover, he said, 'the pricing simply kills local manufacturers and businesses.' Many U.S. policymakers also warn Chinese apps pose greater privacy risks, since Chinese law requires companies to share data with the government on request. ‘Curiosity and defiance’ Still, a growing number of Americans appear unfazed. Many young people in particular seem to shrug off the privacy concerns, arguing that their personal data is already widely exposed. 'They could get all the data they want. And anyway, I’m 16 – what are they going to find? Oh my gosh, he goes to school? There’s not much,' Kutsenko said. Ivy Yang, an expert on U.S.-China digital interaction, told VOA many young Americans also find it unlikely that they would ever be caught up in a Chinese national security investigation. 'What they’re chasing is a dopamine peak. They’re not thinking about whether or not the dance videos or the cat tax pictures they swipe on RedNote are going to be a national security threat,' Yang, who founded the New York-based consulting company Wavelet Strategy, said. Yang said the TikTok ban backlash and surge in RedNote downloads may reflect a shift in how young Americans see China – not just as a geopolitical rival, but as a source of apps they use in daily life. She also attributes their skepticism to a broader cultural mindset – one shaped by a mix of curiosity, defiance, and a growing distrust of institutions, including conventional media. Jeremy Goldkorn, a longtime analyst of U.S.-China digital trends and an editorial fellow at the online magazine ChinaFile, said growing disillusionment with America’s political turmoil and economic uncertainty has intensified these shifts. 'It makes it much more difficult for, particularly, young people to get worked up about what China’s doing when they feel so horrified about their own country,' Goldkorn said during a recent episode of the Sinica podcast, which focuses on current affairs in China. Polling reflects this divide. A 2024 Pew survey found 81% of Americans view China unfavorably, but younger adults are less critical – only 27% of those under 30 have strongly negative views, compared to 61% of those 65 and older. Digital barrier While Chinese apps are expanding in the United States, in many ways the digital divide remains as impenetrable as ever. China blocks nearly all major Western platforms and tightly controls its own apps, while the U.S. weighs new restrictions on Chinese tech. Though President Donald Trump paused the TikTok ban, his administration has signaled broader efforts to curb China’s tech influence. Trump officials have hinted they could take steps to regulate DeepSeek, the Chinese digital chatbot. The Trump administration also recently signaled it intends to close a trade loophole that lets Chinese retailers bypass import duties and customs checks. Broader challenges Even as Washington debates how to handle the rise of Chinese apps, some analysts say the conversation risks obscuring the deeper issue of the broader role of social media itself. Rogier Creemers, a specialist in digital governance at Leiden University, told VOA that while Chinese apps may raise valid concerns for Western countries, they are just one part of a larger, unaddressed problem. 'There’s a whole range of social ills that emerge from these social media that I think are far more important than anything the Chinese Communist Party could do,' he said, pointing to issues like digital addiction, declining attention spans, and the way social media amplifies misinformation and political unseriousness. 'And that would apply whether these apps are Chinese-owned or American-owned or Tajikistani-owned, as far as I’m concerned,' he added. The United States, Creemer said, has taken a more hands-off approach to regulating online platforms, in part due to strong free speech protections and pushback by the tech industry. Apps or influence? For millions of Americans, the bigger debates about China and digital influence barely register when they open TikTok. Kutsenko said neither he nor his friends have strong opinions about U.S.-China tensions. They just wanted an alternative to TikTok – one that felt fun, familiar, and easy to use. It’s a sign that while policymakers see Chinese apps as part of a growing tech rivalry, for many Americans they’re just another way to scroll, shop, and stay entertained, no matter where they come from.	https://www.voanews.com/a/chinese-apps-face-scrutiny-in-us-but-users-keep-scrolling/7973393.html	2025-02-13T03:36:15-08:00	
Several injured after motorist hits crowd of people in Munich	BERLIN — A motorist has driven a car into a group of people in the German city of Munich, leaving several people injured, police said on Thursday. The Bild newspaper reported that 15 people had been injured. The Munich Security Conference is to start on Friday and U.S. Vice President JD Vance and Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskiy are scheduled to arrive later Thursday. A large-scale police operation was underway near the southern city's central train station. Police said on X they were able to detain the driver and did not consider him to pose further threat. The incident appears to have affected people participating in a demonstration linked to a strike organized by the Verdi union, according to the local BR broadcaster. The union said it did not have any information on the incident.	https://www.voanews.com/a/several-injured-after-motorist-hits-crowd-of-people-in-munich/7973359.html	2025-02-13T02:39:33-08:00	
Hamas expresses commitment to ceasefire with Israel	The militant group Hamas expressed its commitment to a ceasefire with Israel on Thursday, as mediators worked to preserve the halt in fighting amid accusations of violations and threats of a return to war. 'We are not interested in the collapse of the ceasefire agreement in the Gaza Strip, and we are keen on its implementation and ensuring that the occupation (Israel) adheres to it fully,' Hamas spokesperson Abdel-Latif Al-Qanoua said. Qanoua also criticized what he called 'language of threats and intimidation' from Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and U.S. President Donald Trump, saying they do not help the implementation of the ceasefire. Hamas earlier this week accused Israel of violating the deal by continuing airstrikes on people in Gaza and blocking aid. The group said future hostage releases would be postponed. Netanyahu said fighting would resume if more captives were not freed on Saturday, and Trump said Monday that 'all hell would break out' if hostages were not returned. On Wednesday, after Israel called up military reservists, the country’s Defense Minister Israel Katz reiterated Trump’s warning. 'If Hamas stops the hostage releases, then there is no ceasefire and there is war,' he said. He added that the fighting would be more intense and would 'allow the realization of Trump's vision for Gaza.' Trump has discussed a plan under which the United States would take over Gaza and Palestinians would have no right to return. Other countries in the region, including Egypt, Jordan and Saudi Arabia, have rejected the idea. Since the ceasefire took effect last month, Hamas, which has been designated a terrorist organization by the United States, has freed 21 hostages and Israel has released more than 730 prisoners. The next exchange on Saturday calls for the release of three more Israelis in exchange for hundreds of Palestinian prisoners jailed by Israel. The war in Gaza was triggered by the October 2023 Hamas terror attack on Israel that killed 1,200 people and led to the capture of 250 hostages. Israel’s counteroffensive killed more than 48,200 Palestinians, more than half of them women and children, according to local health authorities. Israel says the death toll includes 17,000 militants it has killed. Some information for this report came from The Associated Press, Agence France-Presse and Reuters.	https://www.voanews.com/a/hamas-expresses-commitment-to-ceasefire-with-israel/7973353.html	2025-02-13T02:32:10-08:00	
Russian drone attack hits Odesa port infrastructure	Ukrainian officials said Thursday a Russian drone attack injured one person and damaged port infrastructure in the southern region of Odesa. Odesa Governor Oleh Kiper said the attack hit the Izmail area, which is located along the Danube River. Close to the same area, Romania’s Ministry of National Defense said Thursday its systems detected a drone crossing into Romanian airspace before going into Ukraine. The ministry said in a statement it 'strongly condemns these attacks conducted by the Russian Federation against certain Ukrainian civilian infrastructure facilities and elements, which are unjustified and severely breaching the norms of international law.' Moldova, which shares borders with Ukraine and Romania in the same region, reported Thursday that two Russian drones exploded on its soil. Moldovan President Maia Sandu said the incident put the lives of people in her country as risk. 'Russia respects no borders, attacks civilians, spreads terror,' Sandu said on X. 'Its war on Ukraine is criminal. Leave us, peaceful nations, alone.' Ukraine’s military said Thursday it shot down 85 of the 140 total drones that Russian forces launched overnight. The intercepts took place over the Cherkasy, Chernihiv, Dnipropetrovsk, Kharkiv, Kherson, Kirovohrad, Mykolaiv, Odesa, Poltava and Sumy regions, the military said. Dnipropetrovsk Governor Serhiy Lysak said on Telegram that drone, artillery and missile attacks damaged 10 houses, along with a business, powerlines and a gas pipeline. Russia’s Defense Ministry said Thursday it destroyed 83 Ukrainian drones, mostly in regions along the Russia-Ukraine border. Nearly half of the drones were shot down over the Bryansk region, where an official said there were no reports of damage or casualties. Voronezh Governor Alexander Gusev said the attacks damaged several houses in his region. Some information for this report came from Reuters.	https://www.voanews.com/a/russian-drone-attack-hits-odesa-port-infrastructure/7973347.html	2025-02-13T02:03:10-08:00	
Suicide bombing at Afghan ministry kills 1, injures several	ISLAMABAD — Taliban officials said Thursday a suicide bomb explosion outside a ministry building in the Afghan capital of Kabul killed at least one person and injured several others. The blast occurred when security guards at the entrance to the Ministry of Urban Development and Housing intercepted and killed a suicide bomber, an Interior Ministry spokesperson told VOA. Abdul Mateen Qani confirmed the casualties, saying a member of Taliban security was killed, and three others were wounded in the ensuing explosion. No immediate claims of responsibility were made, but suspicions fell on a regional Islamic State group affiliate, Islamic State-Khorasan, or IS-K. The attack came two days after IS-K took credit for a suicide bombing outside a bank in the northeastern Afghan city of Kunduz that killed at least five people and wounded several others. Multiple sources reported that the victims of the Tuesday blast were predominantly Taliban security personnel who had assembled to collect their salaries. IS-K has plotted repeated high-profile attacks since the Taliban retook control of the country in 2021. The violence has killed hundreds of people, including senior Taliban leaders, religious figures and members of the Afghan Shiite community. The back-to-back bombings this week followed the Taliban’s renewed claims that their security forces nearly eliminated IS-K presence in the country, rendering the group incapable of posing a threat within or beyond Afghan borders. The United Nations and independent critics remain skeptical about the Taliban’s assertions. U.N. counterterrorism officials warned during a Security Council meeting on Monday that IS-K is one of the 'most dangerous' Islamic State branches and 'continued to pose a significant threat in Afghanistan, the region and beyond.'	https://www.voanews.com/a/suicide-bombing-at-afghan-ministry-kills-1-injures-several/7973342.html	2025-02-13T01:48:14-08:00

US allies seek clarity on Ukraine support at Munich Security Conference	LONDON — Hundreds of world leaders and delegates are set to attend the Munich Security Conference in Germany this weekend, with conflicts in Ukraine, the Middle East, Sudan and the Democratic Republic of Congo high on the agenda, alongside simmering tensions in the Indo-Pacific region. It’s the first major global summit for the new administration in Washington under President Donald Trump and comes amid speculation that his America First agenda could presage significant changes in U.S. foreign policy. US delegation The U.S. delegation includes Vice President JD Vance and Secretary of State Marco Rubio. 'We are very happy that we will have a strong representation of both the administration of the new American government there, as well as representation from Congress,' said conference chairman Christoph Heusgen. 'And so, the American point of view will also be presented on stage, as will the European point of view, and that of other regions. And then, and that is what Munich stands for, there will be a dialogue, a discussion about the many issues at hand,' Heusgen told Reuters. Vance is scheduled to meet Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy in Munich. Ukraine’s war against Russia’s full-scale invasion is about to enter its fourth year. Zelenskyy said this week he shared a 'common vision' with the Trump administration. 'Of course, there may be different opinions, but a common vision of the main things — of how to stop [Russian President Vladimir] Putin and how to give guarantees of security to Ukraine and Ukrainians,' Zelenskyy told reporters on Monday. 'Unrealistic' However, U.S. Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth said on Wednesday that American troops would not be deployed to Ukraine following any ceasefire deal with Russia and ruled out NATO membership for Kyiv. He also described Ukraine’s hopes to return to its pre-2014 borders with Russia as unrealistic. 'European allies must lead from the front,' Hegseth told reporters in Brussels following a meeting of the Ukraine Defense Contact Group. President Trump has made clear he wants a quick end to the war but it’s not clear how that might be achieved. Trump announced Wednesday he and Putin agreed in a phone call to 'immediately' begin negotiations with Ukraine to bring an end to the nearly three-year-conflict. NATO allies Nevertheless, U.S. allies sense a change in tone from the president since his inauguration last month, said Charles Grant, director of the Center for European Reform, a London-based research group. 'Though Trump has said a lot of things to worry a lot of people on tariffs, on trade, on Gaza and so on, he hasn't yet said anything particularly crazy from a European point of view about Ukraine or NATO. He hasn't repeated his threat to pull out of NATO. He said the Europeans should spend more [on defense] but most of us agree with him on that. He hasn't said he's going to cut off all aid for Ukraine,' Grant told VOA. 'One of the issues that will come up in Munich is to what extent the Europeans should help to keep the peace if there is a ceasefire in Ukraine. And certainly, President [Emmanuel] Macron of France, and to some degree the British, and possibly Friedrich Merz who may well be the next German chancellor, are all in favor of sending troops to keep the peace in Ukraine, if there's a peace to be kept,' Grant added. Ukrainian hopes On the streets of Kyiv, some Ukrainians expressed hope that the Munich conference will strengthen Ukrainian ties with the Trump administration. 'We hope that this personal meeting between President Zelenskyy and Vice President Vance will give an opportunity to convey the real situation of what is happening today in the Russian-Ukrainian war,' sociologist Asked Ashurbekov told The Associated Press. Ukrainian journalist Borden Semeniuk was less optimistic. 'The country has been living in expectation for three years, and because of this, belief in this expectation has decreased. ... I would like to see some relief from the situation. But it is impossible to live in the hope that it will 100 percent happen at this meeting,' Semeniuk told AP. Russia and Iran have not been invited to Munich. Last year, the conference organizers said their governments had not shown a serious interest in negotiations. China The official report of the Munich Security Conference cites the 'multipolarization of the international order' — a theme welcomed by China, which is sending a large delegation to the summit. 'The report shows that the international community's acceptance of a multipolar world is on the rise. … China has always called for an equal and orderly multipolar world and a universally beneficial and inclusive economic globalization,' Guo Jiakun, a spokesperson for the Chinese Ministry of Foreign Affairs, told reporters in Beijing on Tuesday. Earlier this week, the U.S Navy sailed two warships through the Taiwan Strait, prompting an angry response from Beijing. China has ramped up military activity around Taiwan in recent months. China considers Taiwan a breakaway province that someday will be reunified with the mainland, while Taipei considers the island a sovereign state. Secretary of State Rubio is due to hold a trilateral meeting with allies Japan and South Korea while in Munich. Gaza Conflict in the Middle East will also top the agenda at the Munich conference, amid fears that the ceasefire between Israel and Hamas is at risk. President Trump’s repeated suggestion that Palestinians should leave Gaza will overshadow the conference, said analyst Charles Grant. 'I don't see it happening because you can't just eliminate 2 million people and put them nowhere at all,' Grant said. 'But I think most European governments are hoping that Trump will just push this for a while, and he'll get bored of it and talk about something else – and hope he will kind of move on and forget it. But so long as he does talk about it, it's very disruptive and creates a lot of ill-feeling between European and many other governments, and the U.S.,' Grant told VOA. The conference will also host sessions on the conflicts in Sudan and the Democratic Republic of Congo. Climate change, energy security and artificial intelligence also feature on a packed agenda across the three-day conference.	https://www.voanews.com/a/us-allies-seek-clarity-on-ukraine-support-at-munich-security-conference/7972522.html	2025-02-13T00:09:48-08:00

Gas explosion at Taiwan food court kills 4, leaves 8 hospitalized	TAIPEI, TAIWAN — A gas explosion at a department store in Taiwan on Thursday killed four people and left eight hospitalized, fire authorities said. The blast occurred at the food court on the 12th floor of the Shin Kong Mitsukoshi department store in Taichung city, the Taichung Fire Bureau said. Among the dead were two people visiting from Macau, while a third was severely injured, Macao's Tourism Office confirmed Thursday. Local media reported that they were part of a family of seven who were there for tourism. Dozens of firefighters were deployed to the scene at about 11:30 a.m. Parts of the building's exterior were damaged and scattered fragments were strewn on the streets. Taichung Mayor Lu Shiow-yen told reporters at the scene that she felt the shock at her office nearby. She said the fire bureau would focus on a rescue operation first, but an investigation was also underway and officers were checking whether there were other sources of danger. Taiwan's President Lai Ching-te said he had asked all relevant government agencies to investigate the cause of the accident.	https://www.voanews.com/a/gas-explosion-at-taiwan-food-court-kills-4-leaves-8-hospitalized/7973306.html	2025-02-13T00:01:27-08:00	
China's 2024 coal power construction hits 10-year high, researchers say	SINGAPORE — China started construction on 94.5 gigawatts of coal-fired power in 2024, the highest volume of new builds since 2015, hampering the country's transition away from fossil fuels, researchers said in a report published on Thursday. The world's biggest coal consumer and emitter of climate-warming greenhouse gases had vowed to 'strictly control' coal power over the 2021-25 period, but power shortage concerns have led to a spike in new projects since 2023. 'If coal maintains a high share in China's power system for too long, it will be much harder to achieve a rapid decline in emissions,' said Qi Qin, researcher at the Centre for Research on Energy and Clean Air (CREA). 'This, in turn, could pose challenges for global climate efforts, especially at a time when countries are expected to increase their ambitions for 2035 targets,' said Qi, the report's lead author. The surge came despite a record-breaking increase in renewable capacity last year and could make it harder to connect clean power to the grid, said the report, published by CREA and the Global Energy Monitor (GEM) think tank. China has retired more than 100 GW of obsolete coal-fired power in the last decade, according to its energy regulator, and new projects can only be built to provide back-up for renewable energy bases. China also commissioned 356 GW of wind and solar last year, meeting its 2030 target of 1,200 GW of renewable capacity six years ahead of schedule. Renewable power, however, is struggling to compete for space on China's grid, with utilization rates falling sharply near the end of last year, Thursday's report said. China has promised to start cutting coal use over the 2026-2030 five-year plan period as it works to bring its emissions to a peak before the end of the decade. This has created incentives for the industry to lock in as much coal capacity as it can ahead of new restrictions that could come into effect as early as next year. 'China's current push for new coal power is primarily driven by industry interests that are advancing coal expansion under the banner of energy security,' said Qi. 'These groups recognize the constraints imposed by the 2030 carbon peak and 2060 carbon neutrality targets and are moving quickly to secure growth before the window narrows,' she said.	https://www.voanews.com/a/china-s-2024-coal-power-construction-hits-10-year-high-researchers-say/7973302.html	2025-02-12T23:52:13-08:00	
Syrian minister makes first trip to EU as powers look to aid transition	PARIS — Syria's foreign minister will attend an international conference in Paris on Thursday as regional and Western powers seek to shield the country during its fragile transition amid ongoing instability across the region. Asaad Hassan al-Shibani is leading a delegation for a first trip to the European Union since the overthrow of Bashar al-Assad and days after President Emmanuel Macron invited Syria's U.N.-sanctioned President Ahmed al-Sharaa to France. 'This Paris meeting, in a way, is to help create a protective bubble around the Syria crisis, to give them time to resolve it by dissuading the bad losers from destabilizing the country,' a French official said. Regional ministers, including from Saudi Arabia, Turkey and Lebanon, will be joined with Western partners, although the United States will have merely a low-level diplomatic presence. The meeting aims to coordinate efforts to bring a peaceful transition, ensuring the country's sovereignty and security, mobilize Syria's main neighbors and partners to coordinate aid and economic support, the French foreign ministry said. It will also discuss transitional justice and the fight against impunity. The conference does not aim to raise funds, which will be left to an annual pledging conference in Brussels in March, but issues such as the lifting of sanctions would be discussed. The EU has moved forward in lifting some sanctions, although that still remains blocked amid opposition from Cyprus and Greece amid concerns over maritime delimitation talks between Syria and Turkey and assurances that sanctions could be restored quickly, two diplomats said. They said they were hopeful a compromise could be reached this month. Ahead of the meeting, main international donors will also take stock of the humanitarian situation, notably in northeastern Syria, where the impact of U.S. aid cuts has had a 'terrifying' impact, according to a European official. Officials also said the subject of Western-backed Kurdish Syrian forces, the central government and Turkey, which deems part of those forces as terrorist groups, would also be discussed. A Turkish diplomatic source said Deputy Foreign Minister Nuh Yilmaz, who will attend the meeting, would 'draw attention to the threats Syria is facing, namely the separatist terrorist organization, and emphasize our country's determination regarding the total clearance of the country from terror elements.'	https://www.voanews.com/a/syrian-minister-makes-first-trip-to-eu-as-powers-look-to-aid-transition/7973296.html	2025-02-12T23:10:38-08:00	
NATO defense ministers to discuss military spending, Ukraine aid	NATO defense ministers are set to meet Thursday in Brussels to discuss defense spending targets, boosting their industrial capacity and their support to Ukraine. The ministerial meeting comes amid a U.S. push for NATO allies to commit more of their domestic budgets to defense. NATO Secretary-General Mark Rutte expressed support for the U.S. position ahead of the talks, saying if allies do not spend more, then they will not have the necessary deterrents against foes such as Russia in place. Rutte also is urging allies to work on boosting defense production capacities in order to boost stockpiles and to be able to provide more for Ukraine’s defense against the Russian invasion that began in early 2022. U.S. Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth said during a meeting of the Ukraine Defense Contact Group Wednesday that while the U.S. wants a 'sovereign and prosperous Ukraine,' allies must recognize that going back to the Ukrainian borders that existed before Russia moved into Crimea in 2014 is an 'unrealistic objective.' Hegseth advocated for a negotiated end to the war with security guarantees backed by European and non-European troops that are deployed under a non-NATO mission. He ruled out deploying any U.S. troops to Ukraine. Following Thursday’s NATO ministerial, Hegseth heads to Poland for what the Pentagon said will be talks with leaders about 'bilateral defense cooperation, continued deterrence efforts along NATO's eastern flank, and Poland's leadership as a model ally in defense investment and burden-sharing in NATO.'

Modi, Trump to meet with focus on trade, immigration, strategic ties	NEW DELHI — U.S. President Donald Trump welcomes Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi for talks Thursday at the White House. Officials in New Delhi expressed optimism Modi’s visit will herald a renewed and substantive partnership. However, analysts said there will be contentious issues to navigate on trade and immigration, which are among Trump’s top priorities. Underlining that Modi will be meeting Trump within weeks of his taking office, Indian Foreign Secretary Vikram Misri – the ministry’s top civil servant — said India-U.S. ties are solid and that 'this has been one of our strongest international partnerships.' Trade is important for both countries and India has taken steps to demonstrate that it is ready to address concerns of Trump, who has named India among countries that are 'very big tariff abusers.' In a phone conversation with Modi last month, Trump called for moving toward a fair bilateral trading relationship. Kevin Hassett, director of the White House National Economic Council, repeated such concerns on Monday. 'India has enormously high' tariffs that lock out imports, he said in an interview with CNBC. New Delhi, which wants to avoid trade tensions with the U.S., announced earlier this month that it would lower import duties on some items that will benefit American exports such as high-end motorcycles and cars. It also may offer other concessions that could help American goods gain Indian market access and boost energy imports from the U.S., analysts say. 'New Delhi thought it would take a first step and try to resolve differences on trade. But, certainly, as a great negotiator and bargainer, he [Trump] will ask for more,' said Chintamani Mahapatra, founder of the Kalinga School of Indo Pacific Studies. 'India also bargains very well. So, somehow, we will try to make a compromise that will benefit both.' For India, the stakes are high -- the United States is its largest trading partner. Bilateral trade between the two countries was $118 billion, with an Indian surplus of about $32 billion in 2023. India has not been affected so far by Trump’s tariff impositions – the latest 25% tariffs he imposed on steel and aluminum imports will have an only marginal affect on India, as New Delhi is a small exporter of steel to the U.S., according to Indian officials. Strengthening security and defense ties with the U.S., Indian officials say will also be discussed in Washington. According to analysts that could include potential purchases of weapon systems and technology. In the recent phone conversation with Modi, Trump had called on Modi to increase procurement of U.S.-made security equipment India, the world’s largest spender on military equipment, needs a range of weapons systems to modernize its military. As it diversifies its purchases from its traditional weapons supplier, Russia, India has been purchasing more arms from countries such as France, Israel and the United States. 'The U.S. is a little concerned that it is losing out on the India [security] buys, so it has stepped up pressure to sell India a lot more defense equipment than India has bought in the last few years,' according to Rahul Bedi, a defense analyst in New Delhi. 'There is likely to be initiatives on transport aircraft, surveillance aircraft for the navy, and possibly even fighter aircraft, as well as a lot of technology transfers for aircraft engines, infantry combat vehicles.' Immigration is another issue of concern to both countries. Although India has cooperated with the U.S. and said it is ready to take back undocumented migrants, reports of 104 undocumented Indians being shackled for 40 hours while being brought back to India on a military plane last week from the U.S. led to an uproar and protests by opposition parties. Indian officials have said that New Delhi will call for better treatment during future deportations. At the same time, India’s top priority during discussions will be to protect legal channels of immigration for skilled Indian workers and students heading to American universities. Indians are the largest beneficiaries of H1B visas, which allow U.S. employers to hire foreign professionals in specialized fields, such as technology. 'People-to-people relationships constitute the bedrock of our deepening ties with the United States,' Indian foreign minister, Subrahmanyam Jaishankar told lawmakers, while responding to concerns about the transport and treatment of the deportees. In a statement before leaving New Delhi, Modi called his upcoming meeting with Trump an opportunity to build upon the successes of their collaboration in Trump’s first term. Mutual concerns about an assertive China are likely to keep the two countries aligned, according to analysts. Along with the U.S., Australia and Japan, India is a partner in the Quad, a strategic security grouping focused on the Indo-Pacific. Analysts say the two countries have convergence on geostrategic issues. 'It was President Trump in his first term, who dusted off the Quad, which was in a dormant state for about 10 years, and he was solely responsible for reviving it,' said Mahapatra. 'This is an area where both the countries have a lot of things in common for maintaining peace, stability and contributing to the growth story in the Indo-Pacific region.'	https://www.voanews.com/a/modi-trump-to-meet-with-focus-on-trade-immigration-strategic-ties/7973280.html	2025-02-12T21:51:46-08:00	
Trump launches diplomatic blitz to end Ukraine war	Following a successful prisoner swap with Russia, U.S. President Donald Trump launched a multifront diplomatic blitz Wednesday to end the Ukraine conflict, saying he would meet with Russia's leader soon and dispatching a vice president-led team to meet with Ukraine’s leader on Friday.

Austria’s far-right leader fails to form a government after coalition talks collapse	Talks in Austria to form a coalition government with the far-right Freedom Party and the conservative People’s Party collapsed Wednesday after the two sides failed to agree on disputed policy points. The coalition talks were the latest in a series of negotiations that have failed since parliamentary elections were held in September. Herbert Kickl’s Freedom Party, with its anti-immigration platform and opposition to the European Union’s support of Ukraine and sanctions against Russia, took almost 29% of the vote, pushing then-Chancellor Karl Nehammer's People's Party into second place. However, Austrian President Alexander Van der Bellen did not give the Freedom Party leader the mandate to form a coalition government until January, after attempts to form a coalition bloc without Kickl’s party failed. There has not been a far-right leading party in Austria’s government since World War II. The president said Wednesday in a nationally televised address that Austria now has four options to move out of its political dilemma. He said a snap election, which would take at least three months to mount, could be held, or a minority government could lead Austria. Another option is for Austrian politicians to engage in talks once again to form a coalition with a majority. The fourth option, the president said, would be for a temporary government of experts to take on the job of leading Austria. Van der Bellen said he will soon discuss the options with fellow politicians to determine which 'could be successful, as quickly as possible, for as long as necessary.' The president also called on the political parties to engage in the spirit of compromise during their negotiations, something he said he felt was missing. Analysts thought the far-right and conservative parties could form a coalition, but challenges emerged during their discussions, including policy differences and ministry assignments. Kickl said in a letter to the president that there was no point in negotiating with the center-left Social Democrats, the only other party with which the Freedom Party could reach a parliamentary majority. 'I do not take this step without regret,' Kickl said in the letter. 'Austria has no time to waste.'

Negotiators work to preserve Israel-Hamas ceasefire	While mediators were working to preserve a fragile ceasefire agreement between Israel and Hamas, Israel called up military reservists and the nation’s defense minister echoed U.S. President Donald Trump’s threat that 'all hell would break out' if hostages were not released Saturday. A Hamas official told The Associated Press there were positive signals three hostages would be released as planned, but the group was waiting to hear if Israel would honor the current ceasefire agreement. Egyptian and Qatari mediators were working to preserve the truce, according to Egypt's state-run Al-Qahera News TV, which is close to the country's security agencies. An Egyptian official, speaking on condition of anonymity to discuss private negotiations, said the two sides were working on a deal to preserve the ceasefire, AP reported. The monthlong ceasefire came under threat earlier this week when Hamas, a U.S.-designated terror organization, accused Israel of violating the terms of the ceasefire by continuing airstrikes on people in Gaza and blocking aid. The group said future hostage releases would be postponed. According to Hamas, 92 Palestinians have been killed since the ceasefire began and more than 800 have been wounded. Israel said people have been shot if they approached troops or entered certain areas in violation of the agreement. The United Nations said 1.2 million people have been fed and more than 600,000 have received shelter since the ceasefire began Jan. 19. Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said fighting would resume if more captives were not freed on Saturday, and Trump said Monday that 'all hell would break out' if hostages were not returned. On Wednesday, after Israel called up military reservists, the country’s Defense Minister Israel Katz reiterated Trump’s warning. 'If Hamas stops the hostage releases, then there is no ceasefire and there is war,' he said. He added that the fighting would be more intense and would 'allow the realization of Trump's vision for Gaza.' Trump has discussed a plan under which the United States would take over Gaza and Palestinians would have no right to return. Other countries in the region, including Egypt and Saudi Arabia, have rejected the idea. 'Hamas ... will not accept the language of American and Israeli threats,' Hamas spokesperson Hazaem Qassem said in a statement. 'Contacts are underway with mediator countries to conclude the implementation of the ceasefire deal.' The U.S. president’s vision has elicited anger from the Arab world. Arab League Secretary-General Ahmed Aboul Gheit rejected any plan to displace Palestinians from the Gaza Strip, saying Wednesday that such resettlement would be 'unacceptable.' Aboul Gheit told the World Governments Summit that the proposal to move the roughly 2 million Palestinians out of Gaza would push the region into a cycle of crises with a 'damaging effect on peace and stability.' 'It's unacceptable for the Arab world, which has fought this idea for 100 years,' Aboul Gheit said. Jordan’s King Abdullah II said after talks Tuesday with Trump that he reiterated his country’s 'steadfast position against the displacement of Palestinians in Gaza and the West Bank.' 'Rebuilding Gaza without displacing the Palestinians and addressing the dire humanitarian situation should be the priority for all,' Abdullah said on X. He highlighted what he said was Trump’s 'instrumental' role in securing a ceasefire in Gaza and called on the United States and all stakeholders to ensure the halt in fighting holds. Since the ceasefire took effect last month, Hamas has freed 21 hostages and Israel has released more than 730 prisoners. The next exchange on Saturday calls for the release of three more Israelis in exchange for hundreds of Palestinian prisoners jailed by Israel. The war in Gaza was triggered by the October 2023 Hamas terror attack on Israel that killed 1,200 people and led to the capture of 250 hostages. Israel’s counteroffensive killed more than 48,200 Palestinians, more than half of them women and children, according to local health authorities. Israel says the death toll includes 17,000 militants it has killed.

North Korea dismantling facility near border for separated families, Seoul says	SEOUL, South Korea — North Korea is dismantling a facility at its Mount Kumgang resort used for hosting meetings between families separated after the Korean War, South Korea said on Thursday, in the latest sign of strained tensions between the two Koreas. Seoul's Unification Ministry, which handles affairs between the two Koreas, issued a statement urging North Korea to immediately stop the action at the site near the border. The demolition of the facility is an 'anti-humanitarian act that tramples on the wishes of separated families,' the ministry said, adding that it would consider legal measures over the action and a joint response with the international community. North Korea has been escalating its rhetoric against its southern neighbor in recent years, designating South Korea as a 'hostile state.' Pyongyang also blew up sections of inter-Korean roads and rail lines on its side of the heavily fortified border last year, which prompted South Korea's military to fire warning shots at the time. In 2023, Pyongyang scrapped a 2018 military accord designed to curb the risk of inadvertent clashes between two countries that remain technically at war, prompting the South to take a similar step. Nonetheless, there have been recent signs that North Korea may be prepared to reopen to some foreign visitors for the first time in more than five years since the closure of its borders to tourism due to the COVID-19 pandemic. Beijing-based Koryo Tours on Thursday said tours to North Korea were 'officially back,' with some of its staff allowed to enter the Rason area in what it hoped would mark the relaunch of tourism.	https://www.voanews.com/a/north-korea-dismantling-facility-near-border-for-separated-families-seoul-says/7973247.html	2025-02-12T19:25:09-08:00	
US judge allows Trump to proceed with federal worker deferred retirement	BOSTON, MASSACHUSETTS — A federal judge on Wednesday allowed President Donald Trump's administration to carry out its federal worker deferred retirement program as the president moves to overhaul and downsize the U.S. government, handing a setback to unions trying to stop the plan. The decision could clear the way for the Republican president's administration to swiftly try to wrap up the program, though the unions could ask another court to halt the program. U.S. District Judge George O'Toole in Boston dissolved an earlier order he issued that had paused the program at the urging of unions representing more than 800,000 federal employees. O'Toole concluded that the unions lacked legal standing to challenge the rule. The American Federation of Government Employees and other unions have called the administration's deferred resignation offer to more than 2 million federal civilian employees unlawful. 'The unions do not have the required direct stake in the Fork directive, but are challenging a policy that affects others, specifically executive branch employees,' wrote O'Toole, an appointee of Democratic former President Bill Clinton. 'This is not sufficient.' The Office of Personnel Management, which announced the program in a January 28 email titled 'Fork in the Road,' on Monday told employees it intends to close the program to new entrants as soon as legally permissible. As of Friday, about 65,000 federal employees had signed up for the buyouts, according to a White House official, as the Trump administration ramps up plans to engage in wide-ranging job cuts throughout the government. The White House did not immediately respond to a request for comment. American Federation of Government Employees (AFGE) National President Everett Kelley called the ruling a setback. 'Importantly, this decision did not address the underlying lawfulness of the program,' he said in a statement. The unions that had filed the lawsuit argued that the plan announced in January was unlawful and that OPM lacked authority to implement the program. Trump, who began his second term as president on January 20, has appointed Elon Musk a 'special government employee' to oversee a sweeping effort called the Department of Government Efficiency with the stated aim of reducing federal spending and reshaping the United States' 2.2 million-strong federal workforce, potentially purging thousands of workers. He also signed an executive order on Tuesday to expand Musk's influence and continue downsizing the federal workforce. Democrats and other critics have accused Musk, who heads electric carmaker Tesla and rocket company SpaceX, of improperly taking over the federal government. Some federal workers have held protests against Musk's actions. In an email that was sent last month to nearly all federal employees, OPM said employees could choose to resign now and retain all pay and benefits until September 30. The email said employees could remain on the payroll without having to work in person and possibly having their duties reduced or eliminated in the meantime. Interested employees needed only to reply with the word 'resign' to take part. The email's title and contents mirrored a message that Musk, the world's richest man, sent to Twitter employees after he acquired the social media platform, now called X, in 2022. As the deadline approached, the Trump administration had repeated its warning that most federal agencies are likely to be downsized, a message seen by workers as pressure to accept the buyout offer. The unions in their lawsuit argued that OPM's buyout directive was 'stunningly arbitrary' and violated the Antideficiency Act, a federal law that bars agencies from spending more money than Congress appropriated. By encouraging employees to broadly quit without regard to their agency, job duties or institutional memory, OPM is ignoring the adverse consequences resignations could have on the government's ability to function, the unions said. At the request of the unions, O'Toole last week delayed an initial February 6 deadline for employees to resign to Monday. On that day, he put it on hold pending a further order of the court while he considered the case. The unions asked that the deadline be put fully on hold to give them time to seek further relief through the courts and ensure that their members can make informed decisions.	https://www.voanews.com/a/us-judge-allows-trump-to-proceed-with-federal-worker-deferred-retirement-/7973201.html	2025-02-12T18:31:58-08:00	
Washington forum takes on Central Asia water insecurity	washington — Central Asia has a growing population, rising economic demand and severe water shortages that require greater coordination among governments and international aid groups to build out crucially needed water infrastructure, experts on the region say. 'There is no solution to these water problems without political solutions to regional problems involving regional integration to a unique degree,' Wesley Alexander Hill, lead analyst at the International Tax and Investment Center, said last week at an Atlantic Council forum in Washington. Hill explained that the origins of major rivers in Kazakhstan, Kyrgyzstan, Tajikistan, Uzbekistan and Turkmenistan largely depend on sources in Russia, China and Afghanistan. He also highlighted China’s Belt and Road Initiative, which has pledged water investments in Kazakhstan, and Afghanistan’s construction of the Qosh Tepa Canal, which threatens to reduce water flow from the Hindu Kush into downstream countries such as Uzbekistan and Turkmenistan. Central Asian governments over the years have sought water-related agreements with Moscow, Beijing and Kabul. Hill said that modernizing water infrastructure in these countries presents economic opportunities. 'Investing in Central Asian water infrastructure and resources isn’t a charity project,' he said. 'It can actually be quite profitable. There’s plenty of money to be made not just by Chinese and Russian companies, but, hopefully, by American and European companies as well, in areas like relining canals.' Wilder Alejandro Sanchez, president of Second Floor Strategies, underscored the need for 'realistic and rational policy recommendations' to achieve water security in Central Asia. 'We encourage local governments to implement technologies like water-measuring systems, drip irrigation and graywater recycling,' Sanchez told attendees at the forum. He also called for policymakers to ensure accountability and transparency, given Central Asia’s well-documented record of corruption and embezzlement. He suggested that water security projects be monitored by international auditing agencies to build public trust. The Atlantic Council panelists also proposed restructuring the region’s Interstate Commission for Water Coordination, created in 1992, into a more effective Central Asia Water Council or permanent administrative office. The Central Asian governments already have their own initiatives. Tajikistan, for example, leads the Dushanbe Water Process, while Kazakhstan plans to host the Central Asian Water Environmental Summit next year. Sanchez and his colleagues encouraged the Central Asian republics, whose representatives were at the forum, to work not only with the United States but also with European and Asian partners, including the Netherlands, France, South Korea and Japan. Sanchez acknowledged that achieving unity and cooperation remains a challenge, given regional geopolitics and domestic priorities. 'Ultimately, no individual Central Asian state can achieve total water security and water independence without cooperating with its neighbors and significantly improving water management,' he said. For decades, international organizations and researchers have warned about the ecological disaster unfolding in Central Asia, particularly the shrinking of the Aral Sea, which has lost most of its volume since the 1960s. The Caspian Sea, the region’s only remaining major body of water, is also drying up. Ariel Cohen, a nonresident senior fellow at the Atlantic Council who was also on the panel, pointed to deteriorating infrastructure as a key issue. 'A lot of water is lost because modern irrigation technologies are not used. You still have Soviet-era canals, or even pre-Soviet traditional canals, that are just dug into the ground without any protection from evaporation or dissipation,' Cohen said. 'Moving to pipe distribution of water, drip irrigation and sprinklers will probably save 50% of water consumption and move the region toward much more balanced water management.' The experts estimate that modernization will cost billions of dollars, and the question of where that funding will come from remains open. 'If it’s not going to be the U.S., it’s going to be somebody else. The best-case scenario? If it’s not us [the U.S.], it’s the Europeans. Worst-case scenario? It’s the Chinese,' said Cohen. It remains to be seen, other analysts listening to the panel said, whether the Trump administration’s 'America First' policy would support such involvement. 'Often, when we talk about U.S.-Central Asia relations, we focus on the big picture,' said Sanchez. 'We need to diversify engagement between the U.S. and Central Asia.' Water security and environmental protection are high-impact initiatives, he argued, that will not only strengthen ties but also improve the image of the U.S. in Central Asia. 'We also want the people of Central Asia to see the United States as a friend,' Sanchez said.	https://www.voanews.com/a/washington-forum-takes-on-central-asia-water-insecurity-/7973202.html	2025-02-12T18:05:16-08:00

Trump orders revamp of US diplomatic corps to ensure it follows his agenda	WASHINGTON — U.S. President Donald Trump on Wednesday issued an executive order directing Secretary of State Marco Rubio to revamp the Foreign Service to ensure 'faithful and effective implementation' of Trump's foreign policy agenda. The order, which follows upheaval at the U.S. Agency for International Development, comes as Trump institutes changes to ensure U.S. foreign policy is aligned with his 'America First' agenda. He has also repeatedly pledged to 'clean out the deep state' by firing bureaucrats that he deems disloyal. The order also says failure to implement the president's agenda is grounds for professional discipline, which may result in the termination of personnel. 'The Secretary must maintain an exceptional workforce of patriots to implement this policy effectively,' the order read. 'The Secretary shall, consistent with applicable law, reform the Foreign Service and the administration of foreign relations to ensure faithful and effective implementation of the President’s foreign policy agenda.' The executive order says the secretary of state will implement reforms in recruiting, performance, evaluation and retention standards to 'ensure a workforce that is committed to faithful implementation of the President’s foreign policy.' It also said the secretary can revamp the programs of the Foreign Service Institute and revise or replace the Foreign Affairs Manual. Just hours after taking office on Jan. 20, Trump ordered a freeze of most U.S. foreign aid to ensure it was aligned with his 'America First' policies. Following the order, USAID staff were put on leave and told not to report to work at the agency's headquarters, where signs were covered in tape or removed. The USAID website stopped working, and Rubio was named acting administrator.	https://www.voanews.com/a/trump-orders-revamp-of-us-diplomatic-corps-to-ensure-it-follows-his-agenda/7973182.html	2025-02-12T16:57:55-08:00

Lawsuit by US rights group seeks access to migrants sent to Guantanamo Bay	washington — The American Civil Liberties Union filed a lawsuit on Wednesday seeking access to dozens of migrants flown to a U.S. naval base in Guantanamo Bay, Cuba, saying they were being denied the right to an attorney. ACLU filed the complaint on behalf of families of detainees, who say the detainees themselves cannot sue because they are being held without the ability to communicate with the outside world. The suit seeks immediate phone and video access to detainees, as well as in-person visitation. President Donald Trump, a Republican, kicked off a wide-ranging immigration crackdown after taking office on Jan. 20, including the transfer of dozens of migrants to a detention site on Guantanamo Bay, which is best known for the separate high-security U.S. prison used for suspected foreign terrorists. The lawsuit follows a letter sent by ACLU and other civil and immigrant rights groups to top Trump officials last week, demanding a way to speak to detainees. 'Shipping immigrants off to Guantanamo without access to lawyers or the outside world cannot be reconciled with our country’s laws or principles,' said Lee Gelernt, ACLU lawyer and lead counsel on the case. 'It will now be up to the courts to reaffirm that the rule of law governs our nation.' The lawsuit cites the cases of three Venezuelan men believed to be detained at Guantanamo. Angela Carolina Sequera, one of the plaintiffs, said she was in almost daily contact with her son while he was in a Texas immigration detention center and last spoke to him on Saturday, the complaint stated. On Sunday, she received a call from the detention center saying her son would be sent to Guantanamo. 'Ms. Sequera has made numerous calls to try to locate her son and speak to him, to no avail,' the complaint said. 'She is distraught over the lack of information, and she desires that her son be provided with the ability to communicate with legal counsel regarding his detention at Guantanamo.' The plaintiffs also include four nonprofit legal service providers who said they were unable to represent migrants shuttled to the naval base. The providers have clients in Texas and Florida. The Trump administration has provided few specifics about the detainees sent to Guantanamo Bay but said the first flight carried alleged members of the Venezuelan gang Tren de Aragua. Department of Homeland Security spokesperson Tricia McLaughlin said there is a system at the Guantanamo detention site for migrants to phone lawyers. She questioned the ACLU raising concerns about 'highly dangerous criminal aliens including murderers and vicious gang members' rather than U.S. citizens. Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem, who visited the base on Friday, said in a social media post that some of the detainees had allegedly been charged or convicted of homicide, robbery and other crimes. The ACLU lawsuit said the U.S. had never before moved migrants held on civil immigration charges from the U.S. to the Guantanamo Bay base and now held them 'incommunicado, without access to attorneys, family or the outside world.' The complaint said that despite significant public concern, the Trump administration had offered no explanation of its legal authority to move the detainees.	https://www.voanews.com/a/lawsuit-by-us-rights-group-seeks-access-to-migrants-sent-to-guantanamo-bay/7972904.html	2025-02-12T15:39:08-08:00

VOA Mandarin: US lawmaker vows to end China's trade status	WASHINGTON — The U.S. will have to get more aggressive to make its relationship with China authentic and reciprocal, said Representative John Moolenaar, the Republican chairman of the Select Committee on the Chinese Communist Party on Tuesday. He said he and others on the committee have introduced legislation that would revoke China's Permanent Normal Trade Relations and end the de minimis exemption, one that would put tariffs directly China, especially some key sectors at 100% and lesser sectors around 35%.

Russia, Ukraine trade blame for IAEA disruptions at Zaporizhzhia nuclear plant	KYIV, UKRAINE — Russia and Ukraine on Wednesday accused each other of blocking the rotation of staff from the International Atomic Energy Agency at the Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant in southern Ukraine. Moscow's troops seized the facility, Europe's largest nuclear power station, in the first days of its invasion of Ukraine. Both sides have repeatedly accused the other of risking a potentially devastating nuclear disaster by attacking the site. Staff from the U.N. nuclear watchdog have been based there since September 2022 to monitor nuclear safety. Fighting meant the IAEA staff could not be swapped out as part of a planned rotation on Wednesday, the second such delay in a week, both Kyiv and Moscow said, trading blame for the incident. Inspectors spend around five weeks at the plant in stints before being swapped out in a complex procedure that involves traveling across the front line under supervision from the Russian and Ukrainian militaries. Ukrainian foreign ministry spokesman Georgiy Tykhy accused Russia's army of opening fire near where the planned rotation was taking place, saying Moscow's goal was to force the IAEA team to travel through Russian-controlled territory and 'violate Ukraine's sovereignty and territorial integrity.' Russia's foreign ministry spokeswoman Maria Zakharova said the Ukrainian army blocked the IAEA team from traveling to an agreed meeting point and were attacking the area with drones, at which point the Russian military withdrew its support team and returned to the station. 'On their return, the convoy carrying Russian military personnel and IAEA experts ... came under attack by drone and mortar strikes,' Zakharova said in a statement. The IAEA staff members were supposed to leave the station on Feb. 5 in a rotation that was also delayed. IAEA head Rafael Grossi was in both Ukraine and Russia last week, where he discussed the issue of rotations with officials from both countries.	https://www.voanews.com/a/russia-ukraine-trade-blame-for-iaea-disruptions-at-zaporizhzhia-nuclear-plant-/7972887.html	2025-02-12T15:28:54-08:00	
261 trafficking victims rescued from Myanmar scam center	WASHINGTON — More than 260 foreign nationals have been rescued from online scam operations in Myanmar and handed over to authorities in Thailand. The rescue is part of an escalating crackdown on human trafficking and cyber fraud along the two countries' border. A Myanmar insurgent group, the Democratic Karen Benevolent Army, which recently raided scam centers in the region, handed the victims over to Thai authorities on Feb. 12. DKBA Chief of Staff Major Saw San Aung told VOA's Burmese Service in a telephone interview that the group's forces raided casinos in Myawaddy District, Karen State, in search of trafficked foreign workers. 'On February 11, we identified 261 victims and transferred them to Thai authorities on February 12,' he said. 'We are handing over everyone we find today, but the process is difficult. The [Myanmar] junta's immigration department is making demands, and the terrain is challenging. We have to retrieve the victims ourselves before transferring them to the nearest Thai authorities,' Major Saw San Aung said. A rescue worker and eyewitness who requested anonymity for security reasons told VOA in a phone interview on Wednesday that online scam gangs force victims of trafficking 'to meet monthly earnings targets of up to $50,000. If they failed, they were tortured. They were only allowed to sleep for two to three hours a day and worked nonstop. They were kept in dark cells and subjected to continuous abuse.' Thai officials confirmed that the rescued individuals were taken by boat to Phop Phra, Thailand, before being moved to a secure facility. China pressured to crack down on scammers Tensions between China and Myanmar escalated after Chinese actor Wang Xing was abducted and held captive in Myanmar in January, before eventually being rescued from scam centers in Myawaddy. In response to this incident, China pressured Thailand to crack down on scam networks operating in the region. This pressure is widely believed to be a key factor behind Thailand's decision to cut off electricity and fuel supplies to Myanmar, significantly impacting areas controlled by ethnic Karen armed groups. The Wednesday handover follows another transfer on Feb. 6 when Myanmar's ruling junta and another armed group, the Karen Border Guard Force handed over 61 trafficked individuals, including 39 Chinese nationals, to Thai custody. Among those rescued and returned on Thursday, many were from Africa, including 46 Ethiopians and 33 Kenyans, according to the DKBA. In recent days, Myanmar's military leadership has also highlighted its efforts to crackdown on illegal online gambling and scam operations in cooperation with the international community. In audio message shared with the news media last Friday, military junta spokesperson General Zaw Min Tun said many victims of trafficking were lured with promises of high-paying jobs in computer-related and translation fields. 'They were deceived by the prospect of high salaries and good working conditions. Most of them arrived in Mae Sot from Bangkok before being taken across the border illegally by online money-laundering gangs,' General Zaw Min Tun said. Myawaddy: haven for scam syndicates Myawaddy, located in Karen State along the Thai border, is controlled by Karen armed groups, including the DKBA and the Karen BGF, the latter was previously aligned with the Myanmar military. The BGF-controlled town of Shwe Kokko in particular has turned into a notorious hub for online fraud. As of May 2022, reports indicated that 1,225 Chinese nationals, along with individuals from Hong Kong, Taiwan, India, and the Philippines, were trafficked into Shwe Kokko to work in online scam operations. These victims were lured by fake job offers and later forced into online fraud schemes. Since the Karen BGF severed ties with the Myanmar military and rebranded itself as the Karen National Army last year, the scam operations have faced increased scrutiny. The U.S. Institute of Peace has warned that online scams originating from Southeast Asia, particularly Myanmar, are a major security threat and cause significant financial losses in the U.S. In 2023, USIP estimated that Americans lost $3.5 billion to scams from the region. These scams, including forced labor, scams using romantic relationships and other financial crimes, target U.S. residents through fraudulent job applications and false high-tech job ads.

Audit shows Senegal's previous government misreported debt, other key data	DAKAR, SENEGAL — Senegal's Court of Auditors released a long-awaited review of the country's finances on Wednesday that confirmed the previous government misreported key economic data including debt and deficit figures. Senegal's sovereign Eurobonds tumbled following release of the report. 'The work carried out by the Court shows that outstanding debt is higher than that shown in the reporting documents,' the court's report said. The court's report confirmed an audit that had been ordered by President Bassirou Diomaye Faye, who took office in April 2024. At the end of 2023, the total outstanding debt represented 99.67% of gross domestic product, the court's report said. That compared with a previously recorded figure of 74.41%. The audit ordered by Faye had revealed that Senegal's debt and budget deficit were much wider than former President Macky Sall's administration had reported. As a consequence of the audit, Faye's government decided in June not to present a request for further disbursement under its three-year $1.8 billion credit facility with the International Monetary Fund. The IMF had suspended the program pending the Court of Auditors' review. The IMF said on Wednesday that it would analyze the report and initiate consultations with authorities to address issues raised. 'The IMF remains committed to supporting the authorities moving forward,' an IMF spokesperson said via email. The court's report, which covers public finances from 2019 to March 2024, said it detected other anomalies and data discrepancies between the reported and the actual numbers. 'The deficit calculated and reported to the IMF for the period under review is very far from its real value, if the exact volume of project loan disbursements is taken into account,' the court said in the report. The reviewed budget deficit for 2023 stood at 12.3% of GDP compared with 4.9% reported by the previous administration, the court said. Leo Morawiecki, associate investment specialist for emerging market debt at Abrdn, an investment company, said the debt-to-GDP ratio for 2024 was likely to be in excess of 110% given the large deficit being run. 'In response, the IMF will almost certainly move Senegal from moderate to high risk of debt distress,' he said in a note, adding that the government seemed committed to fiscal consolidation and an IMF program. In a note to investors after the report's release, Senegal's finance ministry said it would centralize management of its public debt and implement strict controls over projects financed from external resources. The ministry will shortly organize a call with global investors, the note said.	https://www.voanews.com/a/audit-shows-senegal-s-previous-government-misreported-debt-other-key-data-/7972823.html	2025-02-12T14:22:23-08:00	
Malawi university students feel impact of US aid freeze	BLANTYRE, MALAWI — Public universities in Malawi have ordered all students sponsored by USAID to drop out or seek other sources of funding if they want to remain in school. This follows the 90-day freeze on U.S. foreign assistance recently announced by President Donald Trump. However, Malawi’s government says it is working to ensure that students can continue their education. USAID has provided financial support to thousands of students in several Malawi universities, including the Lilongwe University of Agriculture and Natural Resources, Mzuzu University, Kamuzu University of Health Sciences, and the Malawi University of Science and Technology or MUST. James Mphande, the communications manager at MUST, said the U.S. foreign aid freeze is a big blow to several USAID-funded projects the school was implementing. 'And what it means now is that everything has been suspended,' he said. 'So, if we were developing a curriculum, we can’t proceed. If we had some outreach activities, we can’t proceed. If we were in the process of making some procurements, we can’t proceed.' He said some sponsored students may face the impact next semester. 'Fortunately, we are in the middle of a semester. So, probably fees or support for this semester was already sorted out. But for the upcoming semesters or years, it means the students will have to look elsewhere for support or they risk withdrawing,' Mphande said. However, Patience Yamikani Chakwana, a beneficiary of USAID at MUST, told VOA that she is already feeling the impact. Chakwana, a first-year student in business information technology, said the foreign aid suspension was imposed before students received money for their daily upkeep. 'It was really unexpected. It was, like, we have just started school after a week, then we are getting the news,' she said. 'At the time, we didn’t have the money, and the pocket money had not been given. … I heard the news while I was in class. I didn’t know what to do. That was the only hope I had.' Chakwana said USAID was paying for her tuition and accommodation, as well as giving her money for groceries and the internet connection for her mobile phone. She said she now survives on money she borrows from friends. Jessie Kabwila, Malawi’s minister of higher education, said the aid suspension is discouraging, but the Malawi government is working to find other sources to help students. 'We have engaged local partnerships that are in the private sector to see how they can help us. We have also engaged international partners. For example, we have got a standing agreement with the Republic of Morocco. We have also engaged the Czech Republic, and we will be engaging others, too,' Kabwila said. Alexander Kude, deputy director for the Commonwealth Students Association, told VOA that the U.S. foreign aid suspension should be a wake-up call for developing countries to start investing more in education and reduce overdependence on foreign aid. 'Look, the budget that the United States of America uses to fund us through USAID, it’s just a percent of their money and budget. If you look how much that is and where they get it from, why not stand alone and do it ourselves?' Kude said. The Trump administration says it imposed the 90-day freeze to review USAID spending and make sure it aligns with U.S. policy and interests. The freeze will extend through April 20.	https://www.voanews.com/a/malawi-university-students-feel-impact-of-us-aid-freeze/7972824.html	2025-02-12T14:07:37-08:00	
VOA Kurdish: Kurdish demonstration laws block protesters from entering Irbil	On Sunday, violence erupted at a security checkpoint outside of the Kurdistan Region's capital Irbil after security forces prevented hundreds of protesting teachers from Sulaymaniyah and Halabja provinces from entering the city. The teachers, who are still waiting to receive their December salary payments, told VOA it was their right to take their protests to Irbil as the capital of the Kurdistan Region. Police, however, said the teachers' request to protest was not approved by the Ministry of Interior, and used tear gas, plastic bullets and water cannons to disperse crowds. Hardi Salah, a lawmaker with the Patriotic Union of Kurdistan, told VOA the incident highlighted the need for the Kurdistan Regional Parliament to amend the region's protest law, which he said allows authorities to prevent any gathering they deem a challenge to their authority. But Muna Nabi Kahveci, the deputy head of the Turkmen Reform Party and former Kurdistan Parliament Secretary with close alliance to the ruling Kurdistan Democratic Party (KDP), denounced any attempt to amend the region's 2010 election law, arguing, 'Protesters were barred from entering Irbil to avoid violent unrest.'

Fire at Rio de Janeiro Carnival costume factory injures 21	RIO DE JANEIRO — A fire broke out Wednesday at a factory making costumes for Rio de Janeiro's Carnival, injuring 21 people in a blow to the famed extravaganza that attracts millions of tourists to the Brazilian city every year. Firefighters scaled ladders to reach a window where desperate workers were calling for help as black smoke bellowed from the building in the north of the city, local media images showed. The area around the factory was cordoned off by authorities as firefighters brought the blaze under control, according to an AFP reporter. The fire department's communication service told AFP that 21 people were hospitalized, 12 of whom were in a serious condition. Earlier, state health secretary Claudia Mello said at least eight people had been intubated and were on artificial respiration. Fire department chief Colonel Luciano Pacheco Sarmento said that those affected were working in a 'precarious manner' and without 'safety conditions.' The building contained 'a lot of highly combustible material,' added Sarmento. 'We have information that there have been fires here before,' he said. 'No way' down A survivor, identified as Roberta, told local media she had been working and sleeping in the building 'since Monday.' The fire 'came from the floor below and we had no way to get down,' she said. Rio de Janeiro's labor ministry announced a probe into working conditions at the factory. The cause of the fire has not been established. Rio's Carnival, famous for parades with lavish costumes and towering floats to the tune of samba music, begins on February 28 and will run until March 8. Preparations last almost the whole year, with the final weeks often very tense as competitors scramble to meet deadlines for the making of costumes and floats. One of the associations for the samba schools that compete in the parades, Liga RJ, expressed its 'deep concern' for the injured. The organization said the Maximus Factory that was hit by the fire was 'an essential space for the Rio Carnival.' 'The impact of this incident directly affects the planning of the Carnival and the entire production chain of its realization,' Liga RJ warned in an Instagram message. 'The League will urgently call its presidents for an extraordinary general assembly to evaluate the situation,' the statement said. Samba schools affected Three samba schools were having their outfits made at the affected factory, although none of them were taking part in the main competition for Carnival champion. Like football, the parade competition has several divisions, and samba schools can be relegated or rise up through the ranks each year. Rio de Janeiro Mayor Eduardo Paes said the schools impacted by the fire would not be demoted from their carnival league. 'If they can parade, all three will do so out of competition,' he wrote on the X social media network. Paulo Santi, director of Imperio Serrano, one of the affected schools, said it would carry out its planned parade on March 1 'as if it were competing for the title. Showing the people of Rio that Imperio Serrano will endure.' The samba schools are rooted in Rio's favela urban settlements and each parade tells a story, often dealing with politics, social issues and history. Their parades take place in the Sambadrome, a large, open-air venue where more than 70,000 spectators gather to watch the spectacle with thousands of dancers in shimmering costumes. In 2011, a blaze in the Samba City complex of workshops and warehouses stocking Carnival material wiped out eight months of preparations worth millions of dollars.	https://www.voanews.com/a/fire-at-rio-de-janeiro-carnival-costume-factory-injures-21/7972743.html	2025-02-12T13:29:18-08:00	
Pressure builds on US over future of its military presence in Syria	The future of the United States’ military presence in Syria is in question, with President Donald Trump facing competing demands from Turkey and Israel over the 2,000-strong force that is supporting a Syrian Kurdish-led coalition fighting Islamic State. Israel wants the U.S. to keep supporting Kurdish forces in Syria, while Turkey opposes that strategy.

Trump pushes for lower interest rates alongside tariffs	WASHINGTON — As his trade advisers finalized plans to enact reciprocal measures on every country that charges duties on U.S. imports, President Donald Trump announced Wednesday he will push for lower interest rates alongside his tariff policies. 'Interest Rates should be lowered, something which would go hand in hand with upcoming Tariffs!!! Lets Rock and Roll, America!!!' Trump said on social media Wednesday morning. To maintain the Federal Reserves’ autonomy from politics, U.S. presidents traditionally avoid even the appearance of meddling in monetary policy and the nation’s interest rates, which is the purview of the central bank. Trump, however, has not shied from the practice. In a videoconference address to the World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland, in January, Trump said he would 'demand that interest rates drop immediately.' 'I know interest rates much better than they do,' he said of Fed officials. He has ramped up his criticism of Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell, whom he appointed in 2017 for a term that ends in 2026. Trump’s push to lower interest rates is intended to go hand in hand with punitive measures on trading partners. Reciprocal tariffs are 'absolutely a high priority for the president,' White House economic adviser Kevin Hassett told reporters Wednesday, promising 'a lot more action on it today.' Hassett said the White House has begun negotiations with other countries early to lay the groundwork for imposing such tariffs, although he acknowledged the details about which sectors or how they will be implemented is a 'work in progress.' Under World Trade Organization rules, member countries have the right to impose tariffs on imports. Countries negotiate those rates at the WTO to determine the maximum tariff rate a member country can impose on imports from other member countries. Inflation, looming trade war U.S. inflation rose to 3% in January, according to government data released Wednesday. Last month, the annual pace was 2.9%. Trump campaigned on lowering high consumer prices he blamed on his predecessor, Joe Biden. White House Press Secretary Karoline Leavitt again attributed the increase to the previous administration. 'This is an indictment on the Biden administration's mismanagement of the inflation crisis and their lack of transparency,' she said during her briefing Wednesday. Trump wants to lower interest rates and inflation, she said. 'He believes that the whole of government economic approach that this administration is taking will result in lower inflation.' However, some economists warn that combining high tariffs and low interest rates will have the opposite effect. Trump's plan reflects a 'misunderstanding of how the economy works,' said Joseph Gagnon, senior fellow at the Peterson Institute for International Economics. 'Tariffs raise prices directly, that is inflationary, but also cutting interest rates is inflationary if you do it excessively,' he told VOA. 'Especially with today's data, cutting interest rates would not be a good idea.' During testimony Tuesday before the Senate Banking Committee, Powell said the Fed was in no rush to cut interest rates because the economy had stabilized. He noted that inflation, while still above the Fed’s 2% target, was at 2.6% last year, and he said the labor market was cooling without plummeting, with the unemployment rate at 4%. Gagnon also warned of a looming trade war. Trump already had announced Monday his decision to impose 25% tariffs on all steel and aluminum imports beginning March 12. The duties will hit top U.S. steel supplier Canada, followed by Brazil, Mexico, South Korea and Germany. Additionally, Canada is the leader in aluminum exports to the American market. European Union chief Ursula von der Leyen vowed on Tuesday the move 'will not go unanswered,' saying it will trigger tough countermeasures from the 27-nation bloc, potentially targeting iconic American industries such as bourbon, jeans and motorcycles. EU trade ministers are meeting Wednesday to determine their next moves. China, Mexico and Canada Last week, Trump imposed an additional 10% tariff on Chinese goods, which the White House said was aimed at halting the flow of fentanyl opioids and their precursor chemicals. On Monday China began slapping retaliatory actions on some American goods, including 15% duties on coal and natural gas imports and 10% on petroleum, agricultural equipment, high-emission vehicles and pickup trucks. The country also immediately implemented restrictions on the export of certain critical minerals, and it launched an antitrust investigation into American tech giant Google. Trump delayed enacting a 25% tariff on goods from Mexico and Canada for a month — until March 4 — to allow negotiations over his demands for the U.S. neighbors to secure their borders and stop the flow of the illegal drug fentanyl. The duties could affect about $1.323 trillion in trade imports that come from China, Mexico and Canada, according to U.S. government data. This accounts for 43% of U.S. imports and 5% of the $27 trillion U.S. gross domestic product. If enacted, the new import taxes on Canada, Mexico and China will increase the average tariff rate from its current level of 3% to 10.7% based on contemporary trade patterns, said Joseph Brusuelas, chief economist at financial advisory firm RSM. 'Should the trade skirmishes escalate to include the European Union and turn into an all-out trade war, expect U.S. economic growth to ease back to 2% as the tariffs drag down growth and employment, stoke inflation and widen the current account deficit, all amid higher interest rates,' he wrote on RSM’s Real Economy Blog.

US warns citizens of potential terror threats at key mosque in Pakistan's capital	ISLAMABAD — The United States advised its citizens Wednesday to steer clear of a popular mosque in Pakistan’s capital due to potential terrorist threats. The U.S. Embassy in Islamabad issued the threat alert following the emergence of a social media video earlier this week featuring a purported militant operative at the city’s Faisal Mosque, a major tourist destination. The brief video showed the individual displaying a hand-drawn pamphlet featuring the flag of the Tehrik-i-Taliban Pakistan (TTP), which the United Nations has listed as a global terrorist organization. The video was shared on Monday via social media affiliated with TTP. The U.S. diplomatic mission has prohibited employees from traveling to the mosque area until further notice. The advisory also urged American citizens to avoid the area, stating that 'TTP militants have issued threats against Faisal Mosque in Islamabad.' The terror threat alert was issued on the day Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan arrived in Islamabad for a bilateral visit, amid heightened security measures. TTP routinely stages suicide bombings and gun attacks against Pakistani security forces and other official targets, mainly in districts near and on the country’s border with Afghanistan. The violence has killed hundreds of people in recent years. Islamabad has maintained that the group orchestrates terrorist attacks from sanctuaries in Afghanistan and has persistently called on the neighboring country’s Taliban leaders to rein in TTP militants. The Taliban government in Kabul, not recognized by any country, denies the presence of TTP or any other foreign militant organizations on Afghan soil. It claims that no one is allowed to threaten neighboring countries and beyond from Afghanistan. Critics have questioned the Taliban's denial, pointing to the frequent high-profile attacks claimed or attributed to the Islamic State-Khorasan (IS-K), an Afghan affiliate of the transnational Islamic State terrorist network. The violence has killed hundreds of people, including senior Taliban leaders, religious figures and members of the Afghan Shiite community, since the Taliban reclaimed control of the country in 2021. On Monday, U.N. counterterrorism officials warned during a Security Council meeting that IS-K is one of the 'most dangerous' Islamic State branches. 'ISIL-Khorasan has continued to pose a significant threat in Afghanistan, the region and beyond,' Vladimir Voronkov, U.N. undersecretary-general for counterterrorism, told the meeting, using another acronym for IS-K. The latest IS-K-claimed attack occurred on Tuesday when a suicide bomber detonated himself outside a bank in the northeastern Afghan city of Kunduz. Taliban officials said the blast killed five people and injured seven others. Multiple sources reported that the victims were primarily members of the Taliban security forces.	https://www.voanews.com/a/us-warns-citizens-of-potential-terror-threats-at-key-mosque-in-pakistan-s-capital/7972680.html	2025-02-12T12:40:37-08:00	
Federal appeals court upholds singer R. Kelly's convictions, 30-year prison term	NEW YORK — R. Kelly's racketeering and sex trafficking convictions, along with a 30-year prison sentence, were upheld Wednesday by a federal appeals court that concluded the American singer exploited his fame for over a quarter century to sexually abuse girls and young women. The 2nd U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals in Manhattan ruled Wednesday after hearing arguments last March. The Grammy-winning, multiplatinum-selling R&B songwriter was convicted in 2021 in Brooklyn federal court of multiple charges, including racketeering and sex trafficking. Attorney Jennifer Bonjean, representing R. Kelly, said in a statement that she believed the Supreme Court will agree to hear an appeal. She called the 2nd Circuit ruling 'unprecedented,' saying it gives prosecutors limitless discretion to apply the racketeering law 'to situations absurdly remote' from the statute's intent. Last year, the high court declined to hear an appeal of a 20-year sentence Kelly received after he was convicted in 2022 of child sex charges including charges of producing images of child sexual abuse in Chicago. The 2nd Circuit rejected Kelly's arguments that the trial evidence was inadequate, the constitutionality of some state laws used against him were questionable, four jurors were biased, the trial judge made some improper rulings, and a racketeering charge more commonly used in organized crime cases was improper. 'Enabled by a constellation of managers, assistants, and other staff for over twenty-five years, Kelly exploited his fame to lure girls and young women into his grasp,' the appeals court said, noting members of his entourage helped introduce him to underage girls. 'Evidence at trial showed that he would isolate them from friends and family, control nearly every aspect of their lives, and abuse them verbally, physically, and sexually,' the three-judge panel said. The appeals court said it was 'neither arbitrary nor irrational' that several accusers were permitted to testify at trial that Kelly gave them herpes without disclosing he had an STD, and it was not unduly prejudicial or cumulative that seven witnesses who were not yet adults when Kelly began to abuse them were allowed to testify. 'None of the testimony was more inflammatory than the charged acts,' the appeals court said. The 2nd Circuit also said it was not unfairly prejudicial for the trial judge to let jurors view graphic videos. The videos, the appeals court said, 'were properly admitted to show the means and methods of the enterprise, including the level of control and dominance Kelly had over his victims.' Bonjean, in her statement on R. Kelly's behalf, also cited a partial dissent in which one 2nd Circuit judge, Richard J. Sullivan, concurred with what he described as the majority's 'excellent opinion,' but dissented in part over a restitution award given one victim for a lifetime supply of a suppressive regime of herpes medication. The award was based on the cost of the brand-name drug when a generic drug is available. 'This was not restitution. This was an effort by the government to unfairly enrich government witnesses for their testimony,' Bonjean said. Kelly, born Robert Sylvester Kelly, is known for work including the 1996 hit I Believe I Can Fly and the cult classic Trapped in the Closet, a multipart tale of sexual betrayal and intrigue. Kelly sold millions of albums and remained in demand even after allegations about his abuse of young girls began circulating publicly in the 1990s. He was acquitted of child sexual abuse image charges in Chicago in 2008, but a second trial in Chicago in 2022 ended with his conviction on charges of producing images of child sexual abuse and enticing girls for sex. Widespread outrage over Kelly's sexual misconduct did not emerge until the #MeToo reckoning, reaching a crescendo after the release of the documentary Surviving R. Kelly.	https://www.voanews.com/a/federal-appeals-court-upholds-singer-r-kelly-s-convictions-and-30-year-prison-term/7972508.html	2025-02-12T11:55:25-08:00

Zimbabwe to pay displaced, foreign white farmers	HARARE, ZIMBABWE — Zimbabwe’s government said Wednesday it will compensate foreign investors who lost assets in the country’s controversial land reforms in the early 2000s but were protected by bilateral investment protection agreements. Zimbabwean Finance Minister Mthuli Ncube said in a statement the government will pay 94 former farmers from countries such as Switzerland, Denmark, Germany, Netherlands and the former Yugoslavia. The farmers are covered under Bilateral Investment Protection and Promotion Agreements, or BIPPAs, that Zimbabwe signed with the farmers’ countries. Ncube said $20 million is being paid out of the 2024 budget and another $20 million would come from the 2025 budget. 'This is a very important issue for our arrears clearance and debt resolution process for Zimbabwe, because some of the countries for which we want support, their farmers, their investors, into Zimbabwe were affected by the land reform program in the early 2000s,' Ncube said. 'But we're only targeting those countries where the BIPPAs were ratified properly.' The aim, he said, is to have cleared the entire $146 million liability for BIPPA farmers by the end of 2028. 'We believe that this is very important for building trust, for honoring our commitments,' he said. Zimbabwe’s government is aiming to rebuild its financial reputation after requesting debt relief and restructuring from international financial institutions and other countries in 2022. According to the African Development Bank, Zimbabwe's total foreign debt is $21 billion — including interest — which it has been failing to service for years. However, Eddie Mahembe, an independent economist based in Harare, says resettled farmers, not the government, should pay the $146 million, to prevent increasing the country’s debt. 'Why is the government paying for the farms which were allocated to individuals?' Mahembe said. 'They are farming. Some are doing tobacco. They've been selling their tobacco over the years, and we are seeing ... that there is now a move toward giving them title deals. Why is the government assuming that debt?' Others are concerned that Harare is paying only former farmers of foreign origin. Displaced white Zimbabwean farmers want to be compensated as well, as per a 2020 agreement. That agreement called for Harare to pay $3.5 billion to the farmers driven off their land under a program backed by then-President Robert Mugabe starting in 2000. Trevor Gifford, former head of Zimbabwe’s Commercial Farmers Union, said, 'Twenty-five years from the start of land reform in Zimbabwe, the majority of displaced title deed holders remain destitute due to the nonpayment of compensation. The government failed to honor its commitment on paying [on time] under the global compensation agreement, which is now expired.' He said the government’s move to give title deeds to the farmers who took over the land will create confusion and keep away foreign investors. 'The issuing of title deeds on top of existing title deeds, which have still not been paid for in terms of the international norms for land reform, is reckless and does not create any confidence for prospective investments in Zimbabwe,' Gifford said. Graham Rae was displaced from his farm about 100 kilometers east of Harare and is now farming in neighboring Zambia. He said that until he is compensated, he will not surrender title deeds to the land for which he was dispossessed. 'You can't steal a car and then sell it to me and think you've washed your hands and now it's a legal car,' Rae said. 'It's still illegal and by the mere fact that I'm buying a stolen car from you, I'm complicit in the theft, so there are going to be lots of problems. I find that fraudulent, I just find that very sad that Zimbabwe has regressed into a basket case where there's no rule of law, and that the rule really is at the barrel of a gun — if you don't agree, you disappear.' For now, the Zimbabwe government says it will issue titles to the resettled farmers so that they can use them to borrow money for capitalization of their businesses.	https://www.voanews.com/a/zimbabwe-to-pay-displaced-foreign-white-farmers/7972468.html	2025-02-12T10:35:54-08:00	
Key Islamic State planner killed in airstrike, US and Somali officials say	WASHINGTON — Ahmed Maeleninine, an Omani-born leader of Islamic State, was killed in U.S. airstrikes against the terror group in Somalia earlier this month, officials of the Puntland region said Wednesday. Maeleninine was the main target of the Feb. 1 airstrike against Islamic State hideouts in the semi-autonomous region of northern Somalia. In an interview with VOA Somali, the Puntland state minister for presidency, Abdifitah Mohamed Abdinur, said Somalia and its international security partners had been watching Maeleninine’s movements in the region. 'He was an Omani-born man in his 40s who was wanted for international crimes and his movements and activities have been followed at least for the last two years, as he was hiding in the mountainous area of Puntland,' Abdinur said. 'He was a thorn removed from the flesh of Somalis and the world population, and he eventually tasted what he deserved.' The U.S. Africa Command (AFRICOM) confirmed late Tuesday that Maeleninine and 13 other operatives linked to the Islamic State — also known as IS, ISIL or Daesh — were killed in the Feb. 1 operation, which it said was run in coordination with the Somali government. In a statement, AFRICOM described Maeleninine as a 'recruiter, financier, and external operations leader responsible for the deployment of jihadists into the United States and across Europe.' Abdinur said Puntland officials are still collecting the names and nationalities of the other 13 IS figures killed and will share them with the media when their identities are confirmed. Assessing the success of the U.S. strikes was delayed due to the location of the targets and the terrain — a series of cave complexes in the Cal Miskaad area of Somalia's Golis Mountains. At the time, a Somalia commander told VOA the U.S. strikes had targeted at least 10 locations. Residents in Qandala, a small town in Puntland’s Bari region, not far from the site of the attacks, told VOA that they heard at least seven explosions and saw plumes of smoke and flames. IS has increased its presence in Somalia over the past several years, while IS-Somalia has become a key cog in the IS financial network, funneling money to affiliates in Afghanistan and elsewhere in Africa. The Somali branch has simultaneously become more influential under the leadership of Abdulkadir Mumin, a former militant with al-Qaida-linked al-Shabab, who is thought to head IS's directorate of provinces, overseeing the terror group's affiliates in Africa. Some U.S. officials worry Mumin has risen even higher, perhaps acting as Islamic State's top emir. Others disagree, but there is consensus that Mumin is nonetheless a pivotal figure. VOA’s Jeff Seldin, Harun Maruf and Fadumo Jama contributed to this report.	https://www.voanews.com/a/key-islamic-state-planner-killed-in-airstrike-us-and-somali-officials-say/7972276.html	2025-02-12T10:34:59-08:00	
RFE/RL journalist released from Belarus jail	WASHINGTON — A journalist with VOA’s sister outlet, Radio Free Europe/Radio Liberty, was released from Belarus on Wednesday, after spending more than four years imprisoned in a case that was widely viewed as politically motivated. Andrey Kuznechyk, a journalist with RFE/RL’s Belarus service was released from Belarus on Wednesday, RFE/RL said. RFE/RL President Stephen Capus welcomed Kuznechyk’s release. 'This is a joyous day for Andrey, his wife, and their two young children. After more than three years apart, this family is together again thanks to President Trump. We are also grateful to Secretary Rubio and his team, and to the Lithuanian government for their support,' Capus said in a statement. The terms of the deal were not immediately clear. Kuznechyk had been jailed since November 2021. He was initially sentenced to 10 days in jail on hooliganism charges, which he rejected. When Kuznechyk was due to be released, authorities kept him in prison and added an additional charge of creating an extremist group. In a trial that lasted only one day, a regional court found Kuznechyk guilty in June 2022 and sentenced him to six years in prison. RFE/RL and the U.S. Agency for Global Media, which oversees RFE/RL and VOA, consistently rejected the charges against Kuznechyk and called for his release. Belarus ranks among the worst jailers of journalists in the world. As of early December, at least 31 journalists were jailed there over their work, according to the Committee to Protect Journalists. Another RFE/RL journalist — Ihar Losik — has been jailed in Belarus since 2020 on charges he and his employer reject. 'We remain hopeful that our journalist Ihar Losik will also be released and look to the Trump administration for its continued leadership and guidance,' Capus said in a statement. Three other RFE/RL journalists are currently jailed in Russian-occupied Crimea, Russia and Azerbaijan, all on charges that are viewed as politically motivated. The Belarusian government has embarked on a severe crackdown on independent journalists and other critics ever since longtime President Alexander Lukashenko claimed victory in a 2020 presidential election that was widely viewed as rigged. More than 1,200 political prisoners are currently detained in Belarus, according to the rights group Viasna.	https://www.voanews.com/a/rfe-rl-journalist-released-from-belarus-jail-/7972466.html	2025-02-12T10:17:54-08:00	
Middle East strategy central during Turkish President Erdogan's visit to Pakistan, experts say	Pakistan rolls out the red carpet Wednesday for Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan.

Trump vows to 'immediately' negotiate for end to Ukraine war	President Donald Trump announced Wednesday he and Russia’s leader agreed in a phone call to 'immediately' begin negotiations with Ukraine’s leader to bring an end to the nearly three-year-conflict. 'We will begin by calling President Zelenskyy, of Ukraine, to inform him of the conversation, something which I will be doing right now,' Trump said on his social media platform Truth Social. 'I have asked Secretary of State Marco Rubio, Director of the CIA John Ratcliffe, National Security Advisor Michael Waltz, and Ambassador and Special Envoy Steve Witkoff, to lead the negotiations which, I feel strongly, will be successful.' Trump did not specify what the terms might be to end the Russia-Ukraine conflict. But Secretary of Defense Pete Hegseth, in Germany Wednesday for a meeting of the Ukraine Defense Contact Group, ruled out a key demand by Ukraine’s: eventual membership in NATO. 'The United States does not believe that NATO membership for Ukraine is a realistic outcome of a negotiated settlement,' Hegseth said. Trump’s top hostage negotiator on Wednesday credited Trump’s 'great friendship' with Russia’s leader and with Saudi Arabia’s prince as key in releasing American teacher Marc Fogel from Russian custody late Tuesday. 'I think that getting Mark Fogel out was critical and the Russians were very, very helpful in that effort and very accommodating,' Witkoff said, speaking to reporters at the White House. 'And I think that's maybe a sign about how that working relationship between President Trump and President Putin will be in the future and what that may portend for the world at large for conflict and so forth. I think they had a great friendship. And I think now it's going to continue and it's a really good thing for the world.' Trump welcomed Fogel to the White House late Tuesday. He had been detained since August 2021 for bringing medically prescribed marijuana into the country. 'I feel like the luckiest man on Earth right now,' Fogel said as he stood next to Trump at the White House late Tuesday. Trump said he appreciated what Russia did in letting Fogel go home but declined to specify the details of any agreement with Russia beyond calling it 'very fair' and very reasonable.' Trump also said another hostage release would be announced Wednesday. Waltz, Trump’s national security adviser, said earlier Tuesday the United States and Russia 'negotiated an exchange' to free Fogel but gave no details about what the U.S. side of the bargain entailed. In such deals in recent years, the U.S has often released Russian prisoners that Moscow wanted in exchange. Instead, Waltz cast the deal for Fogel’s release in broader geopolitical terms, saying it was 'a show of good faith from the Russians and a sign we are moving in the right direction to end the brutal and terrible war in Ukraine,' an invasion Russia launched against its neighbor in February 2022, with hundreds of thousands killed or wounded on both sides. Trump had vowed to broker an end to Russia’s war on Ukraine before taking office January 20, but his aides more recently have said he hopes to do it within the first 100 days of his new administration, roughly by the end of April. 'Since President Trump’s swearing-in, he has successfully secured the release of Americans detained around the world, and President Trump will continue until all Americans being held are returned to the United States,' Waltz said. The recent release of six Americans held in Venezuela and Fogel’s freeing are the only publicly known instances. Fogel had been traveling with a small amount of medically prescribed marijuana to treat back pain. Once convicted by a Russian court, he began serving his 14-year sentence in June 2022, with the outgoing administration of former President Joe Biden late last year classifying him as wrongfully detained.	https://www.voanews.com/a/trump-vows-to-immediately-negotiate-for-end-to-ukraine-war/7972444.html	2025-02-12T09:54:05-08:00	
Senate approves Trump’s nominee to lead US intelligence	WASHINGTON — U.S. President Donald Trump’s effort to overhaul the country’s intelligence apparatus appears set to move forward, with lawmakers confirming Tulsi Gabbard as the nation’s next director of national intelligence. The Senate voted 52-48 in favor of Gabbard on Wednesday, narrowly rejecting concerns about her experience and past statements on leaks of classified intelligence and other matters. Gabbard got support from every Republican senator except for former Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, who joined Democrats in opposing her confirmation. 'The intelligence community needs to refocus on its core mission — collecting intelligence and providing unbiased analysis of that information,' said Republican Majority Leader John Thune, praising Gabbard on Monday as lawmakers began debating her nomination. 'That’s what Tulsi Gabbard is committed to ensuring,' Thune said. 'And I believe she has the knowledge and leadership capabilities to get it done.' Democrats were less enthusiastic, making last minute pleas to their Republican colleagues to reject Gabbard. 'We simply cannot, in good conscience, trust our most classified secrets to someone who echoes Russian propaganda and falls for conspiracy theories,' said Minority Leader Chuck Schumer, addressing lawmakers before Wednesday’s vote. Schumer also alleged that most Republicans secretly agree. 'If we had a secret ballot, Gabbard might get 10 votes,' he said. 'People know. That's why they raise so many questions. But Donald Trump and Elon Musk evidently threaten them, and they're changing their view.' Trump selected Gabbard in November, praising her 'fearless spirit.' But the former Democratic representative from the state of Hawaii and one-time Democratic presidential candidate faced criticism from Democrats and some Republicans. Gabbard’s nomination to serve as director of national intelligence advanced to the full Senate by a 9-8 party-line vote in the Senate Intelligence Committee. 'It's fair to say Ms. Gabbard's nomination has generated a bit more interest and attention than do most nominees before this committee,' Senate Intelligence Committee Chairman Tom Cotton, a Republican, acknowledged during Gabbard’s confirmation hearing late last month. During the hearing, Gabbard was questioned repeatedly by Republicans and Democrats about Edward Snowden, a former National Security Agency contractor accused of leaking thousands of classified documents before ultimately fleeing to Russia, and specifically about legislation she introduced to pardon him. Each time they asked whether she considered Snowden a traitor, Gabbard declined to answer. 'Senator, my heart is with my commitment to our Constitution and our nation's security,' Gabbard said during once exchange with Republican Senator James Lankford. Senators also questioned Gabbard about a 2017 trip to Syria, during which she met with then-Syrian President Bashar al-Assad, despite allegations he had used chemical weapons against civilians, and about her comments about Russia’s February 2022 invasion of Ukraine. 'I continue to have significant concerns about your judgment and your qualifications,' said Warner, a Democrat. 'Repeatedly, you have excused our adversaries' worst actions, [and] instead often blame them on the United States.' Gabbard, however, managed to find common ground with the committee’s Republican senators, winning over Susan Collins and Todd Young. Young also shared a letter from Gabbard in which she pledged to hold U.S. intelligence employees and contractors accountable for intelligence leaks and to 'not advocate for any protections which should only be extended to lawful and legitimate whistleblowers.' Gabbard further promised to not make any recommendation 'regarding the legal standing of Edward Snowden' to the U.S. attorney general or to Trump. And she pledged to support the use of warrantless surveillance capabilities despite her opposition to the program while she was a lawmaker.

US defense chief: Return to Ukraine's 2014 borders 'unrealistic'	U.S. Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth told NATO military allies on Wednesday that Ukraine’s hoped-for return to its 2014 borders is an 'unrealistic objective,' and that the United States does not believe that Kyiv membership in NATO is a 'realistic outcome' of a negotiated end to Russia’s three-year war on Ukraine. Speaking in Brussels at NATO headquarters, Hegseth told his fellow defense chiefs, 'We want, like you, a sovereign and prosperous Ukraine. But we must start by recognizing that returning to Ukraine’s pre-2014 borders is an unrealistic objective. Chasing this illusionary goal will only prolong the war and cause more suffering.' No peace talks have been scheduled, but Hegseth said any durable conclusion to the war must include 'robust security guarantees to ensure that the war will not begin again.' 'The United States does not believe that NATO membership for Ukraine is a realistic outcome of a negotiated settlement,' he said, which would invoke the military alliance’s mutual defense provision among NATO’s 32 member nations that requires each of them to help defend each other when they are attacked. Kyiv has long sought NATO membership, and the alliance’s other member nations have said they are committed to it, but not while the war rages on. Instead, Hegseth said security guarantees for Ukraine should be backed by 'capable European and non-European troops.' 'If these troops are deployed as peacekeepers to Ukraine at any point, they should be deployed as part of a non-NATO mission, and they should not be covered under Article 5,' he said, referring to the alliance's mutual defense clause. Russia annexed Ukraine’s Crimean Peninsula in 2014, supported pro-Russian separatists fighting against Kyiv’s forces in eastern Ukraine in the ensuing years and then launched a full-scale invasion in February 2022. It now controls about 20% of Ukraine’s pre-2014 territory. Before taking office to begin his second term in the White House, U.S. President Donald Trump said he would resolve the Russia-Ukraine conflict even before being inaugurated. More recently, his aides say he hopes for a peace pact in the first 100 days of his new term, roughly by the end of April. Under former President Joe Biden, the U.S. was Ukraine’s biggest military benefactor. Trump has often voiced skepticism of continued U.S. support, refusing to say at a political debate last year that he wanted Ukraine to win the war. Now Trump appears intent on getting Europe to assume most of the financial and military responsibilities for the defense of Ukraine. He also has suggested that going forward, Ukraine should pay for continued U.S. support by giving the United States access to its rare earth minerals needed to produce technology products. 'Members of this [Ukraine] contact group must meet the moment,' Hegseth said to the assembled group of about 50 member countries that have provided $126 billion worth of weapons and military assistance to Ukraine since Russia's 2022 invasion. 'We hear you,' British Defense Secretary John Healey said in response to Hegseth's opening remarks. Hegseth said that NATO members must increase their defense spending to 5% of their national economies, a figure that no NATO country currently allocates. The U.S. is at 3.4%, with Poland the highest NATO country at 4.12%. The current NATO defense spending goal is 2% of each country’s national economy, a figure that 23 of the 32 countries meet, up from six in 2021 after Trump chided other NATO countries about the issue during his first presidential term. Hegseth would not commit the U.S. to the 5% figure, saying it was up to Trump. 'We live in fiscally constrained times,' Hegseth said, and need to be responsible with taxpayer money. But the U.S. defense leader said, 'The United States will no longer tolerate an imbalanced relationship [among NATO members] which encourages dependence [on the U.S.]; rather our relationship will prioritize empowering Europe to own responsibility for its own security.' NATO leaders are expected to agree on new spending targets at their next planned summit, in The Hague, Netherlands, June 24-26. Some information for this report came from The Associated Press and Reuters.	https://www.voanews.com/a/us-defense-chief-return-to-ukraine-2014-borders-unrealistic/7972400.html	2025-02-12T09:20:29-08:00	
Rubio heads to Munich amid diplomatic push for Ukraine peace deal	STATE DEPARTMENT — U.S. Secretary of State Marco Rubio is set to depart Thursday for Munich and later this week will visit the Middle East amid an intensive diplomatic push to end Russia’s aggression in Ukraine, as well as efforts to follow up on U.S. President Donald Trump’s plan for the post-war Gaza Strip. Preparations are also underway for Rubio to hold talks with his counterparts from Japan and South Korea on the sidelines of the Munich Security Conference, according to people familiar with the plan who spoke with VOA on condition of anonymity. If the meeting takes place as expected, it would be the first U.S.-Japan-South Korea foreign ministerial trilateral under the Trump administration. Ukraine As Russia’s invasion of Ukraine approaches its third year, the U.S. is pursuing multiple diplomatic avenues to secure a peace deal. Although not directly linked to efforts to secure a peace deal, U.S. officials have described Russia’s Tuesday release of American schoolteacher Marc Fogel as 'a show of good faith from the Russians' and 'a sign that we are moving in the right direction to end' the brutal war in Ukraine. Rubio has said that the U.S. will reaffirm its determination to end the war during meetings at the Munich Security Conference, a high-profile international security forum running from Feb. 14 to 16. U.S. Vice President J.D. Vance and Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy are set to hold in-person talks in Munich. U.S. Special Envoy for Ukraine and Russia Keith Kellogg and Zelenskyy’s chief of staff, Andriy Yermak, will also attend the conference. Ukraine has said that its delegation will present its position on ending the war and outline its vision for achieving a lasting peace. Meanwhile, negotiations are in progress as Ukraine seeks security guarantees from the U.S. and Europe. Ukraine is willing to offer U.S. companies lucrative reconstruction contracts, Zelenskyy told The Guardian newspaper in an interview this week. He also said that if Trump manages to bring him and Russian President Vladimir Putin to the negotiating table, he would offer a land swap: Ukrainian-occupied territory in Kursk in exchange for Russian-held land in Ukraine. Rare earth minerals Trump has expressed interest in making continued military aid conditional on access to Ukraine's raw materials. Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent visited Kyiv on Wednesday for talks on energy and rare earth minerals. He is the first cabinet-level official in the Trump administration to visit the country. More than four dozen minerals, including several types of rare earths, nickel and lithium, are considered critical to the U.S. economy and national defense. Ukraine has large deposits of uranium, lithium and titanium. Russia has gained control over a significant portion of Ukraine's identified mineral resources in the territories it occupies. If Russia permanently seizes that land, Ukraine will lose access to those minerals and other reserves, which would be a blow to both European and U.S. security. First US-Japan-ROK trilateral Rubio’s expected talks with both Japanese Foreign Minister Takeshi Iwaya and South Korean Foreign Minister Cho Tae-yul in Munich would take place amid concerns over North Korea’s military ties with Russia, China’s support for Russia’s defense industry, and security challenges in the Indo-Pacific. On Jan. 21, Rubio met with Iwaya in Washington to discuss strengthening U.S.-Japan cooperation against global security threats, including what officials describe as 'China’s destabilizing actions' in the Indo-Pacific. The following day, he spoke with Cho by phone, where both emphasized the need to further trilateral cooperation among the U.S., Japan and South Korea. 'We need to do more and strengthen relationships with our friends around the world,' said Republican Congressman Rob Wittman of Virginia during a discussion hosted by the Washington-based Center for Strategic and International Studies, or CSIS, on Tuesday. 'We should be concerned about China's growing relationships with countries like Russia,' he added. Wittman serves as the vice chairman of the House Armed Services Committee. He described the military cooperation between Russia and North Korea as 'transactional,' adding that Moscow’s technology transfers to Pyongyang are not out of the 'goodness of the heart.' The U.S.-Japan-ROK trilateral framework was established under former president Joe Biden’s administration. Experts, including former senior State Department official Rick Waters, note that such trilateral cooperation has become increasingly institutionalized, making it 'hard to reverse' — even amid South Korea’s political turmoil following President Yoon Suk Yeol’s impeachment over his brief martial law attempt last December. 'I’d be very surprised if, in four years, we would see anything other than further consolidation' of existing U.S. alliance frameworks in the Indo-Pacific,' Waters said Tuesday at the CSIS event. Middle East Rubio will travel to the Middle East after holding talks with his counterparts in Munich. On Tuesday, he spoke with UAE President Sheikh Mohamed bin Zayed Al Nahyan ahead of his visit to Abu Dhabi, the country’s capital, next week. They 'discussed the ceasefire agreement in Gaza and the importance of ensuring that Hamas releases all hostages, including American citizens,' according to the State Department. Spokesperson Tammy Bruce said that the two also 'highlighted the imperative of ensuring that Hamas can never rule Gaza or threaten Israel again' during the call. Trump said this week the Hamas militant group must release all hostages held in Gaza by midday Saturday, or he will propose canceling the Israel-Hamas ceasefire. Rubio is scheduled to travel to Munich, Jerusalem, Riyadh and Abu Dhabi from Feb. 13-18.	https://www.voanews.com/a/rubio-heads-to-munich-amid-diplomatic-push-for-ukraine-peace-deal/7972321.html	2025-02-12T08:34:55-08:00	
White House blocks AP reporter from Oval Office event over ‘Gulf of America’ policy	The White House blocked an Associated Press reporter from an event in the Oval Office on Tuesday because the news agency has not altered its style on the Gulf of Mexico, which U.S. President Donald Trump has ordered renamed to the Gulf of America, the news agency said. Julie Pace, the AP’s executive editor, said the White House informed the nonprofit news agency that the AP would be blocked from the Oval Office event if the outlet did not align its editorial standards with Trump’s Jan. 20 executive order renaming the Gulf of Mexico to the Gulf of America. An AP reporter attempted to enter the White House event on Tuesday afternoon but was turned away. Later Tuesday night, a second AP reporter was barred from an event in the White House Diplomatic Room. 'As a global news organization, The Associated Press informs billions of people around the world every day with factual, nonpartisan journalism,' Pace said in a statement. 'It is alarming that the Trump administration would punish AP for its independent journalism,' Pace said. 'Limiting our access to the Oval Office based on the content of AP’s speech not only severely impedes the public’s access to independent news, it plainly violates the First Amendment.' The White House Correspondents’ Association, or WHCA, also condemned the decision as 'unacceptable.' 'The White House cannot dictate how news organizations report the news,' WHCA President Eugene Daniels said in a statement. The White House did not immediately reply to a VOA request for comment in response to the AP and WHCA statements. Shortly after being inaugurated, Trump signed an executive order to rename the Gulf of Mexico and Denali, the highest peak in North America. According to his order, the Gulf of Mexico would be renamed the Gulf of America, and Denali would revert to Mount McKinley — its name before President Barack Obama changed it in 2015. A few days later, the AP announced that the news agency would continue referring to the body of water as the Gulf of Mexico while acknowledging the new name Trump had picked. The AP said it made that decision because the gulf has carried the Gulf of Mexico name for more than 400 years and that other countries and international bodies do not need to recognize the name change. However, since the area of the Alaskan mountain lies entirely in the United States and Trump has authority to change the name, the AP said it will use the name Mount McKinley. Thousands of journalists and writers around the world follow the AP’s style. Voice of America typically follows the AP’s style, but VOA’s standards editor announced in late January that the congressionally funded but editorially independent news outlet would begin referring to the body of water as the Gulf of America, in addition to referring to the mountain as Mount McKinley. Some information in this report came from The Associated Press.	https://www.voanews.com/a/white-house-blocks-ap-reporter-from-oval-office-event-over-gulf-of-america-policy/7972268.html	2025-02-12T08:00:25-08:00	
Cost of groceries, gas goes up as US inflation worsens	WASHINGTON — U.S. inflation accelerated last month as the cost of groceries, gas and used cars rose, a disappointment for families and businesses struggling with higher costs and likely underscoring the Federal Reserve's resolve to delay any further interest rate cuts. The consumer price index increased 3% in January from a year ago, Wednesday's report from the Labor Department showed, up from 2.9% the previous month. It has increased from a 3½-year low of 2.4% in September. The figures show that inflation has remained stubbornly above the Fed's 2% target for roughly the past six months, after it fell steadily for about a year and a half. Elevated prices created a major political problem for former President Joe Biden. President Donald Trump pledged to reduce prices in last year's campaign, although most economists worry that his many proposed tariffs could at least temporarily increase costs. The unexpected boost in inflation could dampen some of the business enthusiasm that arose after Trump's election on promises to reduce regulation and cut taxes. Dow futures tumbled 400 points, and all major markets are likely to sell off at the opening bell. Bond yields rose, a sign traders expect inflation and interest rates to remain high. Excluding the volatile food and energy categories, core consumer prices rose 3.3% in January compared with a year ago, up from 3.2% in December. Economists closely watch core prices because they can provide a better read of inflation's future. Month-to-month inflation Inflation also worsened monthly, with prices jumping 0.5% in January from December, the largest increase since August 2023. Core prices climbed 0.4% last month, the most since March 2024. Grocery prices climbed 0.5% just in January, pushed higher by a 15.2% surge in egg prices, the biggest monthly increase since June of 2015. Egg prices have soared 53% compared with a year ago. An avian flu epidemic has forced many egg producers to cull millions of birds from their flocks. Some stores have imposed limits on egg purchases, and some restaurants have placed surcharges on egg dishes. The cost of car insurance continues to rise and picked up 2% just from December to January. Hotel prices rose 1.4% last month, while the cost of a gallon of gas moved up 1.8%. Inflation often jumps in January as many companies raise their prices at the beginning of the year, although the government's seasonal adjustment process is supposed to filter out those effects. Later Wednesday, Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell will testify before the House Financial Services Committee, where he will likely be asked about inflation and the Fed's response to it. The Fed raised its benchmark rate in 2022 and 2023 to a two-decade high of 5.3% to combat inflation. With inflation down significantly from its 9.1% peak in June 2022, it cut its rate to about 4.3% in its final three meetings last year. Interest rates and tariffs Early Wednesday, Trump said on social media that interest rates should be lowered, 'something which would go hand in hand with upcoming Tariffs!!!' Yet the tick up in consumer prices makes it less likely the Fed will cut rates anytime soon. Fed officials are mostly confident that inflation over time will head lower, but they want to see further evidence that it is declining before cutting their key rate any further. The Fed's rate typically influences other borrowing costs for things such as mortgages, auto loans and credit cards. Inflation's recent uptick is a major reason the Federal Reserve has paused its interest rate cuts, after implementing three of them last year. 'We do not need to be in a hurry' to implement further reductions, Powell said Tuesday in testimony to the Senate Banking Committee. The Trump administration's tariff policy could lift prices in the coming months. Trump on Monday imposed 25% taxes on steel and aluminum imports and has pledged to impose more tariffs. Economists at Goldman Sachs forecast that yearly core inflation would fall almost a full percentage point, to 2.3%, by the end of this year, absent any import duties. But they expect tariffs will raise end-of-year inflation to 2.8%. On Tuesday, Powell acknowledged that higher tariffs could lift inflation and limit the central bank's ability to cut rates, calling it 'a possible outcome.' But he emphasized that it would depend on how many imports are hit with tariffs and for how long. 'In some cases, it doesn't reach the consumer much, and in some cases it does,' Powell said. 'And it really does depend on facts that we haven't seen yet.'	https://www.voanews.com/a/cost-of-groceries-gas-goes-up-as-us-inflation-worsens/7972230.html	2025-02-12T07:29:23-08:00	
Evacuations in eastern Ukraine's Pokrovsk as Russian forces inch closer	Ukrainian forces are trying to slow down an ongoing Russian advance toward the city of Pokrovsk in Eastern Ukraine's Dontesk region. The Ukrainian government has been evacuating civilians from the region, but constant shelling is making it dangerous. Kateryna Besedina has the story, narrated by Anna Rice.

UN rights office estimates up to 1,400 killed in crackdown on protests in Bangladesh	Geneva — The U.N. human rights office on Wednesday estimated that up to 1,400 people may have been killed in Bangladesh over three weeks last summer in a crackdown on student-led protests against the now-ousted former prime minister. In a new report, the Geneva-based office says security and intelligence services 'systematically engaged' in rights violations that could amount to crimes against humanity and require further investigation. Citing 'various credible sources,' the rights office said it estimated that as many as 1,400 people may have been killed in the protests between July 15 and Aug. 5 — the day longtime Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina fled to India amid the uprising. Thousands more were injured in the weeks leading up to and after the protests, and the vast majority of those killed and injured 'were shot by Bangladesh's security forces,' the report said. Over 11,700 people were detained, the report said, citing information from security services. It said that about 12 to 13% of people estimated to have be killed —- or as many as about 180 people — were children. In some cases, 'security forces engaged in summary executions by deliberately shooting unarmed protesters at point blank range,' it said. U.N. human rights chief Volker Türk cited signs that 'extrajudicial killings, extensive arbitrary arrests and detentions, and torture' were conducted with the knowledge and coordination of the political leadership and top security officials as a way to suppress the protests. The U.N. fact-finding team was deployed to Bangladesh at the invitation of the country's interim leader, the Nobel Peace laureate Muhammad Yunus, to look into the uprising and violent crackdown. The team of investigators said the interim government has reportedly made 100 arrests in connection with attacks on religious and indigenous groups. The report said 'many perpetrators of acts of revenge, violence and attacks on distinct groups apparently continue to enjoy impunity.' The human rights situation in Bangladesh continues to raise concerns, the U.N. office said. While the government has changed, 'the system has not necessarily changed,' Rory Mungoven, head of the rights office's Asia-Pacific region, told reporters. 'Many officials and people who had served or been appointed under the previous regime continue to function,' he said. Such a situation creates 'a potential conflict of interest' and could impede reforms and accountability, Mungoven added. The investigators issued dozens of recommendations to the government, such as steps to improve the justice system and setting up a witness protection program. It also recommended banning the use of lethal firearms by security forces to disperse crowds unless they are faced with 'imminent threat of death or serious injury.' In a statement after the report was published, Yunus reiterated his government's commitment to upholding the rule of law and said it was crucial to reform the country's law enforcement and justice sectors. 'I call on everyone working inside these institutions to side with justice, the law, and the people of Bangladesh in holding to account their own peers and others who have broken the law and violated the human and civil rights of their fellow citizens,' he said. What began as peaceful demonstrations by students frustrated with a quota system for government jobs unexpectedly grew into a major uprising against Hasina and her ruling Awami League party. A High Court decision in early June that reinstated the quota system was the 'immediate trigger' to the protests, which were also fueled by long standing grievances about economic inequality and a lack of rights, the report said.	https://www.voanews.com/a/un-rights-office-estimates-up-to-1-400-killed-in-crackdown-on-protests-in-bangladesh/7972079.html	2025-02-12T05:49:48-08:00

Paul McCartney rocks the Bowery - Inside his surprise NYC concert	New York — Paul McCartney’s previous New York-area performance took place three years ago at MetLife Stadium, capacity 82,500. His surprise show Tuesday night at the Bowery Ballroom fit, at most, 575. It was probably less than that since McCartney’s sound board and gear — too much to fit backstage — occupied a portion of the floor space at the venerable downtown theater. The whole thing felt like, and was, a lark. McCartney announced the show just hours before taking the stage. Like an echo of Beatlemania, the news swept through Manhattan and beyond earlier in the day, sending New Yorkers sprinting down Delancey Street for a chance to snag one of the few tickets at the Bowery. Most in attendance, including McCartney, himself, could hardly believe it was happening. 'So, here we are,' McCartney said, grinning. 'Some little gig. New York. Why not?' Later, before launching into 'Let Me Roll It,' he added: 'I can’t quite believe we’re here, doing this. But we are here, doing this.' It was not McCartney’s first impromptu concert. The Beatles famously performed in 1969 atop the roof of their Apple Corps headquarters at 3 Savile Row in London. Since then, he’s made something of a habit of it on trips to New York. In 2009, McCartney returned to the Ed Sullivan Theater, site of the Beatles’ famous U.S. debut, and performed above the marquee. In 2018, he popped up in Grand Central Terminal to promote the release of his 'Egyptian Station.' With temperatures in the low 30s on Tuesday, McCartney, 82, this time opted for an intimate, indoor show. Tickets were sold only physically at the venue, one per person. All were snapped up within about 30 minutes. For those quick enough, it was like hitting the lottery. Amy Jaffe, 69, was at home about 30 blocks north when she saw the announcement on Instagram. 'I thought: I can do this,' Jaffe said before the show. 'I put on jeans, grabbed a coat, called a Lyft.' Jaffe has seen McCartney many times before, including with the Beatles in 1964 in Forrest Hills, Queens. But she was still incredulous, smiling and shaking her head: 'I don’t actually believe it.' Phil Sokoloff, 31, was on his way to work nearby when he saw the news. He ran in and told his co-worker, Mat Fuller, and they rushed over to the Bowery Ballroom. 'We just got lucky,' Sokoloff said. 'I’m always learning about these things the day after.' McCartney took the stage roughly on time at 6:30 p.m. with his regular band, along with a three-member horn section. They had only rehearsed once, the day before, McCartney said. Someone shouted: 'You don’t need to rehearse!' If the location was stripped down, the former Beatle didn’t come with a minimized show, packing in a blistering tour through his entire catalog, from Beatles classics to Wings hits. He began with 'A Hard Day’s Night' and also performed 'Got To Get You Into My Life,' 'Maybe I’m Amazed,' 'Lady Madonna,' 'Jet,' 'Get Back,' 'Ob-La-Di, Ob-La-Da,' 'Let it Be' and 'Hey Jude.' 'Blackbird' was a solo number on acoustic guitar, and afterward McCartney reflected on how he wrote it for the Civil Rights Movement, a memory that brought back his first trips to the United States. 'We were just kids,' McCartney said. 'I’ve got grandchildren older than that now.' In the early days, he said, he and John Lennon were always writing for the audience, and the songs were all about reaching out: 'I Want to Hold Your Hand,' 'From Me to You.' 'It had everything to do with the fans, really,' McCartney said. Before playing the Wings song 'Mrs. Vanderbilt,' McCartney spoke of playing it in front of 350,000 people in Kyiv, when Ukraine was exuberant with a newfound freedom. 'Let’s hope it gets back to that soon,' he said. Conversation, mixed with shouts from the audience, peppered the set. After one particularly shrill scream, McCartney responded. 'That was a Beatles scream.' Then he asked for more, saying, 'OK, let’s get it out of the way. Girls, give me a Beatles scream.' All in attendance obliged. McCartney also performed the so-called last Beatles song, 'Now and Then,' a ballad penned by Lennon in the late ’70s but only released in 2023 with the help of the some of the technology used in Peter Jackson’s 2021 documentary, 'The Beatles: Get Back.' The song made McCartney wistful for his songwriting partner, whom he noted loved New York. 'Let’s hear it for John,' he said. McCartney, who was spotted Sunday at the Super Bowl in New Orleans chatting with Adam Sandler, was in New York for the upcoming 'Saturday Night Live' 50th anniversary festivities. He’s to be a guest on the star-studded television special Sunday. It was unclear if McCartney was playing a single show or preparing for something more. He wrapped the Got Back Tour in December and has said he’s hoping to finish a new album this year. For now, though, it was a one-night-only event. One crowd member asked McCartney if it could go all night. 'Some of us need to get some sleep, you know,' he replied.	https://www.voanews.com/a/paul-mccartney-rocks-the-bowery---inside-his-surprise-nyc-concert-/7972017.html	2025-02-12T04:33:18-08:00	
Snow and freezing rain pummel the mid-Atlantic while California prepares for likely flooding	Snow, sleet and freezing rain were expected to continue pummeling the central Appalachians and mid-Atlantic states Wednesday, while California readied for a storm that could flood areas ravaged by the recent wildfires. Especially heavy snowfall — up to nearly 25 centimeters — was expected in parts of Virginia and West Virginia, according to the National Weather Service. Ice accumulations could reach more than 8.4 millimeters in Stanleytown, Virginia, and 6.3 millimeters in Glendale Springs, North Carolina. In California, an atmospheric river — a long band of water vapor that can transport moisture from the tropics to more northern areas — was expected to move in late Wednesday, likely flooding urban areas across central and Southern California, according to the weather service. The snowstorm that blew into the mid-Atlantic states on Tuesday caused accidents on icy roads and prompted school closures. By Tuesday night, nearly 12,000 people in Virginia had lost power, according to PowerOutage.us. 'Stay home and off the roads tonight, Virginia,' the Virginia Department of Transportation posted on social media Tuesday night, alongside a meme of Dorothy from 'The Wizard of Oz' saying, 'There’s no place like home.' In parts of Baltimore and Washington, 2.5 centimeters of snow was falling each hour, according to the weather service. All Washington public schools were closed Wednesday due to the weather. Appalachian Power, which serves 1 million customers in West Virginia, Virginia and Tennessee, said Tuesday it had 5,400 workers dedicated to restoring power. About 65 Virginia National Guard soldiers were at facilities along the Interstate 95 and state Route 29 corridors and in southwest Virginia to support the storm response, guard officials said. Another 20 soldiers and members of the Virginia Defense Force were in support roles. Winter storm warnings extended from northwest North Carolina to southern New Jersey, and the snow-and-ice mix was expected to become all rain by Wednesday afternoon as temperatures climb. Meanwhile a separate storm system was expected to dump heavy snow on an area stretching from Kansas to the Great Lakes starting Tuesday night, the weather service said. The Kansas Legislature canceled Wednesday meetings because of the weather, and Gov. Laura Kelly closed state offices in the capital, Topeka. Hundreds of accidents In Virginia, where Gov. Glenn Youngkin declared a state of emergency and schools and government offices were closed Tuesday, state police reported 700 accidents and dozens of injuries Tuesday. Matt Demlein, a spokesperson for the Virginia State Police, said they can't say definitively that all were weather related. In southern West Virginia, multiple crashes temporarily shut down several major highways Tuesday. Smith’s Towing and Truck Repair responded to at least 15 calls, mostly from tractor-trailer drivers who got stuck on Interstate 64 in Greenbrier County near the Virginia border, dispatcher Kelly Pickles said. 'Basically, they just get sucked over into the median or they go off of the interstate just a little bit on the right-hand side,' she said. 'And they just don’t have enough power in their vehicles to get back onto the road, due to the icy conditions.' ‘Skating rinks instead of roads’ Paige Williams, who owns Downtown Books in Lexington, Virginia, closed her store Tuesday because of the weather. She hoped to reopen Wednesday, noting that Lexington and surrounding Rockbridge County are dependable when it comes to clearing the roads. But with temperatures on either side of freezing Tuesday night and Wednesday, the rain that is supposed to follow could make the roads better or worse. 'It’s just going to depend on where those temperatures go,' Williams said. 'Rain can clear things off. And rain can also freeze. And then you have a lot of skating rinks instead of roads.' Bitter cold temperatures An Arctic air mass stretched from Portland, Oregon, to the Great Lakes. The temperature bottomed out Tuesday morning at minus 35 Celsius in Butte, Montana, where over the past two winters at least five people died from cold exposure, said Brayton Erickson, executive director of the Butte Rescue Mission. Advocates for homeless people in the city of about 35,000 were out on the streets distributing sleeping bags, jackets, mittens and other cold weather gear to anyone who needed them, according to Erickson. 'When it gets this cold, we kind of pull out all the stops,' Erickson said. In Oregon’s Multnomah County, officials extended a state of emergency through at least Thursday. Five emergency shelters were set to open Tuesday night through Wednesday afternoon. Midweek wind chill readings could dip to minus 12 Celsius in Portland, the weather service said.	https://www.voanews.com/a/snow-and-freezing-rain-pummel-the-mid-atlantic-while-california-prepares-for-likely-flooding-/7972005.html	2025-02-12T04:15:34-08:00

Arab League chief rejects Trump plan to displace Palestinians from Gaza	Arab League Secretary-General Ahmed Aboul Gheit rejected any plan to displace Palestinians from the Gaza Strip, saying Wednesday that such resettlement would be 'unacceptable.' Aboul Gheit told the World Governments Summit that U.S. President Donald Trump’s proposal to move the roughly 2 million Palestinians out of war-ravaged Gaza would push the region into a cycle of crises with a 'damaging effect on peace and stability.' 'It's unacceptable for the Arab world, which has fought this idea for 100 years,' Aboul Gheit said. Jordan’s King Abdullah II said after talks Tuesday with Trump that he reiterated his country’s 'steadfast position against the displacement of Palestinians in Gaza and the West Bank.' 'Rebuilding Gaza without displacing the Palestinians and addressing the dire humanitarian situation should be the priority for all,' Abdullah said on X. He highlighted what he said was Trump’s 'instrumental' role in securing a ceasefire in Gaza and called on the United States and all stakeholders to ensure the halt in fighting holds. Trump has discussed a plan under which the United States would take over Gaza and Palestinians would have no right to return. Other countries in the region, including Egypt and Saudi Arabia, have rejected the idea. The status of the ceasefire between Israel and Hamas was in question Wednesday amid a dispute concerning the next planned release of hostage from Gaza set for Saturday. Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said if more hostages are not freed by Saturday, then the Israeli military 'will return to intense fighting until Hamas is finally defeated.' Trump had earlier suggested canceling the ceasefire agreement if all hostages are not released by Saturday. Trump made his remarks Monday after Hamas accused Israel of violating the ceasefire and threatened to delay the release of three hostages set to be freed Saturday. A Hamas official said Tuesday the only way for the captives to be freed was to respect the terms of the truce. Hamas, a U.S.-designated terror group, also said Palestinians were targeted 'with airstrikes and gunfire across various areas' and said Israel has failed 'to facilitate the entry of humanitarian aid as agreed.' A United Nations official said 12,600 humanitarian aid trucks have entered Gaza since the ceasefire began and the immediate threat of famine has dissipated. Since the ceasefire took effect last month, Hamas has freed 21 hostages and Israel has released more than 730 prisoners. The next exchange on Saturday calls for the release of three more Israelis in exchange for hundreds of Palestinian prisoners jailed by Israel. In Paris, United Nations Secretary-General Antonio Guterres called on Hamas to adhere to the planned hostage release. 'We must avoid at all costs the resumption of hostilities in Gaza that would lead to an immense tragedy,' he said. 'I appeal to Hamas to proceed with the planned liberation of hostages next Saturday.' 'Both sides must fully abide by their commitments in the ceasefire agreement and resume serious negotiations in Doha for the second phase,' Guterres said. The war in Gaza was triggered by the October 2023 Hamas terror attack on Israel that killed 1,200 people and led to the capture of 250 hostages. Israel’s counteroffensive killed more than 48,200 Palestinians, more than half of them women and children, according to local health authorities. Israel says the death toll includes 17,000 militants it has killed. Some information for this report came from The Associated Press, Agence France-Presse and Reuters.	https://www.voanews.com/a/arab-league-chief-rejects-trump-plan-to-displace-palestinians-from-gaza-/7971978.html	2025-02-12T03:30:29-08:00	
Investigators file criminal complaints against Philippine vice president	MANILA, Philippines — Philippine government investigators filed criminal complaints, including sedition, against Vice President Sara Duterte on Wednesday over her public threat to have the president assassinated if she herself was killed in an escalating political storm. National Bureau of Investigation Director Jaime Santiago said at a news conference that the complaints of inciting to sedition and grave threats against Duterte were filed at the Department of Justice, which would decide whether to dismiss the complaints outright or elevate them to court. The vice president, a lawyer and daughter of former President Rodrigo Duterte, reacted briefly by saying that she had expected the move by the NBI. She has accused her political rivals of taking steps to prevent her from seeking the presidency when President Ferdinand Marcos Jr.'s term ends in 2028. The vice president's father himself, whose presidential term ended in 2022, is facing legal troubles. The International Criminal Court has been investigating the widespread killings under a brutal anti-drug crackdown he oversaw while in office as a possible crime against humanity. Sara Duterte ran as Marcos' vice presidential running mate in 2022. Their whirlwind political alliance, however, quickly frayed and deteriorated into a bitter feud in an Asian democracy that has long been hamstrung by clashing political clans. Last week, the vice president was impeached by the House of Representatives on a range of accusations that included her threat to have Marcos, his wife and House Speaker Martin Romualdez killed if she herself were fatally attacked in an unspecified plot that she brought up in an online news conference in November. The impeachment complaint, which was signed by majority of the more than 300 members of the House, which is dominated by Marcos' allies, also included allegations of largescale corruption and misuse of her office's confidential funds. The 24-member Senate plans to tackle the impeachment complaint after Congress reopens in June. The vice president has vaguely denied that what she said amounted to a threat against Marcos, his wife and Romualdez, the president's cousin, but her remarks still sparked a national security alarm at the time and investigations, including by the NBI. The vice president said at a news conference last week that her lawyers were preparing for a legal battle in her upcoming impeachment trial, but she refused to say if resignation was an option so that she could preempt a possible conviction that would bar her from running for president in the future.	https://www.voanews.com/a/investigators-file-criminal-complaints-against-philippine-vice-president/7971948.html	2025-02-12T02:30:28-08:00	
VOA Mandarin: China tightens censorship of short-form video dramas	China's National Radio and Television Administration released a new 'classified and tiered review' system to tighten censorship on microdramas on Feb. 5. Any microdrama themed at 'politics, national security, United Front, diplomacy, ethnicity' will be closely and directly scrutinized by the regulator. Most streaming platforms, required to manage the content themselves, will still be prohibited from distributing or promoting microdramas, unlicensed without a registration number. The latest policy runs contrary to the Chinese government's efforts since early last year to promote the microdrama industry. Why is there a sharp turn now? How will the regulator censor microdramas with sensitive themes? How will the Chinese audience respond to the tightened censorship?

Allies to discuss Ukraine military aid	Ukrainian Defense Minister Rustem Umerov said allies gathering Wednesday in Brussels would discuss the supply of military aid for Ukraine, including accelerating deliveries of key weapons such as air defense systems. Umerov’s comments came ahead of the latest meeting of the Ukraine Defense Contact Group, a collection of 50 nations that has coordinated supplies for Ukraine’s military since Russia’s 2022 invasion. Umerov said Wednesday’s talks would also include investments in Ukraine’s defense industry and partnerships on projects with European partners. British Defense Secretary John Healey is leading the meeting for the first time, after previous sessions headed by the U.S. defense chief. 'We will step up support for Ukraine, boost deterrence through NATO, and secure peace through strength,' Healey said on X. New U.S. Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth is set to address the meeting at NATO’s headquarters, a day before a gathering of NATO defense ministers where Hegseth has said he will push for allies to boost their defense spending. 'Our commitment is clear: NATO must be a stronger, more lethal force — not a diplomatic club. Time for allies to meet the moment,' Hegseth said Wednesday on X.

US, Japan aligned in 'peace through strength' to counter China	WASHINGTON — After the meeting between U.S. President Donald Trump and Japanese Prime Minister Shigeru Ishiba last week, the two nations voiced alignment on Trump's 'peace through strength' approach toward countering China in the Indo-Pacific region, analysts said. 'The prime minister and I will be working closely together to maintain peace and security — and I also say – peace through strength all over the Indo-Pacific,' said Trump, at a press conference after his meeting Friday with Ishiba in Washington. 'We agreed to cooperate even more closely to combat the Chinese economic aggression, which is quite aggressive,' Trump said. Ishiba said: 'Further strengthening the strong and unwavering Japan-U.S. alliance to achieving a free and open Indo-Pacific' is key 'to advance the national interests of both of our countries in synergy and to realize peace and prosperity in the Indo-Pacific.' Analysts say the first official meeting between Trump and Ishiba succeeded in striking agreements on what both leaders consider crucial: combating China's aggression and strengthening their national interests. Security commitment Ishiba continued to forge close ties with the U.S. to maintain multilateral alliance security cooperation close to home in the Indo-Pacific, while Trump secured Japanese investments and purchases. Taken together, analysts say, Ishiba is aligned with Trump's vision of making the U.S. strong at home in his 'America First' approach as a prerequisite for maintaining peace through strength in the Indo-Pacific, a region crucial to Japan's defense. 'The U.S.-Japan leaders' communiqué went a long way to reaffirm Trump's peace through strength approach to the Indo-Pacific,' said Kenneth Weinstein, the Japan chair at Hudson Institute. 'The U.S.-Japan leaders' communiqué, which President Trump signed off on, highlighted the importance of multilateral networks in the Indo-Pacific,' Weinstein told VOA on Sunday. 'The two leaders intend to advance multilayered and aligned cooperation' with the Quad security dialogue and three separate trilateral ties with South Korea, Australia and the Philippines 'to realize a free and open Indo-Pacific,' Trump and Ishiba said in a joint statement. There were concerns by some that Trump would not support alliance security formations aimed at maintaining peace and security in the region. 'A big concern on the part of the Japanese' was whether the Biden administration's emphasis 'on the centrality of alliance' or the 'so-called multilayered structures' or 'mini laterals' would continue, said Daniel Sneider, a lecturer in East Asian Studies at Stanford University. Sneider told VOA on Monday, 'It was reassuring for the Japanese and for those in the U.S. who are worried whether those types of policies would have continuity that there was at least a written affirmation of those things in the joint statement.' In their joint statement, Trump and Ishiba also expressed 'strong opposition' to China's attempts to change the status quo in the East China Sea and its unlawful maritime claims in the South China Sea. They also expressed support for Taiwan's 'meaningful participation in international organizations' and opposed China's efforts to disturb stability across the Taiwan Strait. At a press briefing held in Beijing on Monday, Chinese Foreign Ministry Spokesperson Guo Jiakun, said, 'The part of the U.S.-Japan joint statement on China constitutes open interference in China's domestic affairs and an attack and smear against China, which is also aimed at scaremongering in the region.' Increased investment Trump announced at the press conference that Japan will invest $1 trillion in the U.S., participate in the Alaska LNG project, and invest in, rather than buy, U.S. Steel. In one of the first executive orders Trump signed on Jan. 20, he made Alaskan natural resources open to development and production and its liquefied natural gas available for sale to U.S. allied nations within the Pacific region. Ishiba said, 'An unprecedented investment' from Japan to the U.S. and the Japanese investments in U.S. Steel are 'mutually beneficial' and 'contribute not only to the United States and Japan but also to the whole world.' Weinstein, at Hudson, said, 'The announcement of a trillion dollars in foreign investment in the U.S. was the landmark moment, as was the announcement of the investments in the LNG sector' and 'the pending U.S. Steel investment.' 'Ishiba is supporting what is in Japan's best interest: an alliance with minimal distance between the U.S. and Japan,' he said. 'So he understands he needs to back the America First approach to continue alignment with the Trump administration. A strong America is the best guarantee for global peace and stability.' In explaining what foreign policy would look like under the Trump administration, Secretary of State Marco Rubio, during his confirmation hearing in January, emphasized 'a foreign policy centered on our national interest' and making the U.S. strong first at home as the prerequisite for maintaining peace and security around the world. 'Ishiba respects Trump's America First' policy, but he is also a 'Japan first' prime minister, said Yuki Tatsumi, director of the Japan Program at the Stimson Center. She told VOA on Friday that 'both leaders gained. Trump got a commitment of increased investment by Japan in the U.S., while Ishiba gained Trump's articulation of the U.S. commitment to the defense of Japanese territory, including the Senkaku Islands, and the joint statement in which U.S.-Japan support for Taiwan was articulated.' In the joint statement, Ishiba and Trump underscored the United States' 'unwavering commitment' to defending Japan using its full range of capabilities, including nuclear capabilities. The two also 'reiterated their strong opposition to any action that seeks to undermine Japan's long and peaceful administration of the Senkaku Islands.' There is 'continuity' from the Biden administration to the Trump administration, Tatsumi said, and that is to make U.S.-Japan ties 'the hub of alliance cooperation and partnership across the Indo-Pacific.'	https://www.voanews.com/a/us-japan-aligned-in-peace-through-strength-to-counter-china/7971803.html	2025-02-12T00:21:06-08:00	
Deadly Russian missile, drone attacks hit Kyiv	Ukrainian officials said Wednesday Russian forces launched overnight attacks involving ballistic missiles and more than 120 drones, killing at least one person in Kyiv. Kyiv Mayor Vitali Klitschko said on Telegram that three other people also were injured as a result of the attacks. Kyiv emergency services reported fires and other damage at buildings in four districts in the city. Ukraine’s military said missiles also targeted the city of Kryvyi Rih, located in the Dnipropetrovsk region. The regional governor, Serhiy Lysak, said on Telegram that Russian attacks damaged a school, hotel, administrative building and three apartment buildings. Ukrainian air defenses shot down six missiles and 71 of the 123 drones that Russian forces deployed, the Ukrainian air force said. Drone intercepts took place over the Cherkasy, Chernihiv, Dnipropetrovsk, Kharkiv, Kherson, Kirovohrad, Kyiv, Mykolaiv, Poltava, Sumy and Zhytomyr regions. 'Putin is not preparing for peace - he continues to kill Ukrainians and destroy cities,' Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy said on the Telegram messaging app. 'Right now, we need the unity and support of all our partners in the fight for a just end to this war.' Russia’s Defense Ministry said Wednesday it shot down three Ukrainian drones over the Belgorod region.	https://www.voanews.com/a/deadly-russian-missile-drone-attacks-hit-kyiv-/7971903.html	2025-02-11T23:54:23-08:00	
Pakistan sees economy on long-term recovery path under IMF program	ISLAMABAD — Pakistan's economy is on a path to long-term recovery, thanks to a stabilization program backed by the International Monetary Fund, Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif said ahead of a first review of a $7-billion IMF bailout set for early in March. The comments came in Sharif's meeting on Tuesday with Kristalina Georgieva on the sidelines of the World Government Summit 2025 in Dubai, his office said in a statement. He underscored the progress made under the IMF's Extended Fund Facility (EFF), which has played a key role in stabilizing Pakistan's economy and set it on the path of long-term recovery, it added. Ahead of the IMF review, the government and central bank have expressed confidence about meeting its targets, even as Pakistan, bolstered by the bailout secured in September, struggles to navigate the recovery. Tuesday's meeting focused on the macroeconomic stability, achieved by the government's agenda for comprehensive reform under the IMF program. Discussions highlighted Pakistan's commitment to adopting structural reforms and maintaining fiscal discipline under the IMF program, Sharif's office said. He reaffirmed his government's resolve to maintain reform momentum, particularly in critical areas such as taxes, energy efficiency and private sector development, it added. A three-member IMF mission, separately, is currently in Pakistan for a an assessment under the EFF program.	https://www.voanews.com/a/pakistan-sees-economy-on-long-term-recovery-path-under-imf-program/7971891.html	2025-02-11T23:25:23-08:00	
Russia says some of the 300 fishermen stranded on ice floe refused evacuation	Some of the 300 Russian fishermen stranded on an ice floe drifting in the Sea of Okhotsk in the Western Pacific have refused evacuation, Russia's emergency ministry said on Wednesday. A rescue operation with helicopters and vessels has brought 109 of the fishermen ashore, but some refused to be rescued, the ministry said in a post on the Telegram messaging app. 'Some extreme sports enthusiasts are not going to leave without a catch, under any circumstances,' the ministry said. It posted a video showing fishermen walking on snowy ice away from the rescuers. It was unclear why so many fishermen had gathered at the location. About a 10-meter ice crack formed from the Russian village of Malki to the mouth of the Dolinka River in the Sakhalin region, setting the fishermen adrift in the Sea of Okhotsk, the ministry said earlier. Winters in the Sakhalin region in Russia's Far East, which comprises the Sakhalin Island and the chain of the Kuril Islands, are cold, snowy and long, often lasting more than five months.	https://www.voanews.com/a/russia-says-some-of-the-300-fishermen-stranded-on-ice-floe-refused-evacuation/7971888.html	2025-02-11T23:05:46-08:00	
Teacher questioned in stabbing death of first-grader in South Korea	SEOUL, SOUTH KOREA — South Korean police on Tuesday were questioning an elementary school teacher who allegedly stabbed a first-grader to death in the city of Daejeon. The killing on Monday during after-school care has shocked the nation and prompted the country's acting president to order school safety standards reviewed. The female suspect was receiving medical treatment for self-inflicted wounds following the death of the girl in an audio-visual room on the second floor of the school, said Yuk Jong-myeong, chief of Daejeon's western district police station. The suspect, reported to be in her 40s, told police that she had recently returned to work after a period of leave for health reasons, Yuk said. She told police she has received treatment for depression since 2018. After the first-grade student was reported missing at 5:15 p.m. local time Monday, police and family members searched throughout the school and surrounding areas. Her grandmother found her in the audio-visual room around 5:50 p.m. The girl was rushed to the hospital, where she was pronounced dead. Choi Sang-mok, who is the country's acting leader due to President Yoon Suk Yeol's impeachment, called for a thorough investigation into the killing and instructed education authorities to 'implement necessary measures to ensure such incidents never happen again.' Visitors laid flowers and condolence letters at the gate of the school, which was closed on Tuesday.	https://www.voanews.com/a/teacher-questioned-in-stabbing-death-of-first-grader-in-south-korea/7971886.html	2025-02-11T22:50:43-08:00	
Giant schnauzer named Monty wins top prize at Westminster Kennel Club	NEW YORK — A giant schnauzer named Monty won the top prize at the Westminster Kennel Club dog show Tuesday night. Monty bested six other finalists to take best in show at Madison Square Garden. The award is considered the most prestigious prize in the U.S. dog show world. Each dog is judged according to how closely it matches the ideal for its breed. Winners get a trophy, ribbons and bragging rights, but no cash prize. Other finalists included a bichon frisé called Neal, a Skye terrier named Archer, a whippet and repeat runner-up known as Bourbon, a shih tzu called Comet who's been a finalist before, a German shepherd named Mercedes, who came in second last year, and an English springer spaniel called Freddie. Monty made the finals for a third year in a row and won the huge American Kennel Club's big show in December. A Westminster win is considered the most prestigious award in the U.S. dog show world. Each dog is judged according to how closely it matches the ideal for its breed. Winners get a trophy, ribbons and bragging rights, but no cash prize. Every dog at Westminster is a titled champion, but they also are household pets. Some also do therapy work, search-and-rescue or other canine jobs. 'A good German shepherd is an all-purpose dog,' said co-breeder and co-owner Sheree Moses Combs of Wardensville, West Virginia. Some of her pups have become service dogs for wounded veterans, she said. 'Dog shows are fun, but that is what our breed is all about,' she said. Big dogs had their day at Westminster on Tuesday, when 'working' breeds had their turns in the ring. First-round competitor Brina, for instance, is a 71.6 kilogram Neapolitan mastiff. 'I've been struck by this breed since I was 12. ... They're so unique,' owner Yves Belmont, Ph.D., said as Brina napped in her crate, equipped with a 7.5-liter water bucket. With their size, jowly heads and guard-dog history, the breed was developed to be imposing. But Belmont, who currently has several of them at his family's Atlanta-area home, said he also is impressed by their intelligence. A trip to Westminster is a reminder of dogs' variety, even just among purebreds. The same day Brina competed, Tyra the miniature bull terrier also strutted her stuff. Formally called GCH CH Rnr's Top Model, she's named after fashion model Tyra Banks. The hardy terrier breed is 'a big dog in a small package, but they always keep you smiling,' said owner and co-breeder Jessica Harrison of Austin, Texas. Asked where the 2-year-old Tyra falls on the mischief meter, Harrison smiled, 'like a nine, for sure.' 'You can't be upset with them because they're just so cute,' she said as Tyra rolled on her back to get a belly rub from a passerby at the Javits Center, the convention venue that hosted the first-round judging of each breed. Regardless which dog gets the trophy at Westminster, others also have scored points with the crowd. During two nights of semifinals, spectators shouted out breeds and names of canine competitors as if they played for one of the pro teams that call the Garden home, the NBA's New York Knicks and NHL's New York Rangers. 'Love you, Lumpy!' someone yelled to a Pekingese named Lumpy, who earned laughs for his ambling gait. The arena erupted with cheers for a golden retriever named Tuffy, a representative of a popular breed that has never won. Calaco, a Xoloitzcuintli, got huge applause for a confident performance that also earned him some recognition from the judge. Xoloitzcuintlis, are hairless dogs with deep roots in Mexico. A Doberman pinscher called Penny got whoops of approval from spectators, too. Despite her dignified, focused appearance, Penny can be 'a mush,' breeder and co-owner Theresa Connors-Chan of Ontario, Canada, said earlier in the day. Westminster also featured agility and obedience championships, held Saturday. The agility prize went to a border collie named Vanish, and an Australian shepherd called Willie triumphed in obedience.	https://www.voanews.com/a/giant-schnauzer-named-monty-wins-top-prize-at-westminster-kennel-club/7971860.html	2025-02-11T20:37:52-08:00	
US teacher returns home after being freed by Russia	U.S. President Donald Trump welcomed American teacher Marc Fogel to the White House late Tuesday after Fogel was freed from Russia where he had been detained since August 2021 for bringing medically prescribed marijuana into the country. 'I feel like the luckiest man on Earth right now,' Fogel said as he stood next to Trump. Fogel praised the president, U.S. diplomats and lawmakers for working to secure his release. 'I am in awe of what they all did,' Fogel said. Trump said he appreciated what Russia did in letting Fogel go home but declined to specify the details of any agreement with Russia beyond calling it 'very fair' and very reasonable.' Trump also said another hostage release would be announced Wednesday. Mike Waltz, Trump’s national security adviser, said earlier Tuesday the United States and Russia 'negotiated an exchange' to free Fogel but gave no details about what the U.S. side of the bargain entailed. In such deals in recent years, the U.S. has often released Russian prisoners that Moscow wanted in exchange. Instead, Waltz cast the deal for Fogel’s release in broader geopolitical terms, saying it was 'a show of good faith from the Russians and a sign we are moving in the right direction to end the brutal and terrible war in Ukraine,' an invasion Russia launched against its neighbor in February 2022, with hundreds of thousands killed or wounded on both sides. Trump had vowed to broker an end to Russia’s war on Ukraine before taking office Jan. 20, but his aides more recently have said he hopes to do it within the first 100 days of his new administration, roughly by the end of April. 'Since President Trump’s swearing-in, he has successfully secured the release of Americans detained around the world, and President Trump will continue until all Americans being held are returned to the United States,' Waltz said. The recent release of six Americans held in Venezuela and Fogel’s freeing are the only publicly known instances. Fogel had been traveling with a small amount of medically prescribed marijuana to treat back pain. Once convicted by a Russian court, he began serving his 14-year sentence in June 2022, with the outgoing administration of former President Joe Biden late last year classifying him as wrongfully detained.	https://www.voanews.com/a/us-teacher-returns-home-after-being-freed-by-russia/7971848.html	2025-02-11T20:20:52-08:00	
Russia frees American schoolteacher Marc Fogel after four years	WASHINGTON — Russia released American schoolteacher Marc Fogel on Tuesday following an unannounced visit to Moscow by U.S. special envoy Steve Witkoff and he was headed for a White House welcome, U.S. President Donald Trump said. The release of 63-year-old Fogel, who had been detained in Russia since August 2021 and was serving a 14-year sentence, came as Trump seeks to improve relations with Moscow as part of an effort to secure an end to the war in Ukraine. Trump told reporters that Fogel would visit the White House on his return to the U.S. late on Tuesday, and White House national security adviser Mike Waltz said he would also be reunited Tuesday night with his family, who celebrated the news. On a plane home, Fogel, who is from Pennsylvania, was shown with a raised glass, a cheese plate and his U.S. passport in a photo posted on social media by Trump's chief hostage envoy Adam Boehler. Asked what the United States gave up in exchange for Fogel, Trump said: 'Not much' and called the release a show of good faith from the Russians. 'We were treated very nicely by Russia. Actually, I hope that's the beginning of a relationship where we can end that (Ukraine) war and millions of people can stop being killed,' Trump said. Fogel was sentenced to 14 years in prison for drug smuggling after he was detained in Moscow's Sheremetyevo airport in August 2021 with 17 grams of marijuana in his luggage. The marijuana had been medically prescribed in Pennsylvania, where it is legal, said Martin De Luca, a member of Fogel's legal team. Witkoff's plane was on the ground in Moscow for a few hours before leaving with Fogel onboard, flying through central Europe and back to Washington, De Luca told Reuters. 'We are beyond grateful, relieved, and overwhelmed that after more than three years of detention, our father, husband, and son, Marc Fogel, is finally coming home,' the Fogel family said in a statement. 'This has been the darkest and most painful period of our lives, but today, we begin to heal.' Fogel's Russian lawyer Dmitry Ovsyannikov confirmed the release to state news agency RIA. 'For the moment, we don't know on what grounds he was released from where he was serving time - a pardon or something else,' Ovsyannikov told TASS. He told Russia's Interfax news agency that Fogel was last week transferred from a prison in Rybinsk, north of Moscow, to a pre-trial detention center in Moscow ahead of his release. Fogel was left out of a historic swap of prisoners in August that involved 24 prisoners - 16 sent from Russia to the West, including Wall Street Journal reporter Evan Gershkovich, and eight sent back to Russia from the West. Trump has indicated he has spoken with Russian President Vladimir Putin but has been vague on the details other than to say he is insistent on ending the three-year-old Ukraine war. 'We're making good progress there. I think, I really think we're making some very good progress,' Trump told reporters about Ukraine on Tuesday.	https://www.voanews.com/a/russia-frees-american-schoolteacher-marc-fogel-after-four-years/7971848.html	2025-02-11T19:46:59-08:00	
White House fires USAID inspector general after funding oversight warning, officials say	WASHINGTON — The White House fired the inspector general for the U.S. Agency for International Development on Tuesday, several U.S. officials said. The dismissal comes a day after his office warned that the Trump administration's dismantling of USAID had made it all but impossible to monitor $8.2 billion in unspent humanitarian funds. The White House gave no reason for the firing of Inspector General Paul Martin, one of the officials said. The dismissal was first reported by CNN. The officials were not authorized to comment publicly and spoke on condition of anonymity. Inspectors general are typically independently funded watchdogs tasked with rooting out waste, fraud and abuse at government agencies. The Trump administration earlier purged more than a dozen inspectors general. On Monday, Martin's office issued a flash report warning that the Trump administration's funding freeze and staff actions within USAID had left oversight of the humanitarian aid 'largely nonoperational.' That includes the agency's greatly reduced ability to ensure none of the $8.2 billion in unspent unhumanitarian funds falls into the hands of violent extremist groups or goes astray in conflict zones, the watchdog said. Multiparty lawsuit Separately, a lawsuit filed Tuesday alleged that the Trump administration's fast-paced dismantling of USAID is stiffing American businesses on hundreds of millions of dollars in unpaid bills for work that has already been done. The administration's abrupt freeze on foreign aid also is forcing mass layoffs by U.S. suppliers and contractors for USAID, including 750 furloughs at one company, Washington-based Chemonics International, the lawsuit says. 'One cannot overstate the impact of that unlawful course of conduct: on businesses large and small forced to shut down their programs and let employees go; on hungry children across the globe who will go without; on populations around the world facing deadly disease; and on our constitutional order,' the U.S. businesses and organizations said. An organization representing 170 small U.S. businesses, major suppliers, an American Jewish group aiding displaced people abroad, the American Bar Association and others joined the court challenge. It was filed in U.S. District Court in Washington against President Donald Trump; Secretary of State Marco Rubio; acting USAID Deputy Administrator Peter Marocco, a Trump appointee who has been a central figure in hollowing out the agency; and Russell Vought, Trump's head of the Office of Management and Budget. Marocco defended the funding cutoff and push to put all but a fraction of USAID staff on leave in an affidavit filed late Monday in the lawsuit brought by the workers' groups. 'Insubordination' and 'noncompliance' by USAID staffers made it necessary to stop funding and operations by the agency to allow the administration to carry out a program-by-program review to decide which U.S. aid programs could resume overseas, Marocco wrote. It is at least the third lawsuit over the administration's rapid unraveling of the U.S. aid and development agency and its programs worldwide. Trump and ally Elon Musk have targeted USAID in particular, saying its work is out of line with Trump's agenda. Marocco, Musk and Rubio have overseen an across-the-board freeze on foreign assistance and an agency shutdown under a January 20 executive order by Trump. A lawsuit brought by federal employees associations has temporarily blocked the administration from pulling thousands of USAID staffers off the job. The funding freeze and other measures have persisted, including the agency losing the lease on its Washington headquarters. Interceding for farmers The new administration terminated contracts without the required 30-day notice and without back payments for work that was already done, according to a U.S. official, a businessperson with a USAID contract and an email seen by The Associated Press. They spoke on condition of anonymity for fear of reprisal by the Trump administration. For Chemonics, one of the larger of the USAID partners, the funding freeze has meant $103 million in unpaid invoices and almost $500 million in USAID-ordered medication, food and other goods stalled in the supply chain or ports, the lawsuit says. For the health commodities alone, not delivering them 'on time could potentially lead to as many as 566,000 deaths from HIV/AIDS, malaria, and unmet reproductive health needs, including 215,000 pediatric deaths,' the lawsuit says. Meanwhile, seven Republican lawmakers from farm states introduced legislation to safeguard a long-running $1.8 billion food-aid program run by the aid agency, by moving the Food for Peace program under the Department of Agriculture. Farmers, a politically important bloc for the Trump administration, have been affected by the administration's funding freeze as well. Kansas Republican Senator Jerry Moran, who announced the legislation, over the weekend thanked Rubio for interceding to allow delivery of $560 million in U.S.-grown commodities intended for hunger programs worldwide but stuck in ports because of the administration's abrupt cutoff of foreign assistance spending.	https://www.voanews.com/a/white-house-fires-usaid-inspector-general-after-funding-oversight-warning-officials-say-/7971828.html	2025-02-11T19:42:32-08:00	
New York health department confirms first case of new mpox strain	The New York State Department of Health on Tuesday confirmed its first case of the new mpox strain, adding to the global concerns over the spread of the little-known variant. According to the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, there were three confirmed cases in the country — in California, Georgia and New Hampshire — caused by the clade Ib strain. The agency said the three cases were not linked. The World Health Organization declared mpox a global public health emergency for the second time in two years in August, following an outbreak of the viral infection in the Democratic Republic of Congo that has spread to neighboring countries. The New York State Department of Health declined to provide further information on the case.	https://www.voanews.com/a/new-york-health-department-confirms-first-case-of-new-mpox-strain/7971833.html	2025-02-11T18:44:46-08:00	
DOGE cuts $900M from agency tracking US students' progress	WASHINGTON — A federal research agency that tracks the progress of America's students is to lose $900 million in funding after Elon Musk's Department of Government Efficiency found no need for much of its work. It's unclear to what degree the Education Department's Institute of Education Sciences will continue to exist after Musk's team slashed scores of contracts. Industry groups said at least 169 contracts were suddenly terminated Monday, accounting for much of the institute's work. The Education Department did not immediately share details on the cuts. Madison Biedermann, an agency spokesperson, said the action will not affect the institute's primary work, including the NAEP assessment, known as the nation's report card, and the College Scorecard, a database of university costs and outcomes. Musk's grip on the Education Department was dealt a setback Tuesday when the agency temporarily blocked DOGE workers from more than a dozen internal systems containing sensitive information. As part of a lawsuit challenging its access, the department agreed to block Musk's team until at least Monday while a judge weighs a broader pause. Advocates sound alarm The cuts to the institute raised alarm among advocates who said it could hurt the accountability of America's education system, leaving the nation in the dark on schools' effectiveness. Historically, achievement gaps have shown low-income students and students of color falling behind their peers. The cuts are counterproductive and destructive, said Rachel Dinkes, president and CEO of the Knowledge Alliance, a coalition of education research firms. 'Cutting out at the knees the one independent agency that helps improve student outcomes is ridiculous,' Dinkes said. Biedermann declined to share the names of vendors whose contracts were cut. Cuts under contract clause The Institute of Education Sciences is a central source of information on the health of America's education system. Across the country, it tracks student progress over time and across demographics. It evaluates the effectiveness of federal programs, and colleges and schools rely on its research to improve student outcomes. The cuts appear to have been carried out under a clause allowing IES to end contracts at any time 'for the government's convenience,' according to notices obtained by The Associated Press. Among the projects being cut is a study exploring how to accelerate math learning for students in fourth and fifth grade, according to a document obtained by the AP. Known as ReSolve, the project was being led by research group MDRC. Last month, IES released the latest NAEP results, revealing that America's children have continued to lose ground on reading skills and made little improvement in math in the wake of the COVID-19 pandemic. Activate Research, a small business, lost four contracts and plans to lay off at least 20 of its 28 workers. The company was hired to ensure accuracy and objectivity in reports. When founder Dinah Sparks announced the company was winding down Tuesday, she had a message for her team: 'We are not waste,' she said. 'We did valuable work for the U.S. taxpayer.' Another small business lost multiple contracts after being hired to collect basic information on the nation's schools. The company started laying off workers this week, according to an employee who spoke on the condition of anonymity for fear of retaliation. Congress gave the institute about $800 million last year, roughly 1% of the Education Department's annual budget. Associations call to reinstate contracts Two prominent research associations jointly called for the contracts to be reinstated, saying much of IES' work is mandated by Congress and relies on contracts to support its limited staff. The groups said 169 contracts had been cut, curbing the institute's ability to report data on school finances and student outcomes. The institute oversees a wide range of work, including the administration of the NAEP exam and U.S. participation in PISA, an assessment that compares academic progress across nations. It's also a major funder of education research and keeps a database of research that has shown results in improving education. IES shines a light on inequity, and its work is 'more than just numbers and statistics,' said the Education Trust, a nonprofit research and advocacy group. 'Without it, we are left in the dark, unable to see where educational gaps exist or how to close them,' the group said in a statement. Mark Schneider, a former IES commissioner appointed by President Donald Trump in 2018, said the cuts give the new administration a chance to rethink programs that have changed little in decades. 'The question is not what happened on Monday; it's what happens next,' Schneider said. 'If we just swing this sledgehammer, break all this stuff and say, 'OK, done,' then we've wasted an opportunity to fix things.' Democratic Senator Patty Murray, a former teacher and member of the Committee on Health, Education, Labor and Pensions, said she will be 'sounding the alarm' to fight the cuts. Trump has promised to abolish the Education Department and turn its power over to states and schools. The White House is considering an order that would direct Trump's education chief to dismantle the agency as far as possible while calling on Congress to fully shut it down. It's unclear how far Trump could act on his own to slash the department's spending, much of which is ordered by Congress.	https://www.voanews.com/a/doge-cuts-900m-from-agency-tracking-us-students-progress/7971800.html	2025-02-11T18:27:31-08:00	
Fresh fighting flares in eastern DR Congo	Bukavu, Democratic Republic of Congo — Fighting erupted Tuesday in eastern Democratic Republic of Congo, three days after a call by African leaders for a ceasefire and a brief lull in the conflict. M23 fighters attacked Congolese army positions in South Kivu province at dawn, local and security sources told AFP. The DRC government has designated the M23 rebel group as a terrorist organization, while the United Nations and the United States classify it as an armed rebel group. Congo accuses Rwanda of supporting the rebels, a charge that Rwanda denies. The resurgence comes after east and southern African leaders called on their general staff to propose a plan for implementing an 'unconditional' ceasefire by Thursday, in a conflict which has killed thousands and driven vast numbers from their homes. The M23 has in recent months swiftly seized tracts of territory in mineral-rich east DRC after again taking up arms in late 2021, in a country plagued by numerous conflicts for decades. The armed group began advancing in South Kivu after taking control of Goma, the capital of neighboring North Kivu province that borders Rwanda, at the end of last month. Clashes took place Tuesday near the village of Ihusi, around 70 kilometers (43 miles) from the provincial capital Bukavu and 40 kilometers from the province's airport, according to security sources. Several local sources reported 'detonations of heavy weapons'. Kavumu airport is used by the Congolese army to transport reinforcements of troops and equipment to the region and its main military base is located nearby. Bukavu has been preparing for an M23 offensive for several days, with schools shuttering in the city Friday as residents began to flee and shops closed over fears of an imminent attack. Banks were still shut in the city Tuesday. The capture of Bukavu would give full control of Lake Kivu to the M23 and Rwandan troops. Almost 300 Congolese soldiers are currently on trial in a military court in the city, for charges including rape, murder and looting. The M23, which claims to want to 'liberate all of Congo' and oust President Felix Tshisekedi, has attempted in recent days to advance into the highlands overlooking the main road to Bukavu to cut off the DRC army's supply lines. But Burundian soldiers, who are in east DRC to support the Congolese army, stopped the M23 advances, security sources said. Around 10,000 Burundian soldiers are deployed in South Kivu, according to a security source. Bujumbura sent at least one additional army battalion to the area Friday, a security source told AFP. The M23 has begun setting up its own administration in Goma, a city of 1 million people, launching recruitment campaigns, including to create a police force. The humanitarian situation in Goma is worsening with no running water in large parts of the city and residents forced to take water from Lake Kivu, where bodies were recovered after the fighting. An increase in cholera cases has been seen in the region, particularly among people displaced by the conflict, UN humanitarian agency, OCHA, said. The city's airport also remains closed despite a United Nations appeal last week to try allow for the transport of humanitarian aid and the wounded. The crisis in east DRC is set to be discussed at an African Union meeting in Addis Ababa, Ethiopia on Friday. With the recent intensification of the conflict, calls for de-escalation from the international community have increased amid fears the fighting could lead to a regional war. But diplomatic efforts to resolve the conflict that has lasted for more than three years have so far been unsuccessful. The DRC has called for 'targeted sanctions' against Rwanda but with little effect. Kinshasa accuses Kigali of wanting to plunder natural resources in the DRC, such as tantalum and tin used in batteries and electronic equipment, as well as gold. Rwanda denies this, saying it wants to remove armed groups it believes pose a permanent threat to its security, notably the Democratic Forces for the Liberation of Rwanda (FDLR), created by former Hutu leaders of the 1994 genocide against Tutsis in Rwanda. To add to Kinshasa's woes, an attack by a militia from the Lendu ethnic group in the northeastern Ituri province killed 51 people, local and humanitarian sources told AFP on Tuesday. Members of the Cooperative for the Development of Congo (CODECO) killed 51 mostly displaced people in three adjoining areas of Ituri province on Monday, humanitarian sources and a local community leader, Jules Tsuba, said. CODECO was a peaceful agricultural cooperative before transforming into an armed rebel movement fighting the rival Hema community. Monday's raid was allegedly a response to a strike by a Hema militia earlier in the same area. Different conflicts and rebellions have plagued the country for more than 30 years.	https://www.voanews.com/a/fresh-fighting-flares-in-eastern-dr-congo/7971820.html	2025-02-11T18:24:20-08:00	
First US Navy ships sail through Taiwan Strait since Trump inauguration	BEIJING — Two U.S. Navy ships sailed through the sensitive Taiwan Strait this week in the first such mission since President Donald Trump took office last month, drawing an angry reaction from China, which said the mission increased security risks. The U.S. Navy, occasionally accompanied by ships from allied countries, transits the strait about once a month. China, which claims Taiwan as its own territory, says the strategic waterway belongs to it. China's military said the two U.S. ships, which it named as the destroyer Lyndon B. Johnson and the survey ship Bowditch, had passed through the strait between Monday and Wednesday, adding that Chinese forces had been dispatched to keep watch. 'The U.S. action sends the wrong signals and increases security risks,' the Eastern Theater Command of the People's Liberation Army said in a statement early Wednesday. The U.S. Navy confirmed the transit. The last publicly acknowledged U.S. Navy mission in the strait was in late November, when a P-8A Poseidon maritime patrol aircraft flew over the waterway.

US, Japan aligned in 'peace through strength' to counter China	WASHINGTON — After the meeting between U.S. President Donald Trump and Japanese Prime Minister Shigeru Ishiba last week, the two nations voiced alignment on Trump's 'peace through strength' approach toward countering China in the Indo-Pacific region, analysts said. 'The prime minister and I will be working closely together to maintain peace and security — and I also say – peace through strength all over the Indo-Pacific,' said Trump, at a press conference after his meeting Friday with Ishiba in Washington. 'We agreed to cooperate even more closely to combat the Chinese economic aggression, which is quite aggressive,' Trump said. Ishiba said: 'Further strengthening the strong and unwavering Japan-U.S. alliance to achieving a free and open Indo-Pacific' is key 'to advance the national interests of both of our countries in synergy and to realize peace and prosperity in the Indo-Pacific.' Analysts say the first official meeting between Trump and Ishiba succeeded in striking agreements on what both leaders consider crucial: combating China's aggression and strengthening their national interests. Security commitment Ishiba continued to forge close ties with the U.S. to maintain multilateral alliance security cooperation close to home in the Indo-Pacific, while Trump secured Japanese investments and purchases. Taken together, analysts say, Ishiba is aligned with Trump's vision of making the U.S. strong at home in his 'America First' approach as a prerequisite for maintaining peace through strength in the Indo-Pacific, a region crucial to Japan's defense. 'The U.S.-Japan leaders' communiqué went a long way to reaffirm Trump's peace through strength approach to the Indo-Pacific,' said Kenneth Weinstein, the Japan chair at Hudson Institute. 'The U.S.-Japan leaders' communiqué, which President Trump signed off on, highlighted the importance of multilateral networks in the Indo-Pacific,' Weinstein told VOA on Sunday. 'The two leaders intend to advance multilayered and aligned cooperation' with the Quad security dialogue and three separate trilateral ties with South Korea, Australia and the Philippines 'to realize a free and open Indo-Pacific,' Trump and Ishiba said in a joint statement. There were concerns by some that Trump would not support alliance security formations aimed at maintaining peace and security in the region. 'A big concern on the part of the Japanese' was whether the Biden administration's emphasis 'on the centrality of alliance' or the 'so-called multilayered structures' or 'mini laterals' would continue, said Daniel Sneider, a lecturer in East Asian Studies at Stanford University. Sneider told VOA on Monday, 'It was reassuring for the Japanese and for those in the U.S. who are worried whether those types of policies would have continuity that there was at least a written affirmation of those things in the joint statement.' In their joint statement, Trump and Ishiba also expressed 'strong opposition' to China's attempts to change the status quo in the East China Sea and its unlawful maritime claims in the South China Sea. They also expressed support for Taiwan's 'meaningful participation in international organizations' and opposed China's efforts to disturb stability across the Taiwan Strait. At a press briefing held in Beijing on Monday, Chinese Foreign Ministry Spokesperson Guo Jiakun, said, 'The part of the U.S.-Japan joint statement on China constitutes open interference in China's domestic affairs and an attack and smear against China, which is also aimed at scaremongering in the region.' Increased investment Trump announced at the press conference that Japan will invest $1 trillion in the U.S., participate in the Alaska LNG project, and invest in, rather than buy, U.S. Steel. In one of the first executive orders Trump signed on Jan. 20, he made Alaskan natural resources open to development and production and its liquefied natural gas available for sale to U.S. allied nations within the Pacific region. Ishiba said, 'An unprecedented investment' from Japan to the U.S. and the Japanese investments in U.S. Steel are 'mutually beneficial' and 'contribute not only to the United States and Japan but also to the whole world.' Weinstein, at Hudson, said, 'The announcement of a trillion dollars in foreign investment in the U.S. was the landmark moment, as was the announcement of the investments in the LNG sector' and 'the pending U.S. Steel investment.' 'Ishiba is supporting what is in Japan's best interest: an alliance with minimal distance between the U.S. and Japan,' he said. 'So he understands he needs to back the America First approach to continue alignment with the Trump administration. A strong America is the best guarantee for global peace and stability.' In explaining what foreign policy would look like under the Trump administration, Secretary of State Marco Rubio, during his confirmation hearing in January, emphasized 'a foreign policy centered on our national interest' and making the U.S. strong first at home as the prerequisite for maintaining peace and security around the world. 'Ishiba respects Trump's America First' policy, but he is also a 'Japan first' prime minister, said Yuki Tatsumi, director of the Japan Program at the Stimson Center. She told VOA on Friday that 'both leaders gained. Trump got a commitment of increased investment by Japan in the U.S., while Ishiba gained Trump's articulation of the U.S. commitment to the defense of Japanese territory, including the Senkaku Islands, and the joint statement in which U.S.-Japan support for Taiwan was articulated.' In the joint statement, Ishiba and Trump underscored the United States' 'unwavering commitment' to defending Japan using its full range of capabilities, including nuclear capabilities. The two also 'reiterated their strong opposition to any action that seeks to undermine Japan's long and peaceful administration of the Senkaku Islands.' There is 'continuity' from the Biden administration to the Trump administration, Tatsumi said, and that is to make U.S.-Japan ties 'the hub of alliance cooperation and partnership across the Indo-Pacific.'	https://www.voanews.com/a/7971803.html	2025-02-11T17:44:45-08:00	
Appeals court rejects push to reinstate spending freezes on grants, loans	Washington — A federal appeals court on Tuesday rejected a Trump administration push to reinstate a sweeping pause on federal funding, a decision that comes after a judge found the administration had not fully obeyed an earlier order. The Boston-based 1st U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals turned back the emergency appeal, though it said it expected the lower court judge to act quickly to clarify. The Justice Department had asked the appeals court to let it implement sweeping pauses on federal grants and loans, calling the lower court order to keep promised money flowing 'intolerable judicial overreach.' That ruling came from U.S. District Court Judge John McConnell in Rhode Island, the first judge to find that the administration had disobeyed a court order. He is presiding over a lawsuit from nearly two dozen Democratic states filed after the administration issued a boundary-pushing memo purporting to halt all federals grants and loans, worth trillions of dollars. The plan sparked chaos around the country. The administration has since rescinded that memo, but McConnell found Monday that not all federal grants and loans had been restored. Money for things like early childhood education, pollution reduction and HIV prevention research has remained tied up even after his Jan. 31 order halting the spending freeze plan, the states said. McConnell, who was appointed by former President Barack Obama, ordered the Trump administration to 'immediately take every step necessary' to unfreeze all federal grants and loans. He also said his order blocked the administration from cutting billions of dollars in grant funding from the National Institutes of Health, a move announced last week. The Justice Department said McConnell's order prevents the executive branch from exercising its lawful authority, including over discretionary spending or fraud. 'A single district court judge has attempted to wrest from the President the power to 'take care that the laws be faithfully executed.' This state of affairs cannot be allowed to persist for one more day,' government attorneys wrote in their appeal. The states, meanwhile, argued that the president can't block money that Congress has approved, and the still-frozen grants and loans are causing serious problems for their residents. They urged the appeals court to keep allowing the case to play out in front of McConnell. The court battle is unfolding as a string of court losses is increasingly frustrating top administration officials by slowing President Donald Trump's wide-ranging agenda . Judges have also blocked, at least temporarily, Trump's push to end birthright citizenship for anyone born in the U.S., access to Treasury Department records by billionaire Elon Musk's Department of Government Efficiency and a mass deferred resignation plan for federal workers. The Republican administration previously said the sweeping funding pause would bring federal spending in line with the president's priorities, including increasing fossil fuel production, removing protections for transgender people and ending diversity, equity and inclusion efforts. A different federal judge in Washington has also issued a temporary restraining order against the funding freeze plan and since expressed concern that some nonprofit groups weren't getting their funding.	https://www.voanews.com/a/appeals-court-rejects-push-to-reinstate-spending-freezes-on-grants-loans/7971794.html	2025-02-11T17:21:17-08:00	
Vance stakes forceful claim to US leadership in AI	U.S. Vice President J.D. Vance on Tuesday vowed that the United States would maintain its leadership position in the development of advanced artificial intelligence and warned leaders of other countries not to adopt regulatory standards that might 'kill' the new technology 'just as it's taking off.' 'The United States of America is the leader in AI, and our administration plans to keep it that way,' Vance told an audience of world leaders at an AI summit in Paris. He said the administration of President Donald Trump 'will ensure that the most powerful AI systems are built in the U.S. with American-designed and manufactured chips.' Vance said that the U.S. is open to collaboration with its allies. 'But,' he said, 'to create that kind of trust, we need international regulatory regimes that foster the creation of AI technology rather than strangles it, and we need our European friends in particular to look to this new frontier with optimism rather than trepidation.' Regulations criticized The vice president criticized the European Union's regulatory structure, in particular the privacy-focused General Data Protection Regulation and the misinformation-focused Digital Services Act, and he said the Trump administration will not accept foreign governments 'tightening the screws on U.S. tech companies with international footprints.' Vance also appeared to criticize the effort in Europe to replace power generated by burning fossil fuels with more sustainable sources, saying that countries are 'chasing reliable power out of their nations' at a time when AI systems demand ever-greater access to electricity. 'The AI future is not going to be won by handwringing about safety,' Vance said. 'It will be won by building — from reliable power plants to the manufacturing facilities that can produce the chips of the future.' While dozens of countries in attendance at the summit signed a joint declaration on 'building trustworthy data governance frameworks to encourage development of innovative and privacy-protective AI,' the U.S. and U.K. did not. More calls for reduced regulation Although not as dismissive of regulations and safety concerns as Vice President Vance, other leaders at the summit appeared to agree that the regulatory burden on companies in the AI field should be lightened. French President Emmanuel Macron, the summit's host, said that while safety concerns are important, Europe also needs to make it easier for AI firms there to move quickly and innovate at the same pace as other countries. 'At the national and European scale, it is very clear that we have to resynchronize with the rest of the world,' Macron said. European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen defended the bloc's privacy regulations and other standards, pointing out that they are meant to help businesses by creating rules that apply uniformly across all 27 member countries. 'At the same time, I know that we have to make it easier, and we have to cut red tape — and we will,' von der Leyen said. Veiled China comments Chinese Vice Premier Zhang Guoqing, who also attended the summit, said Beijing is prepared to work with other countries to develop AI technology, and it is willing to share its discoveries in the field with the aim of creating 'a community with a shared future for mankind.' In his remarks on Tuesday, Vance did not mention China by name but appeared to warn other nations against engaging in the kind of collaboration that Zhang described. Vance spoke of 'hostile foreign adversaries' that 'have weaponized AI software to rewrite history, surveil users and censor speech' and authoritarian regimes that have 'stolen and used AI to strengthen their military intelligence and surveillance capabilities to capture foreign data and create propaganda to undermine other nations national security.' Partnering with authoritarian regimes, Vance said, 'means chaining your nation to an authoritarian master that seeks to infiltrate, dig in and seize your information infrastructure.' The remarks came at a time when the U.S. is taking wide-ranging action to prevent China from gaining access to the most cutting-edge AI technologies. Recent news reports revealing that a seemingly innovative Chinese AI chatbot known as DeepSeek has been collecting user data and storing it on insecure servers in China has led several nations to restrict access to the service. On Monday, Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesperson Gou Jiakun said in a press conference: 'We take the safety and security of AI seriously, and support entrepreneurial innovation by Chinese companies, thus contributing China's part to global AI development.' 'We have helped developing countries enhance capacity building, advocating that AI technologies should be open-sourced and there should be greater accessibility to AI services so that the benefits of AI can be shared by all countries. That said, we are against drawing lines along ideological difference, overstretching the concept of national security, or politicizing trade and tech issues,' Gou said. Tech researchers concerned Vance's remarks about excessive AI safety concerns were in sync with actions taken so far by the Trump administration. On the day he took office, President Trump rescinded an executive order signed by his predecessor entitled, 'Safe, Secure, and Trustworthy Development and Use of Artificial Intelligence.' Following Vance's remarks Tuesday, U.S.-based artificial intelligence researchers warned that a world in which the U.S. declines to require companies to adopt AI safety precautions could make collaboration with colleagues in countries with stronger protections difficult. 'In order to build effective AI, you have to source data globally, so you have more accurate, complete and representative data sets,' Susan Ariel Aaronson told VOA. She is a professor at George Washington University and co-leader of the National Science Foundation's Trustworthy AI Institute for Law and Society. 'Many AI researchers believe we're running out of data,' Aaronson said. 'The future for these firms, the future [for these] markets are overseas, and so we need rules to govern how we interact with policymakers and users in those markets.' Mona Sloane, a professor at the University of Virginia who leads an AI research lab, told VOA that maintaining access to those data sets is a prevailing concern. 'If you talk to people in the research community in the United States, those folks are acutely worried about access to data sets, about collaborating [internationally] on AI questions, or using AI in their research,' she said. 'There will be very severe implications for research in the United States on AI — but also with AI — by getting cut off from these international conversations,' Sloane said.	https://www.voanews.com/a/vance-stakes-forceful-claim-to-us-leadership-in-ai/7971777.html	2025-02-11T17:18:29-08:00	
Trump pauses enforcement, orders review of foreign corruption act	WASHINGTON — President Donald Trump has ordered a pause and review of a law that has defined the activities of U.S. business overseas for nearly five decades, claiming that the strict prohibitions against bribing foreign officials strangle American competitiveness in a tough global market. 'It's going to mean a lot more business for America,' Trump said as he signed the order on Monday for the Department of Justice to pause ongoing investigations and review the 1977 Foreign Corrupt Practices Act for the next six months. The order argues that 'overexpansive and unpredictable FCPA enforcement against American citizens and businesses — by our own Government — for routine business practices in other nations not only wastes limited prosecutorial resources that could be dedicated to preserving American freedoms, but actively harms American economic competitiveness and, therefore, national security.' But the latest annual review of the law's enforcement by Stanford Law School says the number of enforcement actions in 2024 were 'well below the ten-year average of 36,' with 26 cases that year filed by the two entities responsible for enforcement — the DOJ and the Securities and Exchange Commission. 'This decline suggests that each bribery scheme yielded more unique actions against a corporation and its subsidiaries, employees, and agents, but that fewer separate schemes were targeted for enforcement in 2024,' the report concluded. The president's order garnered criticism from anti-corruption advocates. 'The world must not default to where bribery and corruption are the norm,' Gary Kalman, executive director of Transparency International U.S., said in a statement to VOA. 'A race to the bottom harms both the citizens in the country and the businesses involved in corrupt transactions. Those who do choose to flout the law often face multiple bribery demands that delay or prevent these businesses from obtaining the licenses and permits they need to enter overseas markets. In the end, bribery is a lose-lose proposition.' Bribery is still illegal Private legal experts rushed Tuesday to clarify the order's scope and significance. 'Bribery is still Illegal,' according to the headline of the analysis issued Tuesday morning by Washington-based multinational law firm Arnold & Porter. The eight lawyer-authors go on to say in their analysis that not only does bribery remain illegal under the law, which has not been repealed by Congress, but also under various state, federal and foreign laws. They also note that other countries have boosted their enforcement of anti-corruption laws. 'For now, we recommend that companies wait and see what will happen, and meanwhile continue to focus on compliance,' the lawyers concluded. Democratic Representative Jamie Raskin, a constitutional lawyer, said Tuesday that the new order 'puts America on the side of 'routine' corrupt business practices all over the world.' The order, he said, gives corporations 'free rein to pay bribes, kickbacks, and financial tribute to corrupt foreign officials.' His statement also took aim at Elon Musk, the billionaire businessman whose closeness to Trump has put him at the head of efforts to radically reshape the U.S. government and target waste, fraud and corruption through his Department of Government Efficiency. 'The Trump-Musk Administration is making bribery and corruption perfectly legal again,' Raskin wrote in a statement. 'The prices of eggs and other groceries, housing and rent and electricity continue to soar, but it just became a lot cheaper to engage in political corruption.' Musk and his companies have tangled publicly with the SEC and the Department of Commerce, but neither his name nor those of any of the businesses he is associated with appears on either's complete list of FCPA enforcement actions.	https://www.voanews.com/a/trump-pauses-enforcement-orders-review-of-foreign-corruption-act-/7971485.html	2025-02-11T17:02:30-08:00

Key Islamic State planner killed in airstrike, US says	WASHINGTON — The main target in a series of U.S. airstrikes against the Islamic State terror group in Somalia earlier this month is dead, according to the most recent assessment by military officials. U.S. Africa Command (AFRICOM) announced late Tuesday that Islamic State attack planner Ahmed Maeleninine was killed along with 13 other high-ranking operatives in the Feb. 1 operation, run in coordination with the Somali government. In a statement, AFRICOM described Maeleninine as a 'recruiter, financier, and external operations leader responsible for the deployment of jihadists into the United States and across Europe.' Officials did not provide additional information on Maeleninine's exploits. Assessing the success of the U.S. strikes was delayed due to the location of the targets and the terrain — a series of cave complexes in the Cal Miskaad area of Somalia's Golis Mountains. At the time, a Somalia commander told VOA the U.S. strikes had targeted at least 10 locations. Residents in Qandala, a small town in the Bari region of Puntland not far from the site, told VOA that they could see plumes of smoke and flames, and that they heard at least seven explosions. Islamic State, also known as IS or Daesh, has increasingly played a key role in the terror group's operations in Africa and beyond. Since 2022, Somalia has been home to al-Karrar, one of nine regional Islamic State offices established to help sustain the terror group's capabilities. As a result, IS-Somalia has become a key cog in the IS financial network, funneling money to affiliates in Afghanistan and elsewhere in Africa. IS-Somalia has simultaneously become more influential under the leadership of Abdulkadir Mumin, a former militant with al-Qaida-linked al-Shabab, who is thought to now head IS's directorate of provinces, overseeing the terror group's affiliates in Africa. Some U.S. officials worry Mumin has risen even higher, perhaps acting as Islamic State's top emir. Others disagree, but there is consensus that Mumin is nonetheless a pivotal figure. The U.S. previously targeted Mumin in May 2024. Recent intelligence assessments have further warned IS-Somalia has more than doubled in size over the past year and may now have as many as 1,600 fighters, bolstered by an influx of fighters from Ethiopia, Morocco, Sudan, Syria, Tanzania and Yemen. U.S. Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth earlier on Tuesday warned that Washington would not hesitate to take action against IS in Somalia and beyond. 'Where we see those growing, plotting or planning with increased capabilities, we will strike,' he said during a visit to AFRICOM headquarters in Stuttgart, Germany. He also said the U.S. is open to keeping in place about 500 special operation forces currently stationed in Somalia. 'I want to listen to the commanders on the ground, first and foremost,' Hegseth said. 'The president, he's charged me with, give me your best advice but also keep your ear to the ground of what's most effective.' U.S. President Donald Trump, toward the end of his first term in office in January 2021, withdrew U.S. forces from Somalia. Former President Joe Biden reversed the decision in May 2022, sending about 500 U.S. special operation forces to help Somali forces counter IS and al-Shabab.

Trump signs executive order to continue downsizing federal workforce	WASHINGTON — President Donald Trump made a rare appearance with Elon Musk, his most powerful adviser, in the Oval Office on Tuesday before signing an executive order to continue downsizing the federal workforce. The Associated Press reviewed a White House fact sheet on the order, which is intended to advance Musk's work slashing spending with his Department of Government Efficiency. Musk said there are some good people in the federal bureaucracy, but they need to be accountable and called it an 'unelected' fourth branch. 'The people voted for major government reform, and that's what the people are going to get,' he said. 'That's what democracy is all about.' It was Musk's first time taking questions from reporters since he joined the Trump administration as a special government employee with sprawling influence over federal agencies. He's also the world's richest person and the owner of X, the social media platform formerly known as Twitter. Despite concerns that he's amassing unaccountable power with little transparency, Musk described himself as an open book. He joked that the scrutiny was like a 'daily proctology exam.' The White House fact sheet said that 'agencies will undertake plans for large-scale reductions in force and determine which agency components (or agencies themselves) may be eliminated or combined because their functions aren't required by law.' It also said that agencies should 'hire no more than one employee for every four employees that depart from federal service.' There are plans for exceptions when it comes to immigration, law enforcement and public safety. Trump and Musk are pushing federal workers to resign in return for financial incentives, although their plan is currently on hold while a judge reviews its legality. The deferred resignation program, commonly described as a buyout, would allow employees to quit and still get paid until Sept. 30. Administration officials said more than 65,000 workers have taken the offer. Hundreds of people gathered for a rally Tuesday across the street from the U.S. Capitol in support of federal workers. Janet Connelly, a graphic designer with the Department of Energy, said she's fed up with emails from the Office of Personnel Management encouraging people to take the deferred resignation program. She tried to use her spam settings to filter out the emails but to no avail. Connelly said she has no plans to take the offer. 'From the get-go, I didn't trust it,' she said. Connelly said she thinks of her work as trying to do an important service for the American public. 'It's too easy to vilify us,' she said. Others have said fear and uncertainty have swept through the federal workforce. 'They're worried about their jobs. They're worried about their families. They're also worried about their work and the communities they serve,' said Helen Bottcher, a former Environmental Protection Agency employee and current union leader in Seattle. Bottcher participated in a press conference hosted by Senator Patty Murray, a Democrat from Washington. Murray said workers 'deserve better than to be threatened, intimidated and pushed out the door by Elon Musk and Donald Trump.' She also said that 'we actually need these people to stay in their jobs or things are going to start breaking.'	https://www.voanews.com/a/trump-signs-executive-order-to-continue-downsizing-federal-workforce-/7971513.html	2025-02-11T15:54:36-08:00

Optimism grows as Niger holds convention on transition plans	ABUJA, NIGERIA — Niger is set to hold a national convention to map out its long-awaited political transition following the July 2023 coup that deposed President Mohamed Bazoum. Junta leader, General Abdourahamane Tchiani, says the dialogue will be inclusive, set governance priorities and determine the transition timeline. Niger's military announced on state television last Saturday that the national convention will take place from February 15-19. Authorities said the meeting is expected to produce a preliminary draft of the transition charter. Junta leader General Abdourahamane Tchiani had initially committed to a three-year transition after seizing power from President Mohamed Bazoum in July 2023. But months of silence on the issue fueled uncertainty among Nigeriens and international observers. Ibrahim Faruk, program coordinator for the African division at Yiaga Africa, said the convention is a step in the right direction. 'This signals the beginning of the timeline for a transition to a democratically elected government in the Republic of Niger,' said Faruk. 'I think why this is important is that democratic stability in the West African subregion has a way of creating a ripple effect. We saw how once there were coups and attempted coups in some of these countries, it caused a ripple effect. But beyond just a return to [a] democratic government, it must also provide the promise of development that comes with democracy as well.' Ahead of the convention, authorities held consultations across Niger's eight regions and formed a national commission to oversee the dialogue. At the end of the meeting, the commission is expected to submit a final report to Tchiani within three weeks. The July 2023 coup triggered widespread condemnation, including threats of military intervention from the regional Economic Community of West African States, known as ECOWAS. Niger's political crisis reflects a broader trend in the Sahel, where military takeovers have become more frequent amid escalating jihadist threats and growing resentment toward civilian governments. Faruk believes Niger could set a positive example. 'Mali, Niger and Burkina Faso, who have witnessed unconstitutional change of government — I think one common thread that has been running through these three countries is that there hasn't been adherence to previously agreed transition timelines.' said Faruk. '[So,] I hope that with this step in the Republic of Niger, it will signal to their brothers in Mali and Burkina Faso that indeed there's an importance to return back to democratically elected government.' Mali and Burkina Faso, both under military rule, have extended their transition timelines, despite initially pledging a quicker return to democracy. Mali's military attributes the delay to a second coup in 2021, just months after overthrowing President Ibrahim Boubacar Keita. Burkina Faso's junta postponed elections, citing security concerns. Political analyst Ahmed Buhari said a transition plan is a good step, but 'it's very important for us Africans to know that we cannot copy and paste an entire system and expect it to work with different cultural views, values and norms,' he said. 'And that is why I think that we're struggling as a continent to find stability, economic growth, security, and most importantly, identity for our people. Different democracies will work for different people around the world. We must create a democratic environment that is suitable for our current realities and challenges.' Critics warn that prolonged military rule remains a strong possibility in the Sahel.	https://www.voanews.com/a/optimism-grows-as-niger-holds-convention-on-transition-plans/7971421.html	2025-02-11T14:17:14-08:00

Russia frees American serving 14-year marijuana sentence	Marc Fogel, an American teacher detained in Russia since August 2021 for bringing medically prescribed marijuana into the country, was freed by Moscow on Tuesday and headed back to the United States, the White House announced. The 63-year-old history teacher, who had been serving a 14-year sentence, was expected to be reunited with his family in the eastern state of Pennsylvania by the end of the day. He left Russian airspace aboard the personal aircraft of Steve Witkoff, U.S. President Donald Trump’s foreign affairs envoy who helped negotiate his release. Mike Waltz, Trump’s national security adviser, said the U.S. and Russia 'negotiated an exchange' to free Fogel but gave no details about what the U.S. side of the bargain entailed. In such deals in recent years, the U.S. has often released Russian prisoners that Moscow wanted in exchange. Instead, Waltz cast the deal for Fogel’s release in broader geopolitical terms, saying it was 'a show of good faith from the Russians and a sign we are moving in the right direction to end the brutal and terrible war in Ukraine,' an invasion Russia launched against its neighbor in February 2022, with hundreds of thousands killed or wounded on both sides. Trump had vowed to broker an end to Russia’s war on Ukraine before taking office Jan. 20, but his aides more recently have said he hopes to do it within the first 100 days of his new administration, roughly by the end of April. 'Since President Trump’s swearing-in, he has successfully secured the release of Americans detained around the world, and President Trump will continue until all Americans being held are returned to the United States,' Waltz said. The recent release of six Americans held in Venezuela and Fogel’s freeing are the only publicly known instances. Fogel had been traveling with a small amount of medically prescribed marijuana to treat back pain. Once convicted by a Russian court, he began serving his 14-year sentence in June 2022, with the outgoing administration of former President Joe Biden late last year classifying him as wrongfully detained. Witkoff is a billionaire New York real estate executive and close friend of Trump’s. He previously had helped negotiate the six-week Israel-Hamas ceasefire in Gaza initiated by Biden in the last months of his presidency. Witkoff also had been secretly negotiating the deal for Fogel’s release. Online flight trackers spotted his presence in Moscow when he flew there on his private jet. With the U.S. leading the way in the West’s opposition to the Russian invasion of Ukraine, it was the first known trip to Moscow by a senior U.S. official since William Burns, then the Central Intelligence Agency director, flew to the Russian capital in November 2021, in an unsuccessful attempt to keep Russia from invading Ukraine.	https://www.voanews.com/a/russia-frees-american-serving-14-year-marijuana-sentence/7971415.html	2025-02-11T13:58:54-08:00	
US withdrawal from UN human rights body draws mixed reactions	Washington — Human rights experts in Washington are divided over whether the U.S. withdrawal from a United Nations body on human rights will hurt North Korea’s already poor human rights situation. Last Tuesday, U.S. President Donald Trump signed an executive order pulling the U.S. out of the U.N. Human Rights Council, or UNHRC, reintroducing the stance he held during his previous term. The executive order said that the UNHRC has 'protected human rights abusers by allowing them to use the organization to shield themselves from scrutiny,' adding that the council deserves 'renewed scrutiny.' The decision was announced ahead of Trump’s recent meeting with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, who visited Washington for the first time since Trump’s second inauguration. Since his first term, President Trump has been disapproving of the activities of the U.N. human rights body. In June 2018, the Trump administration criticized the UNHRC for its 'bias against Israel,' stressing the council that year passed resolutions against Israel more than those passed against North Korea, Iran and Syria combined. Negative impact Robert King, who served as the U.S. special envoy for North Korea’s human rights under the Obama administration, said that the U.S. decision to withdraw from the U.N. Human Rights Council could negatively undermine international efforts to improve human rights conditions in the North. 'It will have a negative impact. The U.N. Human Rights Council has been a very effective body in terms of calling attention to North Korea’s serious human rights abuses,' King told VOA Korean on the phone last week. 'And the fact that the United States will not be an active participant is again a very unfortunate situation.' Roberta Cohen, former deputy assistant secretary of state for human rights, said leaving the UNHRC is 'a short-sighted decision.' Cohen, who also served as senior adviser to the U.S. Delegation to the U.N. Commission on Human Rights and the General Assembly, said it is important that the U.S. be seated at the council with a vote and be active in mobilizing support for any new initiatives. 'If the reforms are needed and they are, the U.S. should be involved heavily,' Cohen told VOA Korean by phone last week. 'Walking away cedes the floor to your opponents.' Cohen highlighted that the council was where the Commission of Inquiry on the Human Rights in North Korea, or COI, was conceived. The COI is widely considered to be the first systematic and thorough documentation of Pyongyang’s violations of human rights. She added that an update of the COI is to be presented in September for the first time in more than a decade, saying that Washington needs to be part of the process when the report is introduced. However, others question the role of the Human Rights Council in making a real impact on improving North Korea's human rights conditions. 'The Human Rights Council has become a very tragic farce. It was supposed to promote and protect human rights around the world but instead it coddles dictatorships and gives them legitimacy by including them as members of the council,' said Suzanne Scholte, president of the Defense Forum Foundation and a longtime North Korea human rights activist. 'We're not addressing the horrific things that are happening to the North Korean refugees in China that are being shot and executed when they’re returned.' ‘Illegitimate’ members Human rights experts have long criticized Beijing for failing to afford protection to North Korean refugees and forcefully repatriating them to North Korea. David Maxwell, vice president of the Center for Asia Pacific Strategy in Washington, said North Korean human rights issues need to be separated from how Trump wants to deal with the United Nations. 'This is about the Trump administration’s views toward U.N. organizations and how they are being misused by countries such as China, Russia, Iran and North Korea,' Maxwell told VOA Korean on Monday via email. 'When these organizations are coerced by members of the so-called axis of upheaval, they are not able to support the people who are suffering true human rights abuses.' Meanwhile, Andrew Yeo, a senior fellow and the SK-Korea Foundation chair at the Brookings Institution’s Center for Asia Policy Studies in Washington, said the U.S. has other tools to address the North Korean human rights issue. 'Pulling out of the UNHRC won’t make much of a difference practically speaking,' Yeo told VOA Korean via email last week. 'The U.S. has other means and platforms to raise North Korean human rights objections, including its own State Department human rights reports.' The U.S. rejoined the UNHRC shortly after the inauguration of Joe Biden as president in 2021, but the Biden administration decided not to seek a second term as a board member of the council when the three-year membership was to expire at the end of 2024. The move was made amid the ongoing war between Israel and Hamas, which launched a surprise attack on the former a year prior. The State Department explained at the time that the U.S. decided not to pursue a second term at the council 'because we are engaged with our allies about the best way to move forward.' Every March or April, the State Department releases the annual Human Rights Reports, which cover the human rights situations around the world. The document last year said there were credible reports of unlawful killing, enforced disappearances and torture taking place in North Korea.	https://www.voanews.com/a/us-withdrawal-from-un-human-rights-body-draws-mixed-reactions/7971418.html	2025-02-11T13:57:43-08:00

Trump doubles down on Gaza takeover plan to Jordan's King Abdullah	WASHINGTON — King Abdullah II was at the White House on Tuesday as U.S. President Donald Trump doubled down on his demand that Jordan permanently take in Palestinians and support the United States to take over Gaza — a plan that Trump said will 'be wonderful' for the Middle East. 'You're going to see some great progress,' Trump told the Jordanian king in front of reporters in the Oval Office ahead of their meeting. 'The whole thing will come. It's not a complex thing to do.' He added, 'You're going to have stability in the Middle East for the first time. And the Palestinians, or the people that live now in Gaza, will be living beautifully in another location. They're going to be living safely.' Pressed by a reporter, Trump said that the Palestinians will live 'where we ultimately choose as a group,' which could be 'a parcel of land in Jordan ... a parcel of land in Egypt,' and elsewhere. Abdullah and Egyptian President Abdel-Fattah el-Sissi have rejected Trump’s plans to forcibly relocate an estimated 1.9 million Palestinians from Gaza into neighboring Jordan and Egypt so the U.S. can take over and 'own' the territory. The king declined Trump’s invitation to share his counteroffer with reporters. 'I think we have to keep in mind that there is a plan from Egypt and the Arab countries. We've been invited by [Saudi Crown Prince] Mohammed bin Salman to discussions in Riyadh,' Abdullah said, stressing the need to find a mutually beneficial solution. 'We're going to have some interesting discussions today,' he said, adding that Jordan is immediately prepared to take in 2,000 children who are sick with cancer and other illnesses. Trump maintained that the United States will not be purchasing Gaza but did not elaborate on his takeover plan. 'We're going to have it, and we're going to keep it, and we're going to make sure that there's going to be peace, and there's not going to be any problem, and nobody's going to question it,' he said. It’s a high-stakes meeting for Abdullah that comes as Trump and Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu warn that if Hamas does not return Israeli hostages by noon Saturday, the ceasefire between Israel and Hamas that was agreed upon Jan. 19 will end. 'I don't think they're going to make a deadline, personally. I think they want to play tough guy. But we'll see how tough they are,' Trump said Tuesday, adding that he rejects the incremental nature of the swap. 'They either have them out by Saturday at 12 o'clock or all bets are off,' he said. The agreement between Israelis and Hamas on the number of hostages being released for Palestinians held in Israeli jails was negotiated for months by the Biden administration together with Qatar and Egypt. Hamas on Monday threatened to delay the next planned release of Israeli hostages because of what it said are Israeli violations of the truce. On Tuesday, Netanyahu said he has ordered the Israeli military to surround Gaza. 'The decision that I passed unanimously in the Cabinet is this: If Hamas does not return our hostages by Saturday noon, the ceasefire will be terminated, and the IDF will return to intense fighting until Hamas is finally defeated,' he said, referring to the Israel Defense Forces. Aid threats Ahead of the king’s visit to Washington, Trump warned that U.S. assistance to Jordan and Egypt could be in jeopardy if they don’t meet his demands on Gaza. On Tuesday he seemed to backtrack, saying, 'I don't have to threaten that. ... I think we're above that.' Jordan and Egypt are major recipients of U.S. military and economic aid. The U.S. provided Amman with almost $1.7 billion in foreign aid in fiscal 2023, the most recent period with complete data, according to U.S. government information. It gave Cairo about $1.5 billion during the same period. Trump first floated the idea of developing Gaza into what he calls 'the Riviera of the Middle East' during Netanyahu’s visit to the White House last week. The proposal sent shock waves throughout the Middle East and placed Abdullah in a difficult spot between keeping military and diplomatic ties with a key ally and popular support for Palestinians at home. The Jordanian king has been under immense pressure to maintain good relations with the U.S. over the years while absorbing the shocks from Washington’s policy that has drifted toward Israel’s ultra-right parties, particularly since the first Trump administration, said Zaha Hassan, a fellow at the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace. 'There is no set of circumstances in which the king will accept Palestinian displacement into Jordan,' Hassan told VOA. 'The issue is existential for the king and his continued reign,' she said. Threat to Jordan’s stability Nearly 3 million Palestinians are in Jordan — refugees and naturalized Jordanian citizens of Palestinian descent who came as refugees during Al-Nakba, the mass displacement of Palestinians during the 1948 Arab-Israeli War. An influx of Palestinians from Gaza would dramatically increase strains on an already struggling economy and could upend the fragile demographic balance in Jordanian society, which includes hundreds of thousands of Syrian refugees. Palestinians, and those who support their cause in Jordan, will not accept more displacement, said Ghaith al-Omari, a senior fellow at the Washington Institute for Near East Policy. 'This will create domestic unrest,' he told VOA, adding that an influx would include Hamas members and supporters, creating a terror threat for the kingdom that would turn Jordan into a staging ground for attacks on Israel. 'All of these things will create very, very severe threats to Jordan's stability and maybe even survival,' he said. Jordanian officials have rejected the forced relocation of Palestinians as morally wrong. Palestinians are adamant they will not leave the land they consider rightfully theirs. Trump’s plan could also disrupt the fragile peace between Israel and Jordan under a 1994 peace treaty. 'That agreement would be in jeopardy, as it was based on certain guarantees from the U.S. and premised on a political solution for Palestinians, who had signed an interim agreement with Israel a year earlier,' Hassan said. Israeli far-right politicians, including Finance Minister Bezalel Smotrich, support Trump’s plan, as do most Israelis, according to a survey by the country’s Channel 12 media. United Nations Special Rapporteur Francesca Albanese said Trump’s proposal is 'unlawful, immoral and irresponsible,' and worse than ethnic cleansing. 'It’s inciting to commit forced displacement, which is an international crime,' she said last week at a news conference in Copenhagen. Pressed by a reporter, Trump maintained he will stick to his plan to develop Gaza no matter what alternatives Arab countries may offer. 'I think it's going to be something that's going to be magnificent for the Palestinians. They're going to be in love with it,' Trump said. 'I did very well with real estate. I can tell you about real estate. They're going to be in love with it.'

How pause in US foreign aid is impacting South, Central Asia	WASHINGTON — In Kabul, Afghanistan, a major midwifery program — girls' only higher education option — has closed. Across Pakistan, dozens of development programs have ground to a halt. In Bangladesh, a health research center has laid off more than 1,000 employees. The fallout comes two weeks after U.S. President Donald Trump's administration suspended foreign aid amid a widespread review, leaving thousands of development programs in limbo. 'I'm in shock,' said a student at the USAID-funded midwifery school in Kabul, speaking anonymously. 'This was the last remaining option for girls to receive an education and get a job.' 'People keep calling and asking, 'When is the program going to restart?'' said the head of a USAID-backed education nonprofit in Afghanistan, speaking on condition of anonymity. The freeze follows a Jan. 20 executive order issued by Trump that suspended all foreign aid pending a 30-day review. The president said the review was necessary because 'the United States foreign aid industry and bureaucracy are not aligned with American interests, and in many cases, antithetical to American values.' The executive order said the current setup 'serves to destabilize world peace by promoting ideas in foreign countries' that undermine 'harmonious' international relations. Now, U.S. government agencies involved in delivering foreign assistance must decide by April 30 to keep, change or end their foreign aid programs. The aid suspension marks a sharp break with decades of U.S. foreign policy. Historically, the U.S. has been the world's biggest foreign aid donor, with $68 billion in aid in 2023. The offices of USAID, the lead foreign aid agency, remain closed. Although the State Department has issued a broad exemption to 'lifesaving' humanitarian programs such as emergency food distribution in Afghanistan, most programs on the ground remain closed. U.S. Secretary of State Marco Rubio, who has taken over as acting head of USAID, said that while he backs foreign assistance, 'every dollar' spent on foreign assistance must advance U.S. national interest. 'We are not walking away from foreign aid,' Rubio told Scott Jennings on Sirius XM Patriot 125 on Monday. 'We are walking away from foreign aid that's dumb, that's stupid, that wastes American taxpayer money.' USAID is recognized globally as a premiere development agency, but critics at home and abroad have long accused it of throwing American taxpayer money into wasteful projects. To highlight this, the White House last week issued a list of USAID programs involving 'waste and abuse,' including $1.5 million 'to advance diversity, equity and inclusion' in Serbia; $47,000 for a 'transgender opera' in Colombia; and $6 million to fund tourism in Egypt. Foreign aid defenders acknowledge the waste, but they argue these projects represent a fraction of the $68 billion U.S. aid program. South Asia Though U.S. aid to South and Central Asian nations has declined recently, the region still gets billions annually, with Afghanistan the largest regional recipient. The country, which received $1.3 billion in 2023, now faces a wave of program shutdowns. While emergency humanitarian aid continues after a brief interruption, development programs from child and maternal health to education have stopped. The impact has been wide-ranging. The United Nations Population Fund has frozen all U.S.-backed programs in Afghanistan, potentially leaving more than 9 million people cut off from health services, according to regional director, Pio Smith. The UNFPA, which Republicans have long accused of promoting coercive family planning practices, relies on U.S. assistance for almost a third of its humanitarian operations. The agency, which denies the charge, is likely to lose all that support, impacting its work across the region. Education is another casualty of the aid suspension in Afghanistan. The American University of Afghanistan, established in 2006 with a USAID grant and now operating out of Qatar, has reportedly suspended classes. A university spokesperson could not be reached for comment. Meanwhile in Bangladesh, the Asian University for Women is scrambling to keep hundreds of Afghan students after U.S. funding dried up. To cover the funding shortfall, the university has launched a $7 million appeal. 'We cannot and will not send these students back to an uncertain and oppressive future,' the university said in a statement. Bangladesh, despite its $437 billion economy, is also feeling the pinch. The country is a U.S. ally and South Asia's largest recipient of U.S. aid after Afghanistan, with more than $500 million supporting a wide range of programs from emergency food assistance to fighting tuberculosis and pandemic influenza. In Pakistan, more than three dozen USAID-funded projects have reportedly shut down in recent days. A burns and plastic surgery center in the northwestern city of Peshawar, built with a $15 million USAID grant, faces an uncertain future. 'At the moment, I don't know what's going to happen to the whole program, but I'm hopeful that the program will move forward,' Dr. Tahmeedullah, the center's director, said in an interview. Central Asia In Central Asia, where five former Soviet Republics received about $235 million in 2023, nearly every USAID-funded program and initiative has been stopped, according to local news reports. 'From what I've gathered, all types of programs and initiatives have been suspended as of now,' said Alisher Khamidov, a Kyrgyzstan-based consultant who follows USAID-projects in the region. The suspensions include critical health initiatives such as USAID's $18 million-$20 million 'TB-Free' programs in Tajikistan and Uzbekistan, both launched in 2023. 'This five-year project has special significance for Uzbekistan as it was one of the few projects tackling TB in the country,' Khamidov said in an interview last week with VOA. The State Department did not respond to a VOA question about the current status of U.S.-funded aid operations in South and Central Asia. USAID has poured billions of dollars into many regional development programs since the early 1990s, including initiatives to promote democratization and civil society. Those efforts, however, represent a fraction of the total aid. Today, the agency is largely focused on agriculture and health projects, according to Khamidov. Across the region, USAID programs have long faced allegations of waste and abuse, with numerous examples uncovered by the agency's own inspector general. Nowhere has the alleged abuse been starker than in Afghanistan, where the Taliban have been accused of siphoning of millions of dollars in U.S. aid funneled through U.N. agencies. Some Taliban opponents have welcomed the aid freeze, arguing that it could force the group to accede to international demands. Others, such as former Afghan Vice President Amrullah Saleh, say it could level the political playing field in the country. 'The dismantling of USAID clears the path for the rise of genuine leaders in Afghanistan,' Saleh wrote on X. Bryan Clark, a senior fellow at the Hudson Institute, says a multibillion-dollar program can inevitably lead to waste and abuse. He told VOA that foreign aid can showcase U.S. goodwill but also cause diplomatic friction over policy and cultural issues. Clark said that though the aid pause should have been less abrupt, a thorough review of the program is necessary. 'It makes sense to stop as a new administration comes in and reassess where the money is going, where it's being allocated,' he said. VOA's Afghan, Deewa and Urdu Services and correspondent Vero Balderas contributed to this report.	https://www.voanews.com/a/how-pause-in-us-foreign-aid-is-impacting-south-central-asia/7971248.html	2025-02-11T13:15:35-08:00	
EU, Canada vow to stand firm against Trump's tariffs on metals	The 27-nation European Union and Canada quickly vowed Tuesday to stand firm against U.S. President Donald Trump’s move to impose 25% tariffs on their steel and aluminum exports, verbal sparring that could lead to a full-blown trade war between the traditionally allied nations. 'The EU will act to safeguard its economic interests,' European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen said in a statement. 'Tariffs are taxes — bad for business, worse for consumers. 'Unjustified tariffs on the EU will not go unanswered — they will trigger firm and proportionate countermeasures,' she said. Trump said the steel and aluminum tariffs would take effect on March 12. In response, EU officials said they could target such U.S. products as bourbon, jeans, peanut butter and motorcycles, much of it produced in Republican states that supported Trump in his election victory. The EU scheduled a first emergency video on Wednesday to shape the bloc's response. Prime Minister Donald Tusk of Poland, which holds the EU presidency, said it was 'important that everyone sticks together. Difficult times require such full solidarity.' Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau said during a conference on artificial intelligence in Paris that Trump’s steel and aluminum levy would be 'entirely unjustified,' and that 'Canadians will resist strongly and firmly if necessary.' Von der Leyen is meeting Tuesday with U.S. Vice President JD Vance in Paris, where they are expected to discuss Trump's tariff orders. 'We will protect our workers, businesses and consumers,' she said in advance of the meeting. Trump imposed the steel and aluminum tariff to boost the fortunes of U.S. producers. 'It’s a big deal,' he said. 'This is the beginning of making America rich again.' Billionaire financier Howard Lutnick, Trump’s nominee to lead the Commerce Department, said the tariff on the imports could bring back 120,000 U.S. jobs. As he watched Trump sign an executive order, Lutnick said, 'You are the president who is standing up for the American steelworker, and I am just tremendously impressed and delighted to stand next to you.' Trump’s proclamations raised the rate on aluminum imports to 25% from the previous 10% that he imposed in 2018 to aid the struggling sector. And he restored a 25% tariff on millions of tons of steel and aluminum imports. South Korea — the fourth-biggest steel exporter to the United States, following Canada, Brazil and Mexico — also vowed to protect its companies' interests but did not say how. South Korean acting President Choi Sang-mok said Seoul would seek to reduce uncertainties 'by building a close relationship with the Trump administration and expanding diplomatic options.' The spokesperson of British Prime Minister Keir Starmer said London was 'engaging with our U.S. counterparts to work through the detail' of the planned tariffs. In Monday's executive order, Trump said 'all imports of aluminum articles and derivative aluminum articles from Argentina, Australia, Canada, Mexico, EU countries and the UK' would be subject to additional tariffs. The same countries are named in his executive order on steel, along with Brazil, Japan and South Korea. 'I'm simplifying our tariffs on steel and aluminum,' Trump said. 'It's 25% without exceptions or exemptions.' Bernd Lange, the chair of the European Parliament's international trade committee, warned that previous trade measures against the U.S. were only suspended and could legally be easily revived. 'When he starts again now, then we will, of course, immediately reinstate our countermeasures,' Lange told rbb24 German radio. 'Motorcycles, jeans, peanut butter, bourbon, whiskey and a whole range of products that of course also affect American exporters' would be targeted, he said. In Germany, the EU's largest economy, Chancellor Olaf Scholz told parliament that 'if the U.S. leaves us no other choice, then the European Union will react united.' But he warned, 'Ultimately, trade wars always cost both sides prosperity.' The European steel industry expressed concerns about the Trump tariffs. 'It will further worsen the situation of the European steel industry, exacerbating an already dire market environment,' said Henrik Adam, president of the European Steel Association. He said the EU could lose up to 3.7 million tons of steel exports. The United States is the second-largest export market for EU steel producers, representing 16% of the total EU steel exports. 'Losing a significant part of these exports cannot be compensated for by EU exports to other markets,' Adam said. Some material in this report came from The Associated Press and Agence France-Presse.	https://www.voanews.com/a/eu-canada-vow-to-stand-firm-against-trump-tariffs-on-metals/7971311.html	2025-02-11T12:50:37-08:00

US military not 'abandoning' allies, defense chief says	WASHINGTON — World leaders are making a mistake if they conclude that an effort by U.S. President Donald Trump to review America’s global military posture means Washington is pulling back, according to Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth. Hegseth Tuesday spoke to reporters in Stuttgart, Germany, home to the headquarters for U.S. European Command and U.S. Africa Command, the first stop on his first international trip since being sworn-in last month. 'We would be remiss in not reviewing force posture everywhere, but it would be the wrong planning assumption to say America's abandoning something or America's leaving,' Hegseth said. 'No, America's smart to observe, plan, prioritize and project power where we need to deter conflict,' he added. The comments come ahead of key meetings Wednesday and Thursday in Brussels of NATO defense ministers and of the Ukraine Defense Contact Group, a group of almost 50 countries who have pledged to support Ukraine in its efforts to repel Russia. U.S. defense officials have said Hegseth is expected to press NATO allies to take more of a leadership role in confronting challenges in Europe and also to increase defense spending — something the U.S. defense chief emphasized in Germany. 'The European continent deserves to be free from any aggression. But it ought to be those in the neighborhood investing the most in that individual and collective defense,' Hegseth said. 'That's common sense. 'You defend your neighborhood, and the Americans will come alongside you in helping in that defense,' he said. But whether that means the U.S. will maintain a robust military presence across Europe is unclear. Hegseth said Trump’s push for a 'rapid peace deal in Ukraine' could allow the U.S. to shift resources to counter the rising threat from China in the Indo-Pacific. China threat 'There's just no doubt the communist Chinese ambitious ambitions are robust,' Hegseth told reporters. 'Their view of the world is quite different than ours, and whoever carries that mantle is going to set the tone for the 21st century.' He also called out Beijing for what he called pernicious intentions in Latin America and across Africa. 'America's posture there, along with allies and partners, is going to matter about contesting that space,' he said. Terrorism in Africa Hegseth also left open the possibility that the U.S. could maintain a military presence in Africa, including Somalia, despite Trump’s decision to pull U.S. forces from the country during his first term. 'Africa is very much the front lines of a fight from Islamists,' Hegseth said. 'We're not going to allow them to maintain a foothold, especially to try to strike at America.' The U.S. currently has about 500 special operations forces in Somalia, helping government forces push back against the Islamic State terror group’s Somali affiliate and against al-Qaida linked al-Shabab. 'I want to listen to the commanders on the ground, first and foremost,' Hegseth said, adding that while the U.S. will keep forces where they are needed, there’s a preference to 'do counterterrorism effectively over the horizon.' Earlier this month, U.S. airstrikes targeted a senior Islamic State planner in the Somalia’s Golis mountains. Defense spending Hegseth on Tuesday also pledged to find ways to make U.S. defense spending more efficient, saying he will welcome the help of Elon Musk, the multibillionaire running Trump’s non-governmental Department of Government Efficiency, or DOGE. 'I hope to welcome Elon to the Pentagon very soon,' he said. 'There is waste, redundancies and headcounts in headquarters that need to be addressed.' As an example, Hegseth pointed to Pentagon programs focused on addressing climate change. 'The Defense Department is not in the business of climate change, solving the global thermostat,' he said. 'We're in the business of deterring and winning wars.' He added, however, that efforts to cut waste would not be 'to the detriment of American operational or tactical capabilities.' Even while cutting waste, Hegseth said, the U.S. needs to spend more on defense — calling for spending at least 3% of gross domestic product (GDP). The Trump administration has been calling for NATO allies, many of which have lagged behind the U.S. on military funding, to spend at least 5% of GDP on defense.	https://www.voanews.com/a/us-military-not-abandoning-allies-defense-chief-says-/7971327.html	2025-02-11T12:36:06-08:00	
VOA Mandarin: '611' phenomenon raises serious concerns about China's schools	Across China, K-12 schools are making students study more than 16 hours a day, six days a week in a phenomenon called 611. Some schools allow students only a half day off per month. Chinese teachers, key opinion leaders and U.S. education experts talk about the phenomenon, how the Chinese practice affects students, and how it can be improved.

Europe announces plans to ease AI regulations in bid to become heavyweight	Europe says it will ease regulations on artificial intelligence at a key AI summit in Paris on Feb. 11, 2025, that brought together the U.S. and other global tech giants and politicians. But some experts see bigger challenges stalling the bloc’s ambitions to be an AI heavyweight, from the need to pool resources to attracting more investment and talent. After U.S. President Donald Trump’s massive Stargate investment project and China’s DeepSeek startup, Europe wants to get a share of the artificial intelligence pie. Among other announcements at the Paris summit, co-host French President Emmanuel Macron outlined plans for $113 billion in private AI investment. The two-day summit underscored tensions between fears of too much AI regulation and not enough. 'At this moment, we face the extraordinary prospect of a new Industrial Revolution, one on par with the steam engine or Bessemer steel,' U.S. Vice President JD Vance told summit attendees Tuesday. 'But it will never come to pass if overregulation deters innovators from taking the risks necessary to advance the ball.' Macron, who’s been nicknamed France’s startup president, outlined caveats. He said advancing international governance of AI will enable the consolidation of trust, acceleration and innovation in order to set the rules for AI, which are necessary to move forward. Currently, Europe's AI industry lags behind those of the U.S. and China. But the right policies, some experts believe, can help close the gap. 'Europe really has pretty much everything else it needs to lead in AI or other complex technologies,' said Pierre Alexandre Balland, chief data scientist at the Center for European Policy Studies in Brussels. 'The talent is absolutely incredible. … [T]he scale of the European economy is also huge … the education system. Essentially, we see a wind of change in the EU really led by France, and Emmanuel Macron is very much behind that.' Beyond easing EU regulations, Balland sees bigger challenges — such as pooling European research and other resources, calling for investing pension funds to finance AI’s growth, and concentrating on a single AI hub in Europe. 'Paris is absolutely by far the leading AI ecosystem in Europe,' he said. Alicia Garcia-Herrero, senior fellow at Brussels-based Bruegel policy institute, agreed France is leading the way. She believes Europe should narrow its goals — focusing on areas like AI applications for robotics. 'Can the AI make the EU more competitive? No doubt,' Garcia-Herrero said. 'But I think there’s many other issues that need to be solved beyond AI. The most important one is having a single market.' Paris summit organizers have also pushed for commitments on making AI more ethical, accessible and environmentally sustainable.	https://www.voanews.com/a/europe-announces-plans-to-ease-ai-regulations-in-bid-to-become-a-heavyweight-/7971187.html	2025-02-11T11:16:57-08:00	
Gabon courts stand still as magistrates protest working conditions	YAOUNDE, CAMEROON — Gabon’s courts are effectively closed because the magistrates who run them refuse to work due to what they call poor working conditions and pay. They have rejected pleas by leaders to return to work while waiting for conditions to improve. Civilians say hundreds of people seeking justice have been turned away from the courts for close to a month now. Courts in Gabon traditionally handle cases that include land disputes, marriage disputes, divorce, labor disputes, inheritance and criminal offenses. The courts also authenticate documents and establish certificates of nonconviction for civilians who want to get national identity cards or run for public office. Shopkeeper Narcisse Eboko said he visited the court at the administrative center in Gabon's capital, Libreville, five times within the past 10 days to apply for a certificate of nonconviction, but no one has attended to him. Eboko is surprised that the government is allowing courts, which ensure the protection of human rights and freedoms, to be paralyzed for so long, he told VOA via a messaging app from Libreville on Tuesday. Magistrates in Gabon launched their protests on Jan. 13, saying that they want an immediate application of the general status of their profession, which gives financial and material advantages to guarantee their independence. It is very difficult for magistrates to make fair decisions based on the law without adequate remuneration as stated in Gabon's laws, the magistrates say. Gabon's National Trade Union of Magistrates, or SYNAMAG, said it is surprised there has been no concrete response from the central African state’s government on if there are plans to improve the magistrates’ working conditions. SYNAMAG President Landry Abaga Essono said the union launched protests because Gabon's government refused to improve working conditions of magistrates and declined calls for dialogue. He said the protests will continue until the government improves working conditions. SYNAMAG also blamed the government for failing to improve the functioning of understaffed courts with dilapidated infrastructure, especially in Libreville, Mouila, Port-Gentil, Makokou and Franceville. Justice Minister Paul Marie Gondjout defended the government, saying it is not reluctant to solve the problems and is concerned about the plight of the magistrates and other court workers. He cited a new court building in Ntoum as proof. The country’s financial difficulties make it impossible to raise the $40 million needed to immediately solve the problems presented by the magistrates, Gondjout said on state TV Monday. The government is, however, looking for a way to satisfy some urgent needs of magistrates, he said. Essono did not agree, saying Gabon does not lack the financial means to improve working conditions in a sector as important and sensitive as justice, especially when the courts will be highly important during presidential elections in two months. The vote is expected to end a military transition that began with a coup on Aug. 30, 2023. Essono also pointed out that the government had the resources to increase job benefits for government troops only a few months ago. The magistrates say they have petitioned Gabon's transitional president, General Brice Clotaire Oligui Nguema, to immediately order his government to improve their living conditions. VOA could not verify whether Nguema had received the request. SYNAMAG said it is calling on citizens to be patient, saying that the protest is necessary to improve the delivery of justice.	https://www.voanews.com/a/gabon-courts-stand-still-as-magistrates-protest-working-conditions/7970989.html	2025-02-11T10:33:00-08:00	
Amid USAID debate, Britain offers model for merging aid, diplomacy	London — As Washington debates the future of the U.S. Agency for International Development or USAID amid reports that it may be put under the control of the State Department, analysts say Britain could offer lessons for America on merging diplomacy and aid. The Trump administration last month paused funding for USAID, citing a need to align the agency with the president’s America First policy. British model In 2020, then-British Prime Minister Boris Johnson merged the Department for International Development (DFID), which oversaw the UK’s foreign aid programs, with the Foreign Office. 'This will unite our aid with our diplomacy and bring them together in our international effort,' Johnson told lawmakers in June 2020. 'The foreign secretary will be empowered to decide which country receives or ceases to receive British aid while delivering a single UK strategy for each country, overseen by the National Security Council, which I chair,' Johnson added. Johnson’s decision could be traced to his previous role as Britain’s foreign secretary, according to Tim Durrant, program director at the Institute for Government in London. 'I think he'd got frustrated that it felt like DFID, and the UK's aid program and agenda, were separate and not always aligned with what he thought the UK's foreign policy priorities should be,' he told VOA. 'I think there was definitely a sense among those on the right of UK politics that DFID was a bit too big for its boots perhaps or needed better oversight.' Aid shock The move caused shock among many in the aid sector, recalled Mark Miller, a senior advisor at the British-based development research group ODI Global. 'I think the immediate reaction was almost one of confusion. Where does the aid sector go next? What is aid for in this new world where it's being controlled in the Foreign Office? Because you now had a set of senior managers in place who were largely focused on supporting the UK's national interest - however you might interpret that - rather than previously, [which was] a very clear mandate where aid was meant to be prioritised towards poverty reduction,' Miller said, adding that the confusion is 'still playing out.' In 2020, a few months after the merger of DFID with the Foreign Office, Britain’s aid budget was cut from 0.7% of gross national income, the highest in the G7 group of developed nations, to 0.5%. Geopolitical priorities Spending was redirected as the government sought to align aid with its political aims. Almost a third of Britain’s aid budget, amounting to some $5.2 billion, was spent on supporting refugees inside the country in 2023. Aid spending also reflected Britain’s geopolitical priorities, said ODI Global’s Miller. 'There was more attention being paid to trying to out-compete, let's say China or Russia, particularly in Asia-Pacific. Trying to upscale investment in these regions, whereas historically aid had been much more focused on Africa,' he said. 'You've also seen budgets that were traditionally focused on social sectors like health, for example, relatively deprioritized towards some of the sectors associated with the UK’s trade and investment relationships. Particularly energy and climate finance has been a big focus,' Miller added. UK lessons The creation of Britain’s Foreign, Commonwealth and Development Office, or FCDO, offers lessons for Washington as it mulls the future of USAID. 'In the UK instance, there was a sort of reputational hit. DFID had a very strong brand, as does USAID,' said analyst Durrant. 'There's also the kind of knock-on impact it has on morale and productivity. I think this is particularly going to be the case in the U.S.' 'But there is now a sense that the FCDO is the one voice and that there are people who have both development and diplomacy experience who are representing the UK in countries where the UK is spending development money.' There are practical as well as political lessons from Britain’s merging of diplomacy and aid, said Miller of ODI Global. 'The loss of expertise and how this rather disruptive merger is going - I think there's lessons about how that could be managed more carefully. I think the second thing we saw in the UK was that closing down a department didn't necessarily forge a new consensus on what aid is for,' Miller said. With economic pressures impacting government budgets, political debates over the role of foreign aid continue in London and Washington, noted Durrant. 'What you need is strong institutions, you need UK parliamentary and U.S. congressional oversight. You need people to be able to look through what's being spent and how what impact it's having,' he told VOA.	https://www.voanews.com/a/amid-usaid-debate-britain-offers-model-for-merging-aid-diplomacy/7970771.html	2025-02-11T10:18:53-08:00

US, UK and Australia target Russian cybercrime network with sanctions	WASHINGTON — The U.S., U.K. and Australia on Tuesday sanctioned a Russian web-hosting services provider and two Russian men who administer the service in support of Russian ransomware syndicate LockBit. The Treasury Department's Office of Foreign Assets Control and its U.K. and Australian counterparts sanctioned Zservers, a Russia-based bulletproof hosting services provider — which is a web-hosting service that ignores or evades law enforcement requests — and two Russian nationals serving as Zservers operators. Treasury alleges that Zservers provided LockBit access to specialized servers designed to resist law enforcement actions. LockBit ransomware attacks have extracted more than $120 million from thousands of victims around the world. LockBit has operated since 2019, and is the most deployed ransomware variant across the world and continues to be prolific, according to the U.S. Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency. The Treasury Department's Acting Under Secretary for Terrorism and Financial Intelligence, Bradley T. Smith, said Tuesday's action 'underscores our collective resolve to disrupt all aspects of this criminal ecosystem, wherever located, to protect our national security.' LockBit has been linked to attacks on airplane manufacturer Boeing, the November 2023 attack against the Industrial Commercial Bank of China, the U.K.'s Royal Mail, Britain's National Health Service, and international law firm Allen and Overy. Ransomware is the costliest and most disruptive form of cybercrime, crippling local governments, court systems, hospitals and schools as well as businesses. It is difficult to combat as most gangs are based in former Soviet states and out of reach of Western justice. Tammy Bruce, a State Department spokeswoman, said Tuesday's sanctions 'underscore the United States' commitment, along with our international partners, to combating cybercrime and degrading the networks that enable cyber criminals to target our citizens.'	https://www.voanews.com/a/us-uk-and-australia-target-russian-cybercrime-network-with-sanctions-/7970957.html	2025-02-11T09:49:02-08:00	
Salman Rushdie testifies about his shock and pain as stranger repeatedly stabbed him on stage	MAYVILLE, N.Y. — Salman Rushdie described in graphic detail Tuesday the frenzied moments in 2022 when a masked man rushed at him on a stage in western New York and repeatedly slashed him with a knife, leaving him with life-threatening injuries. The 77-year-old author addressed jurors on the second day of testimony at the trial of Hadi Matar, 27, who has pleaded not guilty to attempted murder and assault in the attack. It was the first time since the attack that Rushdie found himself in the same room with the man accused of trying the kill him. 'I only saw him at the last minute,' Rushdie said. 'I was aware of someone wearing black clothes, or dark clothes and a black face mask. I was very struck by his eyes, which were dark and seemed very ferocious.' Rushdie said he first thought his knife-wielding attacker was striking him with a fist. 'But I saw a large quantity of blood pouring onto my clothes,' he said. 'He was hitting me repeatedly. Hitting and slashing.' Rushdie said he was struck more times in his chest and torso and stabbed in his chest as he struggled to get away. 'I was very badly injured. I couldn't stand up any more. I fell down,' he said. While lying on the stage, he recalled 'a sense of great pain and shock, and aware of the fact that there was an enormous quantity of blood that I was lying in.' 'It occurred to me that I was dying. That was my predominant thought,' he said . His wife, Rachel Eliza Griffiths, cried from her seat in the courtroom's second row. Rushdie was blinded in one eye in the attack and spent months recovering, a process he detailed in a memoir released last year. A speaker who was to appear with Rushdie also was wounded. Jurors heard opening statements Monday, followed by testimony from staffers at the Chautauqua Institution, the nonprofit art and education center where the attack happened about 120 kilometers south of Buffalo. Matar has been in custody since he was subdued by spectators after the attack. The trial is expected to last up to two weeks. Jurors are unlikely to hear about a fatwa issued by the late Iranian leader Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini calling for Rushdie's death, according to District Attorney Jason Schmidt. Rushdie, the author of 'Midnight's Children' and 'Victory City,' spent years in hiding after Khomeini announced the fatwa in 1989 following publication of the novel 'The Satanic Verses,' which some Muslims consider blasphemous Schmidt has said discussing Matar's motive will be unnecessary in the state trial, given the attack was seen by a live audience that was expecting to hear Rushdie present a lecture on keeping writers safe. 'This is not a case of mistaken identity,' Schmidt said during opening statements Monday. 'Mr. Matar is the person who attacked Mr. Rushdie without provocation.' A public defender representing Matar told jurors that the case is not as straightforward as prosecutors have made it out to be. 'The elements of the crime are more than `something really bad happened' — they're more defined,' Lynn Schaffer said. 'Something bad did happen, something very bad did happen, but the district attorney has to prove much more than that.' In a separate indictment, federal authorities allege Matar was driven to act by a terrorist organization's 2006 endorsement of the fatwa. A later trial on federal terrorism charges will be scheduled in U.S. District Court in Buffalo.	https://www.voanews.com/a/salman-rushdie-testifies-about-his-shock-and-pain-as-stranger-repeatedly-stabbed-him-on-stage-/7970966.html	2025-02-11T09:46:03-08:00

Trump ally Steve Bannon pleads guilty and avoids jail time in border wall fraud case	New York — Steve Bannon pleaded guilty on Tuesday to a fraud charge related to duping donors who gave money to a private effort to build a wall along the U.S. southern border — a case the conservative strategist has decried as a 'political persecution.' Bannon, a longtime ally of President Donald Trump, reached a plea agreement that spares him from jail time in the 'We Build the Wall' scheme as long as he stays out of trouble. Asked how he was feeling as he left the courtroom, Bannon said, 'Like a million bucks.' The deal comes just days after U.S. Attorney General Pam Bondi ordered the Justice Department to investigate what the president called the ' weaponization of prosecutorial power.' The case had been scheduled to go to trial March 4. Manhattan District Attorney Alvin Bragg's office charged Bannon in state court after a Trump pardon in 2021 wiped away federal charges on the same allegations. In November, Judge April Newbauer ruled prosecutors could show jurors certain evidence, including an email they say shows Bannon was concerned the fundraising effort was 'a scam.' Bannon had been planning an aggressive defense strategy and recently hired a new team of attack dog lawyers who sought to portray the case to jurors as a selective and malicious prosecution. In January, Bannon's lawyers filed papers asking Newbauer to throw out the case, calling it an 'unconstitutional selective enforcement of the law.' The judge had been expected to rule on that on Tuesday before Bannon's plea deal made the request moot. Bannon, 71, pleaded not guilty in September 2022 to a state court indictment charging him with money laundering, fraud and conspiracy. He was accused of falsely promising donors that all money given to the We Build the Wall campaign would go toward building a wall along the U.S.-Mexico border. Instead, prosecutors alleged the money was used to enrich Bannon and others involved in the project. The campaign, launched in 2018 after Trump fired Bannon as his chief strategist, quickly raised over $20 million and privately built a few miles of fencing along the border. It soon ran into trouble with the International Boundary and Water Commission, came under federal investigation and drew criticism from Trump, the Republican whose policy the charity was founded to support. Bragg, a Democrat, took up the case after Trump cut Bannon's federal prosecution short with a pardon in the final hours of his first term in the White House. Presidential pardons apply only to federal crimes, not state offenses. Early in the fundraising campaign, Bannon pooh-poohed it, prosecutors said at a November hearing. 'Isn't this a scam? You can't build the wall for this much money,' Bannon wrote in an email, according to prosecutor Jeffrey Levinson. He said Bannon went on to add: 'Poor Americans shouldn't be using hard-earned money to chase something not doable.' Two other men involved in the project, Brian Kolfage and Andrew Badolato, pleaded guilty to federal charges and were sentenced to prison. A third defendant, Timothy Shea, was convicted and also sentenced to prison. Bannon went to prison in an unrelated case last year, serving four months at a federal lockup in Connecticut for defying a subpoena in the congressional investigation into the U.S. Capitol attack on Jan. 6, 2021. He was released in October. Bondi last week formed a 'Weaponization Working Group' at the Justice Department to examine cases she said appear to have been motivated by 'political objectives or other improper aims,' including Bragg's pursuit of criminal charges against Trump.	https://www.voanews.com/a/trump-ally-steve-bannon-pleads-guilty-and-avoids-jail-time-in-border-wall-fraud-case/7970825.html	2025-02-11T08:26:04-08:00	
Scores dead as Islamic State attacks military base in Somalia	Nearly 100 people were killed and up to 60 others wounded when members of the Islamic State terror group launched a deadly attack on a military base belonging to security forces from Somalia’s Puntland region, officials said Tuesday. At least 27 Puntland soldiers and more than 70 militants were slain in the fierce fighting around the Togga Jacel area of the Cal Miskaad mountains in Puntland’s Bari region, Puntland security officials told VOA. In an interview Tuesday with VOA’s Somali Service, a spokesperson for Puntland security operations, Brigadier General Mohamud Mohamed Ahmed — known as Fadhigo — said the militants waged suicide attacks on the military base late Monday. 'We have confirmed that at least 27 Puntland soldiers and 70 Islamic State militants, were killed during the attack and subsequent gun battle,' Ahmed said. Ahmed said it was the deadliest attack since Puntland launched an offensive last month against Islamic State groups that have hideouts in the mountains. He said the death toll from the attack could be substantially higher than official figures. 'The death toll, especially that of the militants, could be significantly higher than the number we have provided because they were killed in caves. They were hiding, and we are still assessing,' Ahmed said. According to Puntland security officials, the militants using car bombs and suicide motorbikes launched attacks on the Puntland security base before a fierce gunbattle ensued. 'We knew they were coming as we had prior intelligence tip. They attacked us with car bombs and explosives-laden motorbikes, and then dozens of them engaged in a fierce gunbattle with our soldiers,' Ahmed said. A statement from the Puntland forces said their troops repulsed the attack aimed at taking control of the base. 'Puntland security forces have successfully repelled the enemy attack, and they still remain in their base in Togga Jecel, dealing a significant blow to the extremist group,' the statement said. On Wednesday last week, nearly 70 people were killed, and up to 50 others were wounded, during 24 hours of fighting between the two sides. This latest attack is the deadliest the Islamic State militants have waged on Puntland soldiers. Earlier this month, U.S. warplanes targeted the Islamic State affiliate in Somalia, hitting what officials described as high-ranking operatives in the terror group's mountainous stronghold. U.S. President Donald Trump announced the airstrike on social media, describing the main target as a 'Senior ISIS Attack Planner and other terrorists he recruited and led.' Puntland began a major offensive against Islamic State in December and claims to have since killed nearly 200 Islamic State fighters, dozens of them foreign fighters, and captured villages and bases in the mountainous area controlled by IS. This story originated in VOA's Somali Service.

Iran pardons journalists who covered woman’s death that triggered protests	Iran’s top judicial authority has pardoned two journalists who uncovered the death of a young woman in police custody, the judiciary’s news outlet, Mizan, said Tuesday. The case triggered widespread protests in 2022. Journalists Elaheh Mohammadi and Niloofar Hamedi had been sentenced to 12 and 13 years in prison, respectively, by an Iranian Revolutionary Court in 2023 for their coverage of the death of Mahsa Amini. Amini, a Kurdish-Iranian woman, died in 2022 while in the custody of Iran’s morality police for allegedly violating the country’s strict dress code for women. The death of the 22-year-old sparked the nationwide 'Woman Life Freedom' uprising, which in turn prompted a harsh crackdown by Iranian authorities. The pardons of the two journalists were applied on the anniversary of the 1979 Islamic revolution in Iran, Mizan said. 'Following the approval by Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei of a list of pardons that was prepared by the judiciary’s head, these individuals were pardoned,' Mizan said. Both journalists were temporarily released last year after spending 17 months behind bars and later acquitted of the charge of 'collaboration with the U.S.' in an appeals court. Other charges, such as 'colluding against national security' and 'propaganda against the regime,' remained. But the pardons mean those charges have now been cleared, and the legal cases against the journalists are now closed. The jailings of the two journalists underscores the poor state of press freedom in Iran. The country ranks among the worst jailers of journalists in the world, with at least 16 behind bars for their work as of early December 2024, according to the Committee to Protect Journalists, or CPJ. Iranian authorities detained at least 95 journalists in the wake of the nationwide protests following Amini’s death, according to CPJ. In 2024, Iran ranked 176 out of 180 countries on the World Press Freedom Index, where 180 shows the worst press freedom environment.

UN announces death in Yemeni prison of aid worker detained by Houthis	Cairo — The United Nations World Food Program said Tuesday that an aid worker has died in a Yemeni prison three weeks after his detention by Houthi rebels. The announcement came a day after the U.N. suspended its operations in the rebel's stronghold in northern Yemen. The World Food Program said in a statement that one of its staff members died while in detention in northern Yemen. He was one of seven WFP staffers detained by the Houthi rebels on Jan. 23. No cause of death was given. 'Heartbroken and outraged by the tragic loss of WFP team member, Ahmed, who lost his life while arbitrarily detained in Yemen,' WFP executive director Cindy McCain wrote on the X social media platform. She said the worker, who is survived by his wife and two children, 'played a crucial role in our mission to deliver lifesaving food assistance.' A Houthi spokesman didn't immediately respond to requests for comment. The 40-year-old worker, who joined the U.N. food agency in 2017, died Monday in a prison in the northern province of Saada, and that the circumstances of his death weren't immediately known, said a WFP official, who spoke on condition of anonymity. The U.N. said Monday it was suspending its humanitarian operations in the northern province of Saada after the Houthis detained eight more U.N. staffers. A U.N. statement said the 'extraordinary' decision to pause all operations and programs in Saada was due to the lack of necessary security conditions and guarantees. It called for the Houthis to release all detained U.N. staff. The rebels have detained dozens of U.N. staffers, as well as people associated with aid groups, civil society and the once-open U.S. Embassy in Sanaa, Yemen's capital. None of the U.N. staffers has been released. The U.N. decision will affect the global response to one of the world's worst humanitarian disasters. Seven U.N. agencies operate in Saada, including the WFP, the World Health Organization and UNICEF, along with several international aid organizations, according to the U.N. humanitarian agency. Yemen's civil war began in 2014, when Yemen's Iran-backed Houthi rebels took control of the capital, Sanaa, and much of the country's north, forcing the government to flee to the south, then to Saudi Arabia. A Saudi-led coalition entered the war in March 2015, backed at the time by the U.S., in an effort to restore the internationally recognized government to power. The war has killed more than 150,000 people including civilians and combatants, and in recent years deteriorated largely into a stalemate and caused one of the world's worst humanitarian crises. The U.N. had projected that over 19 million people across Yemen will need humanitarian assistance this year as many deal with climate shocks, malnutrition, cholera and the economic effects of war.	https://www.voanews.com/a/un-announces-death-in-yemeni-prison-of-aid-worker-detained-by-houthis/7970653.html	2025-02-11T05:55:51-08:00	
Vance tells Europeans that heavy regulation could kill AI	Paris — U.S. Vice President JD Vance told Europeans on Tuesday their 'massive' regulations on artificial intelligence could strangle the technology, and rejected content moderation as 'authoritarian censorship.' The mood on AI has shifted as the technology takes root, from one of concerns around safety to geopolitical competition, as countries jockey to nurture the next big AI giant. Vance, setting out the Trump administration's America First agenda, said the United States intended to remain the dominant force in AI and strongly opposed the European Union's far tougher regulatory approach. 'We believe that excessive regulation of the AI sector could kill a transformative industry,' Vance told an AI summit of CEOs and heads of state in Paris. 'We feel very strongly that AI must remain free from ideological bias and that American AI will not be co-opted into a tool for authoritarian censorship,' he added. Vance criticized the 'massive regulations' created by the EU's Digital Services Act, as well as Europe's online privacy rules, known by the acronym GDPR, which he said meant endless legal compliance costs for smaller firms. 'Of course, we want to ensure the internet is a safe place, but it is one thing to prevent a predator from preying on a child on the internet, and it is something quite different to prevent a grown man or woman from accessing an opinion that the government thinks is misinformation,' he said. European lawmakers last year approved the bloc's AI Act, the world's first comprehensive set of rules governing the technology. Vance is leading the American delegation at the Paris summit. Vance also appeared to take aim at China at a delicate moment for the U.S. technology sector. Last month, Chinese startup DeepSeek freely distributed a powerful AI reasoning model that some said challenged U.S. technology leadership. It sent shares of American chip designer Nvidia down 17%. 'From CCTV to 5G equipment, we're all familiar with cheap tech in the marketplace that's been heavily subsidized and exported by authoritarian regimes,' Vance said. But he said that 'partnering with them means chaining your nation to an authoritarian master that seeks to infiltrate, dig in and seize your information infrastructure. Should a deal seem too good to be true? Just remember the old adage that we learned in Silicon Valley: if you aren't paying for the product, you are the product.' Vance did not mention DeepSeek by name. There has been no evidence of information being able to surreptitiously flow through the startup's technology to China’s government, and the underlying code is freely available to use and view. However, some government organizations have reportedly banned DeepSeek’s use. Speaking after Vance, French President Emmanuel Macron said that he was fully in favor of trimming red tape, but he stressed that regulation was still needed to ensure trust in AI, or people would end up rejecting it. 'We need a trustworthy AI,' he said. European Commission chief Ursula von der Leyen also said the EU would cut red tape and invest more in AI. In a bilateral meeting, Vance and von der Leyen were also likely to discuss Trump's substantial increase of tariffs on steel. OpenAI CEO Sam Altman was expected to address the summit on Tuesday. A consortium led by Musk said on Monday it had offered $97.4 billion to buy the nonprofit controlling OpenAI. Altman promptly posted on X: 'no thank you but we will buy twitter for $9.74 billion if you want.' The technology world has closely watched whether the Trump administration will ease recent antitrust enforcement that had seen the U.S. sue or investigate the industry's biggest players. Vance said the U.S. would champion American AI -- which big players develop -- he also said: 'Our laws will keep Big Tech, little tech, and all other developers on a level playing field.'	https://www.voanews.com/a/vance-tells-europeans-that-heavy-regulation-could-kill-ai-/7970615.html	2025-02-11T05:24:13-08:00	
Man recalls burying infants who starved in Sudan's Darfur camp	The U.N. has declared famine conditions in at least five areas of Sudan where it says people are dying daily from starvation and related illnesses. One of those areas includes the besieged Zamzam displacement camp in North Darfur.

Modi to meet Trump with focus on trade, immigration and strategic ties	New Delhi — As Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi heads to the United States for a two-day visit starting Wednesday, officials in New Delhi expressed optimism that the visit will herald a renewed and substantive partnership. However analysts said there will be contentious issues to navigate on trade and immigration, which are among U.S. President Donald Trump’s top priorities. Underlining that Modi will be meeting Trump within weeks of his taking office, Indian foreign secretary Vikram Misri said India-U.S. ties are solid and that 'this has been one of our strongest international partnerships.' Modi will reach Washington after visiting France, where he is attending a global conference on artificial intelligence. Trade is important for both countries and India has taken steps to demonstrate that it is ready to address concerns of Trump, who has named India among countries that are 'very big tariff abusers.' In a phone conversation with Modi last month, Trump called for moving toward a fair bilateral trading relationship. His top economic adviser, Kevin Hassett, repeated such concerns on Monday. 'India has enormously high' tariffs that lock out imports, he said in an interview with CNBC. New Delhi, which wants to avoid trade tensions with the U.S., announced earlier this month that it will lower import duties on some items that will benefit American exports such as high-end motorcycles and cars. It also may offer other concessions that could help American goods gain market access to India and boost energy imports from the U.S., say analysts. 'New Delhi thought it would take a first step and try to resolve differences on trade. But, certainly, as a great negotiator and bargainer, he [Trump] will ask for more,' said Chintamani Mahapatra, founder of the Kalinga School of Indo Pacific Studies. 'India also bargains very well. So, somehow, we will try to make a compromise that will benefit both.' For India, the stakes are high — the U.S. is its largest trading partner. Bilateral trade between the two countries was $118 billion, with a surplus of about $32 billion in India’s favor in 2023. India has not been impacted so far by Trump’s tariff impositions — the latest 25 percent tariffs he imposed on steel and aluminum imports will have merely a marginal impact on India, as New Delhi is a small exporter of steel to the U.S., according to Indian officials. Strengthening security and defense ties with the U.S., Indian officials say will also be discussed in Washington. According to analysts that could include potential purchases of weapon systems and technology. In the recent phone conversation with Modi, President Trump had called on Modi to increase procurement of American-made security equipment. India, the world’s largest spender on military equipment, needs a range of weapons systems to modernize its military. As it diversifies its purchases from its traditional weapons supplier, Russia, India has been purchasing more arms from countries like France, Israel and the United States. 'The U.S. is a little concerned that it is losing out on the India [security] buys, so it has stepped up pressure to sell India a lot more defense equipment than India has bought in the last few years,' according to Rahul Bedi, defense analyst in New Delhi. 'There is likely to be initiatives on transport aircraft, surveillance aircraft for the navy, and possibly even fighter aircraft, as well as a lot of technology transfers for aircraft engines, infantry combat vehicles.' Immigration is another issue of concern to both countries. Although India has cooperated with the U.S. and said it is ready to take back undocumented migrants, reports of 104 undocumented Indians being shackled for 40 hours while being brought back to India on a military plane last week from the U.S. led to an uproar and protests by opposition parties. Indian officials have said that New Delhi will call for better treatment during future deportations. At the same time, India’s top priority during discussions will be to protect legal channels of immigration for skilled Indian workers and students heading to American universities. Indians are the largest beneficiaries of H1B visas, which allow U.S. employers to hire foreign professionals in specialized fields, such as technology. 'People-to-people relationships constitute the bedrock of our deepening ties with the United States,' Indian foreign minister, Subrahmanyam Jaishankar told lawmakers, while responding to concerns about the transport and treatment of the deportees. In a statement before leaving New Delhi, Modi called his upcoming meeting with Trump an opportunity to build upon the successes of their collaboration in Trump’s first term. Mutual concerns about an assertive China are likely to keep the two countries aligned, according to analysts. Along with the U.S., Australia and Japan, India is a partner in the Quad, a strategic security grouping focused on the Indo-Pacific. Analysts point out that the two countries have convergence on geostrategic issues. 'It was president Trump in his first term, who dusted off the Quad, which was in a dormant state for about ten years, and he was solely responsible for reviving it,' said Mahapatra. 'This is an area where both the countries have a lot of things in common for maintaining peace, stability and contributing to the growth story in the Indo-Pacific region.'	https://www.voanews.com/a/modi-to-meet-trump-with-focus-on-trade-immigration-and-strategic-ties-/7970558.html	2025-02-11T04:38:24-08:00	
Russia, Ukraine strike energy infrastructure	Russia and Ukraine attacked each other’s energy infrastructure overnight, just days before U.S. and Ukrainian officials were set to discuss steps toward ending the nearly three-year war sparked by Russia’s 2022 invasion. Russian strikes damaged natural gas production facilities in Ukraine’s Poltava region overnight, using a combined attack of 19 cruise, ballistic and guided missiles, the Ukrainian air force said. As a result of the attack, Ukraine imposed emergency power restrictions on Tuesday, according to Ukraine energy minister German Galushchenko. 'The enemy launched an attack on gas infrastructure overnight,' Galushchenko said in a post on social media. 'As of this morning, the energy sector continues to be under attack.' Russia, which previously focused its missile and drone attacks on the Ukrainian electricity sector, recently stepped-up attacks on gas storage and production facilities, Reuters reported. The Ukrainian military said on Tuesday that it had struck an oil refinery in Russia's Saratov region overnight, causing a fire. It said the refinery produces more than 20 types of petroleum products and is involved in supplying the Russian forces. Saratov regional Governor Roman Busargin posted on the Telegram messaging app that a fire at an industrial facility in the region had been extinguished. He did not name the facility. Russia's defense ministry said air defense units intercepted and destroyed 40 Ukrainian drones over Russian territory. Eighteen of the drones were destroyed over the Saratov region, the ministry said in a post on the Telegram messaging app. The rest were downed over four other regions in Russia's south and west, it said. The Russian military also said its forces had taken control of the settlement of Yasenove in eastern Ukraine. Talks between US and Ukraine As U.S. Vice President JD Vance prepares for a meeting with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky later this week, President Donald Trump suggested that Ukraine 'may be Russian someday.' Trump talked about the war in a Fox News interview that aired Monday. 'They may make a deal, they may not make a deal. They may be Russian someday, or they may not be Russian someday,' he said. Trump also discussed trading Ukraine’s natural resources, such as rare minerals, in exchange for U.S. military support. 'We are going to have all this money in there, and I say I want it back. And I told them that I want the equivalent, like $500 billion worth of rare earth,' Trump said. 'And they have essentially agreed to do that, so at least we don't feel stupid.' Trump’s senior advisers are expected to meet with Zelenskyy this week on the sidelines of the Munich Security Conference. Vance and Secretary of State Marco Rubio and Retired Lt. Gen. Keith Kellogg are traveling to Germany for the summit. 'Knowing how the process works, it would probably be better for Zelenskyy if we all met together and talked through it as a group,' Kellogg said in an interview with the Associated Press. Trump on Monday said he'd 'probably' speak with Zelenskyy this week. Information from the Associated Press, Reuters and Agence France-Presse was used in this report.	https://www.voanews.com/a/russia-ukraine-strike-energy-infrastructure-/7970514.html	2025-02-11T03:41:04-08:00	
Hamas: Ceasefire is only way to bring back hostages	After U.S. President Donald Trump suggested canceling the ceasefire agreement between Israel and Hamas if all hostages were not returned by Saturday, a Hamas official warned that the only way to bring the captives home was to respect the terms of the agreement. Trump made his remarks Monday after Hamas accused Israel of violating the ceasefire and threatened to delay the release of hostages. 'As far as I'm concerned, if all of the hostages aren't returned by Saturday 12 o'clock — I think it's an appropriate time — I would say cancel it and all bets are off and let hell break out,' Trump told reporters at the White House. On Tuesday, senior Hamas official Sami Abu Zuhri told Reuters and Agence France-Presse that the U.S. president’s remarks complicate the fragile truce. 'Trump must remember that there is an agreement that must be respected by both parties, and this is the only way to bring back the prisoners,' he said. 'The language of threats has no value and only complicates matters.' Hamas said Monday no more hostages would be released until further notice. The group — which is listed as a terrorist organization by the United States and several other countries — accused Israel of delaying the return of displaced Palestinians to northern Gaza, although hundreds of thousands have returned. Hamas also said Palestinians were targeted 'with airstrikes and gunfire across various areas' and said Israel has failed 'to facilitate the entry of humanitarian aid as agreed.' A United Nations official said 12,600 humanitarian aid trucks have entered Gaza since the ceasefire began and the immediate threat of famine has dissipated. Israeli Defense Minister Israel Katz said any delay by Hamas would be 'a complete violation' of the ceasefire agreement. He placed the Israeli military on the highest level of alert. Since the ceasefire took effect last month, Hamas has freed 21 hostages and Israel has released more than 730 prisoners. The next exchange was set for Saturday, with three more Israelis set to be freed in exchange for hundreds of Palestinian prisoners jailed by Israel. Plan for Gaza Trump has proposed moving Palestinians living in Gaza to an unspecified location outside the territory. Under his plan, the United States would take over Gaza and Palestinians would have no right to return. In an interview with Fox News released Monday, he called his plan for the narrow territory along the shores of the Mediterranean Sea a 'real estate development for the future.' 'I would own it,' he said, adding that the 2.3 million Palestinians now living in war-ravaged Gaza would be moved to as many as six different sites outside Gaza under a plan that the Arab world, as well as U.S. allies and adversaries alike, have rejected. Trump was scheduled to meet with Jordan's King Abdullah on Tuesday. 'I do think he'll take' refugees, Trump said Monday of the king. Asked if he would withhold aid from Jordan and Egypt if they declined to do so, Trump said: 'Yeah, maybe, sure, why not... if they don't agree, I would conceivably withhold aid.' King Abdullah has said he rejected any moves to annex land and displace Palestinians. He is expected to tell Trump such a move could spur radicalism, spread chaos in the region, jeopardize peace with Israel and threaten the country's very survival. Meanwhile, Egyptian Foreign Minister Badr Abdelatty told U.S. Secretary of State Marco Rubio on Monday that Arab states rejected the plan to displace Palestinians and take control of the enclave. Egypt's foreign ministry said Abdelatty stressed the importance of rebuilding Gaza while Palestinians remained there. After the meeting, the U.S. State Department issued a statement that did not explicitly mention Trump's plan but added that Rubio 'reiterated the importance of close cooperation to advance post-conflict planning for the governance and security of Gaza and stressed Hamas can never govern Gaza or threaten Israel again.' Terms of the ceasefire During the first six-week phase of the ceasefire, Hamas is gradually releasing 33 Israeli hostages captured during its Oct. 7, 2023, attack on Israel, in exchange for a pause in fighting, freedom for hundreds of Palestinian prisoners and a flood of humanitarian aid into Gaza. The deal also stipulated that Israeli troops would pull back from populated areas of Gaza as well as the Netzarim corridor. On Sunday, Israeli troops withdrew from the Netzarim corridor, a narrow strip of land that bisects the territory. It allowed more Palestinians to return to the northern sector where they once lived, but much of the land has been leveled by fighting. In the second phase, all remaining living hostages would be released in return for a complete Israeli withdrawal from Gaza and a 'sustainable calm.' But details are unclear and yet to be negotiated. The war in Gaza was triggered by the shock October 2023 Hamas terror attack on Israel that killed 1,200 people and led to the capture of 250 hostages. Israel’s counteroffensive killed more than 47,000 Palestinians, more than half of them women and children, according to local health authorities. Israel says the death toll includes 17,000 militants it has killed. Some information for this report came from The Associated Press, Agence France-Presse and Reuters.	https://www.voanews.com/a/hamas-ceasefire-is-only-way-to-bring-back-hostages-/7970496.html	2025-02-11T03:21:39-08:00	
EU's AI push to get $50 billion boost, EU's von der Leyen says	PARIS — Europe will invest an additional $51.5 billion to bolster the bloc's artificial intelligence ambition, European Commission Ursula von der Leyen said on Tuesday. It will come on top of the European AI Champions Initiative, that has already pledged 150 billion euros from providers, investors and industry, von der Leyen told the Paris AI Summit. 'Thereby we aim to mobilize a total of 200 billion euros for AI investments in Europe,' she said. Von der Leyen said investments will focus on industrial and mission-critical technologies. Companies which have signed up to the European AI Champions initiative, spearheaded by investment company General Catalyst, include Airbus, ASML, Siemens, Infineon, Philips, Mistral and Volkswagen.	https://www.voanews.com/a/eu-s-ai-push-to-get-50-billion-boost-eu-s-von-der-leyen-says/7970482.html	2025-02-11T02:52:16-08:00	
Five killed in suicide bomb blast in northeastern Afghanistan, police say	At least five people were killed when a suicide bomber with explosives strapped to his body detonated outside a bank in northeastern Afghanistan on Tuesday, police said. The blast took place at 8:35 a.m. near the Kabul Bank branch in Kunduz province, killing the bank's security guard and four others including civilians and members of Afghanistan's ruling Taliban movement, police said. Seven people were wounded, provincial police spokesman Jumma Uddin Khakasr added. He did not say who was believed to be behind the attack and no group has claimed responsibility so far. Militants from the Afghan chapters of Islamic State have waged an insurgency against the Taliban since they returned to power in 2021. Taliban authorities say they have mostly crushed the group, even as it continues to carry out attacks in Afghanistan.	https://www.voanews.com/a/five-killed-in-suicide-bomb-blast-in-northeastern-afghanistan-police-say/7970453.html	2025-02-11T01:51:53-08:00	
Virginia governor declares storm emergency as snow and ice bear down on mid-Atlantic states	A wintry mess was bearing down on mid-Atlantic states Tuesday with forecasts of significant snow and ice accumulations prompting warnings of potential power outages. The National Weather Service said travel would become treacherous Tuesday through early Wednesday in much of Virginia and West Virginia. Virginia Republican Gov. Glenn Youngkin on Monday declared a state of emergency ahead of the storm, allowing state agencies to assist local governments. Schools and government offices throughout Virginia were set to be closed Tuesday. The heaviest snow, up to 25.4 centimeters, was forecast in portions of northern and central Virginia and eastern West Virginia. Ice accumulations could range from a glaze in Kentucky and West Virginia to 1.3 centimeters in the Roanoke Valley of southwest Virginia, the weather service said. Power outages and tree damage were likely in places with heavy ice buildups. 'Did you think winter was over? Think again!' the weather service's office in Blacksburg, Virginia, said in a post on the social media platform X. Appalachian Power, which serves 1 million customers in West Virginia, Virginia and Tennessee, said it has requested 700 additional workers from neighboring utilities to assist with problems by Tuesday morning. In northern Virginia, the National Park Service closed a portion of the George Washington Memorial Parkway, a narrow highway that winds its way through woods along the Potomac River. The parkway connects multiple small national park sites and has historically been a trouble spot during winter storms for abandoned cars that created a slalom course for snowplows and other vehicles. Winter storm warnings extended from Kentucky to southern New Jersey, and a flood watch was posted for a wide swath of Kentucky, Tennessee, southwest Virginia and northern Georgia. The snow-and-ice mix was expected to become all rain as temperatures climb by Wednesday afternoon. A separate storm system is set to bring heavy snow from Kansas and Missouri to the Great Lakes on Wednesday, the weather service said. Dangerous cold was forecast Tuesday from an Arctic air mass stretching from Portland, Oregon, to the Great Lakes. The temperature was expected to bottom out Tuesday morning at minus 36 degrees Celsius in Butte, Montana, where over the past two winters at least five people died due to cold exposure, said Brayton Erickson, executive director of the Butte Rescue Mission. Advocates for the homeless in the city of about 35,000 planned to be out on the streets distributing sleeping bags, jackets, mittens and other cold weather gear to anyone who needs them, Erickson said. 'When it gets this cold, we kind of pull out all the stops,' he said. 'Having all those resources available literally can save their life or keep them from frostbite.'	https://www.voanews.com/a/virginia-governor-declares-storm-emergency-as-snow-and-ice-bear-down-on-mid-atlantic-states/7970427.html	2025-02-11T00:16:20-08:00	
Singapore detains student accused of embracing far-right extremism	SINGAPORE — An 18-year-old Singapore student who was radicalized by violent far-right extremism online and who idolized the gunman behind deadly attacks on two mosques in New Zealand has been detained under the Internal Security Act, the government said. Nick Lee Xing Qiu, identified as an 'East Asian supremacist,' envisioned starting a 'race war' between Chinese and Malays in Singapore, the Internal Security Department (ISD) said in statement issued on Monday. 'At the point of his arrest, Lee's attack ideations were aspirational and he had no timeline to carry them out,' the ISD said, adding investigations into his online contacts had not revealed any imminent threats to Singapore. Lee has been detained since December under the ISA, which allows suspects to be held for up to two years without trial. The ISD said Lee found Islamophobic and far-right extremist content on social media in 2023, and then began actively searching for such content. It said he idolized the gunman who killed 51 people in two mosques in Christchurch in 2019, role-playing as him in an online simulation. 'Lee aspired to carry out attacks against Muslims in Singapore with like-minded, far-right individuals that he conversed with online,' the ISD said. Lee is the third Singaporean youth with far-right extremist ideologies to be dealt with under the ISA, the department said, noting far-right extremism was a growing concern globally. 'Youths may be more susceptible to such ideologies and may gravitate toward the sense of belonging and identity that far-right movements appear to provide,' the ISD said.	https://www.voanews.com/a/singapore-detains-student-accused-of-embracing-far-right-extremism/7970405.html	2025-02-10T23:05:07-08:00	
Indonesia general to head state food procurement company, sparking concerns	JAKARTA, Indonesia — Indonesia's appointment of an army general to run the national food procurement company has raised concerns about the expansion of military roles under President Prabowo Subianto, with a rights activist saying it also violated military laws. Major General Novi Helmy Prasetya was named chief executive of Bulog, a powerful state logistics company in charge of government-controlled imports of rice and other important food staples, on the weekend, becoming the first active duty general in the role since the authoritarian regime of General Suharto. Under military laws, soldiers are allowed to fill civilian posts only at state institutions in sectors such as defense, security, intelligence and disaster response. They are also not allowed to be involved in politics and business. 'This is a threat to democracy and a violation towards the law,' said Ardi Manto Adiputra, director of Indonesian rights group Imparsial, late on Monday. The armed forces are subject to the military justice system, which is separate from the civilian criminal code, raising issues of oversight and transparency at any government institution run by active duty officers, Adiputra said. State-Owned Enterprises Minister Erick Thohir said the appointment was a strategic move towards achieving a goal of food self-sufficiency, according to state news agency Antara. The SOE ministry and the presidential communication office did not respond to Reuters' request for comment. The military law does not stipulate penalties for such a breach. However, the appointment can be appealed through a petition to the administrative court. It follows other military appointments in civic works since Prabowo took office in October, a trend that has caused unease among some people as it raises comparisons to Suharto's military-backed regime when the armed forces dominated public life. Prabowo was a military commander under Suharto, his former father-in-law. Suharto was overthrown in 1998. Sana Jaffrey, a research fellow at the Australian National University, noted Prabowo had appointed other active duty officers, such as his cabinet secretary and senior officials at the ministries of agriculture and transportation, which she said showed he trusted the military to help him meet his goals. 'But he's not willing to consider the long-term political consequences of placing active military officers in civilian roles, whether this is at odds with the law or what sort of institutional damage this might cause,' she said.	https://www.voanews.com/a/indonesia-general-to-head-state-food-procurement-company-sparking-concerns-/7970402.html	2025-02-10T22:52:57-08:00	
Private jets collide at Scottsdale Airport in Arizona, killing 1 person, authorities say	SCOTTSDALE, Ariz. — One person was killed and others were injured when a private jet owned by Mötley Crüe singer Vince Neil collided with another jet Monday afternoon at the Scottsdale Airport in Arizona, authorities said. Neil's jet was landing at the airport when it veered off the runway and collided with another parked plane, Neil's representative Worrick Robinson, IV, said in a statement. There were two pilots and two passengers on Neil’s plane, but he was not among them. 'Mr. Neil’s thoughts and prayers go out to everyone involved, and he is grateful for the critical aid of all first responders assisting today,' Robinson said. The arriving jet veered off the runway and collided with the Gulfstream 200 jet that was parked, according to Kelli Kuester, aviation planning and outreach coordinator at the Scottsdale Airport. It appeared that the primary landing gear of the arriving jet failed, resulting in the collision, she said. Kuester said four people were on the arriving jet, which had come from Austin, Texas, and one person was in the parked plane. Two people injured in the collision were taken to trauma centers and one was in stable condition at a hospital, Scottsdale Fire Department Capt. Dave Folio said. He said they were working to recover the body of the person killed in the collision. 'Our thoughts and prayers go out to everybody involved in this,' Folio said. The runway has been closed and will remain closed 'for the foreseeable future,' Kuester said. Scottsdale Mayor Lisa Borowsky said in a statement that she is closely monitoring the situation and is in touch with the airport, police and federal agencies. 'On behalf of the city of Scottsdale, we offer our deepest condolences to those involved in the accident and for those who have been taken to our trauma center for treatment,' she said. 'We will keep all affected by this tragedy in our prayers.' The airport is a popular hub for jets coming in and out of the Phoenix area, especially during big sports weekends like the Waste Management Phoenix Open golf tournament, which attracts huge crowds just a few miles away. The Scottsdale collision comes after three major U.S. aviation disasters in the past two weeks. A commercial jetliner and an Army helicopter collided near the nation’s capital on Jan. 29, killing 67 people. A medical transportation plane crashed in Philadelphia on Jan. 31, killing the six people on board and another person on the ground. And last week a small commuter plane crashed in western Alaska on its way to the hub community of Nome, killing all 10 people on board.	https://www.voanews.com/a/private-jets-collide-at-scottsdale-airport-in-arizona-killing-1-person-authorities-say/7970380.html	2025-02-10T21:40:03-08:00

Back to plastic: Trump announces US policy ‘to end the use of paper straws’	President Donald Trump issued an executive order Monday declaring that it is 'the policy of the United States to end the use of paper straws.' Former President Joe Biden’s administration, in an attempt to phase out federal purchases of single-use plastics, announced a plan in July 2024 to replace plastics with reusable, compostable and highly recyclable products. Trump’s order Monday stated that paper straws 'are nonfunctional, use chemicals that may carry risks to human health, are more expensive to produce than plastic straws, and often force users to use multiple straws.' He also noted that paper straws are often individually wrapped in plastic, which undermines the environmental argument for their use. 'It’s a ridiculous situation. We’re going back to plastic straws,' Trump said Monday as he signed the order. The Biden policy aimed to get plastic straws and other single-use plastics out of federal food service operations, events and packaging by 2027, and from all federal operations by 2035. Trump declared President Joe Biden’s policy 'DEAD!' in a social media post over the weekend. In his Monday order, he instructed agency officials to stop buying paper straws and make sure paper straws are no longer provided within agency buildings. He also directed officials to create a national strategy to end the use of paper straws within 45 days. Information from The Associated Press was used in this report.	https://www.voanews.com/a/back-to-plastic-trump-announces-us-policy-to-end-the-use-of-paper-straws-/7970362.html	2025-02-10T20:01:41-08:00	
US senior advisers to talk with Zelenskyy on Munich sidelines	Senior advisers in the administration of U.S. President Donald Trump are preparing to meet with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy on the sidelines of the Munich Security Conference, according to an Associated Press interview with retired Lieutenant General Keith Kellogg. Kellogg, a special envoy to Ukraine and Russia, said planning continues for talks with Zelenskyy at the annual conference. Vice President JD Vance, Secretary of State Marco Rubio and Kellogg are among those who could participate in the sideline conversations with Ukraine’s president, AP reported. Trump has been critical about how much the war is costing the U.S. and has said European countries should repay the U.S. for helping Ukraine. During his campaign, Trump said if he were elected president, he would bring a swift end to the war between Russia and Ukraine, but he did not specify how he would accomplish that. Recently, he has said that he wants to make a deal with Ukraine to continue U.S. support in exchange for access to Ukraine’s rare earth minerals. On Monday, AP reported the president said there are people currently working on a money-for-minerals-deal with Ukraine. 'We have people over there today who are making a deal that, as we give money, we get minerals and we get oil and we get all sorts of things,' Trump said. Kellogg told AP that 'the economics of that would allow for further support to the Ukrainians.' Meanwhile, Russian drone attacks caused a fire in Kyiv, injured a woman in Sumy and damaged several homes, according to Ukrainian officials. The Russian military reported downing 15 Ukrainian drones overnight, including seven in the Krasnodar region. Nobody was hurt as a result of the fire in Kyiv, which was sparked in a non-residential building, Mayor Vitali Klitschko said in a post on the Telegram messaging app. Five houses were damaged and a woman was reportedly injured in the northeastern city of Sumy, regional governor Ihor Kalchenko said on Telegram.

Trump imposes 25% tariffs on steel, aluminum imports	White House — President Donald Trump on Monday fired another volley in his ongoing trade war, announcing 25% tariffs on steel and aluminum imports and canceling exemptions and duty-free quotas for major suppliers. 'It’s a big deal,' Trump said, the thick black marker in his right hand hovering over the executive order. 'This is the beginning of making America rich again,' he said, dragging his distinctive jagged signature over the paper. Billionaire financier Howard Lutnick, Trump’s nominee to lead the Commerce Department, watched from over Trump’s left shoulder in the Oval Office. Trump's trade adviser said this move will help domestic producers and support U.S. economic and national security. Lutnick spoke of the 120,000 jobs this could bring back. 'You are the president who is standing up for the American steelworker, and I am just tremendously impressed and delighted to stand next to you,' Lutnick said. The nuts and bolts Trump’s proclamations raised the rate on aluminum imports to 25% from the previous 10% that he imposed in 2018 to aid the struggling sector. And he restored a 25% tariff on millions of tons of steel and aluminum imports. Trump’s actions also will impose a new North American standard requiring steel imports to be 'melted and poured' and aluminum to be 'smelted and cast' in the region to curb imports of minimally processed Chinese steel. The order also targets downstream steel products that use imported steel for tariffs. Trump's trade adviser, Peter Navarro, said the measures would help U.S. steel and aluminum producers and shore up America's economic and national security. 'The steel and aluminum tariffs 2.0 will put an end to foreign dumping, boost domestic production and secure our steel and aluminum industries as the backbone and pillar industries of America's economic and national security,' he told reporters. 'This isn't just about trade. It's about ensuring that America never has to rely on foreign nations for critical industries like steel and aluminum,' Navarro said. What now? Trump first broached the steel and aluminum action Sunday — and the move drew instant pushback in what is unfolding as a tit-for-tat exchange. Earlier Monday, Beijing enacted additional tariffs on U.S. goods as a countermeasure to Trump’s earlier 10% hike on Chinese goods. 'There are no winners in trade wars and tariff wars,' said Guo Jiakun, a spokesperson for China’s Ministry of Foreign Affairs. 'They harm the interests of the people of both countries. What is needed now is not unilateral tariff increases but equal dialogue and consultation based on mutual respect. We urge the U.S. to correct its wrong practices and stop politicizing and instrumentalizing economic and trade issues.' Most economists believe tariffs raise consumer prices. Scholars of supply chains and logistics say Trump’s move also raises major global policy questions. 'It's not clear whether this is a negotiating strategy, whether this is going to be permanent,' said Professor Sunderesh Heragu of Oklahoma State University. 'Is this only restricted to Canada, Mexico and China as it is now, or is it going to expand to the European Union, for example, or even the BRICS countries, of which, you know, Brazil, Russia, India, China, South Africa and 12 or 14 other countries, are part of?' He said these concerns may prompt countries to realign their trade relationships, which will likely alarm producers. 'It clearly causes a lot of confusion, and you know, businesses, again, hate uncertainty,' Heragu said. 'So, they're going to put everything on pause. That means, you know, there could be a decrease in production activity, while at the same time, the tariffs could have inflationary effects.' Some in the automotive industry in Detroit, the U.S.’ 'Motor City,' echoed that concern. 'Sudden tariffs to a system — there isn't a lot of good that comes out of that,' said Glenn Stevens Jr., executive director of MichAuto and vice president of automotive and mobility initiatives at the Detroit Regional Chamber. Studies attempting to understand the impact of these moves yield mixed pictures. The Washington, D.C.-based Tax Foundation estimates that the tariffs will generate around $100 billion each year in federal tax revenue. Another analysis shows they could 'impose significant costs on the broader economy: disrupting supply chains, raising costs for businesses, eliminating hundreds of thousands of jobs and ultimately driving up consumer prices.'

Hamas threatens to delay hostage release	Hamas officials accused Israel of violating a ceasefire agreement Monday and threatened to delay releasing more hostages, prompting U.S. President Donald Trump to say 'all hell is going to break out' if all the remaining hostages are not turned over by Saturday. The next exchange was set for Saturday, with three more Israelis set to be freed in exchange for hundreds of Palestinian prisoners jailed by Israel. A spokesperson for Hamas' armed wing, the al-Qassam Brigades, said in a statement the militants remain committed to the ceasefire terms 'as long as the occupation adheres to them.' Hamas accused Israel of delaying the return of displaced Palestinians to northern Gaza, although hundreds of thousands have returned. The group said Palestinians were targeted 'with airstrikes and gunfire across various areas' and Israel has failed 'to facilitate the entry of humanitarian aid as agreed.' However, a United Nations official said 12,600 humanitarian aid trucks have entered Gaza since the ceasefire began and the immediate threat of famine has dissipated. Israeli Defense Minister Israel Katz said any delay by Hamas would be 'a complete violation' of the ceasefire agreement. He placed the Israeli military on the highest level of alert. In Washington Monday, Trump said he would propose canceling the ceasefire agreement if all the remaining hostages being held in Gaza were not released by 12 o’clock Saturday, but he did not specify whether that was noon or midnight, and he did not indicate a time zone. He also said he might withhold aid to Jordan and Egypt if they don't take Palestinian refugees being relocated from Gaza. Since the ceasefire took effect last month, Hamas has freed 21 hostages while Israel has released more than 730 prisoners. Trump has proposed moving Palestinians living in Gaza to an unspecified location outside the territory. Under his plan for the enclave, they would have no right to return. In an interview with Fox News released Monday, he called his plan for the narrow territory along the shores of the Mediterranean Sea a 'real estate development for the future.' 'I would own it,' he said, adding that the 2.3 million Palestinians now living in war-ravaged Gaza would be moved to as many as six different sites outside Gaza under a plan that the Arab world, as well as U.S. allies and adversaries alike, have already rejected. Trump, a billionaire New York real estate magnate before entering politics in 2015, did not say where the Palestinians would be relocated. But when asked by Fox anchor Bret Baier if they would be allowed to return home to Gaza, Trump said, 'No, they wouldn't, because they're going to have much better housing.' 'In other words, I'm talking about building a permanent place for them because if they have to return now, it'll be years before you could ever — it's not habitable,' Trump said of Gaza, decimated by 15 months of fighting between Israel and Hamas. In the Fox interview, Trump said he would build 'beautiful communities' for the Palestinians. 'Could be five, six, could be two. But we'll build safe communities, a little bit away from where they are, where all of this danger is,' Trump said. On Sunday, Israeli troops withdrew from the Netzarim corridor, a narrow strip of land that bisects the territory. It allowed more Palestinians to return to the northern sector where they once lived, but much of the land has been leveled by fighting. Hamas spokesperson Abdel Latif Al-Qanoua said the withdrawal showed Hamas had 'forced the enemy to submit to our demands' and that it thwarted Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's 'Illusion of achieving total victory.' Israeli officials did not disclose how many soldiers withdrew or to where. Troops currently remain along Gaza's borders with Israel and Egypt and a full withdrawal is expected to be negotiated in a later stage of the initial 42-day ceasefire. During the first six-week phase of the ceasefire, Hamas is gradually releasing 33 Israeli hostages captured during its Oct. 7, 2023, attack on Israel in exchange for a pause in fighting, freedom for hundreds of Palestinian prisoners and a flood of humanitarian aid into Gaza. The deal also stipulated that Israeli troops would pull back from populated areas of Gaza as well as the Netzarim corridor. In the second phase, all remaining living hostages would be released in return for a complete Israeli withdrawal from Gaza and a 'sustainable calm.' But details are unclear and yet to be negotiated. The war in Gaza was triggered by the shock October 2023 Hamas terror attack on Israel that killed 1,200 people and led to the capture of 250 hostages. Israel’s counteroffensive killed more than 47,000 Palestinians, more than half of them women and children, according to local health authorities. Israel says the death toll includes 17,000 militants it has killed.

France seeks AI boom, urges EU investment in the sector	French President Emmanuel Macron wants Europe to become a leader in the artificial intelligence (AI) sector, he told a global summit of AI and political leaders in Paris Monday where he announced that France’s private sector has invested nearly $113 billion in French AI. Financial investment is key to achieving the goal of Europe as an AI hub, Macron said in his remarks delivered in English at the Grand Palais. He said the European bloc would also need to 'adopt the Notre Dame strategy,' a reference to the lightning swift rebuilding of France’s famed Notre Dame cathedral in five years after a devastating 2019 fire, the result of simplified regulations and adherence to timelines. 'We showed the rest of the of the world that when we commit to a clear timeline, we can deliver,' the French leader said. Henna Virkkunen, the European Union’s digital head, indicated that the EU is in agreement with simplifying regulations. The EU approved the AI Act last year, the world’s first extensive set of rules designed to regulate technology. European countries want to ensure that they have a stake in the tech race against an aggressive U.S. and other emerging challengers. European Commission chief Ursula von der Leyen is scheduled to address the EU’s ability to compete in the tech world Tuesday. Macron’s announcement that the French private sector will invest heavily in AI 'reassured' Clem Delangue, CEO of Hugging Face, a U.S. company with French co-founders that is a hub for open-source AI, that there will be 'ambitious' projects in France, according to Reuters. Sundar Pichai, Google’s head, told the gathering that the shift to AI will be 'the biggest of our lifetimes.' However, such a big shift also comes with problems for the AI community. France had wanted the summit to adopt a non-binding text that AI would be inclusive and sustainable. 'We have the chance to democratize access [to a new technology] from the start,' Pichai told the summit. Whether the U.S. will agree to that initiative is uncertain, considering the U.S. government’s recent moves to eliminate diversity, equity and inclusion (DEI) initiatives. U.S. Vice President JD Vance is attending the summit and expected to deliver a speech on Tuesday. Other politicians expected Tuesday at the plenary session are Chinese Vice Premier Zhan Guoqing and Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi. About 100 politicians are expected. There are also other considerations with a shift to AI. The World Trade Organization says its calculations indicate that a 'near universal adoption of AI ... could increase trade by up to 14 percentage points' from what it is now but cautions that global 'fragmentation' of regulations on AI technology and data flow could bring about the contraction of both trade and output. A somewhat frightening side effect of AI technology is that it can replace the need for humans in some sectors. International Labor Organization leader Gilbert Houngbo told the summit Monday that the jobs that AI can do, such as clerical work, are disproportionately held by women. According to current statistics, that development would likely widen the gender pay gap.	https://www.voanews.com/a/france-seeks-ai-boom-urges-eu-investment-in-the-sector-/7970306.html	2025-02-10T17:29:46-08:00	
Justice Dept directs prosecutors to drop charges against New York mayor	The Justice Department on Monday directed federal prosecutors in New York to drop corruption charges against New York Mayor Eric Adams, according to a memo from acting Deputy Attorney General Emil Bove. Bove, a political appointee of President Donald Trump, intervened in the case, saying the indictment of Adams interfered with his 2025 mayoral reelection campaign. A spokesperson for the U.S. Attorney's office in Manhattan, which brought the charges, declined to comment. Prosecutors have not yet indicated to the judge overseeing the case, U.S. District Judge Dale Ho in Manhattan, that they plan to drop the case, court records showed Monday evening. Adams was the subject of a five-count indictment charging him with accepting travel perks from Turkish officials and political donations from foreigners in exchange for taking actions to benefit Turkey. Adams pleaded not guilty.	https://www.voanews.com/a/justice-dept-directs-prosecutors-to-drop-charges-against-new-york-mayor/7970311.html	2025-02-10T17:28:24-08:00	
Musk-led group makes $97.4 billion bid for control of OpenAI	A consortium led by Elon Musk said Monday it has offered $97.4 billion to buy the nonprofit that controls OpenAI, another salvo in the billionaire's fight to block the artificial intelligence startup from transitioning to a for-profit firm. Musk's bid is likely to ratchet up longstanding tensions with OpenAI CEO Sam Altman over the future of the startup at the heart of a boom in generative AI technology. Altman on Monday promptly posted on X: 'no thank you but we will buy twitter for $9.74 billion if you want.' Musk cofounded OpenAI with Altman in 2015 as a nonprofit, but left before the company took off. He founded the competing AI startup xAI in 2023. Musk, the CEO of Tesla and owner of tech and social media company X, is a close ally of President Donald Trump. He spent more than a quarter of a billion dollars to help elect Trump, and leads the Department of Government Efficiency, a new arm of the White House tasked with radically shrinking the federal bureaucracy. Musk recently criticized a $500 billion OpenAI-led project announced by Trump at the White House. OpenAI is now trying to transition into a for-profit from a nonprofit entity, which it says is required to secure the capital needed for developing the best AI models. Musk sued Altman and others in August last year, claiming they violated contract provisions by putting profit ahead of the public good in the push to advance AI. In November, he asked a U.S. district judge for a preliminary injunction blocking OpenAI from converting to a for-profit structure. Musk's lawsuit against OpenAI and Altman says the founders originally approached him to fund a nonprofit focused on developing AI to benefit humanity, but that it was now focused on making money. 'It's time for OpenAI to return to the open-source, safety-focused force for good it once was,' Musk said in a statement Monday. 'We will make sure that happens.' Musk and OpenAI backer Microsoft did not immediately respond to requests for comment. 'Musk's bid puts another wrinkle into OpenAI's quest to remove the nonprofit's control over its for-profit entity,' said Rose Chan Loui, executive director of the UCLA Law Center for Philanthropy and Nonprofits. 'This bid sets a marker for the valuation of the nonprofit's economic interests,' she said. 'If OpenAI values the nonprofit's interests at less than what Musk is offering, then they would have to show why.' The consortium led by Musk includes his AI startup xAI, Baron Capital Group, Valor Management, Atreides Management, Vy Fund III, Emanuel Capital Management, and Eight Partners. XAI could merge with OpenAI following a deal, according to The Wall Street Journal which first reported Musk's offer earlier Monday. XAI recently raised $6 billion from investors at a valuation of $40 billion, sources have told Reuters. Throwing a wrench 'This (bid) is definitely throwing a wrench in things,' said Jonathan Macey, a Yale Law School professor specializing in corporate governance. 'The nonprofit is supposed to take money to do whatever good deeds, and if OpenAI prefers to sell it to somebody else for less money, it's a concern for protecting the interests of the beneficiaries of the not-for-profit. If this was a public company, plaintiffs' lawyers would justifiably be lining up down the block to sue that transaction.' OpenAI was valued at $157 billion in its last funding round, cementing its status as one of the most valuable private companies in the world. SoftBank Group is in talks to lead a funding round of up to $40 billion in OpenAI at a valuation of $300 billion, including the new funds, Reuters reported in January. Aside from any antitrust implications, a deal this size would need Musk and his consortium to raise enormous funds. 'Musk's offer to buy OpenAI’s nonprofit should significantly complicate OpenAI’s current fundraising and the process of converting into a for-profit corporation,' said Gil Luria, analyst at D.A. Davidson. 'The offer seems to be backed by more credible investors ... OpenAI may not be able to ignore it. It will be the fiduciary responsibility of OpenAI’s board to decide whether this is a better offer, which could call into question the offer from SoftBank.' Musk's stock in Tesla is valued at roughly $165 billion, according to LSEG data, but his leverage with banks is likely to be thin after his $44 billion buyout of the social media platform that was called Twitter in 2022.	https://www.voanews.com/a/musk-led-group-makes-97-4-billion-bid-for-control-of-openai/7970292.html	2025-02-10T17:01:16-08:00

Facing backlash over $500K salary, LA's wildfire recovery czar agrees to work for free	LOS ANGELES — Steve Soboroff, a longtime fixture in Los Angeles civic life who is now serving as chief recovery officer for the city’s wildfire comeback, won’t take a salary after facing backlash over plans to pay him $500,000. He would have been paid through charitable donations, not with taxpayer money. Soboroff had defended the proposed salary of half-a-million dollars for three months of work, saying his expertise as a residential property developer made him worth the price. But after criticisms mounted from elected officials and residents, Los Angeles Mayor Karen Bass reversed course over the weekend and said Soboroff would receive no compensation. Soboroff is the city’s former police commissioner. 'Steve is always there for LA. I spoke to him today and asked him to modify his agreement and work for free. He said yes. We agree that we don’t need anything distracting from the recovery work we’re doing,' Bass said in a statement Saturday. She had named him to the recovery czar position on Jan. 17. A message seeking comment was left for Soboroff on Monday. Soboroff, 76, raised his family in the Pacific Palisades area, where nearly 7,000 homes were destroyed by last month's inferno. His son, NBC News journalist Jacob Soboroff, reported from the devastated neighborhood where he grew up. He was initially tasked with leading the first phase of the city’s wildfire rebuilding effort. On Friday though, Bass suggested that the scope of his work could be diminished, saying he would focus primarily on rebuilding the Palisades’ historic business district. Soboroff disputed that notion, saying he is regularly interacting with federal agencies. In addition to developing thousands of homes over decades, Soboroff served on the city’s Board of Police Commissioners and on the city commission that oversees the Department of Recreation and Parks — both volunteer positions. Before the salary reversal, he told the Los Angeles Times that he put aside other real estate and environmental consulting work to take on the role of the city's recovery officer. 'I’ve been doing this for 35 years for free on some of the biggest civic projects for the city of Los Angeles. But nobody ever asked me to drop everything. This time they did,' Soboroff said. 'And I said OK, under the condition that my pay not be taken out of city money, or from any wildfire survivors who would otherwise benefit from that money.' It wasn't clear which charitable organizations would have covered his pay. Los Angeles City Councilmember Monica Rodriguez, who sits on the committee overseeing the recovery, called the proposed salary 'obscene.' Soboroff’s original salary was first reported by the Times.	https://www.voanews.com/a/facing-backlash-over-500k-salary-la-s-wildfire-recovery-czar-agrees-to-work-for-free-/7970272.html	2025-02-10T16:33:33-08:00	
What the Westminster show dogs' names mean	They have names that could make a random password generator cry uncle. Meet, for example, GCHG CH Calicops Sassafras Gonnakikurass. 'She’s a saucy girl. Her name says it all,' Fred Ortiz said as he groomed the Brussels griffon to compete Monday at the Westminster Kennel Club dog show. Her name says ... what exactly? Well, ponder the final part, and you may understand what her owners are wryly getting at. But in any event, you can just call her Wrassy. Westminster’s main competition began Monday with breed-by-breed judging that leads to U.S. dogdom's most illustrious best in show prize, awarded Tuesday night. The kennel club held agility and obedience contests Saturday, as well as other events. If show dogs are the aristocrats of the canine world, they often have the names, titles and nicknames to match. Their 'registered,' or formal, names are the ones used for showing. Those long, confounding-sounding appellations are packed with show-dog information. Clumps of capital letters at the beginning, and sometimes also the end, signify the dogs’ achievements in various sports. 'GCHG' and 'CH,' for example, denote various levels of championship in the traditional, breed-by-breed judging. After those titles, the first word in a registered name generally indicates the kennel, or breeding program, that produced the dog. Other kennels or dogs in the pedigree might get a shout-out at the end. Meanwhile, show dogs have 'call names' that they go by on a day-to-day basis. A dog might also have had a different 'puppy name' bestowed by its breeder and later changed by its eventual owner. The portmanteau words and puzzling phrases in registered names are partly meant to avoid duplication with other dogs in registries that go back over a century. But many breeders also use patterns to help them remember which litter was which. Professional dog handlers and sometime miniature schnauzer breeders Rachel Adams and Alberto Montila name their litters in alphabetical order — one litter had names that start with 'A,' the next with 'B,' and so on, Adams said Monday. She was blow-drying a French bulldog named GCHG CH Elysium’s Adventurous Rapscallion D’Assisi, better known as Finn. When Amie McLaughlin picks names for her litters of Norwegian buhunds, she just likes to have pun. 'I like the name to be something that someone looks at and says, ‘Oh, that’s cute,'' said McLaughlin, of Kent, Washington. A dog she bred and guided Monday, GCH CH Cloudpointe Nothing Betta Than This CGC, was born into a fish-themed litter (hence 'Betta,' a type of Southeast Asian fish). He goes by Eirik when he's at home with co-owner Sarah Woodworth in Paloa, Hawaii. GCH CH Aberdeen's Zoltar RN BN-V — just Zoltar, to his friends — has owners who appreciate humor, too. For one thing, they share their Los Angeles-area home with a shaggy, clownish, 120-pound otterhound who likes to cuddle. Comedian and actor Chris Hardwick, who owns the dog with his wife, model and actor Lydia Hearst, named Zoltar for the fortune-telling machine that makes a teenager grow to adult proportions overnight in the movie 'Big.' 'We knew he was going to grow,' and plenty big, explained Hearst. Zoltar got some recognition Monday from the judge, but the dog's cousin Melody, aka GCHS CH Dobhran’s Alexa Play Some Music, won best of breed. Hardwick and Hearst were also cheering on the French bulldog breed winner called Sassy, or GCHS Diva's Sassafras Lass. She and other breed winners were headed into a semifinal round Monday night. Sassy is owned and was co-bred by Hearst's mother, newspaper heir Patricia Hearst Shaw. Famous in the 1970s for her abduction and involvement in a robbery by a radical group, she's been renowned in recent years for her Frenchies and other show dogs. Colton Johnson and his family name their litters of old English sheepdogs by themes, such as songs, movies, money, or — appropriately — fluffy things. One of those 'fluff' dogs is GCH CH Bugaboo's Give Me S'more, who lolled on a table while Johnson brushed him Monday. 'It’s his spa day,' joked Johnson, of Colorado Springs, Colorado. The dog’s call name is Graham, as in the crackers that join toasted marshmallow and chocolate to make s’mores. The Johnsons considered calling him Marsh or Mallow, but those names didn't stick. Three-year-old Graham is a grandson of Swagger, the old English sheepdog whom Johnson handled to a second-place finish at Westminster in 2013. Last year's runner-up, a German shepherd named GCHP Kaleef's Mercedes, is back this year for a last hurrah and won her breed Monday. The 5-year-old will retire from showing after this event, co-owner Dr. Cynthian Wilhelmy said. As for her name, 'I wanted something German and something that represented excellence,' said Wilhelmy, of Martinsburg, West Virginia. 'Classic, reliable and excellent — that's Mercedes.'	https://www.voanews.com/a/what-the-westminster-show-dogs-names-mean-/7970021.html	2025-02-10T16:22:28-08:00	
Democrats look for ways to oppose Trump administration's changes while in the minority	Democratic lawmakers criticized what they called the Trump administration’s 'extreme' efforts to reshape the U.S. government, vowing to oppose those changes despite limited political capital in both chambers of the U.S. Congress. House Democratic leader Hakeem Jeffries said on the chamber’s floor Monday that Republicans were departing from their campaign pledge not to follow Project 2025, a conservative blueprint for reshaping the U.S. government. 'This year, Republicans have spent all of their time implementing the most extreme parts of Project 2025 and have done nothing to lower the high cost of living,' Jeffries said. Congressional Republicans say Trump is exercising broad presidential authority to reevaluate government agencies. Trump is accomplishing this through Elon Musk, a multibillionaire whom he put in charge of the Department of Government Efficiency, or DOGE, whose aim is to reduce federal spending. Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer wrote in a letter to colleagues that Democrats have a four-pronged strategy to oppose the Trump administration’s actions: oversight, litigation, legislation, and communication and mobilization. Schumer also said Democrats would continue to support litigation in the courts to stop the funding freeze and to prevent federal employees from being laid off. Vice President JD Vance criticized those judicial decisions, writing on X, 'If a judge tried to tell a general how to conduct a military operation, that would be illegal. If a judge tried to command the attorney general in how to use her discretion as a prosecutor, that's also illegal. Judges aren't allowed to control the executive's legitimate power.' Democratic Senator Chris Murphy responded on X Monday, 'For those of us who believe we are in the middle of a constitutional crisis, this is the meat of it. Trump and Vance are laying the groundwork to ignore the courts — democracy’s last line of defense against unchecked executive power.' Senate Democrats also announced a new whistleblowers portal for federal civil service employees and public servants to disclose information about wrongdoing. In a statement, they said, 'As Senate Republicans refuse to fulfill their constitutional duty to provide a check on the Executive Branch, Senate Democrats remain steadfast in our commitment to uncovering the truth. We are prepared to issue demand letters, preserve public records, conduct public hearings, and pursue legal action where necessary.' Schumer said Democrats would support legislation funding the U.S. government but called on Republicans to negotiate in a bipartisan fashion. A short-term resolution funding the U.S. government expires on March 14. Any bill funding the government past that date needs 60 votes in the U.S. Senate to pass. Republicans currently hold the majority in the chamber with 53 seats.	https://www.voanews.com/a/democrats-look-for-ways-to-oppose-trump-administration-s-changes-while-in-the-minority-/7970251.html	2025-02-10T16:20:35-08:00	
As tariffs take effect, Beijing and Washington look back to 2020 deal	New Chinese tariffs on a range of U.S. goods went into effect Monday, following U.S. President Donald Trump’s decision to impose a 10% tariff on Chinese products last week. Tariffs of 25% on steel and aluminum are next. Despite the tariffs and rising tensions, both sides seem reluctant to launch into a full-on trade war, analysts say. Beijing has its plate full battling its own internal economic struggles, and for now President Trump has deferred most of his promised tariffs on the world’s second-largest economy. Last week, The Wall Street Journal reported that Beijing is preparing to offer to return to a so-called 'Phase 1' trade deal that was signed during Trump’s first term. The Trump administration has sent its own signals as well. Trump has called for the Office of the United States Trade Representative to review the first phase of the U.S.-China trade agreement and determine whether Beijing has fulfilled its commitments in the contract. Last week, Jamieson Greer, Trump’s nominee for U.S. trade representative, said he would assess China's compliance with the first phase of the agreement quickly upon his appointment to ensure the implementation of the deal. Greer also said he would use it as a starting point in relations with China. What is the Phase 1 deal? On January 15, 2020, Trump and Chinese Vice Premier Liu He signed the Phase 1 agreement, which laid out several terms for trade between the world’s two biggest economies. The deal called on the United States to cut some of its imposed tariffs on China and included a commitment from Beijing to buy more U.S. products and implement certain reforms. The 96-page agreement, divided into eight sections, placed a big emphasis on reducing the U.S. trade deficit with China, and protecting domestic industries by cracking down on Chinese trade practices, such as nontariff trade barriers, intellectual property violations and the forced transfer of technology without adequate compensation. The agreement mandated that China purchase at least $200 billion in U.S. products and services over a two-year period from January 1, 2020, to December 31, 2021. It also required that Beijing stop subsidizing strategic sectors and give fairer treatment to American companies in terms of regulation. Despite those commitments from China, data from a report published in 2022 by the Peterson Institute for International Economics in Washington showed that Beijing did not reach its purchase target. The report also showed that Beijing has completed 57% of the spending laid out in the agreement, a total that is lower than the level of China's purchase of goods from the United States before the U.S.-China trade war. Although China was not expected to fully meet its commitments, the agreement did have some benefits for Washington, as it helped decrease Washington’s trade deficit with Beijing. Starting point Analysts say the agreement may be revisited as a starting point for new trade discussions. 'The two sides need to start somewhere. Phase 1 may at least provide some common language that both sides will be familiar with so as to get that ball rolling,' Chad Brown, senior fellow at the Peterson Institute for International Economics, explained to VOA in an emailed response Friday. Denny Roy, a senior fellow at the East-West Center in Hawaii, says the Phase 1 agreement has two advantages for acting as a foundation for U.S.-China trade discussions. 'First, the two sides reached a similar agreement before, so they know it’s feasible,' he told VOA in an emailed response on Friday. He also explained that using the agreement 'suits both sides’ interests.' 'Trump wants to claim he has resolved the bilateral trade imbalance, which he sees as his primary measure of success,' he explained, noting that this agreement supports that narrative. He added that the deal benefits Beijing by allowing China to avoid making significant structural reforms. Roy, however, adds that several factors make an agreement between Washington and Beijing difficult. 'A major bilateral economic deal would depend on avoiding a strategic crisis, which might occur over Taiwan or the South China Sea, or an encounter between U.S. and Chinese ships or aircraft that escalates, or something like the spy balloon incident,' he said. Early in 2023, the discovery of a Chinese spy balloon floating through U.S. airspace delayed a U.S. diplomatic visit to the country by then-Secretary of State Antony Blinken. The ballon was eventually shot down.	https://www.voanews.com/a/as-tariffs-take-effect-beijing-and-washington-look-back-to-2020-deal/7970267.html	2025-02-10T16:18:28-08:00	
Ukrainian women fill coal miners' jobs left open by drafted men	Many of Ukraine’s men have been drafted, leaving Ukrainian women to work in the country’s vast coal mines. Lesia Bakalets went to a mine on the front line in the Dnipropetrovsk region and heard from some of those women. The precise location of the mine and the full names of the miners have not been disclosed because of security concerns.

Arizona adds endangered bat to list of night-flying creatures that frequent the state	FLAGSTAFF, ARIZONA — Scientists have long suspected that Mexican long-nosed bats migrate through southeastern Arizona, but without capturing and measuring the night-flying creatures, proof has been elusive. Researchers say they now have a way to tell the endangered species apart from other bats by analyzing saliva the nocturnal mammals leave behind when sipping nectar from plants and residential hummingbird feeders. Bat Conservation International, a nonprofit group working to end the extinction of bat species worldwide, teamed up with residents from southeastern Arizona, southwestern New Mexico and west Texas for the saliva-swabbing campaign. The samples of saliva left along potential migration routes were sent to a lab at Northern Arizona University in Flagstaff, where researchers looked for environmental DNA — or eDNA — to confirm that the bats cycle through Arizona and consider the region their part-time home. The Mexican long-nosed bat has been listed as endangered under the Endangered Species Act since 1988, and is the only one in Arizona with that federal protection. It is an important species for pollinating cactus, agave and other desert plants. Officials from the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service and the Arizona Game and Fish Department announced the discovery in late January. While expanding Arizona's list of bat species to 29 is exciting, wildlife managers say the use of this novel, noninvasive method to nail it down also deserves to be celebrated. 'If we were trying to identify the species in the absence of eDNA, biologists could spend hours and hours trying to catch one of these bats, and even then, you’re not guaranteed to be successful,' said Angie McIntire, a bat specialist for the Arizona's Game and Fish Department. 'By sampling the environment, eDNA gives us an additional tool for our toolkit.' Every spring, Mexican long-nosed bats traverse a lengthy migratory path north from Mexico into the southwestern U.S., following the sweet nectar of their favorite blooming plants like breadcrumbs. They return along the same route in the fall. The bat conservation group recruited ordinary citizens for the mission, giving them kits to swab samples from bird feeders throughout the summer and fall. Inside the university lab, microbiology major Anna Riley extracted the DNA from hundreds of samples and ran them through machines that ultimately could detect the presence of bats. Part of the work involved a steady hand, with Riley using a syringe of sorts to transfer diluted DNA into tiny vials before popping them into a centrifuge. Sample after sample, vial after vial, the meticulous work took months. 'There’s a big database that has DNA sequences of not every animal but most species, and so we could compare our DNA sequences we got from these samples to what’s in the database,' Riley said. 'A little bit like a Google search — you’ve got your question, you’re asking Google, you plug it into the database, and it turns up you’ve got a bat, and you have this kind of bat.' Kristen Lear, of the conservation group, said the collection of eDNA has been used successfully for determining the presence of other kinds of wildlife in various environments, so the group proposed trying it with bats. 'They do apparently leave behind a lot of spit on these plants and hummingbird feeders,' Lear said.	https://www.voanews.com/a/arizona-adds-endangered-bat-to-list-of-night-flying-creatures-that-frequent-the-state/7970013.html	2025-02-10T15:48:53-08:00	
15 cases of measles in Texas county with numerous vaccine exemptions	Fifteen measles cases — mostly in school-aged children — have been confirmed in a small county in West Texas with one of the highest rates of vaccine exemptions in the state. South Plains Public Health District Director Zach Holbrooks said Monday that his department was first notified in late January about the first two cases in Gaines County, which he said were 'two children who had seen a physician in Lubbock.' Some of the cases appear to be connected to private religious schools in the district, said Holbrooks, who cautioned that the investigation is ongoing. 'I wouldn’t say they’re all connected, but our teams are looking into exposure sites and the background of those cases,' he said. Local health officials set up a drive-through vaccination clinic last week and are offering screening services to residents. The U.S. saw a rise in measles cases in 2024, including an outbreak in Chicago that sickened more than 60. This month, health officials in metro Atlanta are working to contain a measles case that spread to two unvaccinated family members. Texas law allows children to get an exemption from school vaccines for reasons of conscience, including religious beliefs. The percentage of kids with exemptions has risen over the last decade from .76% in 2014 to 2.32% last year, according to Texas Department of State Health Services data. Gaines County has one of the highest rates in Texas of school-aged children who opt out of at least one required vaccine: Nearly 14% of children from kindergarten through grade 12 had an exemption in the 2023-24 school year, which is more than five times the state average of 2.32% and beyond the national rate of 3.3%. But the number of unvaccinated kids in the county is likely significantly higher, DSHS spokesperson Lara Anton said, because Gaines County has many children who are homeschooled and whose data would not be reported. The measles, mumps and rubella vaccines are a two-shot series: The first is recommended at 12 to 15 months old and second between 4 to 6 years old. The vaccine is required to attend most public schools in the U.S. But vaccination rates have declined nationwide since the COVID-19 pandemic and most states are below the 95% vaccination threshold for kindergartners — the level needed to protect communities against measles outbreaks. Lawmakers across the country have proposed various vaccine requirement changes at a time when anti-vaccine activist Robert F. Kennedy Jr. is awaiting confirmation as the secretary of Health and Human Services. One of the early Gaines County cases traveled to neighboring New Mexico while they were still infectious, Anton said, but there were no immediate reports of infection. New Mexico Department of Health spokesperson Robert Nott said the agency has been in communication with Texas officials but there was no known exposure to measles in his state. 'We're going to watch this very closely,' Nott said. Two cases of measles were reported in early January in the Houston area, but Holbrooks said the West Texas cases don't appear to be connected. Measles is a highly contagious virus that can survive in the air for up to two hours. Up to 9 out of 10 people who are susceptible will get the virus if exposed, according to the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. Before the vaccine was introduced in 1963, the U.S. saw some 3 million to 4 million cases per year. Now, it's usually fewer than 200 in a normal year.	https://www.voanews.com/a/cases-of-measles-in-texas-county-with-numerous-vaccine-exemptions-/7970000.html	2025-02-10T15:38:20-08:00	
On sidelines of AI Summit in Paris, unions denounce its harmful effects	PARIS — In front of political and tech leaders gathered at a summit in Paris, French President Emmanuel Macron called for a strategy on Monday to make up for the delay in France and Europe in investing in artificial intelligence (AI) but was faced with a 'counter-summit' that pointed out the risks of the technology. The use of chatbots at work and school is destroying jobs, professions and threatening the acquisition of knowledge, said union representatives gathered at the Theatre de la Concorde located in the Champs-Elysees gardens, less than a kilometer from the venue of the Summit for Action on Artificial Intelligence. Habib El Kettani, from Solidaires Informatique, a union representing IT workers, described an 'automation already underway for about ten years,' which has been reinforced with the arrival of the flagship tool ChatGPT at the end of 2022. 'I have been fighting for ten years to ensure that my job does not become an endangered species,' said Sandrine Larizza, from the CGT union at France Travail, a public service dedicated to the unemployed. She deplored 'a disappearance of social rights that goes hand in hand with the automation of public services,' where the development of AI has served, according to her 'to make people work faster to respond less and less to the needs of users, by reducing staff numbers.' Loss of meaning 'With generative AI, it is no longer the agent who responds by email to the unemployed person but the generative AI that gives the answers with a multitude of discounted job offers in subcontracting,' said Larizza. This is accompanied by 'a destruction of our human capacities to play a social role, a division into micro-tasks on the assembly line and an industrialization of our professions with a loss of meaning,' she said, a few days after the announcement of a partnership between France Travail and the French startup Mistral. 'Around 40 projects' are also being tested 'with postal workers,' said Marie Vairon, general secretary of the Sud PTT union of the La Poste and La Banque Postale group. AI is used 'to manage schedules and simplify tasks with a tool tested since 2020 and generalized since 2023,' she said, noting that the results are 'not conclusive.' After the implementation at the postal bank, La Banque Postale, of 'Lucy,' a conversational robot handling some '300,000 calls every month,' Vairon is concerned about a 'generative AI serving as a coach for bank advisers.' ‘Students are using it’ On the education side, 'whether we like it or not, students are using it,' said Stephanie de Vanssay, national educational and digital adviser of the National Union of Autonomous Unions (UNSA) for primary and secondary school. 'We have indifferent teachers, worried teachers who are afraid of losing control and quality of learning, skeptics, and those who are angry about all the other priorities,' she said. Developing the critical thinking of some 12 million students is becoming, in any case, 'an even more serious concern and it is urgent to explain how to use these tools and why,' de Vanssay said. The Minister of National Education Elisabeth Borne announced on Thursday the launch of a call for tenders for an AI for teachers, as well as a charter of use and training for teachers. 'No critical thinking without interactions and without helping each other to think and progress in one's thinking, which requires intermediation,' said Beatrice Laurent, national secretary of UNSA education. 'A baby with a tablet and nursery rhymes will not learn to speak.'	https://www.voanews.com/a/on-sidelines-of-ai-summit-in-paris-unions-denounce-its-harmful-effects-/7970005.html	2025-02-10T15:37:15-08:00	
US judge keeps block on Trump federal buyout plan in place for now	BOSTON/WASHINGTON — A U.S. judge kept his block on President Donald Trump's buyout plan for federal employees in place on Monday while he considers whether to impose it for a longer period of time. The decision by U.S. District Judge George O'Toole in Boston prevents Trump's administration from implementing the buyout plan for now, giving a temporary victory to labor unions that have sued to stop it entirely. More than 2 million federal civilian employees had faced a midnight deadline Monday to accept the proposal. It is unclear when O'Toole will rule on the request by the unions. The buyout effort is part of a far-reaching plan by Trump and his allies to reduce the size and rein in the actions of the federal bureaucracy. Trump, who returned to the presidency on Jan. 20, has accused the federal workforce of undercutting his agenda during his first term in office, from 2017 to 2021. Unions have urged their members not to accept the buyout offer — saying Trump's administration cannot be trusted to honor it — but about 65,000 federal employees had signed up for the buyouts as of Friday, according to a White House official. Reuters has been unable to independently verify that number, which does not include a breakdown of workers from each agency. The offer promises to pay employees their regular salaries and benefits until October without requiring them to work, but that may not be ironclad. Current spending laws expire on March 14, and there is no guarantee that salaries would be funded beyond that point. At a court hearing, U.S. Justice Department attorney Eric Hamilton called the buyout plan a 'humane off-ramp' for those frustrated by Trump's decision to reduce the size of the workforce and end the ability of many of them to work from home. But a lawyer for the unions said the plan had been carried out in a 'slap dash' fashion with little regard to how it might disrupt operations at agencies such as the Department of Veterans Affairs. 'They failed to consider the continued functioning of government,' lawyer Elena Goldstein said. The administration had initially proposed a deadline of last Thursday before O'Toole, an appointee of Democratic former President Bill Clinton, extended it so he could consider the case. Trump has tasked Tesla CEO and SpaceX founder Elon Musk, the world's richest person, with overseeing the purge of federal employees through his Department of Government Efficiency, which is not an actual government agency. Musk's actions have sown panic among federal workers and prompted public protests. His actions also have led to a flood of calls to U.S. lawmakers by voters worried about the access that Musk's team has been given to sensitive information in government computer systems that contain data on federal payments to Americans and personal details of federal workers. Several lawsuits The unions and Democratic attorneys general have brought lawsuits challenging Trump's rapid remaking of government and won some initial victories. A union that represents Consumer Financial Protection Bureau workers has filed a lawsuit seeking to block acting chief Russell Vought's move to suspend CFPB activities, one of several legal challenges that Trump's administration now faces. Democratic attorneys general from 22 U.S. states filed a lawsuit on Monday in Boston challenging sharp cuts to federal grant funding for universities, medical centers and other research institutions by the Trump administration. An effort to hollow out the U.S. Agency for International Development is partially on hold after a judge's ruling. Trump's effort to freeze trillions of dollars in federal loans, grants and other financial assistance has also been paused in a separate case. A federal judge in Rhode Island on Monday ruled that the administration must restore all domestic funding while he considers the case. On Saturday, a judge temporarily blocked Musk's entity from accessing government systems used to process trillions of dollars in payments at the Treasury Department.	https://www.voanews.com/a/us-judge-keeps-block-on-trump-federal-buyout-plan-in-place-for-now/7969998.html	2025-02-10T15:36:33-08:00	
Trump signs executive orders on steel, aluminum tariffs	Washington — President Donald Trump moved to substantially raise tariffs on steel and aluminum imports on Monday, canceling exemptions and duty-free quotas for major suppliers Canada, Mexico, Brazil and other countries in a move that could boost the risk of a multifront trade war. Trump signed proclamations that raised the tariff rate on aluminum imports to 25% from the previous 10% that he imposed in 2018 to aid the struggling sector. His action reinstates a 25% tariff on millions of tons of steel imports and aluminum imports that had been entering the U.S. duty free under quota deals, exemptions and thousands of product exclusions. The proclamations were extensions of Trump's 2018 Section 232 national security tariffs to protect steel and aluminum makers. A White House official said the exemptions had eroded the effectiveness of these measures. Trump also will impose a new North American standard requiring steel imports to be 'melted and poured' and aluminum to be 'smelted and cast' in the region to curb imports of minimally processed Chinese steel into the U.S. The order also targets downstream steel products that use imported steel for tariffs. Trump's trade adviser Peter Navarro said the measures would help U.S. steel and aluminum producers and shore up America's economic and national security. 'The steel and aluminum tariffs 2.0 will put an end to foreign dumping, boost domestic production and secure our steel and aluminum industries as the backbone and pillar industries of America's economic and national security,' he told reporters. 'This isn't just about trade. It's about ensuring that America never has to rely on foreign nations for critical industries like steel and aluminum.' Trump first broached the steel and aluminum action on Sunday, adding that he would also announce a further set of reciprocal tariffs later in the week, drawing warnings of retaliation from trade partners.	https://www.voanews.com/a/trump-signs-executive-orders-on-steel-aluminum-tariffs/7970007.html	2025-02-10T15:35:06-08:00	
2 US deportation flights head to Venezuela, alleged gang members aboard	Two planes carrying Venezuelan migrants deported from the United States — the first since a January deal between the administration of U.S. President Donald Trump and Venezuelan President Nicolas Maduro — are heading to Venezuela, the South American country's government said Monday. The flights, run by Venezuelan airline Conviasa, are part of a plan to repatriate thousands of migrants who fled Venezuela 'because of economic sanctions and the campaigns of psychological warfare against our country,' the government statement said. Some of the people on the flight are allegedly involved in illegal activities with the Tren de Aragua gang, the statement said and will be vigorously investigated for criminal ties. Trump envoy Richard Grenell met with Maduro in Caracas on Jan. 31, where the two men discussed migration and sanctions, among other issues. Grenell left the South American country with six Americans who had been held by Venezuelan authorities. The Trump administration has said it is a priority to deport members of Tren de Aragua from the U.S. and Trump himself said after Grenell's visit that Maduro agreed to receive all Venezuelan illegal migrants and provide for their transportation back home. The Venezuelan government says it destroyed Tren de Aragua within its borders in 2023. Trump's administration has also moved to remove deportation protection from about 348,000 Venezuelans in the U.S., who could lose work permits and then be deported in April. More than 7 million Venezuelan migrants have left their country in recent years amid a sustained economic and social collapse blamed by the government on sanctions by the United States and others. Maduro and several allies have been indicted by the United States on drug trafficking charges and international observers and the country's opposition say a July election which gave Maduro his third term was fraudulent.	https://www.voanews.com/a/us-deportation-flights-head-to-venezuela-alleged-gang-members-aboard/7970003.html	2025-02-10T15:26:24-08:00	
UN Security Council raises alarm over rising IS-K threat from Afghanistan	Islamabad — United Nations counterterrorism officials warned during a Security Council meeting Monday that an Islamic State affiliate in Afghanistan remains a significant threat to regional and global security. The discussion centered on the threat posed by Islamic State, also known as Daesh, and its regional offshoots to international peace and security. The Afghan-based Islamic State-Khorasan (IS-K) was highlighted as one of the 'most dangerous branches' of the transnational terrorist group. It has carried out repeated high-profile attacks targeting Afghan civilians and members of the country’s de facto Taliban rulers. 'ISIL-Khorasan has continued to pose a significant threat in Afghanistan, the region and beyond,' Vladimir Voronkov, U.N. undersecretary-general for counterterrorism, told the meeting, using another acronym for IS-K. He stated that IS-K supporters had plotted attacks in Europe and were actively seeking to recruit individuals from Central Asian countries. 'There were also reports of small numbers of foreign terrorist fighters continuing to travel to Afghanistan,' Voronkov said. He renewed a U.N. appeal for all member states to come together to prevent the South Asian country from 'again becoming a hotbed of terrorist activities.' While addressing the meeting, U.S. Ambassador Dorothy Shea described IS-K as a significant global threat. 'We remain concerned about ISIS-K's capabilities to plot and conduct attacks, as well as sustain recruitment campaigns, particularly in Afghanistan and Pakistan,' Shea stated, using another acronym for IS-K. Chinese envoy Fu Cong cautioned without elaborating that terrorists linked to IS-K, al-Qaida and the anti-China East Turkestan Islamic Movement 'are very active' in Afghanistan and 'are colluding with each other.' 'China calls on the Afghan interim government to take visible and verifiable action to disintegrate and eliminate all terrorist organizations entrenched in Afghanistan,' Fu said, referring to the Taliban government, which is not recognized by any country. Vassily Nebenzia, Russia's ambassador to the U.N., attributed the increasing threat of IS-K to the hasty withdrawal of U.S.-led NATO troops from Afghanistan in 2021. 'The growing activity of ISIL-Khorasan is no coincidence. While hastily leaving Afghanistan, NATO troops abandoned vast quantities of weapons and equipment there, which then fell into the hands of ISIL inter alia [among other things],' Nebenzya asserted. Munir Akram, Pakistan’s envoy to the U.N., questioned the validity of U.S. claims that IS-K is conducting recruitment campaigns in his country. He cited U.N. findings that Afghanistan is 'the main hub for ISIL-K’s recruitment and facilitation' and rejected 'any imputation that there is any such recruitment in Pakistan.' Taliban authorities have not responded to the U.N. assertions but have persistently downplayed IS-K activities in the country, claiming that no foreign terrorist groups operated on Afghan soil. De facto Afghan leaders assert that Taliban counterterrorism forces have nearly eliminated IS-K hideouts, and the group can no longer pose a threat to Afghanistan or other nations from its territory. However, IS-K has routinely conducted and claimed attacks targeting members of the Afghan Shiite community and the Taliban. Last December, an IS-K suicide bomber targeted and killed Khalil Ur-Rahman Haqqani, the Taliban’s minister of refugees, along with several of his associates inside his ministry in Kabul, the Afghan capital. This marked the most high-profile assassination since the Taliban regained control of Afghanistan in August 2021, following the withdrawal of NATO troops from the country.	https://www.voanews.com/a/un-security-council-raises-alarm-over-rising-is-k-threat-from-afghanistan/7969985.html	2025-02-10T14:59:39-08:00	
ICC opens inquiry into Italy over release of Libyan warlord	THE HAGUE, NETHERLANDS — Judges at the International Criminal Court have officially asked Italy on Monday to explain why the country released a Libyan man suspected of torture, murder and rape rather than sending him to The Hague. Italian police arrested Ossama Anjiem, also known as Ossama al-Masri, last month but rather than extraditing him to the Netherlands, where the ICC is based, sent him back to Libya aboard an Italian military aircraft. 'The matter of state’s non-compliance with a request of cooperation for arrest and surrender by the court is before the competent chamber,' the court’s spokesperson Fadi El Abdallah said in a statement. Addressing parliament last week, Italian Justice Minister Carlo Nordio defended the decision to send al-Masri home, claiming the ICC had issued a contradictory and flawed arrest warrant. The court, he said, 'realized that an immense mess was made,' he told lawmakers. Al-Masri was arrested in Turin on the ICC warrant on Jan. 19, the day after he arrived in the country from Germany to watch a soccer match. The Italian government has said Rome’s court of appeals ordered him released on Jan. 21 because of a technical problem in the way that the ICC warrant was transmitted, having initially bypassed the Italian justice ministry. The ICC said it does not comment on national judicial proceedings. Al-Masri’s arrest had posed a dilemma for Italy because it has close ties to the internationally recognized government in Tripoli as well as energy interests in the country. According to the arrest warrant, al-Masri heads the Tripoli branch of the Reform and Rehabilitation Institution, a notorious network of detention centers run by the government-backed Special Defense Force, which acts as a military police unit combating high-profile crimes including kidnappings, murders as well as illegal migration. Like many other militias in western Libya, the SDF has been implicated in atrocities in the civil war that followed the overthrow and killing of longtime Libyan dictator Moammar Gadhafi in 2011. Additionally, any trial in The Hague of al-Masri could bring unwanted attention to Italy’s migration policies and its support of the Libyan coast guard, which it has financed to prevent migrants from leaving. In October, the court unsealed arrest warrants for six men allegedly linked to a brutal Libyan militia blamed for multiple killings and other crimes in a strategically important western town where mass graves were discovered in 2020.	https://www.voanews.com/a/icc-opens-inquiry-into-italy-over-release-of-libyan-warlord/7969989.html	2025-02-10T14:57:05-08:00	
Trump calls for halting penny production, saying it's too expensive	RICHMOND, VIRGINIA — The lowly penny, the forgotten mainstay of coin jars and car cupholders everywhere, may soon be no more. President Donald Trump announced Sunday he's ordered his administration to cease production of the 1-cent coin, whose buying power is long past its prime. Advocates for ditching the penny cite its high production cost — currently almost 4 cents per penny, according to the U.S. Mint — and limited utility. Fans of the penny cite its usefulness in charity drives and relative bargain in production costs compared with the nickel, which costs almost 14 cents to mint. Trump's surprise order comes after decades of unsuccessful efforts to pitch the penny. 'Only tradition explains our stubborn attachment to the penny. But sometimes traditions get ridiculous,' the Farmers' Almanac said in its 1989 edition. Here's a look at some questions surrounding Trump's order. Can Trump really order the Treasury to stop minting pennies without Congress' approval? Yes, according to legal scholar Laurence H. Tribe, the Carl M. Loeb University Professor of Constitutional Law Emeritus at Harvard University. U.S. code gives the Treasury Secretary the authority to mint and issue coins 'in amounts the secretary decides are necessary to meet the needs of the United States.' If Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent decides the amount necessary for the penny is zero, he's within his legal rights, Tribe said. 'Unlike a lot of what the new administration has been doing pursuant to the flood of executive orders since January 20, this action seems to me entirely lawful and fully constitutional,' Tribe said, referring to the aggressive executive action Trump's taken on other issues since taking office. Congress, which dictates currency specifications like the size and metal content of coins, could make Trump's order permanent through law. But past congressional efforts to ditch the penny have failed. Pennies are mostly made of zinc, and the American zinc lobby has been a major opponent to suggestions that the penny be eliminated. How many pennies are in circulation? It depends on what you mean by circulation. Pennies are the most popular coin made by the U.S. Mint, which reported making 3.2 billion of them last year. That's more than half of all the new coins it made last year. MIT Professor Jeff Gore, who founded Citizens to Retire the Penny, said coins are supposed to stay in circulation for about 30 years and that in the last three decades the U.S. Mint has made about 250 billion pennies. But, he says, 'because nobody wants to use pennies, they fall out of active circulation much faster than other coins.' If pennies sit in drawer for a decade, Gore asks, 'Does that qualify as being in circulation?' Will Americans miss pennies? Experience in other countries suggests no. Canada started phasing out its penny a dozen years ago and urged store owners to round prices to the nearest nickel for cash transactions. Electronic purchases were still billed to the nearest cent. The move came after New Zealand, Australia, the Netherlands and others dropped their lowest-denomination coins. After dropping the penny or its equivalent, those countries have not looked back. What comes next? Trump's order, which he announced in a social media post as he was departing New Orleans after watching the first half of the Super Bowl, was the latest in his administration's rapid-fire efforts to cut government costs. 'Let's rip the waste out of our great nation's budget, even if it's a penny at a time,' Trump wrote in his post, which was light on details about plans for a post-penny future. After Canada stopped minting new pennies, it began recycling them for their 'valuable' copper and zinc, according to a 2022 report from the Canadian Mint.	https://www.voanews.com/a/trump-calls-for-halting-penny-production-saying-it-s-too-expensive-/7969975.html	2025-02-10T14:39:24-08:00	
Boston man cleared of US charges he acted as Chinese agent	Boston — A jury found a Boston man not guilty on Monday of U.S. charges that he acted as an unlawful agent of China's government by supplying officials information about individuals, dissidents and groups in the local Chinese community. Litang Liang, 65, was acquitted in federal court of charges that he acted as an unregistered Chinese agent in a case brought in 2023 that U.S. authorities had portrayed as part of their commitment to counter efforts by China's government ato silence its critics abroad. Liang, a China-born U.S. citizen, had denied the charges and pleaded not guilty. His lawyer during the trial called the charges 'ridiculous' and called them an effort to chill the free speech of a local community activist who advocated for the 'reunification' of democratically governed Taiwan with mainland China -- a view in harmony with China's leaders. 'Justice has finally arrived,' Liang told reporters through a translator following the verdict. U.S. Attorney Leah Foley, whose office pursued the case, said in a statement that while prosecutors 'respect the jury's decision, we are disappointed in (Monday's) verdict.' Liang had worked at a hotel and for years had been an active member in his union as well as a community organizer and activist in the Chinese-American community in Boston, according to his lawyer, Derege Demissie. Assistant U.S. Attorney Timothy Kistner told jurors on Friday during closing arguments in the case that China's government sought out Liang because it 'wanted someone already involved in the community who knew the people who were there.' Prosecutors said Liang from 2018 to 2022 provided Chinese officials with information on individuals and shared details about dissidents and groups with pro-Taiwan leanings. Prosecutors said that in 2018, after traveling to Beijing for meetings with an arm of the Chinese Communist Party, Liang founded the New England Alliance for the Peaceful Unification of China, which focused on promoting China's goals with Taiwan. China views democratically governed Taiwan as its own territory. Taiwan rejects Beijing's sovereignty claims, saying only the island's people can decide their future. Prosecutors said Liang, also at the direction of Chinese officials, in 2019 organized a counter-demonstration against pro-democracy protesters, and in 2022 provided an official with a Chinese agency, tasked with investigating political dissidents, information on two potential local recruits. Demissie in his closing argument to the jury countered that Liang made no secret of his activism and that his prosecution infringed on Liang's right to free speech under the U.S. Constitution's First Amendment. 'This case would have meant nothing if it did not involve China,' Demissie said. 'That's what this is about. And it had the purpose of scaring people, and it achieved that purpose.'	https://www.voanews.com/a/7969980.html	2025-02-10T14:37:25-08:00	
UN halts aid work in Houthi rebels' stronghold in Yemen after staff detentions	CAIRO — The United Nations said Monday it suspended its humanitarian operations in the stronghold of Yemen’s Houthi rebels after they detained eight more U.N. staffers, affecting the global response to one of the world’s worst humanitarian disasters. In a statement, the U.N. said the 'extraordinary' decision to pause all operations and programs in northern Saada province was due to the lack of necessary security conditions and guarantees. A spokesperson for the Houthis didn’t immediately respond to messages seeking comment. The rebels in recent months have detained dozens of U.N. staffers, as well as people associated with aid groups, civil society and the once-open U.S. Embassy in Sanaa, Yemen’s capital. None of the U.N. staffers have been released. The U.N. statement said the pause in operations is meant to give the Houthis and the world body time to 'arrange the release of arbitrarily detained U.N. personnel and ensure that the necessary conditions are in place to deliver critical humanitarian support' in rebel-held areas. It said the latest detained U.N. staffers — taken late last month — included six working in Saada, on Yemen’s northern border with Saudi Arabia. Seven U.N, agencies operate in Saada, including the World Food Program, the World Health Organization and UNICEF, along with several international aid organizations, according to the U.N. humanitarian agency. The U.N. late last month suspended all travel into Houthi-held areas. The war in Yemen has killed more than 150,000 people, including fighters and civilians. The Iranian-backed Houthis have been fighting Yemen’s internationally recognized government, which is backed by a Saudi-led coalition, since 2014, when they descended from their stronghold in Saada and took control of Sanaa and most of the north. The U.N. had projected that over 19 million people across Yemen will need humanitarian assistance this year as many deal with climate shocks, malnutrition, cholera and the economic effects of war. The rebels have imprisoned thousands of people during the war. In recent months, they also intensified their crackdown on dissent, including recently sentencing 44 people to death. In January, the Houthis unilaterally freed 153 war detainees as one of several overtures to ease tensions after the ceasefire in the Israel-Hamas war in Gaza. Such prisoner releases have been viewed as a means to jump-start talks over permanently ending Yemen’s war.	https://www.voanews.com/a/un-halts-aid-work-in-houthi-rebels-stronghold-in-yemen-after-staff-detentions-/7969962.html	2025-02-10T14:26:36-08:00

US judge says Trump administration violated order lifting spending freeze	A U.S. judge on Monday said President Donald Trump's administration violated a court order lifting a broad freeze on federal spending and directed the government to immediately release any withheld funds. U.S. District Judge John McConnell in Providence, Rhode Island, had already blocked the funding freeze with a temporary restraining order on Jan. 31, but a group of Democratic state attorneys general who sued to block the move said last week that the government was still withholding funds. The Trump administration on Monday said it is appealing. 'The broad categorical and sweeping freeze of federal funds is, as the court found, likely unconstitutional and has caused and continues to cause irreparable harm to a vast portion of this country,' McConnell said on Monday. 'These pauses in funding violate the plain text of the TRO.' McConnell said all funding must be restored at least until he can hold a hearing on the states' motion for a longer-term order. On Feb. 6, a lawyer with the office of Democratic New York Attorney General Letitia James told McConnell that state agencies were still having difficulty accessing federal funds, including billions of dollars for infrastructure projects under the Inflation Reduction Act. The Trump administration had told states it believed the order did not apply to certain environmental and infrastructure spending, and that some payments were delayed for 'operational and administrative reasons.' However, McConnell said his order had been 'clear and unambiguous' in applying to all funding frozen in response to sweeping executive orders by Trump. The states originally sued the administration over a memorandum from the White House's Office of Management and Budget announcing a wide-ranging freeze of federal spending. Soon after the lawsuit was filed, OMB rescinded that memo. The memo was part of a larger Trump administration push to tighten federal spending and reshape the federal bureaucracy, which has sparked a flurry of lawsuits. In a separate case over Trump's push to dismantle the U.S. Agency for International Development, federal employee unions have accused the administration of violating a court order reinstating USAID workers who were placed on administrative leave.	https://www.voanews.com/a/trump-administration-ordered-to-restore-all-frozen-federal-spending/7969952.html	2025-02-10T14:11:17-08:00	
VOA Mandarin: China courts India as Trump, Modi vow to deepen ties	Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi is scheduled to visit the U.S. on Wednesday. President Donald Trump announced Modi's White House visit as India's foreign secretary, Vikram Misri, met with Chinese Foreign Minister Wang Yi in Beijing, where they agreed to restore bilateral ties and resume direct flights and pilgrimages by Indian pilgrims to a holy site in Tibet. While Modi's government has shifted toward populist policies, China launched an aggressive public relations campaign in 2024 to improve its standing with India. Analysts view China's diplomatic push as a response to the deepening U.S.-India partnership and Beijing's desire to maintain regional influence, particularly given expected tensions with the Trump administration.

VOA Mandarin: DeepSeek's security questioned by many researchers	Since its launch, Chinese startup DeepSeek has attracted worldwide attention for its comparatively low cost and advanced reasoning capabilities. However, more and more researchers have begun to question the security of DeepSeek. They worry that the price of DeepSeek's low-cost research and development may be a lack of security, and its security vulnerabilities may be exploited by criminals. It is particularly weak in preventing malicious exploitation, such as being manipulated into providing instructions for creating bioweapons. In addition, studies found that DeepSeek has been extremely careless in protecting and encrypting sensitive user data.

US defense chief headed to Europe for NATO, Ukraine meetings	Pentagon — New U.S. Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth is headed to Europe, his first international trip since taking office last month. Hegseth departed from Joint Base Andrews, just outside of Washington, early Monday, for stops in Germany, Belgium and Poland. In Germany, the defense secretary is scheduled to visit the headquarters for U.S. European Command, and U.S. Africa Command, getting updates on developments in both regions. From Germany, Hegseth will travel to Brussels for the NATO Defense Ministerial and a meeting of the Ukraine Defense Contact Group on Wednesday and Thursday. U.S. defense officials say Hegseth is expected to press U.S. allies in Europe to increase their defense spending and take more of a leadership role for challenges facing Europe. He is also expected to echo U.S. President Donald Trump’s call for a diplomatic end to the war between Russia and Ukraine, which is about to enter its third year. The meeting of the Ukraine Defense Contact Group — a group of almost 50 countries who have pledged to support Ukraine in its efforts to repel Russia — is the first to take place during the new Trump administration and will be the first led by a country other than the U.S. This week’s meeting, the 26th, will be led by Britain. Britain’s Defense Ministry, in a statement Thursday said the meeting will focus on 'priorities for Ukraine as the international community continues to work together to support Ukraine in its fight against [Russian President Vladimir] Putin’s illegal invasion.' The Pentagon, in a statement previewing Hegseth’s participation in the meeting, said in addition to emphasizing Trump’s push for a diplomatic resolution to the war, the secretary, 'will also highlight the need for increased European leadership on security assistance to Ukraine.' Following the meetings in Brussels, Hegseth is scheduled to travel to Poland to meet with leaders there and visit with U.S. troops. Of note, the U.S. defense secretary said he is skipping the annual Munich Security Conference in Germany, which bills itself as 'the world's leading forum for debating international security policy,' which gets underway Friday. 'We're not going to the Munich Security Conference,' Hegseth told defense officials and troops at a town hall meeting last Friday at the Pentagon. 'We're instead going to Poland to see the troops out there and we're going to Germany to see EUCOM and AFRICOM,' he said. 'I would much rather talk to troops than go to cocktail parties. That's my job.' Instead, the U.S. is set to be represented in Munich by Vice President JD Vance and Secretary of State Marco Rubio.	https://www.voanews.com/a/us-defense-chief-headed-to-europe-for-nato-ukraine-meetings/7969820.html	2025-02-10T12:12:04-08:00

51 dead in Guatemala after bus plunges off bridge	Guatemala City — At least 51 people are dead after their bus plunged off a bridge Monday on the outskirts of Guatemala’s capital, said Hector Flores, who was helping coordinate the municipal government's response. Firefighting spokesperson Edwin Villagran said a multi-vehicle crash sent the bus off the bridge before dawn, trapping survivors. Many of the victims pulled from the wreckage were seriously injured. Volunteer firefighting spokesman Oscar Sanchez said children were among the victims. The densely packed bus had come from Progreso department, northeast of the capital on a busy route into the city when it plunged from Puente Belice, a highway bridge that crosses over a road and creek. The bus fell 35 meters into a sewage-polluted stream. It landed upside down and half-submerged in water. Guatemala City fire department spokesperson, Carlos Hernandez, said the bodies of 36 men and 15 women had been sent to a provincial morgue set up for the accident. Guatemalan President Bernardo Arevalo declared three days of national mourning and deployed the country's army and disaster agency to assist response efforts. 'I stand in solidarity with the families of the victims who today woke up to heartbreaking news. Their pain is my pain,' Arevalo said on social media.	https://www.voanews.com/a/guatemala-bus-accident/7969667.html	2025-02-10T10:58:06-08:00	
Space telescope spots rare 'Einstein ring' of light	CAPE CANAVERAL, FLORIDA — Europe's Euclid space telescope has detected a rare halo of bright light around a nearby galaxy, astronomers reported Monday. The halo, known as an Einstein ring, encircles a galaxy 590 million light-years away, considered close by cosmic standards. A light-year is 5.8 trillion miles. Astronomers have known about this galaxy for more than a century and so were surprised when Euclid revealed the bright glowing ring, reported in the journal Astronomy and Astrophysics. An Einstein ring is light from a much more distant galaxy that bends in such a way as to perfectly encircle a closer object, in this case a well-known galaxy in the constellation Draco. The faraway galaxy creating the ring is more than 4 billion light-years away. Gravity distorted the light from this more distant galaxy, thus the name honoring Albert Einstein. The process is known as gravitational lensing. 'All strong lenses are special, because they're so rare, and they're incredibly useful scientifically. This one is particularly special, because it's so close to Earth and the alignment makes it very beautiful,' lead author Conor O'Riordan of Germany's Max Planck Institute for Astrophysics said in a statement. Euclid rocketed from Florida in 2023. NASA is taking part in its mission to detect dark energy and dark matter in the universe.	https://www.voanews.com/a/space-telescope-spots-rare-einstein-ring-of-light/7969600.html	2025-02-10T09:57:56-08:00	
Opening statements begin in trial of man accused of trying to kill Salman Rushdie	Mayville, New York — Lawyers began delivering opening statements Monday at the trial of the man charged with trying to fatally stab author Salman Rushdie in front of a lecture audience in western New York. Rushdie, 77, is expected to testify during the trial of Hadi Matar, bringing the writer face-to-face with his knife-wielding attacker for the first time in more than two years. Rushdie, the Booker Prize-winning author, had been about to speak about keeping writers safe from harm in August 2022 when Matar ran toward him on the stage at the Chautauqua Institution Amphitheater. Matar stabbed Rushdie more than a dozen times in the neck, stomach, chest, hand and right eye, leaving him partially blind and with permanent damage to one hand. The Indian-born British-American author detailed the attack and his long, painful recovery in a memoir, 'Knife: Meditations After an Attempted Murder,' released last year. Rushdie had worried for his safety since his 1989 novel 'The Satanic Verses' was denounced as blasphemous by many Muslims and led to Iran's Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini issuing a fatwa calling for his death. Rushdie spent years in hiding, but had traveled freely over the past quarter century after Iran announced it would not enforce the decree. The trial is taking place as the 36th anniversary of the fatwa — Feb. 14, 1989 — approaches. Matar, 27, of Fairview, New Jersey, is charged with attempted murder and assault. He has pleaded not guilty. A jury was selected last week. Matar was in court throughout the three-day process, taking notes and consulting with his attorneys. He calmly said, 'Free Palestine' while being led in to court Monday past members of the media taking photographs and video. Matar's defense faced a challenging start after it was announced that his lawyer, Nathaniel Barone, was hospitalized with an undisclosed illness and would not attend the start of the trial. Judge David Foley refused a defense request to postpone opening statements, instead instructing an associate of Barone to deliver the defense's opening statement in his place. Once testimony is underway, the trial is expected to last a week to 10 days. Jurors will be shown video and photos from the day of the attack, which ended when onlookers rushed Matar and held him until police arrived. The event's moderator, Henry Reese, co-founder of City of Asylum in Pittsburgh, was also wounded. Matar told investigators he traveled by bus to Chautauqua, about 120 kilometers south of Buffalo. He is believed to have slept in the grounds of the arts and academic retreat the night before the attack. Matar's attorney has not indicated what his defense will be. In a separate indictment, federal authorities allege Matar was motivated by a terrorist organization's endorsement of a fatwa, or edict, calling for Rushdie's death. A later trial on the federal charges — terrorism transcending national boundaries, providing material support to terrorists and attempting to provide material support to a terrorist organization — will be scheduled in U.S. District Court in Buffalo. Rushdie has been one of the world's most celebrated authors since the 1981 publication of 'Midnight's Children,' winner of the Booker Prize. His other works include the novels 'Shame' and 'Victory City,' which he had completed shortly before the 2022 stabbing, and the 2012 memoir 'Joseph Anton,' in which he wrote about his time in hiding. In the federal indictment, authorities allege Matar believed the edict was backed by the Lebanon-based militant group Hezbollah and endorsed in a 2006 speech by the group's then-leader, Hassan Nasrallah.	https://www.voanews.com/a/opening-statements-begin-in-trial-of-man-accused-of-trying-to-kill-salman-rushdie/7969468.html	2025-02-10T07:44:47-08:00	
Third federal judge blocks Trump's birthright citizenship order	Concord, New Hampshire — A third federal judge on Monday blocked President Donald Trump's executive order ending birthright citizenship for the children of people who are in the U.S. illegally. The ruling from U.S. District Judge Joseph N. Laplante in New Hampshire comes after two similar rulings by judges in Seattle and Maryland last week. A lawsuit filed by the American Civil Liberties Union contends that Trump's order violates the Constitution and 'attempts to upend one of the most fundamental American constitutional values.' Trump's Republican administration has asserted that children of noncitizens are not 'subject to the jurisdiction' of the United States and therefore are not entitled to citizenship. The administration is appealing the Seattle judge's block on Trump's executive order. At the heart of the lawsuits in the three cases is the 14th Amendment to the Constitution, ratified in 1868 after the Civil War and the Dred Scott Supreme Court decision, which held that Scott, an enslaved man, wasn't a citizen despite having lived in a state where slavery was outlawed. In 1898, in a case known as United States v. Wong Kim Ark, the U.S. Supreme Court found the only children who did not automatically receive U.S. citizenship upon being born on U.S. soil were children of diplomats, who have allegiance to another government; enemies present in the U.S. during hostile occupation; those born on foreign ships; and those born to members of sovereign Native American tribes. The U.S. is among about 30 countries where birthright citizenship — the principle of jus soli, or 'right of the soil' — is applied. Most are in the Americas and Canada and Mexico are among them.	https://www.voanews.com/a/third-federal-judge-blocks-trump-s-birthright-citizenship-order/7969406.html	2025-02-10T07:08:58-08:00	
Romanian President Iohannis announces resignation after pressure by populists	Bucharest, Romania — Romanian President Klaus Iohannis announced his resignation on Monday following mounting pressure from populist opposition groups, two months after a top court annulled a presidential election in the European Union country. 'To spare Romania from this crisis, I am resigning as president of Romania,' he said in an emotional address, adding that he will leave office on Feb. 12. Iohannis, 65, held the presidential role since 2014 and served the maximum of two five-year terms. But his presidency was extended in December after the Constitutional Court canceled the presidential race two days before a Dec. 8 runoff. That came after the far-right populist Calin Georgescu unexpectedly won the first round, after which allegations emerged of Russian interference and electoral violations. Several opposition parties, including the far-right Alliance for the Unity of Romanians (AUR), the nationalist SOS party and the Party of Young People — but also some members of the reformist Save Romania Union party — sought Iohannis' ouster through a motion filed to Parliament. Some lawmakers from the governing coalition were also expected to vote in favor. 'This is a useless endeavor because, in any case, I will leave office in a few months after the election of the new president,' Iohannis said. 'It is an unfounded move because I have never — I repeat, never — violated the constitution. And it is a harmful endeavor because ... everyone loses, and no one gains.' He added that the consequences of his ouster would be 'long-lasting and highly negative' for Romania, an EU member since 2007, and a NATO member since 2004. 'None of our partners will understand why Romania is dismissing its president when the process for electing a new president has already begun,' he said. New dates have been set to rerun the presidential vote with the first round scheduled for May 4. If no candidate obtains more than 50% of the ballot, a runoff would be held two weeks later, on May 18. It is not yet clear whether Georgescu will be able to participate in the new election. After his resignation announcement, clashes broke out between Georgescu supporters and police in front of the government building in the capital, Bucharest.	https://www.voanews.com/a/romanian-president-iohannis-announces-resignation-after-pressure-by-populists/7969345.html	2025-02-10T06:33:36-08:00	
Kosovo prime minister looking for allies for new Cabinet after failing to win parliament majority	PRISTINA, Kosovo — Kosovo Prime Minister Albin Kurti’s leftwing party won most seats in the weekend parliamentary election but was left without a majority in the house, forcing it to look for an ally to form the next government, according to preliminary results released Monday. The vote on Sunday was key in determining who will lead Kosovo as talks on normalizing ties with rival Serbia remain stalled and foreign funding for one of Europe’s poorest countries is in question. The election marked the first time since independence in 2008 that Kosovo’s parliament completed a full four-year mandate. It was the ninth parliamentary vote in Kosovo since the end of the 1998-1999 war between Serbian government forces and ethnic Albanian separatists that pushed Serbian forces out following a 78-day NATO air campaign. Serbia does not recognize Kosovo’s independence. With 88% of the votes counted, Kurti’s Self-Determination Movement Party, or Vetevendosje!, had won 41.3%, according to the Central Election Commission, the election governing body. The Democratic Party of Kosovo, or PDK, whose main leaders are detained at a Netherlands-based international criminal tribunal in The Hague and accused of war crimes, won 21.8% of the vote. Next, with 17.8% support is the Democratic League of Kosovo, or LDK, the oldest party in the country. The LDK lost much of its support after the death in 2006 of its leader, Ibrahim Rugova. The Alliance for Kosovo’s Future of former Prime Minister Ramush Haradinaj garnered 7.7% of the votes. Still, Kurti was upbeat, though his remarks gave nothing away about who he plans to ask to join his coalition government. 'The people won. Vetevendosje! won. We are the winners who will form the next Cabinet,' Kurti told journalists as his supporters took to the streets to celebrate. The commission’s webpage was down temporarily on Sunday as it was overloaded 'due to the citizens’ high interest to learn the results,' election body said. Results were collected manually. A preliminary turnout after 92% of the votes counted was 40.6% — about 7% lower than four years ago. The new 120-seat parliament reserves 20 seats for minorities regardless of election results, 10 of them for the Serb minority. Kurti’s new term will face multiple challenges after Washington recently announced it was freezing foreign aid and the European Union, almost two years ago, suspended funding for some projects and initiatives. He also is under pressure to increase public salaries and pensions, improve education and health services, and fight poverty. Kosovo, with a population of 1.6 million, is one of the poorest countries in Europe with an annual gross domestic product of less than $6,000 per person. Kurti also is likely to try and repair ties with Western powers, at odds since his Cabinet took several steps that raised tensions with Serbia and Kosovo's ethnic Serbs, including the ban on the use of the Serbian currency, the dinar, and dinar transfers to Kosovo's Serbs. Kosovo’s ethnic Serb minority depends on Belgrade’s social services and payments. The United States, the European Union and the NATO-led stabilization force in Kosovo, or KFOR, have urged the government in Pristina, Kosovo's capital, to refrain from unilateral actions, fearing the revival of inter-ethnic conflict. In Sunday's election, Srpska Lista, the main party of the ethnic Serb minority, won 2.8% of the vote — just over half of its winnings four years ago. The party's leader, Zlatan Elek, said it was 'the absolute winner of this election,' and thanked Serbia's President Aleksandar Vucic for the 'strong support for our people.' KFOR had increased its presence in Kosovo after last year’s tensions with Serbia, as well as ahead of the election. A team of 104 observers from the EU, 18 from the Council of Europe and about 1,600 others from international or local organizations, monitored the vote.	https://www.voanews.com/a/kosovo-prime-minister-looking-for-allies-for-a-new-cabinet-after-failing-to-win-parliament-majority-/7969195.html	2025-02-10T03:38:05-08:00	
Russia drone attacks spark fire, damage homes	Russian drone attacks caused a fire in Kyiv, injured a woman in Sumy and damaged several homes, according to Ukrainian officials. Meanwhile, the Russian military reported downing 15 Ukrainian drones overnight, including seven in the Krasnodar region. Nobody was hurt as a result of the fire in Kyiv, which was sparked in a non-residential building, Mayor Vitali Klitschko said in a post on the Telegram messaging app. Five houses were damaged and a woman was reportedly injured in the northeastern city of Sumy, regional governor Ihor Kalchenko said on Telegram. While fighting continued, a group of U.S. officials from President Donald Trump's administration were set to travel to Europe this week for discussions that would include the war in Ukraine. Vice President JD Vance was scheduled to attend an artificial intelligence summit in France before attending the Munich Security Conference with Secretary of State Marco Rubio. The Munich event, billed as 'the world's leading forum for debating international security policy,' is expected to focus on prospects for peace in Ukraine as well as discussions of other global conflicts. Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth will visit the headquarters of two military commands, then meet with NATO defense ministers. He’ll also attend a meeting of the Ukraine Defense Contact Group, where he 'will reiterate President Trump's commitment for a diplomatic end to the war in Ukraine as quickly as possible,' according to the Pentagon. Material from Reuters and Agence France-Presse was used in this report.	https://www.voanews.com/a/russia-drone-attacks-spark-fire-damage-homes/7969133.html	2025-02-10T02:54:44-08:00	
High-stakes AI summit in Paris: World leaders, tech titans and challenging diplomatic talks	PARIS — Major world leaders are meeting for an AI summit in Paris, where challenging diplomatic talks are expected as tech titans fight for dominance in the fast-moving technology industry. Heads of state, top government officials, CEOs and scientists from around 100 countries are participating in the two-day international summit from Monday. High-profile attendees include U.S. Vice President JD Vance, on his first overseas trip since taking office, and Chinese Vice Premier Zhang Guoqing. 'We’re living a technology and scientific revolution we’ve rarely seen,' French President Emmanuel Macron said Sunday on national television France 2. France and Europe must seize the 'opportunity' because AI 'will enable us to live better, learn better, work better, care better and it’s up to us to put this artificial intelligence at the service of human beings,' he said. Vance's debut abroad The summit will give some European leaders a chance to meet Vance for the first time. The 40-year-old vice president was just 18 months into his time as Ohio’s junior senator when Donald Trump picked him as his running mate. Vance was joined by his wife Usha and their three children — Ewan, Vivek and Mirabel — for the trip to Europe. They were greeted on French soil Monday morning by Manuel Valls, the minister for Overseas France, and the U.S. Embassy’s charge d’affaires, David McCawley. On Tuesday, Vance will have a working lunch with Macron, with discussions on Ukraine and the Middle East on the menu. Vance, like President Donald Trump, has questioned U.S. spending on Ukraine and the approach to isolating Russian President Vladimir Putin. Trump promised to end the fighting within six months of taking office. Vance will attend later this week the Munich Security Conference, where he may meet Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy. Leaders in Europe have been watching carefully Trump’s recent statements on threats to impose tariffs on the European Union, take control of Greenland and his suggestion that Palestinians clear out Gaza once the fighting in the Israel-Hamas conflict ends — an idea that’s been flatly rejected by Arab allies. Fostering AI advances The summit, which gathers major players such as Google, Microsoft and OpenAI, aims at fostering AI advances in sectors like health, education, environment and culture. A global public-private partnership named 'Current AI' is to be launched to support large-scale initiatives that serve the general interest. The Paris summit 'is the first time we’ll have had such a broad international discussion in one place on the future of AI,' said Linda Griffin, vice president of public policy at Mozilla. 'I see it as a norm-setting moment.' Nick Reiners, senior geotechnology analyst at Eurasia Group, noted an opportunity to shape AI governance in a new direction by 'moving away from this concentration of power amongst a handful of private actors and building this public interest AI instead.' However, it remains unclear if the U.S. will support such initiatives. French organizers also hope the summit will lead to major investment announcements in Europe. France is to announce AI private investments worth a total of $113 billion over the coming years, Macron said, presenting it as 'the equivalent' of Trump's Stargate AI data centers project. Indian PM co-hosting the summit India’s Prime Minister Narendra Modi is co-hosting the summit with Macron, in an effort to involve more global actors in AI development and prevent the sector from becoming a U.S.-China battle. India’s foreign secretary, Vikram Misri, stressed the need for equitable access to AI to avoid 'perpetuating a digital divide that is already existing across the world.' Macron will also travel Wednesday with Modi to the southern city port of Marseille to inaugurate a new Indian consulate and visit the ITER nuclear research site. France has become a key defense partner for India, with talks underway on purchasing 26 Rafale fighter jets and three Scorpene submarines. Officials in New Delhi said discussions are in final phase and the deal could be inked in a few weeks.	https://www.voanews.com/a/high-stakes-ai-summit-in-paris-world-leaders-tech-titans-and-challenging-diplomatic-talks-/7969168.html	2025-02-10T02:49:06-08:00	
China hopes the aging Dalai Lama can 'return to right path'	BEIJING — China hopes the Dalai Lama can 'return to the right path' and is open to discussions about the Nobel Peace laureate's future, as long as certain conditions are met, the foreign ministry said on Monday. The exiled leader of Tibetan Buddhism, who turns 90 this year, fled Tibet in 1959 for India after a failed uprising against Chinese rule, but has expressed a desire to return to Tibet before he dies. China is open to talks about the future of the Dalai Lama if he abandons his position of splitting the 'motherland,' a foreign ministry spokesperson, Guo Jiakun, told a regular press conference. Guo was responding to a request for comment on the death of the spiritual leader's elder brother Gyalo Thondup, who had previously acted as his unofficial envoy in talks with Chinese officials. Gyalo Thondup died on Sunday, aged 97, in his home in the Indian town of Kalimpong. The Dalai Lama needs to openly recognize that Tibet and Taiwan are inalienable parts of China, whose sole legal government is that of the People's Republic of China, Guo said, using the country's official name. The Dalai Lama stepped down in 2011 as the political leader of the Tibetan government-in-exile, which Beijing does not recognize. Official talks with his representatives have stalled since. As the Dalai Lama ages, the question of his successor has also become increasingly urgent. China insists it will choose his successor as Tibet's spiritual leader. But the Dalai Lama says he will clarify questions about the succession, such as if and where he will be reincarnated, in line with Tibetan Buddhist belief, around the time of his 90th birthday in July. A new book by the Dalai Lama, due out in March to coincide with the anniversary of the uprising, is expected to outline a framework for the future of Tibet 'even after I am gone,' he has said.	https://www.voanews.com/a/china-hopes-the-aging-dalai-lama-can-return-to-right-path-/7969144.html	2025-02-10T01:56:36-08:00	
Almost all nations miss UN deadline for new climate targets	PARIS — Nearly all nations missed a UN deadline Monday to submit new targets for slashing carbon emissions, including major economies under pressure to show leadership following the U.S. retreat on climate change. Just 10 of nearly 200 countries required under the Paris Agreement to deliver fresh climate plans by Feb. 10 did so on time, according to a UN database tracking the submissions. Under the climate accord, each country is supposed to provide a steeper headline figure for cutting heat-trapping emissions by 2035, and a detailed blueprint for how to achieve this. Global emissions have been rising but need to almost halve by the end of the decade to limit global warming to levels agreed under the Paris deal. UN climate chief Simon Stiell has called this latest round of national pledges 'the most important policy documents of this century.' Yet just a handful of major polluters handed in upgraded targets on time, with China, India and the European Union the biggest names on a lengthy absentee list. Most G20 economies were missing in action with the United States, Britain and Brazil -- which is hosting this year's UN climate summit -- the only exceptions. The US pledge is largely symbolic, made before President Donald Trump ordered Washington out of the Paris deal. Accountability measure There is no penalty for submitting late targets, formally titled nationally determined contributions (NDCs). They are not legally binding but act as an accountability measure to ensure governments are taking the threat of climate change seriously. Last week, Stiell said submissions would be needed by September so they could be properly assessed before the UN COP30 climate conference in November. A spokeswoman for the EU said the 27-nation bloc intended to submit its revised targets 'well ahead' of the summit in Belem. Analysts say China, the world's biggest polluter and also its largest investor in renewable energy, is also expected to unveil its much-anticipated climate plan in the second half of the year. The United Arab Emirates, Ecuador, Saint Lucia, New Zealand, Andorra, Switzerland and Uruguay rounded out the list of countries that made Monday's cut-off. The sluggish response will not ease fears of a possible backslide on climate action as leaders juggle Trump's return and other competing priorities from budget and security crises to electoral pressure. Ebony Holland from the London-based International Institute for Environment and Development said the US retreat was 'clearly a setback' but there were many reasons for the tepid turnout. 'It's clear there are some broad geopolitical shifts underway that are proving to be a challenge when it comes to international cooperation, especially on big issues like climate change,' she said.	https://www.voanews.com/a/almost-all-nations-miss-un-deadline-for-new-climate-targets/7969128.html	2025-02-10T01:17:33-08:00	
Indonesia launches $183 million free health screening to prevent early deaths	JAKARTA — Indonesia launched an annual free health screening on Monday, a $183 million initiative to prevent early deaths that the country's health ministry said was its biggest ever undertaking. Under the program, all Indonesians will eventually be entitled to a free screening on their birthday, the ministry said. The screening, which is not mandatory, includes blood pressure, tests to determine the risk of heart problems or stroke, and eye tests, the ministry said. The program is initially targeting children under 6 and adults aged 18 and over, Health Minister Budi Gunadi Sadikin told Reuters last week. The leading causes of death in the world's fourth most populous nation include stroke, heart disease, and tuberculosis, data from the World Health Organization shows. Budi said the $184 million allocation for the program was about $62 million less than originally planned after President Prabowo Subianto ordered budget cuts to help fund election promises, including giving free meals to school children. At a health center in Jakarta on Monday, about 30 people had signed up for the screening on the first day. Teacher Ramika Dewi Saragih said she underwent checks on her breasts, cervix, eyes, and more and was not apprehensive. 'I was really looking forward to this,' the 33-year-old said, adding that more people should take up the opportunity. A health ministry spokesperson said the target for the checks this year was 100 million people. Budi said the program was intended to promote preventive care as Indonesians tended to check for illnesses only when they already had them. 'Our culture is checking when we're already sick ... that cuts closest to the grave,' he said. He said the program was the biggest the ministry had ever undertaken, surpassing COVID-19 vaccinations. Budi added the screening, which is to be rolled out at more than 20,000 health centers and clinics, also includes mental health tests to determine signs of depression or anxiety. Researchers at the University of Indonesia's Economic and Social Research Institute warned the program could risk burdening the country's already-strained local health centers, citing uneven distribution of drugs or doctors.	https://www.voanews.com/a/indonesia-launches-183-million-free-health-screening-to-prevent-early-deaths/7969114.html	2025-02-10T00:08:10-08:00	
Chinese marriages slid by a fifth in 2024, fanning birthrate concerns	HONG KONG — Marriages in China dropped by a fifth last year, the biggest drop on record, despite manifold efforts by authorities to encourage young couples to wed and have children to boost the country's declining population. More than 6.1 million couples registered for marriage last year, down from 7.68 million a year earlier, figures from the Ministry of Civil Affairs showed. Declining interest in getting married and starting a family has long been blamed on the high cost of childcare and education in China. On top of that, sputtering economic growth over the past few years has made it difficult for university graduates to find work and those that do have jobs feel insecure about their long-term prospects. But for Chinese authorities, boosting interest in marriage and baby-making is a pressing concern. China has the second-biggest population in the world at 1.4 billion but it is aging quickly. The birth rate fell for decades due to China's 1980-2015 one-child policy and rapid urbanization. And in the coming decade, roughly 300 million Chinese - the equivalent of almost the entire U.S. population - are expected to enter retirement. Measures taken last year by authorities to tackle the problem included urging China's colleges and universities to provide 'love education' to emphasize positive views on marriage, love, fertility and family. And in November, China's state council or cabinet, told local governments to direct resources towards fixing China's population crisis and spread respect for childbearing and marriages 'at the right age.' Last year saw a slight rise in births after a lull due to the pandemic and because 2024 was the Chinese zodiac year of the dragon - with children born that year considered likely to be ambitious and have great fortune. But even with the increase in births, the country's population fell for a third consecutive year. The data also showed that more than 2.6 million couples filed for divorce last year, up 1.1% from 2023.	https://www.voanews.com/a/chinese-marriages-slid-by-a-fifth-in-2024-fanning-birthrate-concerns/7969113.html	2025-02-10T00:05:37-08:00	
UK Anglicans meet after Church of England hit by scandals	LONDON — The Church of England's elected governing body will gather Monday at a time of 'unprecedented crisis' following a number of sexual abuse scandals. The meeting of the General Synod will see members debate the Makin Review, a damning report which set out a series of failings around a Christian camp leader and serial abuser, John Smyth. On Tuesday, a debate on a new way to handle safeguarding will also be held. The meeting comes a month after the Archbishop of Canterbury Justin Welby stepped down as head of the world's Anglicans over failures in the Church of England's handling of the Smyth case. 'There's never been anything like this in our lifetime, because the Church is in an unprecedented crisis,' Synod member Ian Paul told the domestic PA news agency. Paul said 'the crisis we're facing now is a result of gradual erosion over years of trust and confidence and lack of openness, lack of transparency. 'And suddenly the rafters, the rotten rafters, break, the roof collapses.' Paul was one of the people behind a petition last year calling on Welby to resign. Welby announced his resignation in November after an independent probe found that he 'could and should' have formally reported decades of abuse by Church-linked lawyer Smyth to authorities in 2013. 'Prolific' abuser' Smyth, who organized evangelical summer camps in the 1970s and 1980s, was responsible for 'prolific, brutal and horrific' abuse of up to 130 boys and young men, according to the independent Makin Review. It concluded the Church of England -- the mother church of Anglicanism -- covered up the 'traumatic physical, sexual, psychological and spiritual attacks,' which occurred in Britain, Zimbabwe and South Africa over several decades. Stephen Cottrell, who became Archbishop of York in 2020, has temporarily replaced Welby while also tainted by scandal himself. In December, the 66-year-old faced calls to stand down over claims he mishandled a sexual abuse case during his time as the Bishop of Chelmsford, in southeastern England. Priest David Tudor remained in his post despite Cottrell knowing that the Church had banned him from being alone with children and had paid compensation to a sexual abuse claimant, the BBC reported. Cottrell has said he is 'deeply sorry that we were not able to take action earlier' but defended his actions. In a fresh blow last month, the Bishop of Liverpool, John Perumbalath, said he was stepping down after a broadcaster aired allegations of sexual assault and harassment against him. Perumbalath denied wrongdoing but said in a statement a 'rush to judgment and my trial by media... has made my position untenable'. He said a church safeguarding team had investigated the allegations and had found them 'unsubstantiated' and the first allegation was investigated by the police who decided to take no further action. Ahead of the synod meeting, Andrew Graystone, an advocate for abuse survivors, called on church leaders at the four-day meeting in London to show 'radical humility.' 'No one wants another hand-wringing apology; no one wants another 'lessons learned' review; no one wants another reminder of how hard it is to be a bishop. 'We don’t want any more words at all. Instead, we want radical humility from the Archbishop (Cottrell) downwards.' The Anglican Church is the established state church in England and dates back to King Henry VIII's split from the Roman Catholic Church in the 1530s. King Charles III, its supreme governor, appoints archbishops on the advice of the prime minister.	https://www.voanews.com/a/uk-anglicans-meet-after-church-of-england-hit-by-scandals/7969111.html	2025-02-10T00:02:08-08:00	
Ecuador's conservative incumbent and a leftist lawyer advance to presidential runoff	GUAYAQUIL, Ecuador — Ecuador will choose its next president in a runoff election after conservative incumbent Daniel Noboa and leftist lawyer Luisa González garnered enough votes Sunday to beat 14 other candidates. The contest, set for April 13, will be a repeat of the October 2023 snap election that earned Noboa a 16-month presidency. Noboa and González are now vying for a full four-year term, promising voters to reduce the widespread criminal activity that upended their lives four years ago. The spike in violence across the South American country is tied to the trafficking of cocaine produced in neighboring Colombia and Peru. So many voters have become crime victims that their personal and collective losses were a determining factor in deciding whether a third president in four years could turn Ecuador around or if Noboa deserved more time in office. Noboa, an heir to a fortune built on the banana trade, and González, the protégée of Ecuador's most influential president this century, were the clear front-runners ahead of the election. Figures released by Ecuador's National Electoral Council showed that with 80% of ballots tallied, Noboa received more than 3.71 million votes, or 44.43%, while González earned over 3.69 million votes, or 44.17%. The 14 other candidates in the race were far behind them. Voting is mandatory in Ecuador. Electoral authorities reported that more than 83% of the roughly 13.7 million eligible voters cast ballots. Crime, gangs and extortion Under Noboa's watch, the homicide rate dropped from 46.18 per 100,000 people in 2023 to 38.76 per 100,000 people last year. Still, it remained far higher than the 6.85 per 100,000 people in 2019, and other crimes, such as kidnapping and extortion, have skyrocketed, making people fearful of leaving their homes. 'For me, this president is disastrous,' said Marta Barres, 35, who went to the voting center with her three teenage children. 'Can he change things in four more years? No. He hasn't done anything.' Barres, who must pay $25 a month to a local gang to avoid harassment or worse, said she supported González because she believes she can reduce crime across the board and improve the economy. Noboa defeated González in the October 2023 runoff of a snap election that was triggered by the decision of then-President Guillermo Lasso to dissolve the National Assembly and shorten his own mandate as a result. Noboa and González, a mentee of former President Rafael Correa, had only served short stints as lawmakers before launching their presidential campaigns that year. To win outright Sunday, a candidate needed 50% of the vote or at least 40% with a 10-point lead over the closest challenger. More than 100,000 police officers and members of the military were deployed across the country to safeguard the election, including at voting centers. At least 50 officers accompanied Noboa, his wife and their 2-year-old son to a voting center where the president cast his ballot in the small Pacific coast community of Olón. Testing the limits of laws and norms of governing Noboa, 37, opened an event organizing company when he was 18 and then joined his father's Noboa Corp., where he held management positions in the shipping, logistics and commercial areas. His political career began in 2021, when he won a seat in the National Assembly and chaired its Economic Development Commission. As president over the past 15 months, some of his mano dura, or heavy-handed, tactics to reduce crime have come under scrutiny inside and outside the country for testing the limits of laws and norms of governing. His questioned tactics include the state of internal armed conflict he declared in January 2024 in order to mobilize the military in places where organized crime has taken hold, as well as last year's approval of a police raid on Mexico's embassy in the capital, Quito, to arrest former Vice President Jorge Glas, a convicted criminal and fugitive who had been living there for months. His head-on approach, however, is also earning him votes. 'Noboa is the only person hitting organized crime hard,' retiree German Rizzo, who voted to get the president reelected, said outside a polling station in Samborondón, an upper-class area with gated communities separated from the port city of Guayaquil by a river. 'Things are not going to change' González, 47, held various government jobs during the presidency of Correa, who led Ecuador from 2007 through 2017 with free-spending socially conservative policies and grew increasingly authoritarian in his last years as president. He was sentenced to prison in absentia in 2020 in a corruption scandal. González was a lawmaker from 2021 until May 2023, when Lasso dissolved the National Assembly. She was unknown to most voters until Correa's party picked her as its presidential candidate for the snap election. Quito's University of the Americas professor Maria Cristina Bayas said Sunday's result was 'a triumph' for Correa's party because pre-election polls projected a wider difference between Noboa and González. Esteban Ron, dean of the Faculty of Social and Legal Sciences at the International University SEK in Quito, said Noboa will be forced to reengineer his campaign at the risk that he may have already reached his vote ceiling. Ron attributed the outcome to the problems Noboa faced during his administration. Waiting for her turn to vote in Guayaquil, architecture student Keila Torres said she had not yet decided who to vote for. None, she said, will be able to lower crime across Ecuador due to deep-rooted government corruption. 'If I could, I wouldn't be here,' said Torres, who witnessed three robberies in public buses over the past four years and barely escaped a carjacking in December. 'Things are not going to change.'	https://www.voanews.com/a/ecuador-s-conservative-incumbent-and-a-leftist-lawyer-advance-to-presidential-runoff/7969082.html	2025-02-09T22:00:24-08:00	
Chile issues evacuation alerts as wildfires rage in the country's south	SANTIAGO, Chile — Chilean authorities on Sunday issued two evacuation alerts for the southern region of La Araucanía as wildfires raged. At least one person has died. The country's government said the move aims to protect more than 860,000 people. Chile's government ordered the evacuation in regions of imminent risk, urging residents to leave their homes and seek refuge in safe areas. It did not provide figures on damage or number of people evacuated following a request from The Associated Press. Authorities confirmed the death of an 84-year-old woman who had been evacuated but eventually returned home. La Araucanía, south of capital Santiago, has faced a wave of forest fires that have spread rapidly due to high temperatures, strong winds and drought. Authorities issued a red alert in several parts of the region as firefighting teams fight against the flames. Chile's President Gabriel Boric, who ordered a curfew in affected regions on Saturday, said recently some fires are 'deliberate' and urged an investigation. Police arrested five people this weekend in connection with the case. Wildfires have recently devastated 33,406 hectares in Chile, 44% less than last year, authorities said. Much of those blazes are in La Araucanía. Temperatures above 40 degrees Celsius (104 Fahrenheit) this weekend boosted the wildfires in the region. Dozens of people were killed last year and over 1,000 homes were destroyed due to forest fires in the Valparaiso region.	https://www.voanews.com/a/chile-issues-evacuation-alerts-as-wildfires-rage-in-the-country-s-south/7969076.html	2025-02-09T21:46:26-08:00	
Colombia government in crisis after president calls for Cabinet resignations	Bogota, Colombia — Colombian President Gustavo Petro on Sunday called for his ministers and other senior officials to step down, as tensions soared in the government days after he lambasted his team on live television. The demand came after Petro on Tuesday subjected his Cabinet to a five-hour public dressing down on state TV, accusing several officials, including his trade, education and health ministers, of falling behind on the delivery of key projects. 'I have requested the resignation of ministers and directors of administrative departments,' Petro posted on social media platform X. 'There will be some changes in the Cabinet to achieve greater compliance with the program ordered by the people.' Earlier Sunday, Colombia's environment minister Susana Muhamad became the second Cabinet member in a week to step down after the contentious meeting, in which Petro said the government had been underperforming. Several ministers have complained about the presence at the meeting of Armando Benedetti, one of Petro's closest aides, who is being investigated over illegal campaign financing during the president's 2022 election race and who has been accused by his ex-wife of domestic abuse. They also expressed disapproval of the appointment as foreign minister of Laura Sarabia, Petro's scandal-hit former chief of staff, who has had a meteoric rise within the government. She was implicated in an investigation into the largest corruption scandal in the government and was involved in a case of alleged illegal wiretapping against her nanny. The day after the Cabinet meeting, culture minister Juan David Correa resigned, as did Jorge Rojas, the head of the state agency DAPRE, which manages large amounts of state funds. Muhamad, who hosted last year's UN COP16 conference on biodiversity in the city of Cali and was generally viewed as a capable pair of hands in the erratic Petro's left-wing government, was one of the few to earn the president's praise during the meeting. Muhamad told the online channel Los Danieles that her decision to quit was 'difficult' and said it was motivated by Benedetti's involvement in the running of the state. During Tuesday's meeting she had complained 'as a feminist and a woman' against his presence. Muhamad has been one of the stars of Petro's administration at a time when he is seeking to claim a leading role in global climate diplomacy. She had been touted as a possible candidate to succeed the highly unpopular Petro, Colombia's first-ever leftist president, when his term ends in 2026. The political shake-up also comes just weeks after some ministers took office, including Sarabia, and the ministers for finance, information and transport.	https://www.voanews.com/a/colombia-government-in-crisis-after-president-calls-for-cabinet-resignations/7969075.html	2025-02-09T21:44:26-08:00	
Court grants request to block detained Venezuelan immigrants from being sent to Guantanamo	ALBUQUERQUE, N.M. — A federal court on Sunday blocked the Trump administration from sending three Venezuelan immigrants held in New Mexico to Guantanamo Bay Naval Base in Cuba as part of the president's immigration crackdown. In a legal filing earlier in the day, lawyers for the men said the detainees 'fit the profile of those the administration has prioritized for detention in Guantanamo, i.e. Venezuelan men detained in the El Paso area with (false) charges of connections with the Tren de Aragua gang.' It asked a U.S. District Court in New Mexico for a temporary restraining order blocking their transfer, adding that 'the mere uncertainty the government has created surrounding the availability of legal process and counsel access is sufficient to authorize the modest injunction.' During a brief hearing, Judge Kenneth J. Gonzales granted the temporary order, which was opposed by the government, said Jessica Vosburgh, an attorney for the three men. 'It's short term. This will get revisited and further fleshed out in the weeks to come,' Vosburgh told The Associated Press. A message seeking comment was left for U.S. Customs and Immigration Enforcement. The filing came as part of a lawsuit on behalf of the three men filed by the Center for Constitutional Rights, the American Civil Liberties Union of New Mexico, and Las Americas Immigrant Advisory Center. The Tren de Aragua gang originated in a lawless prison in the central Venezuelan state of Aragua more than a decade ago and has expanded in recent years as millions of desperate Venezuelans fled President President Nicolás Maduro 's rule and migrated to other parts of Latin America or the U.S. Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem said last week that flights of detainees had landed at Guantanamo. Immigrant rights groups sent a letter Friday demanding access to people who have been sent there, saying the base should not be used as a 'legal black hole.' White House Press Secretary Karoline Leavitt said Wednesday that more than 8,000 people have been arrested in immigration enforcement actions since Trump's Jan. 20 inauguration. Trump has vowed to deport millions of the estimated 11.7 million people in the U.S. illegally.	https://www.voanews.com/a/court-grants-request-to-block-detained-venezuelan-immigrants-from-being-sent-to-guantanamo/7969074.html	2025-02-09T21:34:16-08:00	
Philadelphia defeats Kansas City in Super Bowl	The Philadelphia Eagles dominated the Kansas City Chief in this year’s Super Bowl, defeating the reigning champions by a score of 40-22. The Chiefs had been slightly favored to win the game, going into the American football showdown with hopes of winning their third consecutive National Football League title. But the Eagles held the Chiefs scoreless until late in the third quarter. By that time, the Philadelphia team already had 34 points on the board at the Caesars Superdome in New Orleans. Philadelphia Eagles quarterback Jalen Hurts was named the game’s MVP. President Donald Trump attended the matchup, the first sitting U.S. president to do so. Before the game, the president issued a press release stating that 'football is America’s most popular sport—for good reason—it fosters a sense of national unity, bringing families, friends, and fans together and strengthening communities.' 'This annual tradition transcends our differences and personifies our shared patriotic values of family, faith, and freedom heroically defended by our military service members, law enforcement officers, and first responders,' he noted. The Super Bowl was estimated to attract more than 120 million viewers, with 30-second advertisements costing a record $8 million. Before the kickoff, a ceremony honored those killed and wounded in a truck-ramming New Year’s Day terror attack in New Orleans on Bourbon Street, as well as first responders.	https://www.voanews.com/a/philadelphia-defeats-kansas-city-in-super-bowl/7969042.html	2025-02-09T19:46:37-08:00

Anora' wins at Producers and Directors Guild Awards	Did a wide-open Oscar race just get a front runner? Sean Baker's Brooklyn comedy 'Anora' took top honors at both the Producers Guild Awards and the Directors Guild Awards on Saturday night, catapulting it to Oscar favorite status with wins from a pair of closely watched Academy Awards precursors. Hollywood's award season has been uncharacteristically up for grabs with half a dozen films viewed as legitimate best-picture contenders. Some had pegged 'Anora' as the front runner going into the season after the film, starring Mikey Madison as a Brooklyn exotic dancer who marries the son of a Russian oligarch, won the Palme d’Or at the Cannes Film Festival. But after several films took turns in the spotlight, including Golden Globe winners 'The Brutalist' and 'Emilia Perez,' 'Anora' reemerged in a big way over the weekend. Baker's film also won best picture at the Critics Choice Awards on Friday. Both guild ceremonies were held in Beverly Hills, California. The PGA's top prize, the Darryl F. Zanuck Award, has matched the Oscar winner for best picture in 16 of the last 21 years. Since 2009, when the guild and the Academy of Motion Pictures Arts and Sciences both adopted a preferential ballot to pick a winner from 10 nominees, they've corresponded all but three times. The DGA is similarly predictive. In the past 74 years, 66 winners have gone on to triumph at the Oscars. That makes Baker the favorite for best director in a field entirely composed of first-time nominees. The guild also named RaMell Ross' 'Nickel Boys' best first film. Ross' movie, nominated for best picture by the Oscars, is his narrative film debut. Oscar voting begins Tuesday. Jacques Audiard's 'Emilia Perez' is the lead nominee with 13 nominations, but the Netflix film has seen its chances crater following multiple waves of backlash and controversy. Another Oscar category also found clarity over the weekend. On Saturday at the Annie Awards, DreamWorks Animation's 'The Wild Robot' cleaned up with nine awards including best film. 'The Wild Robot' will be the heavy favorite to win best animated film at the March 2 Academy Awards.	https://www.voanews.com/a/anora-wins-at-producers-and-directors-guild-awards/7968987.html	2025-02-09T16:17:58-08:00	
Super Bowl commercials rely on comedy, nostalgia to avoid potential missteps	Most of the commercials airing during this year’s Super Bowl are going for laughs, with advertisers betting that America could use a little break. As the Philadelphia Eagles and the Kansas City Chiefs hit the field in New Orleans, a parade of silly ads will hit airwaves Sunday. Many companies put their ads online ahead of the game, but some held out to maintain an element of surprise. Humor dominates in the ads released so far. Four old ladies go on a joy ride with WeatherTech, while Eugene Levy's eyebrows fly off and buzz around after he eats some Little Caesars. Sloths have a case of the Mondays in an ad for Coors Light. A man's tongue starts dancing to celebrate cold foam from Nestlé Coffee Mate. British singer Seal becomes an actual seal, sad that he can't hold Mountain Dew with his flippers. Actor Glenn Powell does a take on Goldilocks for Ram Trucks, while comedian Nate Bargatze clones himself and hires an opera singer because he saved so much money using DoorDash. Shaboozey takes a lighthearted stroll through New Orleans for Nerds, while the stars of the 'Fast and Furious' franchise take a slow cruise in a convertible so they can enjoy Häagen-Dazs ice cream bars. Tim Calkins, a professor of marketing at Northwestern University’s Kellogg School of Management, said this was a complicated Super Bowl for advertisers. Most ads were in development during last fall's U.S. presidential election race, so avoiding controversy was even more of a priority than usual, Calkins said. The finalized crop of commercials features a lot of simple humor, nostalgia and few creative risks, he said. But even that approach can backfire. 'That’s the challenge this year. Everybody wants to be safe, but you also want to be interesting,' Calkins said. 'Safe advertising isn’t the advertising you notice or remember.' And advertisers can't afford not to be noticed. Some of the roughly 80 Super Bowl ads spots cost a record $8 million for 30 seconds this year. Here are some of the themes of this year's Super Bowl ads: Heartwarming nostalgia Budweiser brings back its Clydesdales for its Super Bowl ad, including a foal that wants to join the delivery team. Meg Ryan and Billy Crystal reenact their famous scene from 1989's 'When Harry Met Sally,' except this time Sally is expressing her enthusiasm for Hellmann's mayonnaise. The Muppets search for accommodations with Booking.com, while an Instacart ad features a parade of familiar mascots like Mr. Clean, the Jolly Green Giant and the Pillsbury Doughboy. Disney asks what the world would be like without the iconic characters it owns, like Elsa from 'Frozen,' Bart Simpson and the Marvel superheroes. Advertisers are leaning on nostalgia more than they used to in Super Bowl ads, according to Kimberly Whitler, a marketing professor at the University of Virginia’s Darden School of Business. Nods to the past can broaden the appeal of an ad to different generations and connect products to positive cultural moments, she said. Celebrity mashups Putting celebrities together in unexpected combinations can also broaden the appeal of a commercial. In their Super Bowl ad for Michelob Ultra, actors Catherine O'Hara and Willem Dafoe are pickleball champs. Soccer star David Beckham and actor Matt Damon are long-lost twins who bond over Stella Artois. Celebrity chef Gordon Ramsay and comedian Pete Davidson team up for a HexClad commercial, while Post Malone, Shane Gillis and Peyton Manning have a block party with Bud Light. A slew of celebrities, including Matthew McConaughey, Martha Stewart, Greta Gerwig and Charlie XCX, appear in an ad for Uber Eats. Linli Xu, an associate professor of marketing at the University of Minnesota’s Carlson School of Management, said celebrity endorsements can get people talking. But with dozens of brands using them, there's a risk of diminishing returns. Celebrities can also get so much attention that viewers don’t remember which brand they're advertising, Xu said. Serious moments It isn't all fun and games at the Super Bowl this year. Pharmaceutical company Novartis urges women to get early detection for breast cancer. Dove warns that half of girls who quit sports have been criticized for their body type. Hims & Hers, a telehealth company, talks about America's obesity epidemic. For the third Super Bowl in a row, Come Near — a nonprofit that promotes the teachings of Jesus — is running an ad as part of its He Gets Us campaign. The ad, featuring Johnny Cash's cover of 'Personal Jesus,' shows everyday people being helpful and heroic. And the Foundation to Combat Antisemitism, founded by New England Patriots Chairman and CEO Robert Kraft, has a stark ad featuring Snoop Dogg and Tom Brady saying what they hate about each other, in an effort to show how pointless hate is. Xu said she expected more ads promoting that unifying message. But for the most part, advertisers went with humor, she said. 'We just had an election year and there’s a lot of discussion around divisiveness,' she said. 'People might be wanting to see some unity, everybody coming together as a country.' Artificial intelligence arrives Several Super Bowl ads make the case for AI as a helpmate. Chris Pratt, Chris Hemsworth and Kris Jenner team up for an ad wearing Meta 's smart glasses, which use artificial intelligence to answer questions about what wearers are seeing. Actor Walton Goggins pitches GoDaddy Airo, which uses AI to help build websites and social content. And Google's '50 States, 50 Stories' campaign will show viewers a small business from their state that's using Google's Gemini AI assistant. But Cirkul, a water bottle brand, pokes fun at AI, showing comedian Adam Devine accidentally ordering 100,000 bottles using the AI assistant on his phone.	https://www.voanews.com/a/super-bowl-commercials-rely-on-comedy-nostalgia-to-avoid-potential-missteps/7968981.html	2025-02-09T16:01:08-08:00	
Westminster show's canine athletes get their piece of Super Bowl weekend	New York — They're at the top of their sport. They run, weave and go airborne. And they went all out for this weekend's championship. Sorry — no, they're not the Chiefs or the Eagles. They're the agility dogs at the Westminster Kennel Club show, which began Saturday by showcasing agility and other dog sports. Dog folk often call Westminster the Super Bowl of dog shows, and the comparison might be especially fitting this year. The United States' most prestigious canine competition opened on the same weekend as pro football's Super Bowl, which features the Kansas City Chiefs and the Philadelphia Eagles on Sunday. The rare coincidence comes after both competitions' dates shifted in recent years. 'I always said I wanted people to call the Super Bowl 'the Westminster of football,' ' quipped dog expert David Frei, who has a foot in both worlds: He used to work in publicity for the Denver Broncos and the San Francisco 49ers. The Westminster of football? Well, Westminster is 90 years older than the Super Bowl, after all. And there have been some other connections between the gridiron and Westminster's green carpet. Los Angeles Chargers defensive end Morgan Fox co-owns a French bulldog who came within a smushy-nose length of winning at Westminster in 2022 and was a finalist the following year. (Many other NFL players also have dogs for fun, if not for show, including Kansas City quarterback Patrick Mahomes.) Whatever the analogy, being at Westminster was a triumph for Guster the rescue pug. He and owner Steve Martin took up agility after Guster started wagging his tail and tilting his head while they watched the Westminster agility contest on TV several years ago. 'We never thought we'd be here. And now we're here,' Martin, of Austin, Texas, said Saturday. A border collie named Vanish won the contest, which featured about 300 champion-level canines. 'She's very intuitive, very natural — probably smarter than me,' handler Emily Klarman of Doylestown, Pennsylvania, told a Fox interviewer in the ring. While Klarman said the win initially left her speechless, Vanish had plenty to say, barking enthusiastically. A special award for the best mixed-breed competitor went to Gable, handled by Kayla Feeney of Lima, New York. Westminster added agility in 2014, marking the show's first event with mixed-breed dogs since the 1800s. Last year saw the first mixed-breed agility winner, a border collie-papillon mix named Nimble, who competed again this year. She's an intentional blend of two top agility breeds. But the sport also draws rescue dogs such as an Australian cattle dog mix named Sawyer, or Soy Sauce for short. His owner, Dr. Amy Ondeyka, has a complicated work schedule as a New Jersey emergency room doctor and EMS medical director. But she made time for agility after realizing she'd adopted a super-energetic dog who opens cabinets, unzips things and otherwise causes domestic mayhem when bored. 'He's always exciting — he does ridiculous things,' Ondeyka said as he intermittently leaped into her arms during what was ostensibly down time between agility runs. 'We have fun, regardless what happens.' While some dogs do agility to burn off energy, the sport helps others come out of their shell. Tully, a lanky, shaggy, mostly Labradoodle mix, used to be 'afraid of the world' but now is excited to go to agility classes and competitions, owner Carla Rash said. Saturday's competitors were a spectrum of dogdom, from a great Dane to a 7-pound (0.9-kilogramg) papillon, and they included such lesser-known breeds as a large Munsterlander and a Danish-Swedish farmdog. They navigated jumps, tunnels, ramps and other obstacles as handlers gave hand and voice signals. The object is to be the fastest, without making mistakes. Regardless of scores, some dogs won cheers from spectators. There was a bichon frise with its tail dyed blue, a standard poodle that took a leisurely trot across an A-frame ramp, and a curly-coated mix that apparently had second thoughts about the weave poles, circled around and went through them again. Westminster's traditional, breed-by-breed judging happens Monday and Tuesday, capped by the coveted best in show prize Tuesday night. That's for purebreds only, but mixed-breed dogs also were eligible for Saturday's obedience competition, an event that Westminster added in 2016. The top prize went to Willie, an Australian shepherd who also won in 2022 with handler Kathleen Keller of Flemington, New Jersey. Steve Wesler sported a Philadelphia Eagles sweatshirt as he cheered on partner Jennifer Weinik and Cookie, her Belgian Malinois. They came away with a ribbon, which Wesler deemed more exciting than the Super Bowl — because he was confident the Eagles would prevail. There are no cash prizes at Westminster, but the agility and obedience winners each get to direct a $5,000 donation to a training club or the American Kennel Club Humane Fund. The show also featured Westminster's first demonstration of flyball, a canine relay race that involves retrieving a ball. 'It's a lot of organized chaos,' Hillary Brown said after competing with her Boston terrier, Paxil. His teammates on a York, Pennsylvania-based squad called Clean Break were a standard poodle, a border collie and a whippet-border collie mix. 'It's a blast. The dogs love it,' Brown said.	https://www.voanews.com/a/westminster-show-s-canine-athletes-get-their-piece-of-super-bowl-weekend/7968742.html	2025-02-09T15:41:10-08:00	
Aga Khan, leader of Ismaili Muslims, laid to rest in Egypt during private burial	Aswan, Egypt — The Aga Khan IV was laid to rest on Sunday at a private ceremony in Aswan, Egypt. The death of Prince Karim -- the 49th hereditary imam of the Shiite Ismaili Muslims -- was announced Tuesday by the Aga Khan Development Network and the Ismaili religious community. His son, 53-year-old Rahim Al-Hussaini, has been named as the Aga Khan V, the spiritual leader of the world's millions of Ismaili Muslims, according with his father's will. On Saturday, a private funeral service took place at the Ismaili community center in Lisbon attended by Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau, Spain's King Emeritus Juan Carlos and Portugal's President Marcelo Rebelo de Sousa. The Aga Khan is considered by his followers to be a direct descendant of the Prophet Muhammad and is treated as a head of state. The governor of Aswan welcomed Prince Karim's family at the southern Egyptian's provinces airport on Saturday. 'When his will was opened, it was found that he had requested to be buried in Aswan near his grandfather, Sultan Muhammad Shah, and his grandmother, Om Habiba,' said Maj. Gen. Ismail Kamal. Ismaili mourners marched as bells rang during the burial ceremony in the country's southern Aswan province, as Prince Karim's body was taken in a van. They carried his body, draped in a white shroud, and placed it on a yacht on the Nile River. Prince Karim, 88, was given the title of 'His Highness' by Queen Elizabeth in July 1957, two weeks after his grandfather, the Aga Khan III, unexpectedly made him heir to the family's 1,300-year dynasty as leader of the Ismaili Muslim sect. The late Aga Khan evolved over decades into a business magnate and a philanthropist, moving between the spiritual and the worldly with ease. He was a defender of Islamic culture and values, but also widely regarded as a builder of bridges between Muslim societies and the West. The Aga Khan Development Network deals mainly with issues of health care, housing, education and rural economic development. It says it works in over 30 countries and has an annual budget of about $1 billion for nonprofit development activities. Ismailis lived for many generations in Iran, Syria and South Asia before also settling in east Africa, Central Asia and the Middle East, as well as Europe, North America and Australia more recently. They consider it a duty to donate up to 12.5% of their income to the Aga Khan as steward.	https://www.voanews.com/a/aga-khan-leader-of-ismaili-muslims-laid-to-rest-in-egypt-during-private-burial/7968738.html	2025-02-09T15:31:43-08:00	
German chancellor candidates clash on Trump, the far-right and NATO	Berlin — Europe is prepared to respond 'within an hour' if the United States levies tariffs against the European Union, German Chancellor Olaf Scholz said in a pre-election debate with his conservative challenger Friedrich Merz. In the first duel ahead of the Feb. 23 election, Merz portrayed Scholz as a ditherer who had led Germany into economic crisis, while the Social Democrat presented himself as an experienced leader in command of the details. Asked if the EU was ready with a targeted response if the U.S. imposed tariffs, Scholz, well behind Merz in the polls, said, 'Yes ... We as the European Union can act within an hour.' U.S. President Donald Trump has repeatedly threatened to enact tariffs against the United States' largest trading partners, accusing them of free-riding on American prosperity. Trade policy is an EU competence, run by the European Commission in Brussels. Trump and the far-right Alternative for Germany, endorsed by his confidante Elon Musk, overshadowed the debate. Merz, far ahead in the polls and the favorite to become Germany's next chancellor, expressed reluctance to raise taxes or borrow to reach the NATO alliance's defense spending target of 2% of gross domestic product, far short of the 5% Trump is demanding. When Scholz said that would not be enough, Merz signaled his openness to discuss scrapping Germany's totemic spending cap — despite a manifesto pledge to keep the constitutional debt braked. The two clashed over the AfD, with Scholz warning that Merz could not be trusted not to govern with the party. Merz ruled that out, blaming what he called Scholz's 'left-wing' policies for fueling the far-right party's rise to second in the polls.	https://www.voanews.com/a/german-chancellor-candidates-clash-on-trump-the-far-right-and-nato/7968734.html	2025-02-09T15:20:31-08:00	
Trump to announce 25% steel, aluminum tariffs in latest trade escalation	ABOARD AIR FORCE ONE — U.S. President Donald Trump said Sunday that he will announce on Monday new 25% tariffs on all steel and aluminum imports into the U.S., which would come on top of existing metals duties in another major escalation of his trade policy overhaul. Trump, speaking to reporters on Air Force One, also said he will announce reciprocal tariffs Tuesday or Wednesday, to take effect almost immediately. Trump, during his first term, imposed tariffs of 25% on steel and 10% on aluminum, but later granted several trading partners duty-free quotas, including Canada, Mexico and Brazil. Former President Joe Biden extended these quotas to Britain, Japan and the European Union, and U.S. steel mill capacity utilization has dropped in recent years. White House spokesperson Karoline Leavitt said that the new tariffs would come on top of the existing duties on steel and aluminum. Trump on Friday announced that he would impose reciprocal tariffs — raising U.S. tariff rates to match those of trading partners — on many countries this week. He did not identify the countries, but the duties would be imposed 'so that we're treated evenly with other countries.'	https://www.voanews.com/a/trump-to-announce-steel-aluminum-tariffs-in-latest-trade-escalation/7968731.html	2025-02-09T15:12:44-08:00	
49 migrant bodies found in 2 mass graves in southeastern Libya	Cairo — Libyan authorities have uncovered nearly 50 bodies from two mass graves in the country’s southeastern desert, officials said Sunday, in the latest tragedy involving people seeking to reach Europe through the chaos-stricken North African country. The first mass grave with 19 bodies was found Friday in a farm in the southeastern city of Kufra, the security directorate said in a statement, adding that authorities took them for autopsy. Authorities posted images on its Facebook page showing police officers and medics digging in the sand and recovering dead bodies that were wrapped in blankets. The al-Abreen charity, which helps migrants in eastern and southern Libya, said that some were apparently shot and killed before being buried. A separate mass grave, with at least 30 bodies, was also found in Kufra after raiding a human trafficking center, according to Mohamed al-Fadeil, head of the security chamber in Kufra. Survivors said nearly 70 people were buried in the grave, he added. Authorities were still searching the area. Later Sunday, authorities said they freed 76 migrants from the trafficking center and arrested three people — a Libyan and two foreigners — on suspicion of detaining and torturing migrants. Prosecutors ordered the suspects to remain in detention pending investigation. Migrants’ mass graves are not uncommon in Libya. Last year, authorities unearthed the bodies of at least 65 migrants in the Shuayrif region, 350 kilometers (220 miles) south of the capital, Tripoli. Libya is the dominant transit point for migrants from Africa and the Middle East trying to make it to Europe. The country was plunged into chaos following a NATO-backed uprising that toppled and killed longtime autocrat Muammar Gadhafi in 2011. Oil-rich Libya has been ruled for most of the past decade by rival governments in eastern and western Libya, each backed by an array of militias and foreign governments. Human traffickers have benefited from more than a decade of instability, smuggling migrants across the country’s borders with six nations, including Chad, Niger, Sudan Egypt, Algeria and Tunisia. Once at the coast, traffickers pack desperate migrants seeking a better life in Europe into ill-equipped rubber boats and other vessels for risky voyages on the perilous Central Mediterranean Sea route. Rights groups and U.N. agencies have for years documented systematic abuse of migrants in Libya including forced labor, beatings, rapes and torture. The abuse often accompanies efforts to extort money from families before migrants are allowed to leave Libya on traffickers’ boats. Those who have been intercepted and returned to Libya — including women and children — are held in government-run detention centers where they also suffer from abuse, including torture, rape and extortion, according to rights groups and U.N. experts.	https://www.voanews.com/a/migrant-bodies-found-in-2-mass-graves-in-southeastern-libya/7968727.html	2025-02-09T15:02:00-08:00	
Chiefs chase Super Bowl 'three-peat' as Trump attends NFL showpiece	New Orleans, Louisiana — The Kansas City Chiefs aim for a historic hat-trick of Super Bowl titles on Sunday when they take on the Philadelphia Eagles in front of a star-studded crowd in New Orleans headed by U.S. President Donald Trump. Trump will become the first sitting president ever to attend the NFL showpiece when he takes his seat among a sell-out crowd of around 74,000 fans at the Superdome for the biggest annual event in the American sporting calendar, which kicks off at 5:30pm local time (2330 GMT). Pop superstar Taylor Swift will also be in the VIP seats to watch as her boyfriend Travis Kelce and his fellow Chiefs bid to become the first team in history to lift three consecutive Vince Lombardi Trophies. Trump's presence at the NFL showpiece will mean even tighter security than normal around an event which was already bolstered by a heavy police presence following a New Year's Day attack which left 14 people dead and many more injured on the Big Easy's famous Bourbon Street. Trump has had a strained relationship with the NFL stretching back several decades, and triggered uproar during his first time in 2017 when he attacked the patriotism of players who kneeled during the playing of the U.S. national anthem in a protest against racial injustice. Speaking in a pre-game interview aired on Fox News, Trump said his decision to attend this year's Super Bowl was for the good of the country. 'I thought it would be a good thing for the country to have the President be at the game,' Trump told Fox. 'It's an iconic day. It's going to be a great game, two great teams, and let's see what happens,' Trump added, revealing that he was tipping Kansas City for victory, citing the record of Chiefs quarterback Patrick Mahomes, who is eyeing his fourth Super Bowl win. 'When a quarterback wins as much as he's won, I have to go with Kansas City,' Trump said. 'I have to go with Kansas City.' Trump was due to fly into New Orleans from Florida, where he reportedly played a round of golf with Tiger Woods earlier Sunday. A schedule released by the White House said he is expected to leave the Superdome at around 8.05pm local time, well before the game reaches its conclusion. Super Bowl fans on Sunday welcomed Trump's attendance at the game. 'I think it is awesome, congratulations to him for being the first President to make it,' Bob Benderovich, a Philadelphia Eagles fan from Fort Myers, Florida, told AFP. Chiefs favorites As always, the Super Bowl crosses over into popular culture and the half-time show this year will feature hip-hop artist Kendrick Lamar, who had a clean sweep at last Sunday's Grammys, winning in all five categories for which he received nominations. Bookmakers and casinos meanwhile are taking odds on whether Chiefs star Kelce will propose to pop icon Swift after what might be his final game in the NFL. For the more serious punters, the oddsmakers have the Chiefs as slight favorite for the game, a rematch of the Super Bowl from two years ago which the Chiefs won by three points. They defended their title last year, beating the San Francisco 49ers in Las Vegas and putting them one win away from an unprecedented 'three-peat.' The 29-year-old Mahomes will become one of just four quarterbacks in National Football League history to have won more than three Super Bowls should he triumph again, having first led the Chiefs to Super Bowl glory in 2020. But the Eagles have added serious offensive firepower since their defeat two years ago with mobile quarterback Jalen Hurts joined by the game-changing speed and power of running back Saquon Barkley. The Chiefs put the finishing touches to their game preparations Saturday with a 30-minute walkthrough of a mock game. Chiefs coach Andy Reid saluted his team's attitude to training over the whole week since arriving in Louisiana. 'I thought the guys worked hard, they got done what they needed to get done,' Reid said. The Eagles had a similarly relaxed final session before going to the Superdome on Saturday for a team photo. Head coach Nick Sirianni said his Eagles were 'hungry' and 'ready to roll.' 'We're ready for the challenge against a really good team,' Sirianni said.	https://www.voanews.com/a/chiefs-chase-super-bowl-three-peat-as-trump-attends-nfl-showpiece/7968725.html	2025-02-09T14:40:55-08:00	
Trump official orders consumer protection agency to stop work	Washington — The Trump administration has ordered the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau to stop nearly all its work, effectively shutting down an agency that was created to protect consumers after the 2008 financial crisis and subprime mortgage-lending scandal. Russell Vought, the newly installed director of the Office of Management and Budget, directed the CFPB, in a Saturday night email confirmed by The Associated Press, to stop work on proposed rules, to suspend the effective dates on any rules that were finalized but not yet effective, and to stop investigative work and not begin any new investigations. The agency has been a target of conservatives since President Barack Obama pushed to include it in the 2010 financial reform legislation that followed the 2007-2008 financial crisis. The email also ordered the bureau to 'cease all supervision and examination activity.' Since the CFPB is a creation of Congress, it would require a separate act of Congress to formally eliminate it. But the head of the agency has discretion over what enforcement actions to take, if any. Yet Elon Musk commented, 'CFPB RIP' on social media site X on Friday. And the CFPB homepage on the Internet was down Sunday, replaced by a message reading 'page not found.' Also late Saturday, Vought said in a social media post that the CFPB would not withdraw its next round of funding from the Federal Reserve, adding that its current reserves of $711.6 million are 'excessive.' Congress directed the bureau to be funded by the Fed to insulate it from political pressures. 'This spigot, long contributing to CFPB’s unaccountability, is now being turned off,' Vought said on X. The CFPB says that it has obtained nearly $20 billion in financial relief for U.S. consumers since its founding in the form of canceled debts, compensation, and reduced loans. Last month, the bureau sued Capital One for allegedly misleading consumers about its offerings for high-interest savings accounts — and 'cheating' customers out of more than $2 billion in lost interest payments as a result. Dennis Kelleher, president of Better Markets, an advocacy group, said, 'that's why Wall Street’s biggest banks and Trump’s billionaire allies hate the bureau: it’s an effective cop on the finance beat and has stood side-by-side with hundreds of millions of Americans — Republicans and Democrats — battling financial predators, scammers, and crooks.' The administration's move against the CFPB also highlights the tensions between Trump's more populist promises to lower costs for working-class families and his pledge to reduce government regulation. During the campaign, Trump said he would cap credit card interest rates at 10%, after they had soared to record levels above 20%, on average, as the Federal Reserve lifted interest rates in 2022 and 2023. The CFPB had started work on how that proposal would be implemented. The bureau can still take complaints, but it can’t conduct exams or pursue existing investigations, according to a person familiar with the agency who insisted on anonymity to discuss CFPB business. The memo is also interpreted as blocking it from communicating with companies it regulates, consumer advocates or other outside groups. Musk’s team would also have access to complaints, investigations and regulatory oversight data. The access raises uncomfortable questions if Musk’s company X launches a payments system as the CFPB has data on competitors such as Cash App, the person said. Vought's email follows a similar directive from Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent Feb. 3 and is the latest move by the Trump administration to rapidly curtail the work of federal agencies that they have deemed excessive. Obama spearheaded the creation of the bureau in the wake of the 2007-2008 housing bubble and financial crisis, which was caused in part by fraudulent mortgage lending. It was the brainchild of Massachusetts Democratic Sen. Elizabeth Warren and has attracted lawsuits from large banks and financial industry trade associations. 'Vought is giving big banks and giant corporations the green light to scam families,' Warren said. Last week, Warren called on Trump to work with the bureau to protect Americans from de-banking, the practice of banks shutting down customer accounts because they believe they pose financial, legal or reputational risks to the banks. Vought's email said that President Donald Trump had made him acting director of the CFPB on Friday. Trump fired the previous director of the bureau, Rohit Chopra, on Feb. 1. Vought was an architect of Project 2025, a policy blueprint for the Trump White House that Trump tried to disavow during last year's campaign. Under Chopra, the CFPB approved rules to cap overdraft fees by banks, limit junk fees, and has proposed restrictions on data brokers selling personal information such as Social Security numbers.	https://www.voanews.com/a/trump-official-orders-consumer-protection-agency-to-stop-work/7968717.html	2025-02-09T13:51:53-08:00

White House defends efforts to shut down foreign aid agency	White House national security adviser Michael Waltz on Sunday defended President Donald Trump’s plan to shut down the country’s chief foreign aid agency, contending that 'all too often' it was not aligned with U.S. strategic interests and wastes money. Waltz told NBC’s 'Meet the Press' that the U.S. Agency for International Development programs, often food and humanitarian assistance across the world, 'are not in line with strategic U.S. interests like pushing back on China. They're doing all kinds of other things that frankly, aren't in line with strategic interests or the president's vision.' Moreover, he said, 'Often, all too often, only cents on the dollar actually makes it to people in need, between the big contractors, the subcontractors, the local contractors, the dollars aren't being used … wisely. We need to take a hard look at it. We need to move quickly, and that's exactly what's being done.'.' Trump this past week ordered the 10,000-worker agency shut down with fewer than 300 of them expected to eventually be retained as the agency’s programs are either shifted to State Department control or terminated. A federal judge in Washington on Friday ordered a temporary halt to plans to pull thousands of USAID staffers off the job. On the same day, workers pried the name of the agency letter by letter off the entryway of its headquarters in Washington. Democrats in Congress have been critical of the changes regarding USAID, with some pledging to stall Trump’s Cabinet nominees and leverage their votes on a new government spending bill, in protest. The effort to shut down USAID was the most visible result of Trump dispatching billionaire Elon Musk and his aides to review programs and the legitimacy of spending at dozens of federal government agencies. Trump offered virtually all the government’s 2.3 million civilian workers a chance to resign and continue to get paid through Sept. 30 without working, but a federal judge paused the offer until he holds a new hearing Monday afternoon on its legality. The White House said 65,000 workers, 2.8% of the government’s civilian workforce, accepted the offer to quit and be paid not to work, far fewer than the 5- to 10% figure Musk and his cost cutters were hoping for. Trump said all government agencies would be subject to financial reviews, including one of the biggest targets, the Defense Department, where Musk has billions of dollars of contracts. Waltz said a review of Pentagon spending was especially necessary. 'Everything there seems to cost too much, take too long and deliver too little to the soldiers… we do need great minds, and we do need business leaders to go in there and absolutely reform the Pentagon's acquisition process,' he said. Waltz, a former congressman from the southern state of Florida, said, 'I, as a member of the House Armed Services Committee, held up a bag of bolts that would cost 100 bucks … in a hardware store, that cost $90,000 to the United States Air Force and the American people have said enough, enough with the bloat and the waste….' 'For our barracks and our soldiers, we need all the efficiency we can get in the Pentagon, and I think the American people and the soldiers will welcome' a spending review, he said.' On another matter, Waltz said 'sensitive conversations' are occurring on how to end Russia’s nearly three-year war on Ukraine. 'We will have our secretary of state, our secretary of defense, our vice president, our special envoy in Europe this week talking through the details of how to end this war,' Waltz said. 'And that means getting both sides (to) the table.' Waltz said the discussions would include future U.S. aid to Ukraine, possibly in exchange for Kyiv supplying the U.S. with its rare earth minerals — necessary for the manufacture of high-tech goods. 'Those conversations are going to happen this week. And I think an underlying principle here is that the Europeans have to own this conflict going forward,' Waltz said. 'President Trump is going to end it. And then in terms of security guarantees, that is squarely going to be with the Europeans.'	https://www.voanews.com/a/white-house-defends-efforts-to-shut-down-foreign-aid-agency/7968670.html	2025-02-09T11:51:57-08:00	
‘Dog Man’ bests ‘Heart Eyes,’ ‘Love Hurts’ at box office	New York — On a quiet winter weekend at the box office, DreamWorks Animation’s 'Dog Man' chased its own tail, repeating as the top movie in theaters. The animated Universal Pictures release, adapted from Dav Pilkey’s popular graphic novel series, collected $13.7 million in ticket sales, according to studio estimates Sunday. Both new releases — the Ke Huy Quan action movie 'Love Hurts' and the Valentine’s Day-themed slasher 'Heart Eyes'— were left nipping at the heels of 'Dog Man.' Hollywood often largely punts Super Bowl weekend to the small screen. Last year, Apple’s much-derided 'Argylle' debuted on the same weekend. Instead, the movie industry spends more energy pitching its blockbusters in trailers for the huge football audience on TV. It wasn’t a banner weekend for 'Dog Man.' It fell steeply, dropping 62% in it second weekend. But with a production budget of $40 million, 'Dog Man' has already tallied $54.1 million domestically in two weeks. Coming in second was Spyglass Media Group’s 'Heart Eyes,' released by Sony. The horror-rom-com mashup earned $8.5 million from 3,102 locations. Reviews have been good for the film, directed by Josh Ruben and starring Oliva Holt and Mason Gooding, though audiences were less impressed. Moviegoers gave it a 'B-' CinemaScore. Spyglass made 'Heart Eyes' for $18 million. 'Love Hurts,' the action comedy from 87North Productions ('John Wick,' 'The Fall Guy'), debuted with a paltry $5.8 million in 3,055 theaters. In his first big movie role since his Oscar-winning comeback in 'Everything All at Once,' Ke Huy Quan stars as a mild-mannered realtor with a hitman past. Ariana DeBose co-stars. It, too, was modestly budgeted at $18 million. Audiences, however, mostly rejected the movie, giving 'Love Hurts' a 'C+' CinemaScore. Next weekend should bring Hollywood its biggest box-office weekend of the year with the release of Marvel’s 'Captain America: Brave New World' and Sony’s 'Paddington in Peru.' Final domestic figures will be released Monday. Estimated ticket sales for Friday through Sunday at U.S. and Canadian theaters, according to Comscore: 1. 'Dog Man,' $13.7 million. 2.

Soaring egg prices in US pique interest in backyard chickens	NEW YORK — Thinking about backyard chickens as egg prices soar? Think hard, especially in light of the bird flu outbreak. Keeping home chickens as a pastime has continued to grow since the pandemic. But if eggs are the goal, remember that it takes planning and investment to raise the chickens and protect against bird flu. Costs might go well beyond the nationwide average of $4.15 a dozen that commercial eggs sold for in December. 'Anyone who's done an ounce of research will very quickly understand that there are no free eggs, there are no inexpensive eggs in keeping chickens,' said Kathy Shea Mormino, a home chicken blogger and author who has about 50 of the birds at her Suffield, Connecticut, home. 'You're going to pay more, particularly in your first several years, in your setup and in your birds. And there's a huge learning curve on how to care for animals that are really unusual pets,' said Mormino, who has kept chickens for 15 years and calls herself the Chicken Chick. Costs vary wildly, from about $200 to $2,000 for a coop alone. Feeders and waterers range from about $8 to $50 or more, depending on the size and type. Bird flu has forced farmers to slaughter millions of chickens a month, contributing (along with inflation) to the steep price of commercial eggs and resulting in some scantily stocked stores around the country. The scarcity and high prices are causing some to look for a backyard alternative. 'We've seen a real uptick in calls recently from people wanting to start their own backyard flocks. With the egg shortages at grocery stores, many are excited about the idea of raising chickens and taking steps toward sustainability,' said Matthew Aversa, a co-owner of Winding Branch Ranch, a nonprofit sanctuary and farm animal rescue outside San Antonio. 'We adopt out whole flocks. We're receiving at least a dozen inquiries per week,' he said. Kate Perz, the animal science coordinator for Cornell Cooperative Extension of Suffolk County, New York, said that unlike other pandemic pastimes, raising home chickens has only grown. 'It's not always cost-effective,' she said. 'You have to really look at how many eggs you're eating and what the cost of those are versus what you would be spending.' There are other reasons, of course, to keep chickens at home, not the least of which is the sheer joy of their presence. Mormino and other 'chickeneers,' as she calls home enthusiasts, have a coop full of tips on how to get started. Tend to legal matters You may be ready to dive right in. Your town may not. Mormino, who wrote The Chicken Chick's Guide to Backyard Chickens, said the first thing to consider is whether chickens are right for you. After that, don't assume your county, town or city will allow it. Look up zoning and building codes yourself if you feel capable. Otherwise, consult an attorney who specializes in municipal law in your area. Don't rely on word of mouth or even a town worker to know the ins and outs. Is a building permit required to build a coop? Are roosters banned under noise ordinances? Sometimes, zoning codes are silent on the subject. Don't assume that's a green light. Many codes are 'permissive use' regulations, Mormino said, essentially meaning that if the code doesn't say you're permitted, you're not! If chicken-keeping is allowed, is there a limit on how many birds? Are there restrictions on where a coop can be built in relation to neighboring property lines. Most homeowners associations have rules on animal keeping. Mormino lives in a farming town and had a neighbor who kept three horses and a small flock of chickens, so she assumed they were legal. They weren't. She called the town clerk's office to ask whether a building permit was required to build a coop and was told it wasn't. It was. In the end, she successfully defended a lawsuit against her (she's an attorney) and prevailed in a long battle to amend the law, legalizing backyard chickens in her town. What about bird flu? Bird flu is highly contagious. It spreads mostly by migrating waterfowl in their droppings. Chickens are far from immune if they spend any time free ranging or in a run without protection from wild fowl droppings. 'There's a limited number of things that we can do because our birds live where wildlife live,' Mormino said. 'People need to know if they have a bird or birds that die suddenly from some of the symptoms, they need to contact the USDA to get the postmortem exam and the birds tested for bird flu.' Don't bring sick birds into the house for care. That raises the risk of transmission to humans. Once the virus is confirmed, the entire flock needs to be euthanized, she and Perz said. Symptoms of bird flu include: sudden death without any clinical signs; swelling of the head, eyelids, comb, wattles or hocks; diarrhea; stumbling or falling down; decreased egg production and/or soft-shelled or misshapen eggs; and coughing and sneezing. Don't feed any wildlife in areas where your chickens dwell or roam. Wash hands thoroughly after tending to chickens and dedicate a pair of shoes or boots strictly for use around them. 'The biggest mistake backyard chickeneers make is to bring new chickens into their flock that have lived someplace else. That's the fastest way to bring disease into your chicken yard,' Mormino said. Consider your costs Sarah Penny has turned her 7,000-square-foot home lot in Knoxville, Tennessee, into a beautiful garden and chicken home. She has nine birds and grows more than half the food she and her 13-year-old son eat. She's had chickens since 2021 and estimates her startup costs at about $2,500. Monthly costs vary based on what chickens are fed and how coops are kept. Penny, for instance, uses the deep litter method and composts from her coop, meaning she's not mucking out her coop more than twice a year. 'But the cost of starting with backyard chickens is definitely quite expensive. I don't know if a lot of people know that,' Penny said. Her coop alone, which her family built themselves, cost about $2,000. It had to be outfitted to keep predators out, including rats that tunnel under the ground. Many people start with buying hatchlings, which just got more expensive to ship via the U.S. Postal Service due to new fees. Raising hatchlings requires a chick brooder involving a separate enclosure, heat lamp, feeders and other supplies. Penny buys a bag of feed every two weeks for $15 to $20 a bag. There's also the cost of calcium, such as oyster shells, and grit to aid digestion if chickens are not free-ranging or getting those elements in their feed. She estimates her monthly costs at about $60, saving a bit by also feeding her chickens healthy human leftovers. She's careful not to include foods that are toxic for chickens, including onions, potatoes and avocados. It's all worth it to Penny. 'We eat a lot of eggs,' she said. 'We probably go through a dozen every two days. We bake a lot. We're an ingredient household, so the majority of our food is cooked from scratch. Eggs are a main staple for our breakfast.'	https://www.voanews.com/a/soaring-egg-prices-in-us-pique-interest-in-backyard-chickens/7966140.html	2025-02-09T10:55:51-08:00	
Military: Sudan to form new government after regaining Khartoum	Dubai — The formation of a new Sudanese government is expected to happen after the recapture of Khartoum is completed, military sources told Reuters on Sunday, a day after army head Abdel Fattah al-Burhan said he would form a technocratic wartime government. The Sudanese army, long on the backfoot in its war with the paramilitary Rapid Support Forces (RSF), has in recent weeks regained ground in the capital Khartoum along several axes, closing in on the symbolic presidential palace along the Nile. The RSF, which has said it would support the formation of a rival civilian administration, has retreated, overpowered by the army's expanded air capacities and ground ranks swollen by allied militias. 'We can call it a caretaker government, a wartime government, it's a government that will help us complete what remains of our military objectives, which is freeing Sudan from these rebels,' Burhan told a meeting of army-aligned politicians in the army's stronghold of Port Sudan on Saturday. The RSF controls most of the west of the country — and is engaged in an intense campaign to cement its control of the Darfur region by seizing the city of al-Fashir. Burhan ruled out a Ramadan ceasefire unless the RSF stopped that campaign. The war erupted in April 2023 over disputes about the integration of the two forces after they worked together to oust civilians with whom they had shared power after the uprising that ousted autocrat Omar al-Bashir. The conflict has created one of the world's largest humanitarian crises with the displacement of more than 12 million people and half the population facing hunger. Burhan said there would be changes to the country's interim constitution, which the military sources said would remove all references to partnership with civilians or the RSF, placing authority solely with the army which would appoint a technocratic prime minister who would then appoint a Cabinet. Burhan called on members of the civilian Taqadum coalition to renounce the RSF, saying they would be welcomed back if they did so.	https://www.voanews.com/a/military-sudan-to-form-new-government-after-regaining-khartoum-/7968633.html	2025-02-09T10:34:40-08:00	
Pope reminds armed forces to act for defense, respect international laws	VATICAN CITY — Pope Francis on Sunday told soldiers, police and other law enforcement officials from around the world that armed force can only be used for legitimate defense and must always respect international law. The pontiff reappeared in public for the first time since he was diagnosed with bronchitis Thursday to celebrate an outdoor Jubilee Mass for the armed forces, police and security personnel. However, after a few words, he handed off his homily to an aide to read, saying he was having difficulty with his breath. 'I would like to recall the teaching of the Church in this regard: The Second Vatican Council says that those who exercise their profession in the ranks of the army in the service of their homeland should consider themselves as servants of the security and freedom of their people,' Francis said in his final prayer. 'This armed service must be exercised only for legitimate defense, never to impose dominion over other nations, and always observing international conventions regarding conflicts,' he added. The pontiff launched a new appeal for peace, citing conflicts around the world, including Ukraine, the Middle East, Myanmar and Sudan. 'Let the weapons be silenced everywhere and let the cry of the people asking for peace be heard,' Francis said. Since being diagnosed with bronchitis Thursday, the pope had continued his activities and audiences indoors at Casa Santa Marta, the Vatican residence where he lives, until Sunday. Francis has long battled health problems including long bouts of bronchitis. He uses a walker or cane when moving around his apartment and recently fell twice, hurting his arm and chin. Speculation about the pope's health is a constant in Vatican circles, especially after Pope Benedict XVI broke 600 years of tradition and resigned from the papacy in 2013. Francis has said that he has no plans to resign anytime soon, even if Benedict 'opened the door' to the possibility. In his autobiography 'Hope' released this month, Francis said that he hadn’t considered resigning even when he had major intestinal surgery.	https://www.voanews.com/a/pope-reminds-armed-forces-to-act-for-defense-respect-international-laws-/7968594.html	2025-02-09T09:11:25-08:00	
Israel withdraws from corridor splitting Gaza as tenuous ceasefire holds	A new benchmark was reached Sunday in the tenuous Israel-Hamas ceasefire in Gaza, with Israeli troops withdrawing from the Netzarim corridor, a narrow strip of land that bisects the territory. It allowed more Palestinians to return to the northern sector where they once lived, but much of the land has been leveled by 15 months of fighting. Cars heaped with belongings, including water tanks and suitcases, were seen heading north through a road that crosses the six-kilometer Netzarim. Under the truce, Israel was required to allow the cars to cross through uninspected, and there did not appear to be troops in the vicinity of the road. Hamas spokesperson Abdel Latif Al-Qanoua said the withdrawal showed Hamas had 'forced the enemy to submit to our demands' and that it thwarted Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin 'Netanyahu's illusion of achieving total victory.' Israeli officials did not disclose how many soldiers withdrew or to where. Troops currently remain along Gaza's borders with Israel and Egypt and a full withdrawal is expected to be negotiated in a later stage of the initial 42-day ceasefire that extends into early March. But almost no progress has been made in negotiating an extension of the truce, which is supposed to lead to the release of more hostages held by Hamas and Palestinian prisoners jailed in Israel. Netanyahu was sending a delegation to Qatar, a key mediator in talks between the sides, but the mission included low-level officials. The Israeli leader is also expected to convene a meeting of key Cabinet ministers this week to discuss the second phase of the ceasefire, the extension of which is not guaranteed. Separately on Sunday, the Palestinian health ministry said that two women in their 20s, including one who was eight months’ pregnant, were fatally shot by Israeli gunfire in the northern occupied West Bank, where Israeli troops have been carrying out a broad operation against militants. During the first six-week phase of the ceasefire, Hamas is gradually releasing 33 Israeli hostages captured during its Oct. 7, 2023, attack on Israel in exchange for a pause in fighting, freedom for hundreds of Palestinian prisoners and a flood of humanitarian aid into Gaza. The deal also stipulated that Israeli troops would pull back from populated areas of Gaza as well as the Netzarim corridor. In the second phase, all remaining living hostages would be released in return for a complete Israeli withdrawal from Gaza and a 'sustainable calm.' But details are unclear and yet to be negotiated. The ceasefire pact was thrown into further turmoil this past week when U.S. President Donald Trump, standing by Netanyahu at a White House news conference, called for U.S. ownership of Gaza at the end of the war and later declared that Israel would hand over the territory along the Mediterranean Sea. Hamas, Arab nations and U.S. allies and adversaries alike condemned the proposal although Netanyahu applauded it as a potential game-changing breakthrough leading to Middle East peace. But Netanyahu is under heavy pressure from his far-right political allies to resume the war after the first phase so that Hamas, which carried out the deadliest attack on Israelis in their history, can be defeated. He is also facing pressure from Israelis who are eager to see more hostages return home and want the truce to continue, especially after the gaunt appearances of the three male captives freed Saturday stunned the nation. The war in Gaza was triggered by the shock October 2023 Hamas terror attack on Israel that killed 1,200 people and led to the capture of 250 hostages. Israel’s counteroffensive killed more than 47,000 Palestinians, more than half of them women and children, according to local health authorities. Israel says the death toll includes 17,000 militants it has killed. Hamas, a U.S. designated terror group, freed three more Israeli hostages Saturday and Israel responded with the release of 183 Palestinian prisoners in the latest exchange of hostages for prisoners. It was the fifth exchange since the ceasefire took effect last month. Some information for this report came from The Associated Press, Agence France-Presse and Reuters.	https://www.voanews.com/a/israel-withdraws-from-corridor-splitting-gaza-as-tenuous-ceasefire-holds/7968576.html	2025-02-09T08:46:40-08:00	
Rescuers recover 1 body and search for 28 people in a landslide in southwest China	Beijing — Emergency teams in China's southwestern Sichuan province raced against time Sunday to locate 28 people after a landslide triggered by rains killed one person and buried homes. Nearly 1,000 personnel were deployed following the landslide in the village of Jinping in Junlian county on Saturday. Some officers navigated through the remains of collapsed buildings, using drones and life-detection radars to locate any signs of life with the help of locals who were familiar with the area, state broadcaster CCTV said. Two injured people were rescued and about 360 others evacuated after 10 houses and a manufacturing building were buried, CCTV reported. At a news conference Sunday, authorities said preliminary assessments attributed the disaster to heavy rainfall and local geological conditions. They said these factors transformed a landslide into a debris flow about 1.2 kilometers (more than half a mile) long, with a total volume exceeding 100,000 cubic meters (3.5 million cubic feet). The rescue operation was hampered by continuous rainfall and more landslides. According to preliminary estimates, the collapsed area was about 16 football pitches in size and many houses were carried far by the debris flow. Chinese Vice Premier Liu Guozhong was at the site to guide the operation and visited the affected residents, according to official news agency Xinhua. Liu also noted the surrounding slopes still pose collapse risks, calling for scientific assessment to ensure the safety of the operation and prevent another disaster, Xinhua said. China has allocated about $11 million to support disaster relief and recovery efforts. Landslides, often caused by rain or unsafe construction work, are not uncommon in China. Last year, a landslide in a remote, mountainous part of China's southwestern province of Yunnan killed dozens of people.	https://www.voanews.com/a/rescuers-recover-1-body-and-search-for-28-people-in-a-landslide-in-southwest-china/7968534.html	2025-02-09T07:52:12-08:00	
31 suspected Maoist rebels, 2 police officers killed in forest combat in central India	PATNA, India — At least 31 suspected Maoist rebels and two police officials were killed on Sunday in the deadliest combat so far this year in central India, police said. Hundreds of police and paramilitary soldiers launched an operation in the forests of the Indravati area of Chhattisgarh state based on intelligence that large number of rebels had gathered there, said state police Inspector General Pattilingam Sundarraj. Sundarraj said as the troops conducted a search operation fighting erupted in the forest, killing at least 31 insurgents and two police officials. Two other police were injured . He said search operations were continuing in the area and the troops had recovered some arms and ammunition, including automatic rifles. There was no immediate statement from the rebels. Sunday's fighting is the biggest so far this year and the second major clash in less than a month in Chhattisgarh, according to police officer Jitendra Yadav. At least 16 rebels were killed in the state's Gariband district on Jan. 23. According to Indian officials, the government had issued a bounty for 12 of them totaling about $345,000. Eight rebels were killed in a gunbattle with troops in the Bijapur district on Jan. 31. Indian soldiers have been battling the Maoist rebels across several central and northern states since 1967, when the militants, also known as Naxalites, began fighting to demand more jobs, land and wealth from natural resources for the country's poor indigenous communities. The insurgents are inspired by Chinese revolutionary leader Mao Zedong. Years of neglect have isolated many locals, who face a lack of jobs, schools and health care clinics, making them open to overtures by the rebels. The rebels speak the same tribal languages as many villagers and have promised to fight for a better future especially in Chhattisgarh, one of India's poorest states despite its vast mineral riches. The rebels have ambushed police, destroyed government offices and abducted officials. They've also blown up train tracks, attacked prisons to free their comrades and stolen weapons from police and paramilitary warehouses to arm themselves.	https://www.voanews.com/a/suspected-maoist-rebels-and-2-police-officers-killed-in-forest-combat-in-central-india-/7968437.html	2025-02-09T05:20:37-08:00	
Polls open in Ecuador with conservative incumbent and leftist lawyer leading presidential race	GUAYAQUIL, Ecuador — Ecuador's presidential election Sunday is shaping up to be a repeat of the 2023 race, when voters chose a conservative young millionaire over the leftist protégé of the country's most influential president this century. President Daniel Noboa and Luis González are the clear front-runners among the pool of 16 candidates. All promised voters to reduce the widespread crime that pushed their lives into an unnerving new normal four years ago. The spike in violence across the South American country is tied to the trafficking of cocaine produced in neighboring Colombia and Peru. So many voters have become crime victims that their personal and collective losses will be a determining factor in deciding whether a third president in four years can turn Ecuador around or if Noboa deserves more time in office. Voting is mandatory in Ecuador. More than 13.7 million people are eligible to vote. On Thursday, thousands of inmates who await sentencing cast ballots at voting centers set up in more than 40 prisons. To win outright, a candidate needs 50% of the vote or at least 40% with a 10-point lead over the closest opponent. If needed, a runoff election would take place on April 13. Noboa defeated González in the October 2023 runoff of a snap election triggered by the decision of then-President Guillermo Lasso to dissolve the National Assembly and shorten his own mandate as a result. Noboa and González, a mentee of former President Rafael Correa, had only served short stints as lawmakers before launching their 2023 presidential campaigns. Noboa, 37, is an heir to a fortune built on the banana trade. His political career began in 2021, when he won a seat in the National Assembly and chaired its Economic Development Commission. He opened an event organizing company when he was 18 and then joined his father's Noboa Corp., where he held management positions in the shipping, logistics and commercial areas. Under his presidency, the homicide rate dropped from 8,237, or 46.18 per 100,000 people, in 2023 to 6,964, or 38.76 per 100,000 people, last year. Still, it remained far higher than the 1,188 homicides, or 6.85 per 100,000 people, in 2019. González, 47, held various government jobs during the presidency of Correa, who led Ecuador from 2007 through 2017 with free-spending socially conservative policies and grew increasingly authoritarian in his last years as president. He was sentenced to prison in absentia in 2020 in a corruption scandal. González was a lawmaker from 2021 until May 2023, when Lasso dissolved the National Assembly. She was unknown to most voters until Correa's party picked her as its presidential candidate for the snap election.	https://www.voanews.com/a/polls-open-in-ecuador-with-conservative-incumbent-and-leftist-lawyer-leading-presidential-race-/7968425.html	2025-02-09T05:10:41-08:00	
Baltic states switch to European power grid, ending Russia ties	VILNIUS — Estonia, Latvia and Lithuania said on Sunday they had successfully synchronized their electricity systems to the European continental power grid, one day after severing decades-old energy ties to Russia and Belarus. Planned for many years, the complex switch away from the grid of their former Soviet imperial overlord is designed to integrate the three Baltic nations more closely with the European Union and to boost the region's energy security. 'We did it!,' Latvian President Edgars Rinkevics said in a post on social media X. After disconnecting on Saturday from the IPS/UPS network, established by the Soviet Union in the 1950s and now run by Russia, the Baltic nations cut cross-border high-voltage transmission lines in eastern Latvia, some 100 meters from the Russian border, handing out pieces of chopped wire to enthusiastic bystanders as keepsakes. EU foreign policy chief Kaja Kallas, herself an Estonian, earlier this week called the switch 'a victory for freedom and European unity.' The Baltic Sea region is on high alert after power cable, telecom links and gas pipeline outages between the Baltics and Sweden or Finland. All were believed to have been caused by ships dragging anchors along the seabed following Russia's invasion of Ukraine. Russia has denied any involvement. Poland and the Baltics deployed navy assets, elite police units and helicopters after an undersea power link from Finland to Estonia was damaged in December, while Lithuania's military began drills to protect the overland connection to Poland. Analysts say more damage to links could push power prices in the Baltics to levels not seen since the invasion of Ukraine, when energy prices soared. The IPS/UPS grid was the final remaining link to Russia for the three countries, which re-emerged as independent nations in the early 1990s at the fall of the Soviet Union, and joined the European Union and NATO in 2004. The three staunch supporters of Kyiv stopped purchases of power from Russia following Moscow's invasion of Ukraine in 2022 but have relied on the Russian grid to control frequencies and stabilize networks to avoid outages.	https://www.voanews.com/a/baltic-states-switch-to-european-power-grid-ending-russia-ties-/7968415.html	2025-02-09T04:53:54-08:00	
High home prices and mortgage rates put American dream out of reach for many	The Petersen family's two-bedroom apartment in northern California is starting to feel small. Four-year-old Jerrik's toy monster trucks are everywhere in the 1,100-square-foot unit in Campbell, just outside of San Jose. And it's only a matter of time before 9-month-old Carolynn starts amassing more toys, adding to the disarray, said her mother, Jenn Petersen. The 42-year-old chiropractor had hoped she and her husband, Steve, a 39-year-old dental hygienist, would have bought a house by now. But when they can afford a bigger place, it will have to be another rental. Petersen has done the math: With mortgage rates and home prices stubbornly high, there's no way the couple, who make about $270,000 a year and pay about $2,500 in monthly rent, can afford a home anywhere in their area. According to October data from the Federal Reserve Bank of Atlanta, a San Jose family with a median income of $156,700 would need to spend 80% of their income on housing — including an $8,600 monthly mortgage payment — to own a median-priced $1.54 million home. That's far higher than the general rule of thumb that people should pay no more than 30% of their income on a mortgage or rent. Moving out of state is out of the question for the Petersens — they have strong family ties to the area and their income would plummet if they move to a lower cost-of-living area. 'I'm not willing to give up my job and close connections with my family for a house,' Petersen said. The issue is widespread and near historic highs nationally: As of last fall, the median homeowner in the U.S. was paying 42% of their income on homeownership costs, according to the Atlanta Fed. Four years ago, that percentage was 28% and had not previously reached 38% since late 2007, just before the housing market crash. 'The American dream, as our parents knew it, doesn't exist anymore,' Petersen said. 'The whole idea that you get a house after you graduate college, get a steady job and get married? I've done most of those milestones. But the homeownership part? That just doesn't fit financially.' Supply lags demand First-time homeowners are getting older. The same is true for an increasing number of American families. In 2024, the median first-time homebuyer was 38 years old, a jump from age 35 the previous year, according to a recent report by the National Association of Realtors. That's significantly above historic norms, when median first-time buyers hovered between 30 and 32 years old from 1993 to 2018. The biggest driver of this trend, experts said, is simple: There are far too few houses on the market to match pent-up demand, driving prices past the point of affordability for many people who are relatively early in their careers. Coupled with high mortgage rates, many have concluded that renting is their only option. 'Wage growth hasn't kept up with the increase in home prices and interest rates,' said Domonic Purviance, who studies housing at the Federal Reserve Bank of Atlanta in Atlanta, Georgia. 'Even though people are making more money, home prices are increasing at a faster rate.' That gap has left many out of the housing market, which for generations has been a way for Americans to build equity and wealth that they can pass down or leverage to buy a larger home. It's also led to widespread worries about housing in the United States. About 7 in 10 voters under age 45 said they were 'very' concerned about the cost of housing in their community, according to AP VoteCast, a survey of more than 120,000 voters in the 2024 election. Is the dream going to fade? Brian McCabe, a sociology professor at Georgetown University, said he frequently tells his students that 'there are few things that all Americans agree on, but one of them is that they'd rather own a home than rent.' McCabe said homeownership, especially as a wealth-building tool, is the right move for many, especially if the owner intends to be in one place for a long time. But he also said many are realizing that not owning a home has its advantages, too — it gives people more flexibility to move and allows them to live in exciting neighborhoods they would not be able to afford to buy property in. McCabe said millennials are getting married later, having children later, have a stronger desire to stay in cities and, especially due to remote work, value the flexibility of being able to move with ease — all of which he said could prompt an end to the notion that homeownership is the 'apex of the American dream.' 'The big question is whether we see the sheen of homeownership start to fade,' McCabe said. 'It's such an interesting cultural marker: Why is owning a home the pinnacle for so many people?' It's a question Petersen wrestles with because she knows any three-bedroom home she found in her area would leave her family 'house poor.' 'I used to subscribe to the idea that owning a house is just a natural milestone you have to reach,' she said. 'At some point, though, what are you sacrificing by just owning a house and gaining equity? I want to be able to travel with my kids. I want to be able to sign them up for extracurriculars. How are we supposed to do that if we're paying a mortgage that's most of our take-home pay?' Petersen said she'll 'always hold out a little bit of hope' that homeownership will be in her family's future. But if they find a townhouse to rent that has space for her kids and fits within their $3,600 monthly rental budget? 'I'd take that,' she said. Cities offer support Some cities are providing crucial aid to first-time homebuyers Lifelong Boston resident Julieta Lopez, 63, spent decades hoping to buy a home but watched as prices became increasingly out of reach. 'The prices in Boston just got higher and higher and higher and higher,' said Lopez, who works for the city traffic department issuing tickets for parking violations. Two years ago, furious to learn that her subsidized apartment's monthly rent was being hiked to $2,900, Lopez, who earns about $60,000 annually, took out her phone and began searching for government programs that help first-time homebuyers. She was determined to finally own her own place. Within months, she had succeeded. Lopez qualified to receive $50,000 from the local Massachusetts Affordable Homeownership Alliance nonprofit and another $50,000 from the city of Boston's Office of Housing — funds that helped her with a down payment on the $430,000 two-bedroom condominium she shares with her 30-year-old son. She now pays about $2,160 a month on her mortgage. Lopez knows she is lucky the city has placed such a focus on aiding first-time buyers like herself — Boston has poured more than $24 million into its homeownership assistance programs since Mayor Michelle Wu took office in 2021, helping nearly 700 residents get their first homes. But Lopez also feels proud to have her own place after years of working — doing jobs that included everything from telecommunications to health care to electronics. 'I was determined to have my piece of the pie,' she said. 'I felt I deserved that. I've always worked. Always. Nonstop.'	https://www.voanews.com/a/high-home-prices-and-mortgage-rates-put-american-dream-out-of-reach-for-many/7966141.html	2025-02-09T04:08:23-08:00	
Dalai Lama's elder brother, who led several rounds of talks with China, dies at 97	NEW DELHI — The elder brother of the Dalai Lama and former chairman of the Tibetan government-in-exile in India, Gyalo Thondup, who led several rounds of talks with China and worked with foreign governments for the Tibetan cause, has died. He was 97. Thondup died at his home in Kalimpong, a hill town in the Himalayan foothills of eastern West Bengal state, on Saturday evening, media reports said. No other details were immediately released about his death. Tibetan media outlets credited Thondup for networking with foreign governments and praised his role in facilitating U.S. support for the Tibetan struggle. The Dalai Lama led a prayer session for Thondup at a monastery in Bylakuppe town in India's southern state of Karnataka on Sunday where the spiritual leader is currently staying for the winter months. He prayed for Thondup's 'swift rebirth,' in accordance with Buddhist traditions, and said 'his efforts towards the Tibetan struggle were immense and we are grateful for his contribution.' Thondup, one of six siblings of the Tibetan spiritual leader and the only brother not groomed for a religious life, made India his home in 1952 and helped develop early contacts with the Indian and U.S. governments to seek support for Tibet. In 1957, Thondup helped recruit Tibetan fighters who were sent to U.S. training camps in subsequent years, a report by the U.S.-funded Radio Free Asia said. According to RFA, Thondup was primarily responsible for liaising with the Indian government, including with Prime Minister Jawaharlal Nehru, when the Dalai Lama escaped to India in 1959. He also played a key role in establishing Tibetan leaders' relations with U.S. officials. Thondup began discussions between Tibetans and Chinese leaders in 1979, in a departure from his earlier approach, which sought an armed struggle against Chinese control of Tibet. The meeting laid a basis for a series of formal negotiations between the Dalai Lama's official envoys and the Chinese leadership that continued until they were halted in 2010. In an interview with RFA broadcast in 2003, Thondup said neither India nor the U.S. would be able to solve the Tibetan issue, and that progress could only come through face-to-face talks with Beijing. Thondup served as chairman of the Tibetan government-in-exile based in India's northern hillside town of Dharamshala from 1991 to 1993.	https://www.voanews.com/a/dalai-lama-s-elder-brother-who-led-several-rounds-of-talks-with-china-dies-at-97-/7968396.html	2025-02-09T04:07:10-08:00	
Kosovo votes for new parliament as foreign aid dwindles and talks with Serbia are stalled	PRISTINA, KOSOVO — Kosovars cast their votes Sunday in a parliamentary election considered a key test for Prime Minister Albin Kurti as talks on normalizing ties with rival Serbia remain stalled and foreign funding for one of Europe's poorest countries in question. Kurti's left-wing Vetevendosje, or Self-Determination Movement Party, is seen as the front-runner but is not expected to win the necessary majority to govern alone, leaving open the possibility the other two contenders join ranks if he fails to form a Cabinet. The other challengers are the Democratic Party of Kosovo, or PDK, whose main leaders are detained at an international criminal tribunal at The Hague accused of war crimes, and the Democratic League of Kosovo, or LDK, the oldest party in the country that lost much of its support after the death in 2006 of its leader, Ibrahim Rugova. The parties made big-ticket pledges to increase public salaries and pensions, improve education and health services, and fight poverty. However, they did not explain where the money would come from, nor how they would attract more foreign investment. Ties with Serbia remain a concern Kurti has been at odds with Western powers after his Cabinet took several steps that raised tensions with Serbia and ethnic Serbs, including the ban on the use of the Serbian currency and dinar transfers from Serbia to Kosovo's ethnic Serb minority that depends on Belgrade's social services and payments. The U.S., the European Union and the NATO-led stabilization force KFOR have urged the government in Pristina to refrain from unilateral actions, fearing the revival of inter-ethnic conflict. This is the first time since independence in 2008 that Kosovo's parliament has completed a full four-year mandate. It is the ninth parliamentary vote in Kosovo since the end of the 1998-99 war between Serbian government forces and ethnic Albanian separatists that pushed Serbian forces out following a 78-day NATO air campaign. Serbia does not recognize Kosovo's independence. The vote will determine who will lead the Kosovo in negotiations with Serbia, which stalled again last year. Some aid funds are suspended The EU has suspended funding for some projects and set conditions for their gradual resumption, linked to Kosovo taking steps to de-escalate tensions in the north, where most of the Serb minority lives. Kosovo is also suffering after Washington imposed a 90-day freeze on funding for different projects through the U.S. Agency for International Development, which has been key in promoting the country's growth. Some 2 million eligible voters will elect 120 lawmakers from 1,280 candidates from 27 political groupings. One independent candidate is also running. The Kosovar parliament has 20 seats reserved for minorities regardless of election results, 10 of which are for the Serb minority. 'I encourage all the citizens of Kosovo to use this opportunity to decide on the next four years,' Kurti said after casting his ballot. There have been sporadic violent incidents. Prosecutors said they detained five people for trying to influence voters. Kosovars abroad started voting on Saturday at 43 diplomatic missions. There are some 20,000 voters from the diaspora of nearly 100,000 casting ballots at the missions, and the rest by mail. Although crucial for the region's stability, negotiations with Serbia have not figured high on any party's agenda. 'What can we do? We were born here. Our graves are here. It will be better, I hope. We have to come out and vote. That is our duty,' Mileva Kovacevic, a Serb resident in northern Mitrovica, said. Kosovo, with a population of 1.6 million, is one of the poorest countries in Europe with an annual gross domestic product of less than 6,000 euros per person. KFOR has increased its presence in Kosovo after last year's tensions with Serbia as well as for the election. A team of 100 observers from the EU, 18 from the Council of Europe and about 1,600 others from international or local organizations will monitor the vote.	https://www.voanews.com/a/kosovo-votes-for-new-parliament-as-foreign-aid-dwindles-and-talks-with-serbia-are-stalled/7968375.html	2025-02-09T02:54:03-08:00	
China to roll back clean power subsidies after boom	BEIJING — China's top economic planning agency said on Sunday it was taking steps to scale back subsidies for renewable energy projects after a boom in solar and wind power installations. China broke its own records for new solar installations in 2024 with installed capacity up 45% from the previous year. China now has almost 887 GW of installed solar power, more than six times the capacity of the United States, according to data from the International Renewable Energy Agency. The surge in installations meant China hit its 2030 target six years ahead of schedule, underscoring the speed of its clean energy rollout at a time when President Donald Trump has pulled the United States out of the Paris climate deal for a second time and pledged to make it easier to drill for oil and gas. China's National Development and Reform Commission (NDRC) said together with China's energy administration it had issued 'market-oriented' changes to policies intended to encourage clean energy projects. The NDRC said China's clean energy capacity of all kinds had reached more than 40% of the economy's total energy generation capacity, in part because of the support of a system that guaranteed prices for renewable energy sold to the grid. 'The cost of new energy development has dropped significantly compared to earlier stages,' the NDRC said in a statement. The agency said any new projects completed after June this year would face payments for electricity based on 'market-based bidding.' The NDRC said it expected there would be no impact on the price for residential users and farming and that power prices would be 'basically the same' for industrial and commercial operations after the change took effect. The NDRC said it would work with local governments across China on the implementation of the plan. It did not provide details of the pricing formula it would introduce. Less generous subsidies for new solar farms could add pressure on China's solar industry, where overcapacity relative to global demand has sent prices for solar panels plunging and threatened to drive smaller producers into bankruptcy.	https://www.voanews.com/a/china-to-roll-back-clean-power-subsidies-after-boom/7968356.html	2025-02-09T01:15:06-08:00	
Sam Nujoma, Namibia's first president, dies at 95	WINDHOEK, NAMIBIA — Sam Nujoma, the fiery freedom fighter who led Namibia to independence from apartheid South Africa in 1990 and served as its first president for 15 years, and was known as the father of the nation, has died. He was 95. Nujoma's death was announced Sunday by current Namibian President Nangolo Mbumba. Mbumba said Nujoma died on Saturday night after being hospitalized in the capital, Windhoek. 'The foundations of the Republic of Namibia have been shaken,' Mbumba said in a statement. 'Over the past three weeks, the Founding President of the Republic of Namibia and Founding Father of the Namibian Nation was hospitalized for medical treatment and medical observation due to ill health.' 'Unfortunately, this time, the most gallant son of our land could not recover from his illness,' Mbumba added. Nujoma was revered in his homeland as a charismatic father figure who steered his country to democracy and stability after long colonial rule by Germany and a bitter war of independence from South Africa. He spent nearly 30 years in exile as the leader of its independence movement before returning to be elected his country's first democratic leader in 1990. Nujoma, with his trademark white beard, was the last of a generation of African leaders who brought their countries out of colonial or white minority rule that included South Africa's Nelson Mandela, Zimbabwe's Robert Mugabe, Zambia's Kenneth Kaunda and Mozambique's Samora Machel. Many Namibians credited Nujoma's leadership for the process of national healing and reconciliation after the deep divisions caused by the independence war and South Africa's policies of dividing the country into ethnically based regional governments, with separate education and health care for each race. Even his political opponents praised Nujoma — who was branded a Marxist and accused of ruthless suppression of dissent while in exile — for establishing a democratic Constitution and involving white businessmen and politicians in government after independence. Despite his pragmatism and nation-building at home, Nujoma often hit foreign headlines for his fierce anti-Western rhetoric. He claimed AIDS was a man-made biological weapon and also occasionally waged a verbal war on homosexuality, calling gays 'idiots' and branding homosexuality a 'foreign and corrupt ideology.' Nujoma built ties with North Korea, Cuba, Russia and China, some of which had supported Namibia's liberation movement by providing arms and training. But he balanced that with outreach to the West, and Nujoma was the first African leader to be hosted at the White House by former U.S. President Bill Clinton in 1993. Clinton called Nujoma 'the George Washington of his country' and 'a genuine hero of the world’s movement toward democracy.' Nujoma grew up in a rural, impoverished family, the eldest of 11 children. His early life revolved around looking after his parents' cattle and the cultivation of land. He attended a mission school before moving to Windhoek and working for South African Railways. He was arrested following a political protest in 1959 and fled the territory shortly after his release. In exile, he helped establish the South West African People’s Organization and was named its president in 1960. SWAPO has been Namibia's ruling party since 1990. When South Africa refused to heed a 1966 U.N. resolution ending its mandate over the former German colony of South West Africa, Nujoma launched SWAPO’s guerrilla campaign. 'We started the armed struggle with only two sub-machine guns and two pistols,' Nujoma once said. 'I got them from Algeria, plus some rounds of ammunition.'	https://www.voanews.com/a/sam-nujoma-namibia-s-first-president-dies-at-95-/7968336.html	2025-02-08T22:36:26-08:00	
Economists raise concern over sustainability of Indonesian meal program	JAKARTA, INDONESIA — Economists are raising concerns about the viability of Indonesian President Prabowo Subianto’s program launched this year to combat child nutrition. According to an Indonesian Ministry of Health Nutritional Status Study report, 21.6% of children ages 3 and 4 experienced stunting caused by malnutrition in 2022. The first stage of the Free Nutritious Meal Program, extending through March, is intended to provide around 20 million Indonesian school children, pregnant women and breastfeeding mothers meals to improve their health and prevent stunting. The effort was initially projected to cost $28 billion over five years. However, Coordinating Minister for Food Zulkifli Hasan said on Jan. 9 during a meeting on food security that the $4.4 billion budgeted for this year will run out in June and that $8.5 billion more will be requested to fund the program through December. China, Japan, the United States and India have expressed support for the program, although it is unclear how much money will be provided or what form that support will take. Japan and India have said their help will be in the form of training. Officials plan to implement the program in stages, eventually reaching 83 million people — more than a quarter of Indonesia’s 280 million population — by 2029, Muhammad Qodari, deputy chief of the presidential staff told reporters on Feb. 3. The program is part of a long-term strategy to develop the nation’s youth to achieve a 'Golden Indonesia' generation, referring to a plan to make Indonesia a sovereign, advanced and prosperous nation by its 2045 centennial. The program's cost could make Prabowo politically vulnerable, according to Dinna Prapto Raharja, a professor of international relations at Jakarta’s Bina Nusantara University and a senior policy adviser at Jakarta consulting firm Synergy Policies. 'In order to finance this program, Prabowo has taken steps to implement major cutbacks in his government budget with some ministries seeing 50% cuts,' Dinna said. 'Now he is forced to seek financial assistance from overseas sources.' she told VOA on Jan. 31. The Finance Ministry said the spending cuts would amount to $18.7 billion, 8% of this fiscal year’s approved spending. While other nations said they would support the program, officials from the National Nutrition Agency — which manages the program — said internal talks about the level of foreign aid, type of assistance and technical aspects of its implementation have not begun. Support from China, Japan, US and India In November, China committed to supporting free nutritious meals but did not pledge a specific amount. The Chinese Embassy in Jakarta did not respond to VOA requests for further information on the value and form of the assistance. It remains unclear whether China’s financial assistance will be in the form of a loan or grant. The United States is providing training to Indonesian dairy farmers to support the program, which has increased the demand for locally produced milk. Indonesia, so far, can provide milk only two to three times a week to school children, according to Deddy Fachrudin Kurniawan, CEO of Dairy Pro Indonesia and project leader of U.S. Dairy Export Council training. Deddy told VOA on Jan. 8 that Indonesia has had to import 84% of its milk in the past, and that demand will double because of the food program. In January, Japanese Prime Minister Shigeru Ishiba announced Japan will support the meal program by helping the Indonesian government increase its ability to combat childhood malnutrition. Ishiba offered Japan’s support by training Indonesian cooks and sending Japanese chefs to assist. Prabowo added that Japan will also assist in improving the fishery and agriculture sectors, based on Japan’s experience. More recently, India reaffirmed support for the program through the sharing of knowledge of the government’s Food Corporation of India and other institutions with Indonesian officials. 'India shares its experiences in the fields of health and food security, including the [free] lunch scheme and public [service] distribution system to the Indonesia government,' Prime Minister Narendra Modi said on his YouTube channel on Jan. 25. Other support and reaction Other countries have said they support the program. France and Brazil expressed their support on the sidelines of the recent G20 Leaders Summit in Rio de Janeiro. Prabowo instructed his team to arrange a visit of an Indonesian delegation to Brazil to take notes from the South American country's similar program. France, which has a similar school feeding program, intends to share its expertise and help Indonesia modernize its agricultural sector. Teuku Rezasyah, an associate professor of international relations at Bandung’s Universitas Padjajaran, noted that India exported 20,000 metric tons of water buffalo meat to Indonesia last year while Brazil exported 100,000 metric tons of beef to Indonesia. British Deputy Prime Minister Angela Reynar showed similar interest during her meeting with Prabowo in London in November. However, it remains unclear what type of support the U.K will offer. Mohammad Faisal, executive director of the Center of Reform on Economics, told VOA in Jakarta on Jan. 31 that countries offering support will have their own interests in mind, as well. 'I believe there’s no free lunch,' Faisal said. 'The donations may be partly altruistic, but not entirely. Donor countries consider it as strengthening bilateral ties, but they may also expect to reap the benefits in the future, such as enjoying ease of investing in Indonesia through incentives and getting better penetration of export markets as a reward.' Rezasyah agreed. 'Donor countries are probably hoping Indonesia will import more products from their countries to support this multibillion-dollar supplemental food program,' he said. 'On the other hand, they see Indonesia becoming a middle power that could contribute to finding solutions to global affairs.'	https://www.voanews.com/a/economists-raise-concern-over-sustainability-of-indonesian-meal-program/7966819.html	2025-02-08T20:14:15-08:00	
Released Thai hostages return to Bangkok after being held for over a year in Gaza	BANGKOK — Five Thai workers released after being held hostage for over a year in Gaza arrived in Bangkok on Sunday. Sarusak Rumnao, 32, Watchara Sriaoun, 33, Sathian Suwannakham, 35, Pongsak Thaenna, 36, and Bannawat Saethao, 27, were freed on Jan. 30 as part of an exchange arrangement. They were embraced by family members, some of whom cried, in the arrivals hall at Suvarnabhumi airport. Thai Foreign Minister Maris Sagniampongsa and Israeli Ambassador to Thailand Orna Sagiv were both at the airport to welcome home the freed hostages. 'We are all very grateful and very happy that we get to return to our homeland. We all would really like to thank you. I don't know what else to say,' Pongsak told a news conference at the airport. Maris said the Thai government 'never gave up hope and here is the result today. The tears of joy are our encouragement.' He added that Bangkok would continue working to secure the release of the remaining Thai hostage. The group quickly left the news conference to return to their hometowns in Thailand's northern and northeastern regions. They were the second batch of Thai hostages released since the war broke out. During an earlier ceasefire in November 2023, 23 Thai nationals were released in a deal negotiated between Thailand and Hamas, with assistance from Qatar and Iran. All five men were assessed at a hospital outside Tel Aviv prior to their return. Four of them were joined by one relative each earlier this week. The trip was sponsored by the Israeli government, according to the Thai Embassy in Tel Aviv. Hamas militants kidnapped 31 Thai nationals during the Oct. 7, 2023, assault on southern Israel, making them the largest group of foreigners held captive. Many of the Thai agricultural workers lived in compounds on the outskirts of southern Israeli kibbutzim and towns, and Hamas militants overran those places first. A total of 46 Thais have been killed during the conflict, including two Thai citizens who were killed during the attack and their bodies taken into Gaza, according to Thailand's Ministry of Foreign Affairs. There was no immediate information available about Nattapong Pingsa, who is the last Thai hostage left in Gaza, nor the two Thai workers whose bodies were taken into Gaza. Maris, the Thai foreign minister, traveled to Israel to visit the five freed men shortly after their release. Maris met with his Israeli counterparts seeking support to secure the release of the remaining Thai hostage and retrieve the bodies of the two deceased Thais. Thai workers remain the largest group of foreign agricultural laborers in Israel. The countries implemented a bilateral agreement a decade ago specifically easing the way for Thai agricultural workers. Many Palestinian workers had since returned, and before the Hamas attack about half of Israel's workforce was made up of foreign and Palestinian laborers.	https://www.voanews.com/a/released-thai-hostages-return-to-bangkok-after-being-held-for-over-a-year-in-gaza/7968321.html	2025-02-08T19:55:38-08:00	
North Korea slams US-South Korea-Japan partnership, vows to boost nuclear program	SEOUL, SOUTH KOREA — North Korean leader Kim Jong Un said an elevated U.S. security partnership with South Korea and Japan poses a grave threat to his country and vowed to bolster his nuclear weapons program, state media reported Sunday. Kim has previously made similar warnings, but his latest statement implies again that the North Korean leader won't likely embrace U.S. President Donald Trump's overture to meet him and revive diplomacy anytime soon. In a speech on Saturday marking the 77th founding anniversary of the Korean People's Army, Kim said the U.S.-Japan-South Korea trilateral security partnership was established under a U.S. plot to form a NATO-like regional military bloc. He said it is inviting military imbalance on the Korean Peninsula and 'raising a grave challenge to the security environment of our state,' according to the official Korean Central News Agency. 'Referring to a series of new plans for rapidly bolstering all deterrence including nuclear forces, he clarified once again the unshakable policy of more highly developing the nuclear forces,' KCNA said. Amid stalled diplomacy with the U.S. and South Korea in recent years, Kim has focused on enlarging and modernizing his arsenal of nuclear weapons. In response, the United States and South Korea have expanded their bilateral military exercises and trilateral training involving Japan. North Korea has lashed out at those drills, calling them rehearsals to invade the country. Trump on Kim: 'I got along with him' Since his January 20 inauguration, Trump has said he would reach out to Kim again as he boasted of his high-stakes summit with him during his first term. During a joint news conference with Japanese Prime Minister Shigeru Ishiba on Friday, Trump said, 'We will have relations with North Korea, with Kim Jong Un. I got along with him very well, as you know. I think I stopped the war.' During a Fox News interview broadcast on January 23, Trump was asked if he will reach out to Kim again, Trump replied, 'I will, yeah.' Trump met Kim three times in 2018-19 to discuss how to end North Korea's nuclear program in what was the first-ever summitry between the leaders of the U.S. and North Korea. The high-stakes diplomacy eventually collapsed after Trump rejected Kim's offer to dismantle his main nuclear complex, a partial denuclearization step, in return for broad sanctions relief. North Korea hasn't directly responded to Trump's recent overture, as it continues weapons testing activities and hostile rhetoric against the U.S. Many experts say Kim is now preoccupied with his dispatch of troops to Russia to support its war efforts against Ukraine. They say Kim would eventually consider returning to diplomacy with Trump if he determines he would fail to maintain the current solid cooperation with Russia after the war ends. Kim reaffirms support for Russia In his Saturday speech, Kim reaffirmed that North Korea 'will invariably support and encourage the just cause of the Russian army and people to defend their sovereignty, security and territorial integrity.' Kim accused the U.S. of being behind 'the war machine which is stirring up the tragic situation of Ukraine.' In South Korea, some worry that Trump might abandon the international community's long-running goal of achieving a complete denuclearization of North Korea to produce a diplomatic achievement. But a joint statement issued by Trump and Ishiba after their summit stated the two leaders reaffirmed 'their resolute commitment to the complete denuclearization of the DPRK,' the acronym of North Korea's official name, the Democratic People's Republic of Korea. The statement said the U.S. and Japan also affirmed the importance of the Japan-U.S.-South Korean trilateral partnership in responding to North Korea.	https://www.voanews.com/a/north-korea-slams-us-south-korea-japan-partnership-vows-to-boost-nuclear-program-/7968313.html	2025-02-08T19:10:30-08:00	
Japan prime minister voices optimism over averting US tariffs	TOKYO — Japanese Prime Minister Shigeru Ishiba expressed optimism on Sunday that his country could avoid higher U.S. tariffs, saying President Donald Trump had recognized Japan's huge investment in the U.S. and the American jobs that it creates. At his first White House summit on Friday, Ishiba told public broadcaster NHK, he explained to Trump how many Japanese automakers were creating jobs in the United States. The two did not specifically discuss auto tariffs, Ishiba said, although he said he did not know whether Japan would be subject to the reciprocal tariffs that Trump has said he plans to impose on imports. Tokyo has so far escaped the trade war Trump unleashed in his first weeks in office. He has announced tariffs on goods from Canada, Mexico and China, although he postponed the 25% duties on his North American neighbors to allow for talks. The escalating trade tensions since Trump returned to the White House on Jan. 20 threaten to rupture the global economy. Ishiba said he believes Trump 'recognized the fact Japan has been the world's largest investor in the United States for five straight years and is therefore different from other countries.' 'Japan is creating many U.S. jobs. I believe (Washington) won't go straight to the idea of higher tariffs,' he said. Ishiba voiced optimism that Japan and the U.S. can avoid a tit-for-tat tariff war, stressing that tariffs should be put in place in a way that 'benefits both sides.' 'Any action that exploits or excludes the other side won't last,' Ishiba said. 'The question is whether there is any problem between Japan and the United States that warrants imposing higher tariffs,' he added. Japan had the highest foreign direct investment in the United States in 2023 at $783.3 billion, followed by Canada and Germany, according to the most recent U.S. Commerce Department data. Trump pressed Ishiba to close Japan's $68.5 billion annual trade surplus with Washington but expressed optimism this could be done quickly, given a promise by Ishiba to bring Japanese investment in the U.S. to $1 trillion. On Sunday, Ishiba identified liquefied natural gas, steel, AI and autos as areas that Japanese companies could invest in. He also touched on Trump's promise to look at Nippon Steel investing in U.S. Steel as opposed to buying the storied American company, a planned purchase opposed by Trump and blocked by his predecessor, Joe Biden. 'Investment is being made to ensure that it remains an American company. It will continue to operate under American management, with American employees,' Ishiba said. 'The key point is how to ensure it remains an American company. From President Trump's perspective, this is of utmost importance.' On military spending, another area where Trump has pressed allies for increases, Ishiba said Japan would not increase its defense budget without first winning public backing. 'It is crucial to ensure that what is deemed necessary is something the taxpayers can understand and support,' he said.	https://www.voanews.com/a/japan-prime-minister-voices-optimism-over-averting-us-tariffs/7968310.html	2025-02-08T18:38:36-08:00

Authorities in Somalia warn against financing terrorism	Somalia's government Saturday sent stern warnings to businesses and individuals that pay extortion money to al-Shabab, saying the full force of the law would be brought against traders and individuals who pay the al-Qaida ally. Presenting a unified front, Somalia's Minister of Internal Security Abdullahi Sheikh Ismail and Minister of Religious Affairs Mukhtar Ali Robow joined the government's attorney general and the deputy minister of information at a joint news conference in Mogadishu, Somalia. They said, any business found to have paid or collaborated with al-Shabab in any way would 'face legal action,' including having their government-issued trading permits revoked. 'Do not let your wealth destroy your life because security forces are prepared to act against anyone attempting to collaborate with these groups,' said minister Ismail. He said in recent government actions — aimed at cutting off al-Shabab funding —security forces shut down financial accounts used by the militant group to receive funds. Somali President Hassan Sheikh Mohamud declared a 'total war' against the al-Qaida-linked militants shortly after being elected in May 2022. President Mohamud said at the time that part of the government strategy to weaken and defeat the militants was not only on the military front, but also to cut its finances. In January 2023, Somali Prime Minister Hamza Abdi Barre said his government had closed every known account connected with the militants. 'The government had successfully shut down 250 bank accounts belonging to the group and closed an additional 70 mobile money accounts of the militants,' Barre said at the time. The al-Qaida affiliated group has continued to fund itself for years through intimidation and by extorting businesses in Mogadishu and collecting taxes in areas under its control. Robow, a former al-Shabab fighter who defected before accepting the Cabinet ministry position, said there is no justification for paying al-Shabab. He said it is unacceptable for anyone to finance activities that harm the Somali people, especially in areas under government control, such as Bakara market. 'Those who attempt to justify their support for terrorism will find no refuge,' he warned. Deputy Minister of Information Abdirahman Yusuf al-Adala acknowledged that the government is tracing sources of money going to al-Shabab. 'The government possesses detailed information about individuals directly or indirectly funding groups like al-Shabab and ISIS. Make no mistake, no one will escape unpunished' if found to be involved in 'terrorist funding in any form,' al-Adala said, referring to the Islamic State terrorist group by an acronym. Ismail praised the government's multi-faceted approach to dismantle the terrorist organization. 'Our primary objective was to combat al-Shabab and defeat them across various fronts. Now, we can say we have beaten them in the financial warfare, media battles, ideological war and on the front lines,' Ismail said. Ismail added that the government is aware of individuals who still have secret dealings with al-Shabab. 'I warn ... our citizens to avoid any engagement with al-Shabab. If you are found in contact with al-Shabab, and you are seen facilitating funds, the government will take serious action against you,' he said. Prosecutors' meeting Saturday's government warning follows the conclusion of the 7th Prosecutors' Conference of Somalia in Mogadishu this week, which marked a significant step in the nation's fight against terrorism financing. According to a government statement, this year's conference focused on addressing the financial networks that support extremist groups, a critical challenge in ensuring national security and stability. A government statement at the conclusion of the conference said that participants engaged in in-depth discussions and research on strategies to strengthen the legal framework and enhance inter-agency cooperation aimed at eliminating the financial resources that fuel terrorist activities. 'Officials at the conference emphasized the importance of robust legal measures and collaborative efforts in dismantling the financial infrastructures of terrorist organizations,' the statement said. 'This conference is part of the government's broader efforts to secure Somalia's future by targeting the economic lifelines of terrorism and ensuring that the rule of law prevails.' the statement added. One of the keynote speakers of the conference was Regional Police Commander Moalim Mahdi, chief of the Banadir region that covers Mogadishu. He said taxes provided by traders to al-Shabab funded terrorist attacks that claimed innocent lives. 'The explosive attacks orchestrated by al-Shabab in the capital cost as much as $80,000 per operation, with Somali traders unknowingly funding the group's activities,' Mahdi said. Mahdi said that al-Shabab secures much of its operational funding through extortion from business owners in key commercial areas, including the Bakara Market, the biggest in Somalia. He said the group uses extorted taxes to finance the manufacturing and transport of explosive devices, which are often smuggled into Mogadishu from the Shabelle and Jubba regions. 'Moving these explosives into the city requires substantial financial support,' Mahdi said. 'Each operation involves payments ranging from $10,000 to $80,000, and the vehicles carrying the bombs pass through at least nine intermediaries before reaching their target.' Mahdi noted that many traders comply with the extortion demands out of fear of retaliation, but he warned that their payments are directly fueling attacks that harm innocent Somali civilians.	https://www.voanews.com/a/authorities-in-somalia-warn-against-financing-terrorism/7968302.html	2025-02-08T18:17:24-08:00	
Head of UN chemical weapons watchdog meets Syrian leader	DAMASCUS, SYRIA — The head of the world's chemical weapons watchdog met Syria's new leader Saturday, in a first visit to Damascus since the ousting of Bashar al-Assad, who was repeatedly accused of using such weapons during Syria's 13-year civil war. More than a decade ago, Syria agreed to hand over its declared stockpile for destruction, but the Organization for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons has been concerned that the declaration was incomplete and that more weapons remained. With new authorities now in power, the OPCW visit has raised hope that Syria will be conclusively rid of such weapons after years of delays and obstructions to the body's work. 'This visit marks a reset. After 11 years of obstruction by the previous authorities, the Syrian caretaker authorities have a chance to turn the page,' OPCW chief Fernando Arias said. The Syrian presidency said interim leader Ahmed al-Sharaa and Foreign Minister Asaad al-Shaibani received a delegation from the Organization for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons led by Arias. The presidency also shared pictures of Sharaa and Shaibani shaking hands with Arias. There has been widespread concern about the fate of Syria's stockpile of chemical weapons since Assad's dramatic overthrow at the hands of Islamist-led rebels. The OPCW has also expressed concern that valuable evidence may have been destroyed in intense Israeli strikes on Syrian military sites in the wake of his fall. Israel has said its targets included chemical weapons to prevent them from falling into the hands of extremists. In 2013, Syria agreed to join the OPCW and disclose and hand over its toxic stockpile under Russian and U.S. pressure, and to avert the threat of airstrikes by Washington and its allies. This came after a suspected chemical attack on the Eastern Ghouta suburb of Damascus that killed more than 1,000 people, according to U.S. intelligence, and was attributed to the Syrian government, which denied involvement and blamed rebels. Despite insisting the use of chemical weapons was a red line, then-U.S. President Barack Obama did not conduct strikes, instead he reached a deal with Russia on the dismantlement of Syria's chemical arsenal under U.N. supervision. Assad's government had long denied using chemical weapons. But in 2014, the OPCW set up what it called a 'fact-finding mission' to investigate chemical weapons use in Syria, subsequently issuing 21 reports covering 74 instances of alleged chemical weapons use. Investigators concluded that chemical weapons were used or likely used in 20 instances. In 14 of these cases, the chemical used was chlorine. Sarin was used in three cases and a mustard agent was employed in the remaining three. In 2021, OPCW members stripped Syria of voting rights after a probe blamed Damascus for poison gas attacks carried out after it had claimed the stockpile was eliminated. In November 2023, France issued international arrest warrants against Assad, his brother Maher and two generals on suspicion of complicity in the 2013 chemical attacks.	https://www.voanews.com/a/head-of-un-chemical-weapons-watchdog-meets-syrian-leader/7968301.html	2025-02-08T17:50:34-08:00	
Lasers aid river search for debris from plane-helicopter collision	Crews continuing to search for debris from the deadly collision of a passenger jet and Army helicopter near Washington used a plane outfitted with lasers to scan the bottom of the Potomac River early Saturday, the National Transportation Safety Board said. Large pieces of the jetliner and helicopter along with the remains of all 67 victims were recovered this week, and crews will spend the coming days looking for smaller debris before finishing the work in about a week. A plane operated by the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration and equipped with laser scanning technology flew at low altitudes over the crash site. The lasers are used to penetrate the river's surface and map the riverbed. 'All major pieces' of the two aircraft have been found, and investigators will examine them for any markings that could reveal the angle of the collision, according to an NTSB statement released Saturday afternoon. The NTSB said information collected will be part of its ongoing investigation into the January 29 collision between the Army helicopter and an American Airlines flight over Washington. There were no survivors. U.S. President Donald Trump on Thursday blamed the collision on what he called an obsolete computer system used by U.S. air traffic controllers and vowed to replace it. NTSB officials told members of Congress that the helicopter's advanced surveillance technology, which transmits aircraft location and other data to air traffic control and other aircraft, was turned off, Texas Republican Senator Ted Cruz said Thursday. Investigators are also looking into the altitude of the plane and helicopter, including whether the helicopter was above its 61-meter flight ceiling. Investigators need to be able to examine the wreckage of the Black Hawk to get more precise information. The crash was the deadliest in the U.S. since November 12, 2001, when a jet slammed into a New York City neighborhood just after takeoff, killing all 260 people on board and five on the ground.	https://www.voanews.com/a/lasers-aid-river-search-for-debris-from-plane-helicopter-collision-/7968296.html	2025-02-08T17:30:56-08:00	
Scandal-hit narco-musical 'Emilia Perez' wins Spanish film prize	GRANADA, SPAIN — Narco-musical Emilia Perez won best European film at Spain's equivalent of the Oscars on Saturday, after social media posts by the movie's star prompted a backlash in the middle of awards season. The mostly Spanish-language musical tells the story of a Mexican drug cartel boss who transitions to life as a woman and turns her back on crime. Before the scandal broke, the film earned 13 Oscar nods, picked up four Golden Globes in January and won multiple prizes at last year's Cannes Film Festival. But old social media posts by star Karla Sofia Gascon, in which she denigrates Islam, China and African American George Floyd, unleashed a scandal that has harmed her reputation and the film. Voting for the Goya awards closed on Jan. 24, days before the posts were uncovered. Spaniard Gascon, the first transgender woman nominated for an Oscar for best actress, has apologized for her posts and distanced herself from publicity for the film. She lives near Madrid but did not attend the Goya awards ceremony in Granada. The movie's French director Jacques Audiard has called the posts 'inexcusable' and 'absolutely hateful.'	https://www.voanews.com/a/scandal-hit-narco-musical-emilia-perez-wins-spanish-film-prize/7968297.html	2025-02-08T17:30:28-08:00	
7.6 magnitude quake shakes Caribbean southwest of Cayman Islands, USGS says	MEXICO CITY — A magnitude 7.6 earthquake shook the Caribbean Sea southwest of Cayman Islands on Saturday, according to the U.S. Geological Survey. Some Caribbean islands and Honduras urged people near the coastline to move inland or avoid beaches as a precaution in case of a tsunami. The quake struck at 6:23 p.m. local time in the middle of the sea and had a depth of 10 kilometers, the USGS said. Its epicenter was 209 kilometers south-southwest of George Town in the Cayman Islands. The U.S. National Tsunami Warning Center said there is no tsunami alert for the U.S. mainland but issued a tsunami advisory for Puerto Rico and the U.S. Virgin Islands. The Cayman Islands government issued a tsunami threat alert and said in its social media channels that its 'residents living near the coastline are encouraged to move inland.' Honduran authorities said there were no immediate reports of damage but urged its residents to stay away from beaches in the next few hours, local media said. The International Tsunami Information Center said 'hazardous tsunami waves from this earthquake are possible within the next three hours along some coasts of' Cayman Islands, Jamaica, Cuba, Mexico, Honduras, Bahamas, Haiti, Turks and Caicos, San Andres Providence, Belize, Dominican Republic, Colombia, Panama, Puerto Rico, Costa Rica, Aruba, Bonaire, Curacao, U.S. Virgin Islands, British Virgin Islands and Saba.	https://www.voanews.com/a/magnitude-quake-shakes-caribbean-southwest-of-cayman-islands-usgs-says/7968294.html	2025-02-08T17:20:30-08:00	
Chile imposes curfews in wildfire impacted regions	SANTIAGO, CHILE — Chile's President Gabriel Boric on Saturday issued state of emergency decrees for two regions in the center and south of the country due to the threat of raging wildfires. He said the measures for Nuble and Maule, which are aimed at saving forests, fields, homes and human life, would include curfews to allow the authorities to tackle possible criminal acts. Speaking at a news conference at the presidential palace, Boric said he has 'reasons to believe that a large part of the fires that affect the AraucanIa area today (south of capital Santiago) are deliberate.' 'We are not going to tolerate the vile behavior of a person or organization that carries out these types of acts,' said Boric. Local authorities say there are about 15 active fire outbreaks in Chile currently, which have been aggravated by weather temperatures above 40 Celsius degrees. More than 60 arrests have been made recently in connection with forest fires in the AraucanIa area, according to local authorities. Dozens of people were killed last year and over 1,000 homes were destroyed due to forest fires in the Valparaiso region.	https://www.voanews.com/a/chile-imposes-curfews-in-wildfire-impacted-regions/7968293.html	2025-02-08T17:11:24-08:00	
US judge temporarily blocks Musk's DOGE from accessing payment systems	A federal judge early Saturday temporarily blocked billionaire Elon Musk's government efficiency team and Trump administration political appointees from accessing government systems used to process trillions of dollars in payments, citing a risk that sensitive information could be improperly disclosed. U.S. District Judge Paul Engelmayer in Manhattan issued the order after a coalition of Democratic attorneys general from 19 U.S. states filed a lawsuit late Friday arguing Musk's Department of Government Efficiency has no legal power to access the U.S. Department of Treasury systems. Musk, on X, called the ruling 'absolutely insane!' and said without evidence that 'something super shady is going to protect scammers.' 'How on Earth are we supposed to stop fraud and waste of taxpayer money without looking at how money is spent?' Musk said on his social media platform and called Engelmayer 'an activist posing as a judge.' The lawsuit said Musk and his team could disrupt federal funding for health clinics, preschools, climate initiatives, and other programs, and that Republican President Donald Trump could use the information to further his political agenda. DOGE's access to the system also 'poses huge cybersecurity risks that put vast amounts of funding for the States and their residents in peril,' the state attorneys general said. They sought a temporary restraining order blocking DOGE's access. The judge, an appointee of Democratic former President Barack Obama, said the states' claims were 'particularly strong' and warranted him acting on their request for emergency relief pending a further hearing before another judge on Feb. 14. 'That is both because of the risk that the new policy presents of the disclosure of sensitive and confidential information and the heightened risk that the systems in question will be more vulnerable than before to hacking,' Engelmayer wrote. New York Attorney General Letitia James, a Democrat whose office is leading the case, welcomed the ruling, saying nobody was above the law and that Americans across the country had been horrified by the DOGE team's unfettered access to their data. 'We knew the Trump administration's choice to give this access to unauthorized individuals was illegal, and this morning, a federal court agreed,' James said in a statement. 'Now, Americans can trust that Musk — the world's richest man — and his friends will not have free rein over their personal information while our lawsuit proceeds.' Engelmayer's order bars access from being granted to Treasury Department payment and data systems by political appointees, special government employees and government employees detailed from an agency outside the Treasury Department. The judge also directed that anyone prohibited under his order from accessing those systems to immediately destroy anything they copied or downloaded. The White House and Treasury Department did not immediately respond to requests for comment. Trump deputized Musk to lead DOGE to identify fraud and waste in the government. Musk's efforts have alarmed Democrats and advocacy groups who say he is overstepping his authority by seeking to dismantle agencies responsible for critical government programs and fire federal workers en masse. Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent, a Trump appointee, said this week that the department's payment system will not be touched by Musk and that any decisions to stop payments would be made by other agencies.	https://www.voanews.com/a/us-judge-temporarily-blocks-musk-s-doge-from-accessing-payment-systems/7968292.html	2025-02-08T17:06:13-08:00	
Rescuers search for 30 people missing after landslide in China	BEIJING — Chinese rescuers searched for some 30 people after a landslide Saturday in southwestern Sichuan province buried 10 houses and forced hundreds of residents to evacuate. The Ministry of Emergency Management deployed hundreds of rescuers including firefighters following the landslide in a village in Junlian county. Two people were pulled out alive and about 200 others were relocated, state broadcaster CCTV said. A villager told Beijing News that rocks were frequently seen rolling down the mountain since the second half of 2024, in some cases making sounds similar to firecrackers. The villager said geologists had inspected the area late last year, the state-run newspaper reported. President Xi Jinping expressed his concern and urged authorities to make every effort to search for the missing people and minimize casualties, the official Xinhua news agency reported. Chinese Premier Li Qiang asked for an investigation and inspection of potential geological hazard risks in nearby areas. Li also said residents who were under threat should be evacuated to prevent another disaster, according to Xinhua. The National Development and Reform Commission has allocated $6.9 million from the central budget to support the emergency restoration of infrastructure and public service facilities.	https://www.voanews.com/a/rescuers-search-for-30-people-missing-after-landslide-in-china/7968291.html	2025-02-08T17:01:05-08:00	
Spending bill talks bog down after Trump's efforts to slash government	WASHINGTON — Before President Donald Trump and Republicans in Congress can enact much of their legislative agenda, they must deal with some unfinished business — completing work on the current budget year's spending bills. It's a task that by all accounts is not going well. The current stopgap measure lasts through March 14. After that, without congressional action, there would be a partial government shutdown. Five weeks is an eternity when it comes to resolving spending bills in Washington. But Trump's first weeks in office have escalated tensions between the two parties as the new administration reshapes agency priorities and dismantles existing programs without congressional approval. A look at where the talks stand: Republicans accuse Democrats of abandoning negotiations Republican and Democratic leaders of the two appropriations committees in Congress were holding spending bill talks in late January; aides said the two sides were committed to getting a deal done. But optimism has faded in recent days. 'Obviously, the Democrats are not in a good place right now, so they walked away from talks. But it'll have to resume,' House Majority Leader Steve Scalise, a Republican from Louisiana, said Thursday. House Speaker Mike Johnson, a Republican from Louisiana, gave a similar assessment, contending that comments by House Democratic leader Hakeem Jeffries of New York and some of his colleagues made it seem as though they are 'trying to set up some sort of government shutdown, which I think is very unfortunate. We were negotiating in good faith and trying to get the topline number, but so far as I know, they've been sort of unresponsive the last two days or so. So, I hope we can get back to it.' Representative Tom Cole, the chairman of the House Appropriations Committee, said he heard from Democratic lawmakers as recently as Thursday, so he did not believe they were walking away from talks. 'But we're not making the progress I would hope,' said Cole, a Republican from Oklahoma. Democrats dispute GOP leadership's characterization Connecticut Representative Rosa DeLauro, the lead Democrat on the House Appropriations Committee, said 'that is false' in response to the assertion that Democrats have withdrawn from negotiations. 'The Democrats have made their offer. We have not walked away from the table,' DeLauro said. Jeffries told reporters that DeLauro 'has been trying to get Republicans to respond to her for weeks.' 'I'm hopeful that Republicans are actually willing now to sit down at the table and reach a spending agreement in the best interest of the American people, not in the best interest of their billionaire donors,' Jeffries said. Tensions over topline spending levels Under terms of an agreement that former Speaker Kevin McCarthy, a Republican from California, worked out with then-President Joe Biden, spending for defense and non-defense would increase by 1% for the current budget year, which began October 1. That would bring the tallies to about $895.2 billion for defense and $780.4 billion for non-defense. Congress set the spending levels to grow below the rate of inflation, at the insistence of Republicans, as part of a package that also suspended the debt limit so that the federal government could continue paying its bills. Democrats say an agreement is an agreement. 'That is the path forward that will allow everyone to come together to reach a spending agreement that meets the needs of the American people,' Jeffries said. Republicans don't see it that way. Cole said Democrats should adjust to the reality of a Republican president in the White House and Republicans controlling both chambers of Congress. 'We have to remember the deal they are trying to enforce is when we had a Democratic president and a Democratic Senate. We don't have those anymore,' Cole said. 'And in particular, the president doesn't feel bound by an agreement made by another president that didn't go down on his watch.' Cole said that 'there's only one signature that matters right now and it's not Joe Biden's anymore.' Democrats wary as Trump, Musk revamp federal government Democrats are struggling to keep up and provide a unified response to Trump's first weeks in office as government workers are pushed to resign, entire agencies are dismantled, and Elon Musk's team from the Department of Government Efficiency gains access to sensitive information of countless Americans. They are worried about how current government services are being affected, with Democrats accusing the administration of blocking hundreds of billions of dollars in previously approved funding. Those concerns are also swaying their thinking as they approach the spending bill negotiations. 'The level of trust is at the lowest I have ever seen it here in Congress,' said Washington Senator Patty Murray, the top Democrat on the Senate Appropriations Committee. 'It is up to our Republican colleagues to stand up to this and assure us an agreement and a law is real.' DeLauro said Democrats need assurances that Republicans will follow through on whatever spending agreement the negotiators reach. 'You won some. I won some. We lost some each. But we have a deal. And that's got to be it. Those assurances have to be made,' DeLauro said. Plan B If lawmakers fail to reach agreement on a full-year spending measure, then it's possible that they could also pass another temporary measure to keep the government open for a few more weeks or months while they try to work out their differences. Such stopgap measures, called continuing resolutions (CRs), generally fund government programs and agencies at current levels. 'I don't want a CR,' Cole said. 'But I certainly prefer a CR to a shutdown.'	https://www.voanews.com/a/spending-bill-talks-bog-down-after-trump-s-efforts-to-slash-government-/7968287.html	2025-02-08T16:48:08-08:00	
Thailand leader seeks more cooperation with China	TAIPEI, TAIWAN — Thailand's prime minister, Paetongtarn Shinawatra, vowed to deepen cooperation with China to tackle the cyber scam centers that have troubled both countries, and she signed more than a dozen agreements to elevate bilateral economic ties between the two nations at the conclusion of her visit to China on Saturday. Some analysts say the Thai prime minister's four-day visit shows that Thailand is managing its relationship with China 'quite well.' 'The trip signaled that Thailand is willing to cooperate proactively on a number of fronts that will benefit Thailand economically and enhance Thailand's ability to protect its security interests in neighboring Myanmar,' said Hunter Marston, a research fellow at La Trobe University in Australia. Ahead of her first official visit to China since taking power last August, Paetongtarn said she hoped to demonstrate Thailand's commitment to crack down on illegal cyber scam centers operating in areas near the Thai-Myanmar-Chinese border. On Tuesday, Thai authorities announced they would suspend electricity to some border areas close to Myanmar, as the government intensified efforts to target cyberscam operations. Additionally, the Thai leader was seeking Beijing's help to boost Chinese tourist confidence in traveling to Thailand. The abduction of Chinese television actor Wang Xing from the Southeast Asian country to a scam center in neighboring Myanmar has sparked widespread concern among Chinese tourists about the risks of traveling to Thailand. During a bilateral meeting with Paetongtarn in Beijing on Wednesday, Chinese President Xi Jinping praised Thailand's 'efforts and effective measures' to combat online gambling and telecom fraud, and said both countries should 'strengthen law enforcement, security and judicial cooperation to safeguard the safety of people's lives and property.' Apart from promising to 'take resolute and effective measures' to combat cyber scam operations, the Thai prime minister also said she takes Chinese citizens' safety in her country 'seriously.' 'I personally looked into all the securities myself, I talked to the police, I talked to the military and everybody who is involved' ... 'to be able to take care of everybody that wants to come to Thailand,' Paetongtarn said during an interview this week with China's state-run China Daily. Experts say that while the willingness by China and Thailand to strengthen law enforcement cooperation could help push cyber scam centers farther away from the border region, it's unlikely to entirely root out illegal operations. The cyber scam operations 'will find some other place where they can slip to unless the Thais and the Chinese are willing to do significant cross-border operations into Myanmar,' said Ian Chong, a political scientist at the National University of Singapore. Paul Chambers, an expert on Southeast Asian affairs at Naresuan University in Thailand, told VOA that one potential risk of increasing law enforcement cooperation between Beijing and Bangkok is that there could be 'a much heightened and unaccountable Chinese police presence in Thailand.' And since the United States Agency for International Development used to be a 'major funder' of counter-human trafficking efforts in Thailand, Chong said the Trump administration's decision to freeze foreign aid could complicate Beijing and Bangkok's efforts to crack down on the cyber scam gangs. 'What the meeting between Xi and the Thai prime minister didn't talk about is who will provide the money to continue those programs,' he told VOA by phone. Deepening economic ties Apart from strengthening joint efforts to combat cyber scams, Thailand and China also are looking to deepen bilateral economic cooperation in areas like infrastructure, digital economy, and electric vehicles. One key project is the 609-kilometer-long high-speed railroad connecting Thailand with southern China through neighboring Laos, which Bangkok hopes to finish building by 2030. Chinese President Xi said he hoped both countries would 'promote the vision of interconnected development of China, Laos, and Thailand to achieve more fruitful outcomes as soon as possible'. Additionally, Thailand and China signed 14 agreements related to cooperation in artificial intelligence, green development, and fish product exports during Paetongtarn's meeting with Chinese Premier Li Qiang. Marston said, while China says the high-speed railway could help enhance their connectivity with regional countries, Thailand hopes to further develop key industries through deepened economic cooperation with Beijing. Bangkok hopes 'the relocation of Chinese manufacturing to Thailand could help them develop their own semiconductor and electric vehicle manufacturing capacity,' Marston told VOA by phone. Other analysts warn, however, that Thailand's enhanced cooperation with China over electric vehicles could adversely affect other countries' automobile manufacturing in Thailand. 'What may be good for China in the EV market may not necessarily be good for other countries, such as Japan, that have traditionally made automobiles and have supplied a lot of middle-class jobs in Thailand,' Mark Cogan, an expert on Southeast Asian affairs at Kansai Gaidai University in Japan, told VOA in a video interview via Zoom. As the United States threatens to impose tariffs against products from several countries, including longstanding allies like Canada, and vows to boycott global summits like the G20, Marston said China sees a window of opportunity to further relations with neighboring countries like Thailand. 'China will be making every effort to deepen relations with Southeast Asian countries and impress upon them the perception that the U.S. is not reliable,' he told VOA. Marston said while Thailand is trying to expand engagement with China, it also isn't distancing itself from the U.S., which has long been Bangkok's key security partner. 'Thailand is well positioned to continue its bamboo diplomacy, and we will likely see it maintain positive relations with both China and the U.S. in the years ahead,' he said.	https://www.voanews.com/a/thailand-leader-seeks-more-cooperation-with-china/7968278.html	2025-02-08T16:22:44-08:00	
Dozens killed in bus accident in southern Mexico	MEXICO CITY — More than three dozen people have died in an accident involving a bus in southern Mexico, local media reported Saturday, as local authorities expressed condolences to the families of the victims. The bus was traveling between Cancun and Tabasco, according to reports. 'We are attentive to the federal and state authorities to help with whatever they request,' said Ovidio Peralta, the mayor of Comalcalco, a town in Tabasco. Some 44 passengers were traveling on the bus, according to a list shared by the bus operator, Tours Acosta. 'Tours Acosta is profoundly sorry about what happened,' the company said in a post on Facebook, adding that it was working with authorities to find out what happened and that the bus had been traveling within speed limits. Authorities will give an update with details on the number of victims and their identities later Saturday, said the secretary of government of Tabasco, Ramiro Lopez.	https://www.voanews.com/a/dozens-killed-in-bus-accident-in-southern-mexico-/7968091.html	2025-02-08T14:59:08-08:00

US declares interest in developing African mining sector	CAPE TOWN, SOUTH AFRICA — The administration of U.S. President Donald Trump is interested in developing the mining sector in Africa. On the first day of his second term, Trump signed an executive order focusing on minerals, mineral extraction, and mineral processing. 'Mainly in the United States but if you read closely there are also multiple references in that executive order to international partnerships and you know, cooperating with partner nations,' said Scott Woodard, the acting deputy assistant secretary of state for energy transformation at the U.S. State Department. Woodard spoke at a recent African mining conference — also known as an indaba — in Cape Town, South Africa. Moderator Zainab Usman, director of the Africa Program at the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace, asked Woodard whether the U.S. understands that in addition to mineral extraction, Africans want projects that add value to the raw material in order to boost the continent's industrialization. Woodard replied that the Trump administration is still putting together its policies. In recent years, America's investment in the African minerals needed for cleaner energy has been driven by the Export-Import Bank of the United States. In 2022, the U.S. entered into agreements with the Democratic Republic of Congo and Zambia to establish a supply chain for electric vehicle batteries, underscoring its interest in both countries' copper, lithium and cobalt resources. The U.S. also has funded the rebuilding of the Lobito Rail Corridor, which will transport minerals from Congo, Zambia and Angola on the west coast. Speaking in the exhibition hall during the indaba, Zambia's minister of transport and logistics, Frank Tayali, thanked the U.S. for its leadership. 'We have something like a $350 billion gap in terms of infrastructure gap financing that the continent needs,' said Tayali. 'Now this focus on infrastructure development is really key in helping the African economies to be able to improve so that they are able to look after their people more effectively.' China, meanwhile, is invested in rehabilitating the Tanzania-Zambia Railway Authority — known as TAZARA — to bolster rail and sea transport in East Africa. And in South Africa, the conference's host country, transport and logistics problems at the state-owned Transnet railway system are being considered. 'The CEO of Transnet is very open about the state of the rail network,' said Allan Seccombe, head of communications at the Minerals Council of South Africa. ' ... it needs a lot of work.' How will they raise the money? 'They are going out on public tenders to try and get that investment in,' said Allan Seccombe, head of communications at the Minerals Council of South Africa. 'Also, significantly they're speaking to their customers who are by and large, large mining companies to maybe through tariffs they can invest in the rail network, improve it, then have private trains they can operate on the network.'	https://www.voanews.com/a/us-declares-interest-in-developing-african-mining-sector-/7968007.html	2025-02-08T13:49:54-08:00	
Trump administration sends third flight of detainees to Guantanamo	PENTAGON — The top U.S. homeland security official got a firsthand look at the detention center at Guantanamo Bay, visiting the U.S. naval base in Cuba on Friday, posting video of what appears to be a third flight of 'high-threat illegal aliens' to arrive at the facility. Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem shared details of her visit on her official account on the X social media platform, promising, 'Vicious gang members will no longer have safe haven in our country.' Noem did not share details about how many detainees were offloaded from what appeared to be a military cargo jet or about the crimes with which they are charged or of which they are suspected of having committed. The Homeland Security Department and U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement have yet to respond to requests for details. U.S. Southern Command, which oversees operations at Guantanamo Bay, did not comment on the number of flights but told VOA Saturday that the detention facility is now housing 'over three dozen individuals.' SOUTHCOM also said it 'is prepared to support operations for holding illegal aliens as directed by the Department of Defense' and that any new arrivals 'will be treated safely and humanely in accordance with international humanitarian standards.' Immigrants' rights groups, including the American Civil Liberties Union, on Friday sent DHS, the State Department and the Pentagon a letter demanding information and immediate access to the individuals sent to the prison facility at Guantanamo Bay. 'The Constitution, and federal and international law prohibit the government from using Guantánamo as a legal black hole,' the groups stated. 'We therefore request that the government provide our organizations access to the noncitizens detained at Guantánamo so that those individuals will have access to legal counsel, and so advocates and the public can understand the conditions under which the government is detaining them.' Noem, in another post on X late Friday, said she was at Guantanamo Bay 'checking out some of the operations we're standing up to house the worst of the worst and illegal criminals that are in the United States of America.' 'They won't be there for long,' she added, while also thanking U.S. President Donald Trump for his hard work to 'make America safe again.' Noem's visit to Guantanamo Bay came a day after the arrival of a second flight of 'high-threat illegal aliens,' whom she described on social media as 'murderers & vicious gang members.' In a separate post, earlier Friday, Noem said the detainees were all Venezuelan gang members. She said one detainee had confessed to murder, while others were wanted for attempted murder, assault, weapons trafficking and impersonation. A U.S. official, speaking to VOA on the condition of anonymity to discuss the operation, said Thursday's flight aboard a U.S. military cargo plane carried 13 'high threat' individuals. DHS has not yet provided charging documents or other details regarding the crimes the detainees are accused of committing. The first 10 undocumented migrants arrived at the detention facility Tuesday, also on board a C-17. Officials have said all the migrants are being held in jail cells under the supervision of officers with ICE. Homeland security officials said the 10 migrants who arrived Tuesday were members of Tren de Aragua, a Venezuelan street gang with transnational reach. Officials did not say when or how they were first taken into custody. The White House has announced plans to designate Tren de Aragua as a Foreign Terrorist Organization. U.S. defense officials have called the detention of the high-threat migrants at Guantanamo Bay detention facility a temporary measure. Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth on Friday emphasized the military's commitment under President Donald Trump to secure the U.S. southern border with Mexico. 'We've seen an invasion,' Hegseth told a town hall meeting with Pentagon employees. 'From people all around the world who I'm sure many of them want to seek a better life. I understand that.' 'But we also don't know who millions of them are, what their intentions are, why they're here,' he said. 'That creates a very real national security threat.' Since Trump's executive order last month, the Pentagon has deployed hundreds of Marines to Guantanamo to expand the facilities to support holding operations for undocumented immigrants. That includes preparing the detention center, known mostly for housing military prisoners and terror suspects, including those involved in the September 11, 2001, attacks and members of the Taliban. It also includes setting up tents and other facilities to house non-violent migrants on another section of the base to prepare for as many as 30,000 migrants who will stay there until they can be deported to their countries of origin or to other countries willing to take them. Closing Guantanamo Democratic administrations under Barack Obama and Joe Biden had sought to close the detention camp, which was built by the George W. Bush administration in 2002, following the U.S. invasion of Afghanistan that began shortly after the 9/11 attacks of 2001. Human rights groups have criticized the Trump administration's move to use Guantanamo as a holding center for migrants, some warning it would amount to a human rights catastrophe. At its height during the global war on terror, the detention facility held about 680 prisoners. As of January 6, there were just 15 detainees at the facility, according to the Pentagon. Before being used to detain terror suspects, the U.S. naval facility also was used to house migrants from Cuba and Haiti in the early 1990s.

Hundreds protest in London against proposed 'mega embassy' for China	Hundreds of demonstrators protested Saturday at a site earmarked for Beijing's controversial new embassy in London over human rights and security concerns. The new embassy, if approved by the U.K. government, would be the 'biggest Chinese Embassy in Europe,' one lawmaker said earlier. Protester Iona Boswell, a 40-year-old social worker, told AFP said there was 'no need for a mega embassy here' and that she believed it would be used to facilitate the 'harassment of dissidents.' China has for several years been trying to relocate its embassy, currently in the British capital's upmarket Marylebone district, to the sprawling historic site in the shadow of the Tower of London. The move has sparked fierce opposition from nearby residents, rights groups, critics of China's ruling Communist Party and others. 'This is about the future of our freedom, not just the site of a Chinese Embassy in London,' Conservative Party lawmaker Tom Tugendhat told AFP at the protest, adding that people living in the U.K. have been threatened by Chinese state agents. 'I think it would be a threat to all of us because we would see an increase in economic espionage... and an increase in the silencing of opponents of the Chinese Communist Party (in the U.K.),' the former security minister added. Housing the Royal Mint, the official maker of British coins, for nearly two centuries, the site was earlier home to a 1348-built Cistercian abbey but is currently derelict. Beijing bought it for a reported $327 million in 2018. 'It will be like a headquarter (for China) to catch the (Hong Kong) people in the U.K. to (send them) back to China,' said another protester dressed in black and wearing a full face mask, giving his name only as 'Zero,' a member of 'Hongkongers in Leeds,' the northern English city. The protest comes as British Prime Minister Keir Starmer, elected last July, wants more engagement with Beijing following years of deteriorating relations over various issues, in particular China's rights crackdown in Hong Kong. In November, Starmer became the first U.K. prime minister since 2018 to meet Chinese President Xi Jinping, when the pair held talks at the G20 summit in Brazil. A national planning inspector will now hold a public inquiry into the project, but Communities Secretary Angela Rayner will make the final decision. Opponents fear the Labour government's emphasis on economic growth, and improved China ties, could trump other considerations.	https://www.voanews.com/a/hundreds-protest-in-london-against-proposed-mega-embassy-for-china/7968055.html	2025-02-08T13:06:08-08:00	
Emboldened by Trump, Iranian dissidents demand overthrow of rulers	PARIS — Thousands of opponents to Iran's authorities rallied in Paris on Saturday, joined by Ukrainians to call for the fall of the government in Tehran, hopeful that U.S. President Donald Trump's 'maximum pressure' campaign could lead to change in the country. The protest, organized by the Paris-based National Council of Resistance of Iran, which is banned in Iran, comes as two of the group's members face imminent execution with a further six sentenced to death in November. 'We say your demise has arrived. With or without negotiations, with or without nuclear weapons, uprising and overthrow await you,' NCRI President-elect Maryam Rajavi said in a speech. People from across Europe, some bussed in for the event, waved Iranian flags and chanted anti-government slogans amid images deriding Iran's Supreme Leader Ali Khamenei. Hundreds of Ukrainians accusing Iran of backing Russian President Vladimir Putin in the war against Ukraine joined the protest. Iryna Serdiuk, 37, a nurse turned interpreter originally from Ukraine's embattled Donbas region and now exiled in Germany, said she had come to Paris to join forces against a common enemy. 'I'm happy to see these Iranians because they are opposition. They support Ukraine and not the Iranian government which gives Russia weapons. We are together and one day it will be victory for Ukraine and Iran too,' she said. The NCRI, also known by its Persian name Mujahideen-e-Khalq, was once listed as a terrorist organization by the United States and the European Union until 2012. While its critics question its support inside Iran and how it operates, it remains one of the few opposition groups able to rally supporters. Mohammad Sabetraftar, 63, an Iranian in exile for 40 years and who now runs a taxi business in the United Kingdom, dismissed criticism of the NCRI saying that it was the only alternative capable of achieving democracy in Iran. 'What we expect from Mr. Trump or any Western politician is to not support this government. We don't need money, we don't need weapons, we rely on the people. No ties with the regime, no connections and put as much pressure on this government.' Tehran has long called for a crackdown on the NCRI in Paris, Riyadh, and Washington. The group is regularly criticized in state media. In January, Trump's Ukraine envoy spoke at a conference organized by the group in Paris. At the time, he outlined the president's plan to return to a policy of maximum pressure on Iran that sought to wreck its economy, forcing the country to negotiate a deal on its nuclear and ballistic missile programs, and regional activities. Homa Sabetraftar, 16, a schoolgirl in Britain, said she felt it was her duty to come to the event to represent the youth of Iran. 'Some people in Iran don't have that voice and aren't able to vocalize as freely as we are able to here,' she said. 'We need to push for a better future.'	https://www.voanews.com/a/emboldened-by-trump-iranian-dissidents-demand-overthrow-of-rulers-/7968042.html	2025-02-08T12:47:46-08:00	
Massive protest in Germany against far-right AfD ahead of election	MUNICH, GERMANY — More than 200,000 protesters rallied in Munich, Germany, on Saturday against far-right extremism ahead of the country's general election. The far-right, anti-immigrant Alternative for Germany, or AfD, is in second place in recent polls and has prompted widespread protests across the country before voters cast their ballots on Feb. 23. The protest at Munich's Theresienwiese — where Oktoberfest takes place each year — brought a significantly larger crowd than expected, according to the German dpa news agency. The event's organizer estimated the crowd could be up to 320,000 people, many of whom carried signs against the AfD with slogans like, 'Racism and hatred is not an alternative.' The protest was supported by activist groups as well as the Munich Film Festival, churches and Munich soccer clubs FC Bayern and TSV 1860, among others. Police told dpa that the demonstration was peaceful. Similar protests attracted large crowds Saturday in Hanover, Rostock and elsewhere in Germany, mirroring other demonstrations that have occurred across the country in recent weeks. Last month at Berlin’s Brandenburg Gate, a huge crowd blew whistles, sang antifascist songs and carried banners denouncing AfD. Activists said they hoped the rally also would draw attention to other far-right parties in Europe and the new administration of U.S. President Donald Trump. Demonstrators have recently also opposed Friedrich Merz, the center-right leader and front-runner in the upcoming election, and his Christian Democrats for last month sending to parliament proposals for tough new migration rules that received AfD's backing. The protesters say Merz and his party broke Germany’s unwritten post-Nazi promise by all democratic parties to never pass any rule or resolution in parliament with the support of far-right, nationalist parties like the AfD. Merz insists his position is unchanged and that he didn’t and won’t work with the party. The 12-year-old AfD entered the national parliament in 2017, benefiting from then-Chancellor Angela Merkel ’s decision two years earlier to allow large numbers of migrants into the country.	https://www.voanews.com/a/massive-protest-in-germany-against-far-right-afd-ahead-of-election/7968003.html	2025-02-08T11:09:11-08:00	
White South Africans reject Trump’s resettlement plan	CAPE TOWN, SOUTH AFRICA — Groups representing some of South Africa's white minority responded Saturday to a plan by President Donald Trump to offer them refugee status and resettlement in the United States by saying: thanks, but no thanks. The plan was detailed in an executive order Trump signed Friday that stopped all aid and financial assistance to South Africa as punishment for what the Trump administration said were 'rights violations' by the government against some of its white citizens. The Trump administration accused the South African government of allowing violent attacks on white Afrikaner farmers and introducing a land expropriation law that enables it to 'seize ethnic minority Afrikaners' agricultural property without compensation.' The South African government has denied there are any concerted attacks on white farmers and has said that Trump's description of the new land law is full of misinformation and distortions. On Saturday, two of the most prominent groups representing Afrikaners said they would not be taking up Trump's offer of resettlement in the U.S. 'Our members work here, and want to stay here, and they are going to stay here,' said Dirk Hermann, chief executive of the Afrikaner trade union Solidarity, which says it represents about 2 million people. 'We are committed to build a future here. We are not going anywhere.' At the same news conference, Kallie Kriel, the CEO of the Afrikaner lobby group AfriForum, said: 'We have to state categorically: We don’t want to move elsewhere.' Trump's move to sanction South Africa, a key U.S. trading partner in Africa, came after he and his South African-born adviser Elon Musk accused its Black leadership of having an anti-white stance. But the portrayal of Afrikaners as a downtrodden group that needed to be saved would surprise most South Africans. 'It is ironic that the executive order makes provision for refugee status in the U.S. for a group in South Africa that remains amongst the most economically privileged,' South Africa's Foreign Ministry said. There was 'a campaign of misinformation and propaganda' aimed at South Africa, the ministry said. Whites in South Africa still generally have a much better standard of living than Blacks more than 30 years after the end of the apartheid system of white minority rule in 1994. Despite being a small minority, whites still own about 70% of South Africa's private farmland. A study in 2021 by the South Africa Human Rights Commission said 1% of whites were living in poverty compared with 64% of Blacks. Trump's action against South Africa has given international attention to a sentiment among some white South Africans that they are being discriminated against as a form of payback for apartheid. The leaders of the apartheid government were Afrikaners. Solidarity, AfriForum and others are strongly opposed to the new land expropriation law, saying it will target land owned by whites who have worked to develop that land for years. They also say an equally contentious language law that's recently been passed seeks to remove or limit their Afrikaans language in schools, while they have often criticized South Africa's affirmative action policies in business that promote the interests of Blacks as racist laws. 'This government is allowing a certain section of the population to be targeted,' said AfriForum's Kriel, who thanked Trump for raising the case of Afrikaners. The South African government says the laws that have been criticized are aimed at the incredibly difficult task of redressing the wrongs of colonialism and then nearly a half-century of apartheid, when Blacks were stripped of their land and almost all their rights.	https://www.voanews.com/a/white-south-africans-reject-trump-s-resettlement-plan/7967974.html	2025-02-08T10:23:06-08:00	
White House order halts Myanmar refugee resettlement deal with Thailand	BANGKOK — The head of a Thai parliamentary committee that oversees border affairs and refugee camp officials told VOA the suspension by the United States of refugee admissions has halted a resettlement deal the U.S. struck with Thailand last year to take in thousands of Myanmar families. About 90,000 refugees from Myanmar are in Thailand in a string of nine sealed-off camps along the countries’ shared border. Some have lived in the camps since the mid-1980s, fleeing decades of fighting between Myanmar’s military and ethnic-minority rebel groups vying for autonomy. Most are ethnic minority Karen. After more than a year of talks and planning, the United States agreed to start taking in some of the refugees last year, although the U.S. State Department would not say how many of them might resettle. However, Thai lawmaker Rangsiman Rome, and an aid worker previously told VOA that local United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees staff told them in 2023 that it could be up to 10,000 per year, a claim the U.N. would not confirm or deny. The first groups of 25 families left the camps for the United States in July. U.S. President Donald Trump said that during the previous four years — the term of former President Joe Biden — 'the United States has been inundated with record levels of migration, including through the U.S. Refugee Admissions Program,' and he suspended the program by executive order Jan. 20, effective a week later. The administration is allowing only case-by-case exceptions, 'until such time as the further entry into the United States of refugees aligns with the interests of the United States.' The U.S. Embassy in Bangkok declined to comment to VOA on the order’s impact on the resettlement deal the United States and Thailand struck last year. Asked about the deal’s fate, a U.S. State Department spokesperson told VOA it was 'coordinating with implementing partners to suspend refugee arrivals to the United States' and refused further comment. Rangsiman, who chairs the Thai House of Representatives National Security, Border Affairs, National Strategy and National Reform Committee, which monitors the refugee camps, confirmed Friday that Trump's order has put a stop to the deal, at least for the time being. 'We are aware that the deal is on hold but still waiting for updates from related departments if this deal can be renegotiated,' he told VOA. Officials and spokespersons for the Thai government and ministries involved in managing the deal either refused to speak with VOA or did not reply to requests for comment. Camp administrators told VOA that all work vetting and preparing the refugees in the camps for resettlement to the U.S., including interviews and medical checks, has stopped since the White House order. 'After the 20th, after the announcement, everything stopped,' said Nido, who goes by one name, the vice chairman of the committee managing day-to-day operations at the Umpiem camp in Tak province. 'On the 27th, many people from the camp had to go for their second vaccination. The doctors and nurses were there already preparing to vaccinate. But when the people arrived, they said there were some changes, so they had to stop the vaccination process. They told the people they will have to stop this process for a while, but they could not say for how long,' he said. 'The interviews, the vaccinations — they had to stop it.' Bweh Say, secretary of the Karen Refugee Committee that oversees the individual camp committees, said he was told by UNHCR staff that resettlement work was on hold across all the camps. 'Some of their staff, when we sit together, we talk together … they said [it has] stopped,' he said. The UNHCR has been helping Thailand and the United States run the resettlement program, but it refused to comment to VOA on the impact of the suspension of the U.S. refugee admissions program, USRAP. Camp officials and refugee advocates say the deal between Thailand and the U.S. was the only foreseeable chance in the near term for thousands of families to have a future other than as permanent refugees. The Myanmar military’s overthrow of a democratically elected government in 2021 amplified violence in the country, setting off a civil war that has killed thousands of civilians. Thailand itself will not allow the refugees to settle outside the camps and mostly denies them the chance to work or study outside the camps legally. Aid and advocacy groups that work with the refugees have described rising despair, drug abuse and violence. No other country besides the United States has taken up Thailand’s call to resettle the refugees in large numbers. 'This [deal] is very important for the refugees. Some of us have been staying in the camps for decades — two or almost three. Children have been born here,' said Nido, a refugee himself who fled Myanmar nearly 20 years ago. 'The situation in Myanmar now is very terrible,' he said. 'A lot of conflict and fighting. It’s not possible to go back. It’s also not possible to be recognized as a Thai national or to get Thai ID, and when you’re stateless, it is very hard to move around or find work.' Inside the camps, jobs are hard to come by except for running a small shop or working with an aid group for a modest stipend. Schools are barred from teaching the Thai curriculum or language, leaving little chance for a higher education. Monthly food allowances, funded by international donors, barely keep pace with inflation. Since Trump took office, the dismantling of the U.S. Agency for International Development also has compelled the clinics it was funding across the camps to close, forcing the refugees onto Thailand’s own public health care system. The Thai government has vowed to plug the gap, but media reports say it is struggling. Some critics say the USAID programs are wasteful and promote an agenda that fosters dependence without addressing the root of the problem. A Justice Department official, Brett Shumate, said Friday, 'The president has decided there is corruption and fraud at USAID,' although he did not detail the alleged mismanagement. 'If they could return [to Myanmar], if the situation [were] safe, of course everyone would want to return to their homes. But since it is impossible, then resettlement is one of their first options,' said Wahkushee Tenner, a former refugee from the camps who now runs the Karen Peace Support Network, a nongovernment group based in Thailand that advocates for the Karen. 'Resettlement is not the best option,' she said, 'but there is no best … option.'	https://www.voanews.com/a/white-house-order-halts-myanmar-refugee-resettlement-deal-with-thailand/7967957.html	2025-02-08T10:07:59-08:00	
African leaders call for 'immediate ceasefire' at DRC summit	BUKAVU, DEMOCRATIC REPUBLIC OF CONGO — A summit of African leaders meeting to address the crisis in the Democratic Republic of Congo on Saturday called for an 'immediate and unconditional ceasefire' within five days. The M23 armed rebel group has rapidly seized swathes of territory in the mineral-rich eastern DRC in an offensive that has left thousands dead and displaced vast numbers. The DRC government has officially designated the M23 rebel group as a terrorist organization, while the United Nations and the United States classify it as an armed rebel group. The summit in Tanzania brought together Rwandan President Paul Kagame and his Congolese counterpart, Felix Tshisekedi, as well as leaders from the East African Community bloc and 16-member Southern African Development Community. Kagame appeared in person, while Tshisekedi joined via video call. In the final statement, the summit called for army chiefs from both communities 'to meet within five days and provide technical direction on an immediate and unconditional ceasefire.' It also called for the opening of humanitarian corridors to evacuate the dead and injured. Meanwhile, fighting was ongoing about 60 kilometers from the South Kivu provincial capital of Bakuvu, local and security sources told AFP. The M23 took the strategic city of Goma, capital of North Kivu province, last week and is pushing into neighboring South Kivu in the latest episode of decadeslong turmoil in the region. Local fears Since the M23 reemerged in 2021, peace talks hosted by Angola and Kenya have failed and multiple ceasefires have collapsed. While Rwanda continues to deny supporting the M23 militarily, a report by United Nations experts said last year Rwanda had around 4,000 troops in the DRC and profited from smuggling out of the country vast amounts of gold and coltan — a mineral vital for phones and laptops. Rwanda accuses the DRC of sheltering the Democratic Forces for the Liberation of Rwanda, an armed group created by ethnic Hutus who massacred Tutsis during the 1994 Rwandan genocide. The summit comes amid reports that the M23 is closing on the town of Kavumu in South Kivu, which hosts an airport critical to supplying Congolese troops. There have also been reports of panic in the provincial capital, Bukavu, as residents board up shops and seek to escape. 'The border with Rwanda is open but almost impassable because of the number of people trying to cross. It's total chaos,' they said. Gang rape, slavery U.N. rights chief Volker Turk warned Friday: 'If nothing is done, the worst may be yet to come for the people of the eastern DRC but also beyond the country's borders.' Turk said that nearly 3,000 people had been confirmed killed and 2,880 wounded since the M23 entered Goma on Jan. 26, and that the final tolls were likely to be much higher. He also said his team was 'currently verifying multiple allegations of rape, gang rape and sexual slavery.' M23 has already installed its own mayor and local authorities in Goma. It has vowed to march all the way to the national capital, Kinshasa, even though the city lies about 1,600 kilometers away across the vast country, which is roughly the size of Western Europe. The DRC army, which has a reputation for poor training and corruption, has been forced into multiple retreats. The M23 offensive has raised fears of a regional war, given that several countries are supporting the DRC militarily, including South Africa, Burundi and Malawi.	https://www.voanews.com/a/african-leaders-call-for-immediate-ceasefire-at-drc-summit/7967909.html	2025-02-08T08:51:04-08:00	
Lebanese leader forms new government, pledges reforms	BEIRUT — Lebanon formed a new government Saturday, following unusually direct U.S. intervention in the process and in a step intended to bring the country closer to accessing reconstruction funds following a devastating war between Israel and Hezbollah. Speaking to reporters at the presidential palace, new Prime Minister Nawaf Salam said the 24-member Cabinet would prioritize financial reforms, reconstruction and the implementation of a United Nations resolution seen as a cornerstone to stability on the Lebanese border with Israel. The announcement came after more than three weeks of talks with rival political parties in Lebanon — where government posts are parceled out according to sect — and days of deadlock over the Shiite Muslim ministers, usually named by Iran-backed Hezbollah and its Shiite ally Amal. But Washington pushed back against Hezbollah's sway in any new government. U.S. Deputy Middle East Envoy Morgan Ortagus said on Friday that the U.S. considered Hezbollah's involvement in the new Cabinet a 'red line' and thanked Israel for dealing devastating blows to the group, in a controversial statement that sparked protests in Lebanon. But ultimately, Hezbollah's ally Amal — which is headed by Parliament Speaker Nabih Berri — was allowed to choose four of the new Cabinet's members, including the finance minister Yassin Jaber, and give its nod of approval to a fifth. The Cabinet is now charged with drafting a policy statement — a broad outline of the upcoming government's approach and priorities — and will then need a vote of confidence from Lebanon's Parliament to be fully empowered. Joseph Aoun, who enjoyed U.S. backing as army commander, was elected president on Jan. 9 and nominated Salam to form a new government days later. Salam had been serving as the head of the International Court of Justice. Salam's nomination was the latest signal of a dramatic shift in the power balance in Lebanon, following the heavy blows Israel dealt to Hezbollah, the ousting in December of Hezbollah's Syrian ally Bashar al-Assad and Aoun's election last month.	https://www.voanews.com/a/lebanese-leader-forms-new-government-pledges-reforms/7967899.html	2025-02-08T08:27:29-08:00	
Modi’s party wins majority in New Delhi polls, first time in 27 years	NEW DELHI — Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s ruling Hindu nationalist party won the most seats in the high-stakes state legislature election in the country’s federal territory, including New Delhi, for the first time in over a quarter-century, according to official data Saturday. Modi’s Bharatiya Janata Party won 47 seats in the 70-member assembly that includes India’s capital of 20 million people, ousting the Aam Aadmi Party, or AAP, that ruled New Delhi since 2015. The AAP won 22 seats. The outcome of the race in one remaining seat had yet to be declared, according to the Election Commission of India. India's main opposition Congress party lost on all seats for the third consecutive term. In a major upset, the AAP founder and leader Arvind Kejriwal and his deputy, Manish Sisodia, lost their seats despite their party having built widespread support with its welfare policies and anticorruption movement. 'We accept the mandate of the people with great humility,' Kejriwal said in a video statement while congratulating the BJP on its victory. He said he hoped that the BJP would fulfil its election promises. 'We have done a lot of work in the field of health, education and infrastructure in the last 10 years,' Kejriwal said. 'We will not only play the role of a constructive opposition but will also remain among the people and continue to serve them.' Waving party flags and posters of Modi, supporters of the BJP chanted slogans and danced outside its headquarters in the capital as vote results began trickling with most exit polls predicting the party's win. Pledges on schools and health services The BJP's Amit Shah, who is India's powerful home minister, said his party's victory signified that 'people can’t be misled with lies every time.' He said under the leadership of Modi, the BJP would make New Delhi 'the world’s No. 1 capital by fulfilling all promises.' 'Our victory is a sign of the people’s faith in Prime Minister Modi’s vision of progress,' he said in a statement. Saturday’s victory is seen as a big boost for the BJP after it failed to secure a majority on its own in last year’s national election but formed the government with coalition partners. It gained some lost ground by winning two state elections in northern Haryana and western Maharashtra states last year. Ahead of the election, Modi’s party slashed income taxes on the salaried middle class, one of its key voting blocs, in the federal budget. During the electioneering, Modi and Kejriwal offered to revamp government schools and provide free health services and electricity, along with a monthly stipend of over 2,000 rupees ($25) to poor women. Federal investigations Kejriwal was arrested last year along with two key party leaders on charges of receiving bribes from a liquor distributor. They have denied the accusations, saying they are part of a political conspiracy. The Supreme Court allowed the release of Kejriwal and other ministers on bail. Kejriwal later relinquished the chief minister’s post to his most senior party leader, Atishi, who won her seat Saturday. Opposition parties widely condemned Kejriwal’s arrest, accusing Modi’s government of misusing federal investigation agencies to harass and weaken political opponents. They pointed to several raids, arrests and corruption investigations of key opposition figures before the national election. Kejriwal formed the AAP in 2012 after tapping into public anger over corruption scandals.

More than 50 killed in convoy ambush in Mali, sources say	More than 50 people were killed near Mali's northeastern city of Gao on Friday after armed assailants ambushed their convoy and its army escort, a local official and residents said. The attackers struck near the village of Kobe, around 30 kilometers from Gao in a region where affiliates of Islamic State and al-Qaida have been active for over a decade, destabilizing Mali and neighboring Burkina Faso and Niger. 'People jumped out of vehicles to flee. There were many dead and wounded civilians,' the local official said on Saturday, speaking on condition of anonymity due to security concerns. Up to 56 bodies were recorded at the hospital in Gao, the official said, adding that there also was an unknown number of military casualties. The Malian army did not immediately respond to a request for comment. A Gao resident also said about 50 were killed and vehicles torched. Deadly attacks have become so frequent that the military organizes near-daily escorts, the resident said. The insurgencies took root in Mali's arid north following a Tuareg separatist rebellion in 2012. The Islamist militants have since spread to other countries in the impoverished central Sahel region south of the Sahara. The attacks have killed thousands of people and contributed to a humanitarian crisis with upwards of 3.2 million people displaced as of January, according to the International Organization for Migration.	https://www.voanews.com/a/more-than-50-killed-in-convoy-ambush-in-mali-sources-say/7967744.html	2025-02-08T05:18:42-08:00	
Zelenskyy hints at ‘intensive’ talks with Trump as US, Ukraine discuss peace deal	Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy has not confirmed that he will meet with U.S. President Donald Trump next week but said the coming weeks may be 'very intensive in diplomacy.' Trump said on Feb. 7 that he is likely to meet with Zelenskyy next week. The site of the meeting 'could be Washington,' he said, adding that he would not be going to Kyiv. He also said he would 'probably' be speaking with Russian President Vladimir Putin soon but did not give a time frame. Zelenskyy said it is important that he and Trump meet in person before the U.S. president meets with Putin. Zelenskyy did not confirm a meeting with Trump but said diplomacy would be ramping up. 'The coming weeks may be very intensive in diplomacy, and we will do what’s needed to make this time effective and productive. We always appreciate working with President Trump,' he said shortly after Trump spoke. 'Weʼre also planning meetings and talks at the teams’ level. Right now Ukrainian and American teams are working out the details. A solid, lasting peace shall become closer.' In his comments earlier at the White House, the U.S. president reiterated that he is interested in tying continued military aid to access to Ukraine's raw materials. 'One of the things we're looking at with President Zelenskyy is having the security of their assets. They have assets underground, rare earth and other things, but primarily rare earth,' he said. 'We're looking to do a deal with Ukraine where they're going to secure what we're giving them with their rare earths and other things,' Trump said on Feb. 3. He said on Feb. 7 that the United States wants 'an equal amount of something' in exchange for U.S. support. 'We would like them to equalize,' Trump said. More than four dozen minerals, including several types of rare earths, nickel, and lithium, are considered critical to the U.S. economy and national defense. Ukraine has large deposits of uranium, lithium, and titanium. Ukraine floated the idea of opening its critical minerals to investment by allies last year when it presented its plan to end the war and now suggests it could be open to a deal. 'If we are talking about a deal, then let's do a deal. We are only for it,' Zelenskyy said on Feb. 7, emphasizing Ukraine's need for security guarantees from its allies as part of any settlement of the war. 'Strong security always has many elements, and each one matters,' he said on X. 'Ukraine possesses some of the largest strategic resource reserves in Europe, and protecting Ukraine also means protecting these resources.' Less than 20% of Ukraine's mineral resources, including about half its rare earth deposits, are under Russian occupation, Zelenskyy said in an interview with Reuters published on Feb. 7. Moscow could open those resources to North Korea and Iran if it maintains its hold on the territories. 'We need to stop Putin and protect what we have -- a very rich Dnipro region, central Ukraine,' he told Reuters. Zelenskyy is likely to further discuss the idea with allies next week at the Munich Security Conference. Trump's special envoy for Ukraine and Russia, Keith Kellogg, said this week he plans to attend the conference, but denied a report that he will present Trump’s plan for ending the war in Ukraine at the gathering, which starts Feb. 14. Andriy Yermak, Zelenskyy's chief of staff, said he had spoken to Kellogg about the battlefield situation, the safety of Ukrainian civilians, and meetings at the annual security conference. He also said Ukraine is looking forward to Kellogg’s visit later this month. Some information for this report came from Reuters and dpa.	https://www.voanews.com/a/zelenskyy-hints-at-intensive-talks-with-trump-as-us-ukraine-discuss-peace-deal/7967709.html	2025-02-08T02:41:58-08:00	
Baltics begin decoupling from Russian power grid	VILNIUS, LITHUANIA — The Baltic states on Saturday began cutting ties with Russia's power grid in order to integrate with Europe's system, a years-long process that gained urgency with Moscow's invasion of Ukraine. Estonia, Latvia and Lithuania -- all former Soviet republics now in the European Union and NATO -- are leaving Russia's grid to prevent Moscow from weaponizing it against them. 'We are now removing Russia's ability to use the electricity system as a tool of geopolitical blackmail,' Lithuania's Energy Minister Zygimantas Vaiciunas told AFP. EU foreign policy chief Kaja Kallas -- Estonia's former prime minister -- hailed the move on X as 'a victory for freedom and European unity.' Lithuania was the first of the three Baltic countries to decouple from the Moscow-controlled electricity network, Lithuania's state-run grid operator Litgrid said Saturday. 'I can confirm that Lithuania's electricity exchange lines with Kaliningrad and Belarus were disconnected at 07:43' local time (0543 GMT), Litgrid spokesperson Matas Noreika told AFP. Estonia and Latvia were due to follow suit by 0700 GMT, he added. Official celebrations are planned across the Baltics, although some consumers worry about disruptions to supply including from potential cyberattacks. Latvia will physically cut a power line to Russia on Saturday and European Commission president Ursula von der Leyen is to attend a ceremony with Baltic leaders in Vilnius on Sunday. 'We are ready,' Lithuanian Prime Minister Gintautas Paluckas said on X, calling the weekend 'the beginning of a new era of our energy independence.' The Baltics have long prepared to integrate with the European grid but faced technological and financial issues. The switch became more urgent after Russia invaded Ukraine in 2022, spooking the Baltic states into thinking they could be targeted. They stopped purchasing Russian gas and electricity after the invasion, but their power grids remained connected to Russia and Belarus, controlled from Moscow. This left them dependent on Moscow for a stable electricity flow, which is crucial for factories and facilities requiring a reliable power supply. 'Possible provocations' After the Baltic states disconnect from the Russian grid, they will operate in so-called 'isolated mode' for about 24 hours to test their frequency, or power levels. 'We need to carry out some tests to assure Europe that we are a stable energy system,' said Rokas Masiulis, head of Litgrid. 'We'll switch power stations on and off, observe how the frequency fluctuates and assess our ability to control it.' The states will then integrate into the European power grid via Poland. Authorities have warned of potential risks linked to the change. 'Various short-term risks are possible, such as kinetic operations against critical infrastructure, cyberattacks and disinformation campaigns,' Lithuania's state security department told AFP. Poland's power grid operator PSE said it will use helicopters and drones to patrol the connection with Lithuania. Latvian President Edgars Rinkevics told LTV1 the countries were 'maximally ready' for the switch, but said they could not 'rule out possible provocations.' In Estonia, police and volunteer defense corps will man critical electrical infrastructure until the following weekend because of the risk of sabotage. Several undersea telecom and power cables have been severed in the Baltic Sea in recent months. Some experts and politicians have accused Russia of waging a hybrid war, an allegation Moscow denies. 'People won't feel it' A total of $1.7 billion -- mostly EU funds -- has been invested in the synchronization project across the Baltic states and Poland. Lithuanian President Gitanas Nauseda was sure the switch would go smoothly, telling reporters: 'People won't feel it, either in terms of their bills or any inconvenience.' Estonia's climate ministry urged everyone to carry on as usual as 'the more regular and predictable the behavior... the easier it is to manage the power grid.' But some consumers worry about power cuts and home improvement stores in Estonia have noted a sharp increase in sales of generators. After the Baltic decoupling, the energy system in the Russian enclave of Kaliningrad will lose its grid connection to mainland Russia. Kaliningrad has been building up power generation capacity for years and Kremlin spokesperson Dmitry Peskov dismissed all concerns. Asked about the cut-off last week, he said: 'We have taken all measures to ensure the uninterrupted reliable operation of our unified energy system.'	https://www.voanews.com/a/baltics-begin-decoupling-from-russian-power-grid/7967586.html	2025-02-08T00:32:54-08:00	
Rwandan, Congolese leaders to meet over eastern DRC conflict	DAR ES SALAAM, TANZANIA — Rwanda's President Paul Kagame was due to meet his Congolese counterpart Felix Tshisekedi in Tanzania on Saturday as regional leaders convene in a bid to defuse the conflict in Democratic Republic of Congo. The M23 armed group has rapidly seized swathes of territory in the mineral-rich eastern DRC in an offensive that has left thousands dead and displaced vast numbers. The group took the strategic city of Goma last week and is pushing into the neighboring South Kivu province in the latest episode of decades-long turmoil in the region. Kagame and Tshisekedi are due to attend a joint summit in the Tanzanian city of Dar es Salaam, bringing together the eight countries of the East African Community and 16-member South African Development Community. Since the M23 reemerged in 2021, several peace talks hosted by Angola and Kenya have failed. Rwanda denies military support for the M23 but a U.N. report said last year it had around 4,000 troops in DRC and profited from smuggling vast amounts of gold and coltan -- a mineral vital to phones and laptops -- out of the country. Rwanda accuses the DRC of sheltering the FDLR, an armed group created by ethnic Hutus who massacred Tutsis during the 1994 Rwandan genocide. Local fears The summit comes as the M23 advances on the town of Kavumu, which hosts an airport critical to supplying Congolese troops. Kavumu is the last barrier before the South Kivu provincial capital Bukavu on the Rwandan border, where panic has set in. A Bukavu resident said shops were barricading their fronts and emptying storerooms for fear of looting, while schools and universities suspended classes on Friday. 'The border with Rwanda is open but almost impassable because of the number of people trying to cross. It's total chaos,' they said. U.N. rights chief Volker Turk warned: 'If nothing is done, the worst may be yet to come, for the people of the eastern DRC, but also beyond the country's borders.' 'Gang rape, slavery' Turk said nearly 3,000 people had been confirmed killed and 2,880 injured since M23 entered Goma on Jan. 26, and that final tolls were likely much higher. He also said his team was 'currently verifying multiple allegations of rape, gang rape and sexual slavery.' The M23 has already installed its own mayor and local authorities in Goma, the capital of North Kivu province. It has vowed to go all the way to the national capital Kinshasa, even though it lies about 1,600 kilometers away across the vast country, which is roughly the size of Western Europe. The DRC army, which has a reputation for poor training and corruption, has been forced into multiple retreats. The offensive has raised fears of regional war, given that several countries are engaged in supporting DRC militarily, including South Africa, Burundi and Malawi. Regional foreign ministers gathered on Friday for the first day of the summit in Tanzania ahead of their leaders on Saturday. Kenyan foreign secretary Musalia Mudavadi said there was a 'golden opportunity' to find a solution, calling for the previous peace processes hosted by Angola and Kenya to be merged into one.	https://www.voanews.com/a/rwandan-congolese-leaders-to-meet-over-eastern-drc-conflict/7967581.html	2025-02-08T00:01:18-08:00	
Uyghurs mark 28 years since Ghulja violence, condemn ongoing repression	WASHINGTON — The first week of February is marked by grief for Zubayra Shamseden not only because she lost loved ones nearly three decades ago, she says, but because China’s repressive policies toward Uyghurs continue. 'I have been commemorating this day and protesting for the past 28 years, every February 5,' Shamseden told VOA. 'The Ghulja massacre in 1997 was the beginning of today’s ongoing genocide of Uyghurs.' Many protesters were killed by the Chinese armed forces that day in what Shamseden describes as a violent Chinese government crackdown on a peaceful Uyghur protest in Ghulja, a city in China’s northwestern region of Xinjiang. During subsequent crackdowns, she also lost her brother, Sadirdin, and her nephew, Hemmat Muhammet. In the aftermath, another brother was sentenced to life in prison. 'The Chinese government should release all prisoners, including my brother, who were unjustly imprisoned,' she told VOA. Outset of violence In recent years, China’s policy toward Uyghurs in Xinjiang has drawn global attention, with the U.S. officially labeling China’s actions as genocide. The United Nations has raised alarms, warning that China’s conduct may constitute crimes against humanity, including mass detentions, forced labor, and other abuses. Beijing, which refers to the 1997 crackdown as 'the Yining incident' — a measured police response to an unfolding 'riot' — has dismissed these claims as 'sheer falsehoods' driven by U.S.-led anti-China forces. Now Chinese outreach coordinator for the Washington-based Uyghur Human Rights Project, Shamseden led a demonstration Wednesday outside the Chinese Embassy in Washington. Joined by a dozen activists, she marked the anniversary of what she and many others refer to as the Ghulja Massacre. Recalling the violence of that day, Shamseden says a few hundred unarmed Uyghur youths marched through Ghulja, calling for basic rights. 'They took to the streets peacefully and unarmed, asking the government to respect their Islamic religious freedom and Uyghur cultural practices,' said Shamseden, a former vice president of the World Uyghur Congress. The youths also called for the release of previously 'arrested leaders of their gatherings, because the Chinese authorities didn’t allow them to gather for Meshrep,' she said. Meshrep, a traditional Uyghur community gathering, has been recognized by UNESCO as part of Uyghur intangible cultural heritage since 2010. Some Meshrep organizers, Shamseden said, had previously been arrested despite initial government approval to hold Meshrep gatherings. Speaking out about a drug crisis among fellow youths in the region had been the purpose of their gatherings. 'The Uyghur youth in Ghulja sought to address the growing heroin addiction crisis that spread in the early 1990s,' Shamseden said. 'They turned to Meshrep — traditional gatherings that included sports, music, performances, and other forms of entertainment — to help young Uyghurs struggling with addiction and alcohol.' Officials in Beijing, however, soon deemed the gatherings a threat. In August 1995, key organizers were arrested, prompting protests in Ghulja. Authorities responded by banning Meshrep and cracking down on other Uyghur-led initiatives. Uyghurs were later barred from holding events of any kind. Different perspective Liu Pengyu, spokesperson for the Chinese Embassy in Washington, described the protest as 'not a so-called massacre, but a serious incident of beating, smashing, and looting' carried out by a burgeoning terrorist group. 'Xinjiang was once a major area where extremist groups infiltrated and carried out violent terrorist activities,' Liu said, adding that China’s measures in the region have been aimed at countering terror-based insurgency within the framework of Chinese law. A 1997 Human Rights Watch report, however, linked the crackdown to a secret Chinese government directive known as 'Document No. 7.' Issued in March 1996 by the Politburo Standing Committee of the Chinese Communist Party, the document laid out measures to strengthen control over Xinjiang, including restrictions on religious and cultural activities, increased military presence and tighter security enforcement. The Washington-based Campaign for Uyghurs described the Chinese government crackdown on protesters as a massacre, stating that the policies behind that bloodshed have evolved into the genocide unfolding today. The Ghulja Massacre was 'a pivotal moment when the world had an opportunity to recognize China’s trajectory towards mass atrocities — and failed to act,' said Rushan Abbas, the group's executive director, in a statement issued Wednesday. 'That failure emboldened the [Chinese Communist Party],' said Abbas, who is also chairperson of the executive committee at World Uyghur Congress. 'Today, as Uyghurs endure genocide, history repeats itself. The price of inaction is paid in human lives, and every day without accountability reinforces the Chinese regime’s belief that it can commit atrocities without consequence.' According to Shamseden, who had been in Australia since 1993, visiting Ghulja only in the aftermath of the crackdown in 1998, mass arrests and collective punishment had by then become routine. This crackdown led to the arrest, torture and release of her sister for allegedly helping a Ghulja protester, the killing of her brother Sadirdin in Kazakhstan under mysterious circumstances, and the killing of her nephew Hemmat Muhammet by Chinese police in Ghulja. Shamseden’s nephew and brother were leading members of earlier Meshrep gatherings. In 1999, Shamseden said another younger brother, Abdurazzak was sentenced by the Chinese officials for being a separatist, receiving a sentence of life in prison. To this day, she said, she has been unable to learn any details about her brother’s current fate, including whether he is alive. According to the U.S. Commission on International Religious Freedom, Abdurazzak’s sentence was commuted by the Xinjiang Uyghur Autonomous Region High People's Court in August 2016. He had reportedly been serving time at Urumqi No.1 Prison, and is expected to be released in 2036, but his exact whereabouts remain unknown.	https://www.voanews.com/a/uyghurs-mark-28-years-since-ghulja-violence-condemn-ongoing-repression/7967538.html	2025-02-07T23:30:32-08:00	
Stradivari violin made in 1714 sells for $11.3M	NEW YORK — A violin made in 1714 by the legendary luthier Antonio Stradivari sold for $11.3 million at an auction in New York on Friday, short of estimates that would have made it the most expensive instrument ever sold. Sotheby's auction house had estimated that the 'Joachim-Ma Stradivarius' violin could sell for between $12 million and $18 million, with the higher end of the range potentially eclipsing the record-breaking $15.9 million someone paid for another Stradivari violin at auction more than a decade ago. The 'Joachim-Ma Stradivarius' is regarded as one of Stradivari's best works, built during his 'Golden Period' at the height of his craftsmanship and acoustic mastery, according to the auction house. Adding to the intrigue, the violin is believed to have influenced legendary composer Johannes Brahms when he wrote the famed 'Violin Concerto in D Major' and was actually played during the concerto's 1879 premiere. 'This extraordinary violin represents the pinnacle of craftsmanship and classical music history, its unparalleled sound and storied provenance captivating collectors and musicians alike,' Mari-Claudia Jimenez, chair at Sotheby's. 'The Joachim-Ma Stradivarius garnered global attention, achieving one of the highest prices ever for a musical instrument — an acknowledgment of its rarity and historical importance.' $2M increase in seconds Bidding at Sotheby's began at $8 million and within seconds shot up to $10 million, as auctioneer Phyllis Kao scanned the room, looking for someone to put up $10.5 million. 'Am I selling? At $10 million,' she said, looking to potential bidders. The room was quiet. 'Last chance, at $10 million,' she said. 'I can sell, and I will, at $10 million, unless you go on.' 'Sold. $10 million,' she said, banging a gavel. The final price includes auction house fees. Sale funds scholarships The name of the instrument comes from two of its famous violin virtuoso owners, Joseph Joachim of Hungary and Si-Hon Ma of China. Ma's estate gifted the violin to the New England Conservatory in Boston after his death. The conservatory will use the proceeds to fund student scholarships. 'The sale is transformational for future students, and proceeds will establish the largest named endowed scholarship at New England Conservatory,' said Andrea Kalyn, president of New England Conservatory. 'It has been an honor to have the Joachim-Ma Stradivari on campus, and we are eager to watch its legacy continue on the world stage.'	https://www.voanews.com/a/hold-for-wknd---stradivari-violin-made-in-1714-sells-for-11-3m-/7967516.html	2025-02-07T23:29:54-08:00	
Alaska lawmakers ask Trump to retain Denali's name, not change it to Mount McKinley	JUNEAU, ALASKA — The Alaska Legislature passed a resolution Friday urging President Donald Trump to reverse course and retain the name of North America's tallest peak as Denali rather than change it to Mount McKinley. Trump, on his first day in office, signed an executive order calling for the name to revert to Mount McKinley, an identifier inspired by President William McKinley, who was from Ohio and never set foot in Alaska. He said he planned to 'restore the name of a great president, William McKinley, to Mount McKinley, where it should be and where it belongs. President McKinley made our country very rich through tariffs and through talent.' The 19-0 vote in the state Senate came just over a week after the House passed the measure 31-8. The resolution was sponsored by Rep. Maxine Dibert, a Democrat who is Koyukon Athabascan. Members of that tribe bestowed the name Denali, or 'the high one,' on the mountain in interior Alaska. 'Denali is more than a mountain,' Dibert of Fairbanks said in a news release. 'It's a cornerstone of Alaska's history, a tribute to our diverse culture and a testament to the people who have cherished this land for millennia.' The Interior Department late last month announced efforts were underway to implement Trump's renaming order, even though state leaders haven't seen the matter as settled. An Interior spokesperson, J. Elizabeth Peace, earlier this week said the agency did not have any further updates. According to the National Park Service, a prospector in 1896 dubbed the peak Mount McKinley for William McKinley, who was elected president that year. Although there were challenges to the McKinley name at the time it was announced, maps had already been circulated with the mountain's name in place. The name was formally recognized by the U.S. government until it was changed in 2015 by the Obama administration to Denali. The name change reflected the traditions of Alaska Natives and the preference of many Alaskans, underscored by a push by state leaders decades earlier. The 6,190-meter mountain in Denali National Park and Preserve on clear days can be see from hundreds of kilometers away. 'Denali is the name of our mountain; a name of great importance to Alaska Natives and everyone across our state,' House Speaker Bryce Edgmon, an independent from Dillingham, said in the news release. 'It is clear from the bipartisan support in the legislature that Alaskans should decide.'	https://www.voanews.com/a/alaska-lawmakers-ask-trump-to-retain-denali-s-name-not-change-it-to-mount-mckinley/7967506.html	2025-02-07T23:29:17-08:00	
North Korea says its nuclear weapons not a 'bargaining chip' as Trump, Ishiba meet	SEOUL, SOUTH KOREA — North Korea said on Saturday its nuclear weapons are not meant for negotiations but are intended for combat use against enemies that threaten its people and world peace, its state media reported. The statement comes after U.S. President Donald Trump hosted Japanese Prime Minister Shigeru Ishiba at the White House on Friday. The two leaders expressed their commitment to ensuring North Korea ends its nuclear weapons program. KCNA did not mention the meeting between the U.S. and Japanese leaders but instead cited reported comments by officials of NATO and the EU that reiterated demands for a complete denuclearization of North Korea. 'We say this clearly again: Our nuclear weapons are not an advertisement to get anyone's recognition and even less a bargaining chip to be exchanged for some money,' KCNA said in a statement. 'Our nuclear forces are for unwavering combat use to swiftly eliminate any attempts by enemy forces that infringe on our country's sovereignty and the safety of our people and threaten world peace,' it said. North Korea has not responded directly to overtures from Trump to resume contact with its leader Kim Jong Un and instead stressed its intention to 'bolster' its nuclear forces. Trump said on Friday he 'will have relations with North Korea and with Kim Jong Un,' adding he had a good rapport with Kim. The two held unprecedented summit meetings during Trump's first presidency. On Jan. 20 when he was inaugurated for his second term, Trump said the North was a 'nuclear power,' raising questions whether he would pursue arms reduction talks rather than denuclearization negotiations. 'The two leaders expressed their serious concerns over and the need to address North Korea’s nuclear and missile programs and reaffirmed their resolute commitment to the complete denuclearization of North Korea,' a joint statement by Trump and Ishiba issued after their talks said.	https://www.voanews.com/a/north-korea-says-its-nuclear-weapons-not-a-bargaining-chip-as-trump-ishiba-meet/7967579.html	2025-02-07T23:28:26-08:00	
US approves sale of $7.4B in bombs, missiles to Israel	WASHINGTON — The United States on Friday announced the approval of the sale of more than $7.4 billion in bombs, missiles and related equipment to Israel, which has used American-made weapons to devastating effect during the war in Gaza. The State Department has signed off on the sale of $6.75 billion in bombs, guidance kits and fuses, in addition to $660 million in Hellfire missiles, according to the U.S. Defense Security Cooperation Agency (DSCA). The proposed sale of the bombs 'improves Israel's capability to meet current and future threats, strengthen its homeland defense, and serves as a deterrent to regional threats,' DSCA said in a statement. And the missile sale would 'improve Israel's capability to meet current and future threats by improving the ability of the Israeli Air Force to defend Israel's borders, vital infrastructure, and population centers,' it said. Israel launched a hugely destructive offensive against Hamas in Gaza in October 2023 in response to an unprecedented attack by the Palestinian militant group that month. Hamas has been designated a terrorist organization by the United States, United Kingdom, European Union and others. The war has devastated much of Gaza -- a narrow coastal territory on the Mediterranean -- resulting in the displacement of much of its population, but a ceasefire has been in effect since last month, bringing a halt to the deadly conflict and providing for the release of hostages seized by Hamas. In response to concerns over civilian deaths, then-President Joe Biden's administration blocked a shipment of 907-kilogram bombs to Israel -- larger than those in the latest proposed sale -- but his successor, Donald Trump, reportedly approved the shipment after returning to office. While the State Department has approved the sale of the bombs and missiles, the transactions still need to be approved by Congress, which is unlikely to block the provision of the weapons to Washington's closest ally in the Middle East.	https://www.voanews.com/a/us-approves-sale-of-7-4b-in-bombs-missiles-to-israel/7967574.html	2025-02-07T23:06:01-08:00	
US Justice Department disbands teams investigating corruption, election interference	The U.S. Department of Justice will refocus much of its staff and resources on the 'total elimination' of drug cartels and transnational criminal organizations in the U.S. while disbanding units dedicated to prosecuting white-collar crime and kleptocrats and tracking foreign efforts to influence U.S. elections. The change, announced in a set of memos issued this week by newly sworn-in Attorney General Pam Bondi, is part of a major reorientation of a department that President Donald Trump says has been 'weaponized' against him since the end of his first term in office. In a memo issued Wednesday, her first day in office, Bondi called for a 'fundamental change in mindset and approach' when it comes to combating drug cartels. 'We must do more than try to mitigate the enormous harms these groups cause in America,' Bondi wrote. 'It is not enough to stem the tide of deadly poisons, such as fentanyl, that these groups distribute in our homeland. Rather, we must harness the resources of the Department of Justice and empower federal prosecutors throughout the country to work urgently with the Department of Homeland Security and other parts of the government toward the goal of eliminating these threats to U.S. sovereignty.' Kleptocracy programs eliminated The same memo outlined Bondi's moves to do away with specific units in the department. Among those eliminated were two dedicated to targeting kleptocrats — public figures who use their authority to steal resources from their own people. The Kleptocracy Asset Recovery Initiative, established in 2010, worked to identify the assets of kleptocrats, seize them and return them to the countries from which they were stolen. Task Force KleptoCapture, a separate unit, was formed in early 2022 in the wake of Russia's full-scale invasion of Ukraine. The unit targeted oligarchs close to Russian President Vladimir Putin and enforced sanctions against Russia by the U.S. and its allies after the invasion. 'Attorneys assigned to those initiatives shall return to their prior posts,' Bondi's memo said, 'and resources currently devoted to those efforts shall be committed to the total elimination of Cartels and TCOs.' The Criminal Division's unit focused on bringing prosecutions under the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act, she said, 'shall prioritize investigations related to foreign bribery that facilitates the criminal operations of Cartels and TCOs, and shift focus away from investigations and cases that do not involve such a connection.' In 2024 alone, the FCPA unit secured hundreds of millions of dollars in settlement payments from companies found guilty of bribing public officials. Prosecutions under the Foreign Extortion Prevention Act were also redirected under the new instructions. Anti-corruption groups concerned Gary Kalman, the executive director of Transparency International U.S., told VOA that the changes to DOJ priorities could have dire consequences for the global fight against public corruption. 'The elimination of kleptocracy initiatives is a concern in that those initiatives were providing valuable coordination and information-sharing services amongst different departments and with some of our overseas allies,' Kalman said. 'Those networks had some encouraging results and enabled investigations to move more quickly,' he said. 'Dismantling those programs will likely have a negative effect on our ability to investigate and prosecute cases.' Regarding the change in focus for FCPA and FEPA investigations, Kalman said, much will depend on how the administration chooses to define 'transnational criminal organizations.' FCPA and FEPA violations 'are by nature, transnational crimes,' he pointed out. So, he said, it's difficult to know for sure what kind of investigations will be prioritized. 'For example, do they consider the Iranian government an 'organization'?' he asked. In an analysis of the Justice Department's moves, a group of attorneys at the law firm Arnold & Porter argued that the department's new posture might lead to more FCPA cases. 'FCPA enforcement might actually increase, at least in certain areas,' they wrote. 'For example, DOJ might more aggressively prosecute FCPA violations related directly to Mexico and other Latin American countries, as well as China — places that the Trump administration has identified publicly as sources of transnational criminal activity, including trafficking of illegal narcotics.' Foreign influence prosecutions refocused In a separate memo, Bondi revealed that the Department of Justice will also disband the Foreign Influence Task Force, established in 2017 to investigate efforts by state actors, such as Russia and China, to influence U.S. public opinion, particularly around elections. Trump has been highly critical of efforts by law enforcement to identify and root out foreign interference in U.S. elections, especially after a report by special counsel Robert Mueller, in 2019, found extensive evidence that Russian influence operations had been mounted to benefit Trump's candidacy during the 2016 presidential election. In her memo, Bondi wrote, 'To free resources to address more pressing priorities, and end risks of further weaponization and abuses of prosecutorial discretion, the Foreign Influence Task Force shall be disbanded.' Election integrity advocates were dismayed by the decision. Susannah Goodman, the director of election security for the activist organization Common Cause, said in a statement that the decision to disband FITF is a 'terrible mistake' that will leave state and local election infrastructure without critical support. 'The FITF provides critical protection to safeguard our votes and our elections from the intelligence services of hostile foreign governments including Russia, China and Iran,' Goodman said. 'We know that foreign governments have been interfering in our elections for decades and even more expansively beginning during the 2016 election cycle. It is hard to imagine a more pressing priority than protecting our elections from foreign interference,' she said. 'States and local officials — who run our elections — do not have the resources and expertise to go toe-to-toe with highly sophisticated foreign intelligence services,' she said.	https://www.voanews.com/a/us-justice-department-disbands-teams-investigating-corruption-election-interference/7967503.html	2025-02-07T21:42:27-08:00	
Hamas set to release 3 Israeli hostages as ceasefire deal holds	Hamas has identified three more Israeli hostages it plans to free on Saturday as part of a fragile ceasefire agreement, even as U.S. President Donald Trump continues to talk up his plan to take ownership of the Gaza Strip. The three men, captured by Hamas during its attack on Israel on Oct. 7, 2023, will be part of the fifth exchange since a ceasefire between Isreal and Hamas took effect last month. For its part, Isreal is set to release 183 Palestinian prisoners on Saturday. The three Israelis are Eli Sharabi, 52; Ohad Ben Ami, 56; and Or Levy, 34. Ami and Sharabi were both taken hostage from Kibbutz Beeri, a communal farm, while Levy was abducted from the Nova music festival. During the first phase of the ceasefire, set to last six weeks, Hamas is to gradually free 33 Israeli hostages in exchange for hundreds of Palestinian prisoners. So far, 13 Israeli hostages and five Thai workers abducted during the Hamas attack have been freed. Details of the planned exchange Saturday came as Trump said his plan for the United States to take ownership of the Gaza Strip should be viewed as a real estate transaction but offered no timetable for the plan, saying 'we’re in no rush on it.' The president made the comments Friday as he and visiting Japanese Prime Minister Shigeru Ishiba met with reporters at the White House before the two leaders held talks. Responding to a question about his Gaza proposal, Trump said his plan has been 'very well received,' and as he envisioned it, there would be no need for the United States to have 'boots on the ground' in the region because Israel would provide security. Trump first announced his Gaza takeover plan earlier this week alongside Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu at a White House news conference. Trump later offered more on the plan on his Truth Social platform, suggesting Israel should turn the Gaza Strip over to the United States after the war with Hamas ends. Under his plan, he said, the more than 2 million Palestinians who live there 'would have already been resettled in far safer and more beautiful communities.' In a video statement Thursday, during his visit to Washington, Netanyahu praised the plan, saying it was worth listening to and 'the first original idea to be raised in years.' The plan has been widely assailed by U.S. allies and adversaries alike, many of whom remain committed to the creation of an independent Palestinian state alongside Israel, known as the 'two-state solution.' A large street protest was held in Amman, Jordan, on Friday in opposition to plan. At the demonstration, organized by the Muslim Brotherhood and other opposition parties, marchers carried posters and a banner condemning Trump and chanting pro- Palestinian slogans. On Thursday, Israeli Defense Minister Israel Katz called Trump’s idea a 'bold plan,' and said he has ordered the Israel Defense Forces to devise a plan for Palestinians to voluntarily leave the Gaza Strip, adding they could go 'to any country willing to accept them.' Meanwhile, the IDF announced Friday it has deployed forces from three divisions of its Southern Command to several points in the Gaza Strip to 'strengthen the layer of defense for Israeli citizens bordering the area.' In statement on its website, the IDF said the deployments were 'part of the ceasefire agreement' and added its forces 'are prepared for defense and will continue to act decisively against terrorist organizations, in order to ensure the security of the residents of the State of Israel.' It was unclear if the forces were related to the defense minister’s orders. Netanyahu wrapped his Washington visit Friday with a trip to Capitol Hill where he met with House Speaker Mike Johnson. During remarks following their meeting, Netanyahu thanked Trump for the executive order he issued placing sanctions on the International Criminal Court. Netanyahu called the ICC a 'scandalous and corrupt organization' that 'threatens the right of all democracies to defend themselves by themselves.' In the executive order, issued Thursday, Trump claimed the court 'has engaged in illegitimate and baseless actions targeting America and our close ally Israel.' The order also accused the ICC of abusing its power by issuing arrest warrants in November for Netanyahu and Yoav Gallant, Israel’s former defense minister who oversaw much of the war in Gaza. In a statement Friday, the ICC condemned the executive order. In a separate statement, Judge Tomoko Akane, president of the court, said the order was 'only the latest in a series of unprecedented and escalatory attacks aiming to undermine the ICC’s ability to administer justice in all situations.' The ICC was established in 2002 to serve as a permanent court to prosecute those responsible for war crimes, crimes against humanity and genocide. The court is governed by an international treaty called the Rome Statute, which was adopted by the U.N. in 1998. It took effect on July 1, 2002. Some information for this report came from The Associated Press, Agence France-Presse and Reuters.	https://www.voanews.com/a/hamas-set-to-release-3-israeli-hostages-as-ceasefire-deal-holds/7967559.html	2025-02-07T21:37:59-08:00	
Wreckage of missing Alaska plane found; no survivors	The wreckage of a small commuter plane missing in Alaska has been found, Coast Guard officials said Friday. All 10 people aboard the plane – nine passengers and a pilot – are dead, according to media reports. Coast Guard spokesman Mike Salerno said rescuers saw the crash from their helicopter as they flew over the Cessna 208 Caravan’s last known location. Two rescue swimmers were lowered to investigate the scene, Salerno said. Several groups were involved in the search for the plane, including the Alaska State Troopers the U.S. Coast Guard, Alaska Air National Guard, Alaska Army National Guard and local search teams. Authorities said a Jayhawk helicopter was brought in Friday morning to help with the search. The FBI provided technical assistance, including cellphone analysis to help locate the aircraft. The Bering Air flight was traveling in western Alaska, just south of the Artic Circle, from Unalakleet to Nome. Alaska State Troopers said they were notified Thursday at 4 p.m. about the missing plane. The U.S. Coast Guard said on X the flight’s last known position was 19 kilometers offshore. Early Friday, the Nome fire department posted on X that it was conducting a ground search, but weather and visibility conditions were hampering the department's air search. The department urged people not to form their own search parties because of hazardous weather conditions in the region, which is prone to sudden snow squalls and high winds. Airplanes are often the only method of transportation between rural Alaskan villages. Nome is well-known as the last stop in the Iditarod Trail Sled Dog Race. This is the third major U.S. aviation incident in recent days. On Jan. 29, a commercial airliner and an Army helicopter collided near Reagan National Airport outside Washington. Two days later, a medical transport plane crashed into a Philadelphia neighborhood shortly after takeoff, killing six people onboard and another person on the street. Some information for this report came from The Associated Press.	https://www.voanews.com/a/wreckage-of-missing-alaska-plane-found-no-survivors/7967549.html	2025-02-07T20:42:02-08:00	
Sweden wants to tighten gun laws after mass shooting	Sweden said Friday it wants to tighten its gun laws, following a lone gunman’s mass shooting of 10 people Tuesday with his licensed firearms at an education center in Orebro, about 200 kilometers west of Stockholm. After killing seven women and three men between the ages of 28 and 68, the attacker apparently killed himself with one of his weapons. The coalition government said in a statement that it has come to an agreement on a proposal restricting access to semiautomatic weapons, specifically citing the AR-15 rifle, which has been used in several U.S. shootings. It is 'an example of a weapon that is compatible with large magazines and can cause a lot of damage in a short time,' the statement said. 'There are certain types of weapons that are so dangerous that they should only be possessed for civilian purposes as an exception,' the government said. While it is not immediately clear what weapons were used in Tuesday’s shooting, Justice Minister Gunnar Strommer told Reuters a ban on the AR-15 would be a 'preventative measure.' Sweden’s government also called for a reassessment of the requirements for hunting licenses that would allow Swedes to possess an AR-15, which could then be used, with some adjustments, in a mass shooting. AR-15 rifles have been allowed in Sweden for hunting since 2023, Reuters reported and since then 3,500 licenses have been issued. Police have not revealed what weapons were used in this week’s incident but have said that three rifles found near the suspect’s body were licensed to him. Police have seized a fourth gun also licensed to the suspect. Police say they have not determined a motive for the shootings. However, Broadcaster TV4 has shown a video shot by a student hiding in a bathroom during the ordeal. Someone can be heard in the video shouting, 'You will leave Europe.' The police have not released the nationalities of the victims, nor have they released the identity of the shooter. The Swedish press, however, has identified the suspect as 35-year-old Rickard Andersson, whom they describe as a recluse with mental health issues.	https://www.voanews.com/a/sweden-wants-to-tighten-gun-laws-after-mass-shooting/7967547.html	2025-02-07T20:26:03-08:00

19 states sue to stop DOGE from accessing Americans' personal data	Nineteen Democratic attorneys general sued President Donald Trump on Friday to stop Elon Musk's Department of Government Efficiency from accessing Treasury Department records that contain sensitive personal data such as Social Security and bank account numbers for millions of Americans. The case, filed in federal court in New York City, alleges the Trump administration allowed Musk's team access to the Treasury Department's central payment system in violation of federal law. The payment system handles tax refunds, Social Security benefits, veterans' benefits and much more, sending out trillions of dollars every year while containing an expansive network of Americans' personal and financial data. The White House did not immediately respond to a request for comment. Musk's Department of Government Efficiency, also known as DOGE, was created to discover and eliminate what the Trump administration has deemed to be wasteful government spending. DOGE's access to Treasury records, as well as its inspection of various government agencies, has ignited widespread concern among critics over the increasing power of Musk, while supporters have cheered the idea of reining in bloated government finances. Musk has made fun of criticism of DOGE on his X social media platform while saying it is saving taxpayers millions of dollars. New York Attorney General Letitia James, whose office filed the lawsuit, said DOGE's access to the Treasury Department's data raises security problems and the possibility for an illegal freeze in federal funds. 'This unelected group, led by the world's richest man, is not authorized to have this information, and they explicitly sought this unauthorized access to illegally block payments that millions of Americans rely on, payments for health care, child care and other essential programs,' James said in a video message released by her office. James, a Democrat who has been one of Trump's chief antagonists, said the president does not have the power to give away American's private information to anyone he chooses, and he cannot cut federal payments approved by Congress. Also on the lawsuit are Arizona, California, Colorado, Connecticut, Delaware, Hawaii, Illinois, Maine, Maryland, Massachusetts, Minnesota, Nevada, New Jersey, North Carolina, Oregon, Rhode Island, Vermont, and Wisconsin. The suit alleges that DOGE's access to the Treasury records could interfere with funding appropriated by Congress, which would exceed the Treasury Department's statutory authority. The case also argues that the DOGE access violates federal administrative law and the U.S. Constitution's separation of powers doctrine. It also accuses Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent of changing the department's longstanding policy for protecting sensitive personally identifiable information and financial information to allow Musk's DOGE team access to its payment systems. 'This decision failed to account for legal obligations to protect such data and ignored the privacy expectations of federal fund recipients,' including states, veterans, retirees, and taxpayers, the lawsuit says. Connecticut Attorney General William Tong said it's not clear what DOGE is doing with the information in the Treasury systems. 'This is the largest data breach in American history,' Tong said in a statement. 'DOGE is an unlawfully constituted band of renegade tech bros combing through confidential records, sensitive data and critical payment systems. What could go wrong?' The Treasury Department has said the review is about assessing the integrity of the system and that no changes are being made. According to two people familiar with the process, Musk's team began its inquiry looking for ways to suspend payments made by the U.S. Agency for International Development, which Trump and Musk are attempting to dismantle. The two people spoke with The Associated Press on condition of anonymity for fear of retaliation. Separately, Democratic lawmakers are seeking a Treasury Department investigation of DOGE's access to the government's payment system. Also, labor unions and advocacy groups have sued to block the payments system review over concerns about its legality. A judge in Washington on Thursday temporarily restricted access to two employees with 'read only' privileges.	https://www.voanews.com/a/states-sue-to-stop-doge-from-accessing-americans-personal-data/7967515.html	2025-02-07T17:59:18-08:00	
Trump orders freeze of aid to South Africa, cites country's land expropriation law	washington — President Donald Trump signed an executive order Friday formalizing his announcement earlier this week that he'll freeze assistance to South Africa because of its law aiming to address some of the wrongs of South Africa's racist apartheid era — a law the White House says amounts to discrimination against the country's white minority. 'As long as South Africa continues to support bad actors on the world stage and allows violent attacks on innocent disfavored minority farmers, the United States will stop aid and assistance to the country,' the White House said in a summary of the order. The White House said Trump is also going to announce a program to resettle white South African farmers and their families as refugees. Trump was responding to a new law in South Africa that gives the government powers in some instances to expropriate land from people. The White House said the law 'blatantly discriminates against ethnic minority Afrikaners.' The Expropriation Act was signed into law by South African President Cyril Ramaphosa last month and allows the government to take land in specific instances where it is not being used, or where it would be in the public interest if it were redistributed. It aims to address some of the wrongs of South Africa's racist apartheid era, when land was taken away from Black people and they were forced to live in areas designated for nonwhites. Elon Musk, who is a close Trump ally and head of Trump's new Department of Government Efficiency, has highlighted that law in recent social media posts and cast it as a threat to South Africa's white minority. Musk was born in South Africa. The order also references South Africa's role in bringing accusations of genocide against Israel before the International Court of Justice. The halt in foreign aid to South Africa comes amid a broader pause in most U.S. overseas assistance under Trump, as he looks to shift to what he calls an 'America First' foreign policy.	https://www.voanews.com/a/trump-orders-freeze-of-aid-to-south-africa-cites-country-s-land-expropriation-law/7967514.html	2025-02-07T17:58:48-08:00	
US homeland security leader official set to visit Guantanamo Bay	PENTAGON — The top U.S. homeland security official was set to get a firsthand look at the detention center at Guantanamo Bay, visiting the U.S. naval base in Cuba a day after sending a second flight of 'high-threat illegal aliens' to be held there. Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem announced the trip Friday in a social media post on X, while sharing photos of detainees she described as 'murderers & vicious gang members' being offloaded from a U.S. military transport jet before being taken to the prison facility. In a separate post earlier Friday, Noem said the detainees were all Venezuelan gang members. She said one detainee had confessed to murder, while others were wanted for attempted murder, assault, weapons trafficking and impersonation. DHS has not yet provided charging documents or other details regarding the crimes the detainees are accused of committing. A U.S. official, speaking to VOA on the condition of anonymity to discuss the operation, said Thursday's flight aboard a U.S. military C-130 cargo plane carried 13 'high-threat' individuals. The first 10 undocumented migrants, described by U.S. officials as the 'the worst of the worst,' arrived at the detention facility Tuesday, also on board a C-130. Officials have said all the migrants are being held under the watch of officers with U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement. Homeland Security officials said the 10 migrants who arrived Tuesday were members of Tren de Aragua, a Venezuelan street gang with transnational reach. Officials did not say when or how they were first taken into custody. The White House has announced plans to designate Tren de Aragua as a Foreign Terrorist Organization. U.S. defense officials have called the detention of the high-threat migrants at Guantanamo Bay detention facility a temporary measure. Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth on Friday, though, emphasized the military's commitment under President Donald Trump to secure the U.S. southern border with Mexico. 'We've seen an invasion,' Hegseth told a town hall meeting with Pentagon employees. 'From people all around the world who I'm sure many of them want to seek a better life. I understand that. 'But we also don't know who millions of them are, what their intentions are, why they're here,' he said. 'That creates a very real national security threat.' Since Trump's executive order last month, the Pentagon has deployed hundreds of Marines to Guantanamo to expand the facilities to support holding operations for undocumented immigrants. That includes preparing the detention center, known mostly for housing military prisoners and terror suspects, including those involved in the September 11, 2001, attacks and members of the Taliban. It also includes setting up tents and other facilities to house nonviolent migrants on another section of the base to prepare for as many as 30,000 migrants who will stay there until they can be deported to their countries of origin or other countries willing to take them. Closing Guantanamo Democratic administrations under former Presidents Barack Obama and Joe Biden had sought to close the detention camp, which was built by the administration of former President George W. Bush in 2002, following the U.S. invasion of Afghanistan that began shortly after the 9/11 attacks of 2001. Human rights groups have criticized the Trump administration's move to use Guantanamo as a holding center for migrants, with some warning it would amount to a human rights catastrophe. At its height during the global war on terror, the detention facility held about 680 prisoners. As of Jan. 6, there were just 15 detainees at the facility, according to the Pentagon. Before being used to detain terror suspects, the U.S. naval facility was also used to house migrants from Cuba and Haiti in the early 1990s.	https://www.voanews.com/a/us-homeland-security-leader-official-set-to-visit-guantanamo-bay/7967295.html	2025-02-07T16:51:25-08:00	
Casino mogul asks US Supreme Court to revisit landmark defamation rule	washington — Casino mogul Steve Wynn has asked the U.S. Supreme Court to hear an appeal that, if granted, could give the justices a chance to revisit libel protections for journalists enshrined in a landmark 1964 ruling that has been questioned by two conservative justices and President Donald Trump. The court established a stringent limit on defamation claims by public figures more than 60 years ago in its New York Times v. Sullivan decision involving the U.S. Constitution's First Amendment protections for freedom of speech and the press. Wynn, the former CEO of Wynn Resorts and former finance chair of the Republican National Committee, is appealing a decision by Nevada's top court to dismiss his defamation suit against The Associated Press and one of its journalists. The court found Wynn failed to show a disputed 2018 news report containing allegations of sexual assault had been published with 'actual malice.' The Supreme Court in New York Times v. Sullivan and subsequent decisions set a standard that in order to win a libel suit, a public figure must demonstrate the offending statement was made with 'actual malice,' meaning with knowledge it was false or with reckless disregard as to whether it was false. That standard has since been adopted in a number of state laws across the country, including in Nevada. Wynn's petition for appeal, which the court made public Tuesday, asks the justices to assess 'whether this court should overturn Sullivan’s actual-malice standard,' as well as a related prior court decision. At least four justices must vote to grant review for the court to hear an appeal. No date has been set for the justices to review or vote on whether to take up Wynn's case. Wynn's defamation lawsuit accused the defendants of publishing an article falsely alleging he committed sexual assault in the 1970s. Those claims first appeared in two separate citizens' complaints that an Associated Press reporter obtained from the Las Vegas Metropolitan Police Department, including one complaint that Wynn argued was implausible on its face and that a Nevada court in a separate proceeding found to have included 'clearly fanciful or delusional' allegations. Wynn has denied the sexual assault allegations. The Supreme Court in recent years has turned away other opportunities to revisit New York Times v. Sullivan, including a 2021 denial that drew dissents from conservative Justices Clarence Thomas and Neil Gorsuch. Citing a rapidly changing media environment increasingly rife with disinformation, Thomas and Gorsuch said in separate opinions the court should take a fresh look at its precedents that make it harder for public figures to sue for defamation. Since launching his first Republican presidential campaign in 2015, Trump has often attacked and even sued media outlets whose coverage he dislikes, and has repeatedly criticized U.S. defamation laws. A federal judge in 2023 threw out Trump's $475 million defamation lawsuit against CNN, in which the former president claimed the network's description of his election fraud as the 'big lie' associated him with Adolf Hitler. Trump's lawyers, in a 2022 filing in that case, had invited the judge to reconsider the legal standard set in New York Times v. Sullivan. 'The court should reconsider whether Sullivan’s standard truly protects the democratic values embodied by the First Amendment, or, instead, facilitates the pollution of the 'stream of information about public officials and public affairs' with false information,' Trump's lawyers wrote.	https://www.voanews.com/a/casino-mogul-asks-us-supreme-court-to-revisit-landmark-defamation-rule-/7967483.html	2025-02-07T16:16:33-08:00	
US defense secretary hosts Australian counterpart	pentagon — U.S. Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth welcomed Australian Defense Minister Richard Marles to the Pentagon on Friday, after Australia made its first $500 million payment to the United States under the AUKUS nuclear submarine deal involving Washington, Canberra and London. 'The check did clear,' Hegseth joked to Marles and reporters ahead of the defense ministers’ meeting. Marles said the 'strength of American leadership' in the Indo-Pacific region is 'critically important' to Australia. He added that the AUKUS submarine deal also represented an increase in Australian defense spending. 'We really understand the importance of building our capability, but in paying our way,' Marles told Hegseth. Marles was the first foreign defense counterpart that Hegseth had hosted since his confirmation. U.S. and Australian officials confirmed that Australia transferred the $500 million after a call between Marles and Hegseth late last month. AUKUS is a trilateral partnership that Australia, the U.K. and the U.S. announced in September 2021 to support a 'free and open Indo-Pacific' amid increased Chinese aggression. The first initiative under AUKUS was aimed at strengthening the U.S. submarine industrial base so that Australia can acquire nuclear-powered attack submarines for the Royal Australian Navy. It also provides for the rotational basing of American and British nuclear submarines in Australia.	https://www.voanews.com/a/us-defense-secretary-hosts-australian-counterpart/7967472.html	2025-02-07T16:03:00-08:00	
Vietnam braces for fallout from US tariffs on Chinese goods	WASHINGTON — Vietnamese Prime Minister Pham Minh Chinh instructed his Cabinet to prepare for a possible global trade war after U.S. President Donald Trump imposed tariffs of 10% on all Chinese products. 'Prepare for the possibility of a world trade war this year,' the prime minister said at a Cabinet meeting on Wednesday, according to the Dan Tri online newspaper. Pham spoke after Trump announced a pause in his threatened tariffs against Mexico and Canada for 30 days. Pham told the Cabinet that the situation in the world and the region was 'developing very unpredictably, directly affecting our country, especially on exports, production and business, and the macro economy.' He emphasized that if a global trade war were to occur, with countries imposing retaliatory tariffs on each other's exports, it could disrupt supply chains and shrink the country's export markets, posing significant risks to Vietnam's economy. Pham did not specifically mention Trump's tariffs on products from China, a strategic trade partner and a neighboring country of Vietnam. There are worries that Trump's tariffs may cause rising product prices and reduced consumer purchasing power in Vietnam, a highly open economy that relies heavily on exports and foreign direct investment, with China as its leading trade partner. Vietnamese businesses and consumers are bracing for U.S. tariffs on China to drive up the costs of some goods as the country imports machinery and electronic devices, such as computers and cellphones, from the U.S., with elements or pieces that originated from China. The country will also likely have to cope with pressure from Beijing to import more Chinese products, analysts said. 'Vietnam may be under pressure to import more products from China as Chinese products are levied higher tariffs by the U.S.,' Nguyen Quang A, an economic political observer and businessman in Hanoi, told VOA this week. Others predict that as American markets close to Chinese companies, they will increasingly turn to regional trading partners, like Vietnam. In 2024, Vietnam's exports to China totaled $61.2 billion. Meanwhile, imports from China surged to $144 billion, according to the Vietnam Chamber of Commerce and Industry. With the United States, the situation is reversed, with Vietnam's trade surplus in 2024 exceeding $123 billion, Reuters reported. According to analysts, Hanoi's pledges to import more from the U.S. as well as other offsetting measures could spare Vietnam from the Trump administration's tariffs. Nguyen noted a major hidden risk for Vietnam is that Chinese companies are setting up factories in Vietnam to import products for re-export, meaning they would repackage Chinese products with minimal labor by cheap Vietnamese workers and export them under the 'Made in Vietnam' label to avoid tariffs. 'Chinese businesses [are] moving to Vietnam and are processing their imported materials from China and then labeling their products as 'Made in Vietnam' before exporting to the U.S. The U.S. will definitely examine this issue carefully,' Nguyen said. Vietnam, which has long had geopolitical tensions with China, may face the risk of potential reprisal measures from China as Beijing said it would impose retaliatory tariffs on some U.S. goods as soon as next week. However, Vietnam seemed to win big in Trump's first-term trade war with China as the Southeast Asian country attracted manufacturers wanting to avoid Chinese tariffs. If Trump's tariffs are extended to Vietnam, the economic effects could ripple through trade balances, exchange rates, supply chains and foreign direct investment, said Vo Tri Thanh, former vice president at the Central Institute for Economic Management and a member of the National Financial and Monetary Policy Advisory Council, writing in Vietnam News. The sweeping tariffs have triggered the phenomenon of goods being stockpiled in Vietnam and in the region to avoid tax hikes, driving up demand for container shipping and pushing freight costs to new highs. Despite these pressures, Vietnam may find itself positioned to capitalize on global supply chain shifts, Nguyen Hong Dien, Vietnam's minister of industry and trade, told Tuoi Tre Online, explaining that the country could attract more investment in high-value sectors.	https://www.voanews.com/a/vietnam-braces-for-fallout-from-us-tariffs-on-chinese-goods/7967258.html	2025-02-07T15:40:41-08:00	
Authorities continue search for plane missing in Alaska	Rescuers in Alaska continued their search Friday for an airplane that went missing Thursday with nine passengers and a pilot onboard. Several groups were involved in the search, including the Alaska State Troopers, the U.S. Coast Guard, the Alaska Air National Guard, the Alaska Army National Guard and local search teams. Authorities said a Jayhawk helicopter was brought in Friday morning to help with the search. The FBI was also providing technical assistance, including cellphone analysis, to help locate the aircraft. The Bering Air Caravan flight was traveling in western Alaska, just south of the Arctic Circle, from Unalakleet to Nome. State troopers said they were notified Thursday at 4 p.m. about the plane's disappearance. The Coast Guard said on X that the flight was 19 kilometers offshore when its position was lost.

US judge to temporarily block Trump from taking some steps to dismantle USAID	WASHINGTON — A U.S. judge on Friday said he would enter a 'limited' order temporarily blocking the Trump administration from taking some steps to dismantle the U.S. Agency for International Development, adding that 2,200 employees from the agency would not immediately be placed on administrative leave. U.S. District Judge Carl Nichols in Washington, who was nominated by Trump during his first term, announced the decision at a hearing on a lawsuit from the largest U.S. government workers' union and an association of foreign service workers, who sued to stop the administration from dismantling the agency. Nichols said the written ruling would be issued later Friday. The administration in a notice sent to the foreign aid agency's workers on Thursday said it would keep 611 essential workers on board at USAID out of a worldwide workforce that totals more than 10,000. 'The major reduction in force, as well as the closure of offices, the forced relocation of these individuals were all done in excess of the executive’s authority in violation of the separation of powers,' Karla Gilbride, a lawyer for the unions, said at the hearing. A Justice Department official, Brett Shumate, told Nichols that about 2,200 USAID employees would be put on paid leave under the administration's plans, adding that 500 had already been placed on leave. 'The president has decided there is corruption and fraud at USAID,' Shumate said. However, the judge said his order would prevent those 2,200 employees from being immediately placed on administrative leave and would also pause the relocation of certain humanitarian workers stationed outside the United States. Hours after he was inaugurated on Jan. 20, Trump ordered all U.S. foreign aid be paused to ensure it was aligned with his 'America First' policy. Chaos has since consumed USAID, which distributes billions of dollars of humanitarian aid around the world. The State Department issued worldwide stop-work directives after the executive order was issued, effectively freezing all foreign aid with the exception of emergency food assistance. That brought USAID programs covering lifesaving aid around the globe to a grinding halt, in a move that experts warned risked killing people. The gutting of the agency has largely been overseen by businessman Elon Musk, the world's richest man and a close Trump ally spearheading the president's effort to shrink the federal bureaucracy. In fiscal 2023, the United States disbursed, partly via USAID, $72 billion of aid worldwide on everything from women's health in conflict zones to access to clean water, HIV/AIDS treatments, energy security and anti-corruption work. The U.S. provided 42% of all humanitarian aid tracked by the United Nations in 2024, yet that represents less than 1% of its total budget.	https://www.voanews.com/a/us-judge-to-temporarily-block-trump-from-taking-some-steps-to-dismantle-usaid/7967290.html	2025-02-07T15:24:14-08:00

However, analysts say that the nation’s upcoming 'trillion yuan-worth growth track' is still in a 'trial-run' phase, which is why some netizens in China remain skeptical about the government's claim that China faces a shortage of a million drone pilots.

Trump pauses repeal of tariff on packages as they pile up at US customs	WASHINGTON/LONDON/LOS ANGELES — U.S. President Donald Trump paused his administration's repeal of duty-free treatment of low-cost packages from China on Friday, giving the Commerce Department time to make the order workable, after the rapid change sparked chaos for customs inspectors, postal and delivery services and online retailers. The cancellation of de minimis means low-value e-commerce packages arriving in the United States with goods from China must use the 'formal entry' process that requires additional information and duties before entering the country — a more time-consuming process. The stop and restart of the United States Postal Service acceptance of those packages set off a swarm of disruptions that backed up Customs clearance for packages — even those that had paid duties — at New York City's John F. Kennedy International Airport. 'Well, that was a fun Tuesday through Friday, if you work in global e-commerce,' said Derek Lossing, CEO of e-commerce and global supply chain firm Cirrus Global Advisors. The change, implemented with just 48 hours' notice, caused the USPS to temporarily stop accepting packages from China and Hong Kong earlier this week. Popular online retailers, including Shein, Temu and Amazon.com's new Haul service, fly packages direct from Chinese factories to U.S. shoppers and use de minimis to keep prices low. Those retailers did not immediately respond to requests for comment. The Trump administration's revision to the order was signed on Wednesday and published today, a White House spokesperson said. U.S. Customs and Border Protection, which has the job of screening e-commerce packages and collecting duties on them, on Thursday held a meeting with logistics professionals to discuss the status of more than 1 million packages piling up at JFK Airport, according to a source familiar with the meeting. One logistics executive on Friday told Reuters that customs had begun releasing packages it was holding at JFK, which has been taking in about 60 million de minimis e-commerce packages annually. Trump scrapped the duty-free treatment for Chinese goods with the stated aim of stopping the flow of fentanyl and precursor chemicals into the United States. White House officials have said Canada and Mexico are conduits for shipments of fentanyl and its precursor chemicals into the U.S. in small packages that are not often inspected by customs agents. While fentanyl traffickers have exploited a U.S. trade law, public data shows 0.2% of all fentanyl seized in the U.S. comes from the Canadian border, while the vast majority originates from the southern border. Many shipping experts and attorneys warned that switch would overwhelm customs inspections because the agency does not have systems and processes in place. Its staff are also stretched thin because they fall under the U.S. Department of Homeland Security, which also is responsible for border security. Companies like Shein and Temu had halted some air cargo flights, invoking force majeure to cancel agreements without penalties, said Kathy Liu, Director of Global sales and marketing, Asia-focused freight forwarder Dimerco. U.S. shoppers also got hit with bills for duties on purchases of dresses, tops and baby clothing that previously were exempt. It is not immediately clear whether those consumers would be eligible for refunds for any duties paid. 'We're navigating these significant changes to U.S. trade policy as they come, as best we can on behalf of our clients,' said Brian Bourke, global chief commercial officer for SEKO Logistics, which moves e-commerce packages targeted with new duties. Delivery firms UPS, FedEx and DHL also handle those packages. Their representatives did not immediately comment on the Trump administration's pause on duty collection.	https://www.voanews.com/a/trump-pauses-repeal-of-tariff-on-packages-as-they-pile-up-at-us-customs-/7967176.html	2025-02-07T14:19:33-08:00

Trump updates Iran peace deal effort to reflect new realities, analysts say	WASHINGTON — U.S. President Donald Trump’s peace overtures toward Iran this week — made as he signed a directive to put the country under 'maximum pressure' for malign behavior — signal a revived policy that some analysts say has evolved from his first term as he adapts to Iran’s new circumstances. Trump made his overture in a Wednesday post on his Truth Social platform, saying he seeks a 'Verified Nuclear Peace Agreement, which will let Iran peacefully grow and prosper' in return for ensuring that the Islamic Republic 'cannot have a Nuclear Weapon.' A day earlier, Trump also told a news conference with visiting Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, 'I would love to be able to make a great deal [with Iran], a deal where you can get on with your lives, and you'll do wonderfully.' In 2020, during Trump’s first term, Jared Kushner, Trump’s son-in-law and then a senior adviser, made a similar, if more muted, appeal to Iran's then-President Hassan Rouhani, in an interview with VOA. 'For President Rouhani, I would say it’s time for the region to move forward. Let’s stop being stuck in conflicts of the past. It’s time for people to get together and to make peace,' he said. At the time, Trump said a key goal of his original 'maximum pressure' campaign was to negotiate a new bilateral agreement to end Iran’s perceived malign behaviors that he said were not sufficiently addressed by Tehran’s 2015 nuclear deal with world powers. Trump withdrew the United States from that deal in 2018 and started the pressure policy. Trump revived his 'maximum pressure' policy by signing a presidential memorandum Tuesday, directing a series of economic and legal measures to counter Iranian activities that threaten U.S. national interests. The document highlighted Iran’s development of nuclear weapons-related capabilities, ballistic missiles and its regional aggression through support of proxy forces. ‘Higher ambitions and more tools for pressure’ The new Iran policy is 'qualitatively different' from what Trump pursued in his first term, Brian Katulis, a senior fellow of the Washington-based Middle East Institute, told VOA. 'It has higher ambitions and more tools for pressure,' he said. Iranian Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei responded to Trump's new policy Friday, saying Trump's withdrawal from the 2015 nuclear deal shows that negotiating with the U.S. 'is neither rational, nor intelligent, nor honorable, and [we] should not engage in negotiations with it.' Iranian state media said Khamenei made the comment while speaking to a gathering of air force personnel. They also quoted him as issuing the following warning to the U.S.: 'If they threaten us, we will threaten them. If they carry out their threat, we will carry out our threat. And if they disrupt the security of our nation, we will definitely disrupt their security as well.' Iran long has denied seeking nuclear weapons. The International Atomic Energy Agency has said Iran suspended an active nuclear weapons program in 2003, but Israel, a U.S. ally, said in 2018 its agents in Tehran stole documents indicating the Iranian government had covertly continued that program. Trump’s new 'maximum pressure' memorandum includes two specific measures that were prominent features of his first term campaign — seeking to drive Iran’s export of oil, its highest revenue-earner, to zero and calling for a snapback, or return, of international sanctions the U.N. Security Council lifted under the 2015 nuclear deal. In the first announcement of new sanctions in Trump’s second term, the U.S. Treasury Department on Thursday, targeted Iran’s oil exports by sanctioning an international network it said facilitates the shipment of 'millions of barrels of Iranian crude oil worth hundreds of millions of dollars' to China, Iran’s top oil customer. Trump’s goals of reducing Iranian oil exports to zero and restoring international sanctions on Iran were not fully achieved in his first term. An October 2024 report by the U.S. Energy Information Administration said Iran’s crude oil and condensate exports reached a low of 0.4 million barrels per day in 2020 'due to the U.S. reimposition of sanctions in November 2018 and the decline in demand because of the COVID-19 pandemic.' Trump’s first administration also unilaterally declared a restoration of international sanctions on Iran in September 2020, but most other U.N. Security Council members rejected the move. They asserted the U.S. had forfeited its right to trigger the return of international sanctions by quitting the 2015 nuclear deal that lifted those sanctions. One provision of Trump’s new Iran memorandum, setting a goal that was not explicitly stated in his first term, is ensuring neither Iraq nor the Gulf countries can be used by Tehran to evade sanctions. Trump’s first administration had tried to stop such evasion by Iran, according to Elliott Abrams, a Council on Foreign Relations senior fellow who served as U.S. special envoy for Iran at the end of Trump’s first term. Responding to a VOA question in a Federalist Society webinar on Thursday, Abrams said, 'There were points at which we said to the Emiratis, ‘Look, Dubai is being used by the Iranians to get around sanctions. Close that down.’' He said the second Trump administration appears to be giving that objective more public attention. Another new feature of Trump's pressure campaign is its order to 'modify or rescind sanctions waivers ... that provide Iran any degree of economic or financial relief ... related to Iran’s Chabahar port project.' India has been developing a terminal at the Iranian port under a 2016 agreement and secured a waiver from the first Trump administration in 2018 to continue the project to facilitate humanitarian aid to Afghanistan. The Biden administration extended the waiver, but when India signed a deal last year to operate the Iranian port for a decade, Biden’s State Department said that 'anyone considering business deals with Iran, they need to be aware of the potential risk that they are opening themselves up to ... sanctions.' 'Enhanced' campaign seen Jason Brodsky, policy director of U.S. advocacy group United Against Nuclear Iran, told VOA he expects to see Trump pursue an 'enhanced' maximum pressure campaign that is tailored to the 'changed geopolitical realities of 2025, rather than to 2018.' One of those new realities is a major rebound in Iranian oil exports, primarily due to what Brodsky said was lax Biden administration sanctions enforcement. The U.S. Energy Information Administration’s October report, citing data from international energy analytics company Vortexa, said Iran’s oil exports increased to an average of 1.5 million barrels per day in the first eight months of last year. The Biden administration rejected accusations of lax sanctions enforcement made by critics of its Iran policy while it was in office, highlighting its sanctioning of hundreds of entities for Iran-related activities. But Biden’s treasury secretary, Janet Yellen, said in April 2024 that Iran was 'continuing to export some oil' and added, 'there may be more that we could do.' Other new factors Brodsky cited as reasons for Trump to enhance his maximum pressure strategy include Iran’s progress in uranium enrichment during the Biden administration and Tehran’s recent regional losses. In the past year, Israel killed the leaders of Iran’s terror proxies Hezbollah and Hamas in Lebanon and Gaza, while Islamist rebels in Syria ousted longtime Iran-backed leader Bashar al-Assad from power. But Brodsky said the new maximum pressure memorandum also raises questions about what Trump wants out of a potential new deal with Iran. He noted the document calls for ending the '[Iranian] regime’s nuclear extortion racket' and asked whether this means Trump will demand that Iran stop uranium enrichment, as Trump did in his first term. 'We don't have answers right now,' Brodsky said.	https://www.voanews.com/a/trump-updates-iran-peace-deal-effort-to-reflect-new-realities-analysts-say/7967220.html	2025-02-07T14:08:27-08:00

Live poultry markets ordered shut in New York because of avian flu outbreak	NEW YORK — All live poultry markets in New York City and some of its suburbs were ordered Friday to close for a week after the detection of seven cases of avian flu, which has also hit farms nationwide. Governor Kathy Hochul said that there was no immediate threat to public health and that the temporary closure of bird markets in the city and its Westchester County and Long Island suburbs came out of an abundance of caution. No cases of avian flu have been detected among humans in New York, officials said. The birds infected with the virus were found during routine inspections of live bird markets in the New York City boroughs of the Bronx, Brooklyn and Queens. The U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention has said the virus poses low risk to the general public. The agency said there have been 67 confirmed cases of bird flu in humans in the U.S., with illnesses mild and mostly detected among farmworkers who were exposed to sick poultry or sick dairy cows. The first bird flu death in the U.S. was reported last month in Louisiana, with health officials saying the person was older than 65, had underlying medical problems and had been in contact with sick and dead birds in a backyard flock. In New York, live bird markets where the virus was detected have to dispose of all poultry in a sanitary manner, according to the state's order. Other bird markets that do not have cases will have to sell off remaining poultry within three days, clean and disinfect their operations, and then remain closed for at least five days and be inspected by state officials before reopening. Ahead of the mandatory disposal order for markets with no cases, employees at La Granja, a halal-certified poultry market in Manhattan's Harlem neighborhood, raced to sell the remaining inventory: around 200 live chickens of different varieties, along with turkeys, quail, ducks, roosters, pigeons and rabbits. Any remaining animals would be slaughtered and given to employees and longtime customers, according to Jose Fernandez, the owner. 'We're going to lose money, for now,' he said. 'But the law is the law. They know what they're doing.' The H5N1 strain of bird flu has been spreading among wild birds, poultry, cows and other animals. Officials have urged people who come into contact with sick or dead birds to wear respiratory and eye protection and gloves when handling poultry. More than 156 million birds nationwide have been affected by the outbreak, many at large farming operations that have had to slaughter their entire flocks. Despite growing attention on the avian flu, New York City's poultry markets appeared to be doing brisk business Friday. Outside the Wallabout Poultry market in Brooklyn, a line of customers took numbers and picked their chickens, which employees snatched from crowded cages, weighing them upside down, before taking them to a back room to be slaughtered. 'I'm not worried about any bird flu,' said Stan Tara, 42, of Brooklyn, as he purchased a large chicken for $22.50. 'It's the same as you buy from the supermarket. A little more expensive, but at least it's fresh.' Some animal rights groups, meanwhile, questioned the purpose of a state order that allowed the markets to continue selling fowl, rather than shutting them down immediately. 'The public is going into markets where no one knows if there are outbreaks of avian flu, then taking home dead birds that may or may not be infected,' said Edita Birnkrant, executive director of NYCLASS, which has long raised alarms about conditions within the city's roughly 70 live animal markets. 'It's ludicrous.' U.S. egg prices are likely to remain high past Easter and well into 2025, largely because of avian flu, according to CoBank, a Denver-based provider of loans and other financial services to the agriculture sector. The highly contagious virus has affected nearly 100 million egg-laying hens in the U.S. since 2022. But CoBank said other factors are also causing supply constraints and driving up prices, such as skyrocketing consumer demand for eggs in recent years. Fast-growing breakfast and brunch chains are also eating up supplies.	https://www.voanews.com/a/live-poultry-markets-ordered-shut-in-new-york-city-because-of-avian-flu-outbreak-/7967127.html	2025-02-07T12:53:51-08:00	
US flu season most intense in at least 15 years	NEW YORK — The U.S. winter virus season is in full force, and by one measure is the most intense in 15 years. One indicator of flu activity is the percentage of doctor's office visits driven by flu-like symptoms. Last week, that number was clearly higher than the peak of any winter flu season since 2009-10, according to data posted Friday by the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. Of course, other viral infections can be mistaken for flu. But COVID-19 appears to be on the decline, according to hospital data and CDC modeling projections. Available data also suggests another respiratory illness, RSV, or respiratory syncytial virus, has been fading nationally. The flu has forced schools to shut down in some states. The Godley Independent School District, a 3,200-student system near Fort Worth, Texas, last week closed for three days after 650 students and 60 staff were out Tuesday. Jeff Meador, a district spokesman, said most illnesses there have been flu, plus some strep throat. He called it the worst flu season he could remember. So far this season, the CDC estimates, there have been at least 24 million flu illnesses, 310,000 hospitalizations and 13,000 deaths — including at least 57 children. Traditionally, flu season peaks around February. Overall, 43 states reported high or very high flu activity last week. Flu was most intense in the South, Southwest and Western states. In Rochester, New York, the flu season has been intense but not necessarily worse than at the peak of other years, said Dr. Elizabeth Murray, a pediatric emergency medicine doctor at the University of Rochester Medical Center. She said there is a lot of flu, but there is also still a lot of RSV and a surprising number of babies with COVID-19. 'All of the respiratory illnesses are around, with a vengeance,' Murray added. The CDC declined to let an Associated Press reporter speak to an agency flu expert about recent trends. The Trump administration ordered a temporary 'pause' on health agency communications and has continued to refuse interview requests that were routinely granted in the past. U.S. health officials recommend that everyone 6 months and older get an annual flu vaccination. About 44% of adults got flu shots this winter, the same as last winter. But coverage of children is down, at about 45% this winter. It's usually around 50%, according to CDC data. About 23% of U.S. adults were up to date on their COVID-19 vaccinations as of late January, up from about 20% at the same point in time the year before. COVID-19 vaccination rates for kids were about the same, at around 12%. The government has not yet reported its estimates of how well this season's flu vaccine is working. Testing results from patients indicate that two strains of seasonal flu are causing the most illnesses: type A H1N1 and H3N2. Health officials are closely watching a third strain — H5N1 bird flu — that has sickened tens of millions of animals and is known to have infected 67 people in the U.S. To avoid seasonal viruses, doctors say you should avoid touching your eyes, nose and mouth because germs can spread that way. You should also wash your hands with soap and water, clean frequently touched surfaces, and avoid close contact with people who are sick.	https://www.voanews.com/a/us-flu-season-most-intense-in-at-least-15-years-/7967118.html	2025-02-07T12:51:57-08:00	
Plane crashes into street in Brazil, killing 2 on board	SAO PAULO — A small aircraft crashed on an avenue in Sao Paulo on Friday morning shortly after taking off from a nearby private airport, killing the pilot and the plane's owner, authorities said. The two were the only people on board. The plane went down in the busy Barra Funda neighborhood on the west side of the city, near its downtown. A piece of the plane hit a bus, injuring one woman inside, while a motorcyclist was struck by another piece of wreckage, the firefighters' statement said. Both were receiving medical care. A later statement said that four more people who were injured were taken to hospitals in the area with minor injuries. Governor Tarcisio de Freitas said on X that the two dead were the pilot, Gustavo Medeiros, and the owner of the aircraft, Marcio Carpena. A CCTV video obtained by the local television network TV Globo showed the moment of the crash. The plane slammed into the avenue a few meters past an intersection, where a line of cars was waiting to move forward. Images on local media showed the plane's fuselage and the bus on fire, with firefighters working to extinguish the blaze. The avenue is home to office buildings, and there is a bus, train and subway station nearby. There was no word as to what caused the plane to lose altitude less than 5 kilometers from the private airport from where it departed a few minutes earlier. It was bound to Porto Alegre in the southern Rio Grande do Sul state. The Brazilian air force said it would investigate the accident as fast as possible. Brazil has had several deadly, small aircraft crashes in recent years, including one last August in Vinhedo, near Sao Paulo that was particularly shocking. Images from that crash showed a passenger plane falling in a flat spin before crashing into the backyard of a home in a gated community, killing all 72 people on board.	https://www.voanews.com/a/plane-crashes-into-street-in-brazil-killing-2-on-board/7967031.html	2025-02-07T11:58:15-08:00	
Initially exempted, US intelligence faces ‘fork in the road’	WASHINGTON — A handful of key U.S. intelligence agencies have given most of their employees a chance to walk away, offering them the opportunity to take the deferred resignation option extended to the government’s civilian workforce. Under the initial rollout of the plan, aimed at drastically reducing the size of the U.S. government, military and security employees were exempt, due to the critical nature of their work in protecting the United States. But over the past few days, at least five U.S. intelligence agencies have come forward, telling their workforces that they can choose to take the so-called 'fork in the road' deal, allowing them to get paid until September while no longer working on a daily basis. The list includes the CIA, the country’s premiere spy agency, and the Office of the Director of National Intelligence, which is charged with overseeing all 18 U.S. intelligence agencies. The National Security Agency, which specializes in electronic intelligence gathering, the National Geospatial-Intelligence Agency and the National Reconnaissance Office also confirmed to VOA their participation in the downsizing program. A CIA spokesperson, speaking on the condition of anonymity in order to discuss the initiative, said it was triggered by the agency’s newly confirmed director, John Ratcliffe, to be more responsive to President Donald Trump’s priorities. 'These moves are part of a holistic strategy to infuse the Agency with renewed energy, provide opportunities for rising leaders to emerge, and better position the CIA to deliver on its mission,' the spokesperson said in a statement. The other intelligence agencies taking part in the deferred resignation program declined to explain why workers initially seen as critical to U.S. national security are now deemed as expendable. Nor did they answer questions about the impact potential resignations could have on their missions. The White House National Security Council referred questions about the decision to make the intelligence agencies eligible for the program and the potential impact to the U.S. Office of Management and Budget. OMB has yet to respond to multiple requests for comment. The move, though, has raised concern among some former intelligence officers and experts who fear the potential reductions could hamper the ability of U.S. intelligence agencies to gain information and insights that are vital to the security of the U.S. homeland. Daniel Byman, director of the Warfare, Irregular Threats, and Terrorism Program at the Washington-based Center for Strategic and International Studies, said the impact on the CIA could be significant. 'If many employees take the option, it risks reducing the tremendous expertise the CIA has built up on a variety of areas,' he told VOA. 'It takes years to develop the operational and analytic expertise to be a good intelligence officer, and losing this would be a significant blow to U.S. capabilities during a turbulent time in the world,' Byman said, noting that proposed job cuts at the FBI could boost U.S. adversaries that 'try to exploit U.S. security vulnerabilities and influence U.S. public discourse.' Senior Democratic lawmakers such as Senate Intelligence Committee Vice Chairman Mark Warner have likewise raised concerns — noting even Trump’s hiring freeze exempted national security jobs. Others describe the push to get U.S. intelligence officials to quit as 'crazy.' 'I think that's a great way to send some of our best talent packing,' said Representative Raja Krishnamoorthi, the ranking member of the House Select Committee on the Chinese Communist Party. 'It’s a way to help our adversaries,' Krishnamoorthi told VOA. 'I hope that they reconsider this nutty HR [human resources] move and instead try to attract the best and brightest in the intelligence community because we need them.' But Republican Senator Thom Tillis called such fears 'overblown.' 'Really, if people think that special operators and clandestine operators are suddenly going to take it, they don't understand what’s trying to be happening here,' he told VOA. 'What they're trying to do is probably get less out of the head office and less out of administrative positions, so they can put more into the field.' 'The press is going for the worst-case scenario,' Tillis added. 'Most of these people are at the end of their career anyway, and so you're doing buyouts so that you can bring in new people and right-size.' Other former officials see an upside to the inclusion of U.S. intelligence agencies in the deferred resignation program, casting it as a clear message to U.S. adversaries to beware. 'What this says to a country like Russia or China or others, [is] Trump is a very strong leader,' said former U.S. Ambassador to NATO Kurt Volker. 'This is something that they did not see with President [Joe] Biden, who is a weak leader in their eyes,' Volker told VOA. 'In Trump, they see someone who is willing to go there. He is willing to break crockery. He's willing to escalate. He's willing to do what he wants in order to get his will accomplished. That sends a very strong message to adversaries.' The deferred resignation program’s numerical impact on U.S. intelligence agencies remains unclear. U.S. officials say that so far, 65,000 of the government’s approximately 2 million employees have chosen to accept the offer, although the number of intelligence agency employees is classified. The individual agencies are unlikely to release data. The original deadline for government employees — including at the intelligence agencies — to accept the deferred resignation offer was Thursday, but a court order has delayed that until at least Monday.	https://www.voanews.com/a/initially-exempted-us-intelligence-faces-fork-in-the-road-/7967024.html	2025-02-07T11:29:30-08:00	
Cyprus jails Syrian man over toddler death on overloaded migrant boat	NICOSIA, CYPRUS — A Cyprus court sentenced a Syrian national to three years in prison after finding him guilty of causing the death by negligence of a 3-year-old girl from dehydration aboard an overloaded migrant boat that was adrift for six days without adequate supplies of food and water. The Attorney General’s Office said Friday the Famagusta criminal court ruled that the 48-year-old captain had failed to ensure the safety of the 60 Syrian migrants aboard the small wooden craft that carried no navigational aids or appropriate communications equipment. According to the facts of the case, the captain had told the passengers at some point in the journey to throw any remaining bottles of water overboard in a bid to remove any indications that the boat had departed from Lebanon. The boat set sail on Jan. 18, 2024, but an engine failure left the vessel adrift for nearly a week in the eastern Mediterranean, where many of the desperate passengers began to drink sea water and their own urine to quench their thirst. Cypriot authorities had airlifted the little girl, who was accompanied by her mother, to a hospital after locating the boat but medical staff couldn’t save her. The number of people arriving in Cyprus as migrants has fallen precipitously over the past three years after the government in the European Union member took a string of get-tough measures. Authorities said the country’s ability to host and accommodate many thousands of new asylum-seekers was overwhelmed. According to the most recent government data, migrant arrivals to ethnically divided Cyprus — mostly through the breakaway Turkish Cypriot north where government authorities can’t exercise jurisdiction — dropped from 17,278 in 2022 to 6,102 in 2024. Equally, asylum applications plummeted from a record 21,565 to 6,769 over the same time while repatriations increased to nearly 11,000 from 7,700. Considering the fall of Bashar al-Assad in Syria late last year, Cyprus' Deputy Minister for Migration Nicholas Ioannides said some 40 Syrian nationals on average are requesting to either withdraw their asylum application or to revoke their international protection status. Ioannides said some 755 Syrians have already returned to their homeland. But Cyprus has been taken to task for violating migrants’ human rights at sea. Last October, Europe’s top human rights court ruled that Cyprus breached the right of two Syrian nationals to seek asylum after keeping them, and more than two dozen other people, aboard a boat at sea for two days before sending them back to Lebanon.	https://www.voanews.com/a/cyprus-jails-syrian-man-over-toddler-death-on-overloaded-migrant-boat-/7966971.html	2025-02-07T10:45:49-08:00

Trump hosts Japan’s Ishiba amid early moves that have rattled some allies	WHITE HOUSE — U.S. President Donald Trump hosts Japanese Prime Minister Shigeru Ishiba at the White House on Friday, in a visit that Tokyo hopes will reaffirm the U.S.-Japan alliance amid Trump’s early foreign policy moves that have rattled allies and adversaries. Trump and Ishiba are expected to discuss increasing joint military exercises and cooperation on defense equipment and technology, ramping up Japanese investments to the United States, and American energy exports to Japan, a senior Trump administration official said in a briefing to reporters Friday. The official said they also will talk about improving cybersecurity capabilities, bolstering space cooperation and promoting joint business opportunities to develop critical technologies, including AI and semiconductors. Ishiba’s visit comes amid anxiety in Tokyo as Trump has put pressure on some U.S. allies and partners, saying he wants to absorb Canada as a U.S. state, acquire Greenland from Denmark and take control of the Panama Canal. 'We would like to first establish a higher relationship of trust and cooperation between two countries, especially the two leaders,' a senior Japanese government official told reporters during a briefing Thursday. The U.S. president has imposed fresh 10% tariffs on China and 25% tariffs on Canada and Mexico — although the latter two have been at least temporarily delayed. He has warned of possible tariffs against other countries, especially those with whom the U.S. holds a trade deficit, such as Japan. 'We all know that President Trump pays a lot of attention to the deficit as an indication of the economic strength of the relationship. So, I'm sure discussions will happen about that,' the Trump administration official said. Other strains on the U.S.-Japan relationship include former President Joe Biden’s blocking of a $15 billion acquisition bid by Japan’s largest steel producer, Nippon Steel, for Pittsburgh-based U.S. Steel. Biden blocked the deal during the final weeks of his term, citing national security concerns. Trump has said he also opposes the deal. The White House has not responded to VOA’s query on Trump’s current position on Nippon Steel. The Japanese prime minister’s office did not respond to VOA’s query on whether the issue will be raised today. Continuity on security front Under then-Prime Minister Fumio Kishida, Japan became a key player in what the Biden administration called a 'lattice-like strategic architecture' to bolster deterrence against the two main U.S. adversaries in the Pacific: China and North Korea. Biden’s approach connected Tokyo with other allies in trilateral formats and other groupings, including with South Korea, Australia and the Philippines, to deter regional threats in the Taiwan Strait, the South China Sea and Korean Peninsula. Japan is anxious to maintain ties forged in recent years, during which time Tokyo has increased defense spending and intensified joint military exercises with the U.S. and other regional allies. Japan needs a 'multilayered network of security' to defend itself, the senior Japanese official said. The Trump administration will continue to support trilateral efforts and some of the working groups that have come out from under those over the last few years, the Trump official said. 'There may be some adjustments to where the focus is on trilateral cooperation, but I think largely you will see continuity.' Under his first term, Trump and then-Prime Minister Shinzo Abe agreed on the 'free and open Indo-Pacific' framework to promote peace and prosperity in the region. The two countries also agreed to elevate what’s known as the Quad grouping with India and Australia. The fact that the Trump administration sees those formats as a critical part of its strategy in the Pacific is important, said Jeffrey Hornung, the Japan Lead for the RAND National Security Research Division. A key indicator to watch is whether the leaders will come out with a joint statement on a free and open Indo-Pacific. While it may sound like a diplomatic cliché, it would deliver a strong message to Beijing to not be provocative toward Taiwan, Hornung told VOA. In dealing with the threats from Pyongyang, the Trump official underscored the U.S. is 'committed to the complete denuclearization of North Korea.' Making deals with Japan While maintaining the security alliance, analysts say Trump may use the visit as an opportunity to broker deals that would further his 'America First' agenda, using what he sees as Tokyo’s interests as leverage. 'Part of President Trump's negotiating stance for almost all issues is that we don't really know where he wants to land in the end,' said Kenji Kushida, a senior fellow at the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace. 'If the promise to allow Nippon Steel to acquire U.S. Steel can be used as bargaining leverage, he may use this to get Japan to pay much more than they're already committed, to help contribute to U.S. military bases and other defense costs,' he told VOA. Ahead of Ishiba’s visit, Nippon Steel said its proposed acquisition is aligned with Trump's goals of a stronger United States. 'From Japan's perspective, they want to position themselves as the staunch ally of U.S. interests in Asia, and so fitting into that set of interests is Nippon Steel's strategy here,' Kushida said. Tokyo is aware of what Trump wants — investments in key industries such as AI and semiconductors, increasing Tokyo’s defense spending and American energy purchase. 'Those are all areas that Japan does have shared interests. They have technology. They have the money to invest in some of these areas, and so they're able to use their leverage in a very strategic manner,' Hornung said. 'At the same time, trying to promote with Trump the things that they're interested in: making sure that U.S. forces remain in Japan, making sure that the U.S. remains committed to the Indo-Pacific.' The best-case scenario for Ishiba is that Trump doesn’t ask beyond what Tokyo already expected, said Kushida. 'Perhaps an increase in the defense sharing burden, mainly buying U.S. military equipment, expansion of U.S. bases, perhaps, and then perhaps some other financial commitments, but nothing that would upset the sort of geopolitical status in East Asia to Japan's disadvantage,' Kushida said. 'Nothing very extreme, or to get mixed in with some of the issues In the Middle East in ways that Japan has been trying to keep out.' The leaders are expected to hold a press conference later Friday.	https://www.voanews.com/a/trump-hosts-japan-s-ishiba-amid-early-moves-that-have-rattled-some-allies/7966846.html	2025-02-07T09:37:36-08:00	
US to push Russia to end war in Ukraine through sanctions	The U.S. special envoy to Russia and Ukraine said Thursday the U.S. plans to significantly step up pressure on Russia through sanctions to end the war in Ukraine. In an exclusive interview with the New York Post, Special Envoy Keith Kellogg said there is a lot of room to increase sanctions on Russia, particularly in Russia’s energy sector. He characterized sanctions enforcement on Russia as 'only about a 3' on a scale of 1 to 10 on 'how painful the economic pressure can be.' Kellogg told the Post he understands that both Moscow and Kyiv will have to make concessions to end what he called the 'industrial-sized' killing in the war. In the interview, Kellogg also was critical of the approach by the administration of former President Joe Biden of 'supporting Ukraine as long as it takes,' calling it 'a bumper sticker, not a strategy.' Kellogg said the Trump administration is focused on a 'holistic approach' to ending the war, combining support for Ukraine with increased pressure on Russia. Kellogg’s Chief of Staff Ludovic Hood echoed those sentiments when he told the GLOBSEC Transatlantic Forum in Washington on Thursday, 'Nothing's off the table at this stage' as far as negotiations for a peace deal. Meanwhile, Ukraine’s presidential website reported the U.S. special envoy also spoke Thursday with Ukraine's head of the office of the president, Andriy Yermak. In a statement, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy’s office said the two discussed Kellogg’s upcoming visit to Ukraine, as well as the situation on the front lines and security issues for Ukrainian civilians. The statement said the two gave 'special attention' in their conversation to the upcoming Munich Security Conference, scheduled to begin in one week. In a separate interview with the Associated Press on Thursday, Yermak stressed the importance of 'active engagement' between Ukraine and the Trump administration, particularly as any peace negotiations. Yermak emphasized the importance of keeping the Trump White House up to date and providing accurate information about the battlefield situation. He said direct communication with U.S. partners is crucial for establishing a shared position, because it is impossible to form any peace plans without Ukraine. Meanwhile, in the latest reports from the battlefield, Ukraine’s air force reported Friday – from its Telegram social media account – Russian attacks across multiple Ukrainian regions killed at least three civilians and injured five over the past 24 hours. The report said Ukrainian air defenses shot down 81 of 112 Shahed combat drones and decoy drones Russia launched over nine oblasts, or regions, while 31 other drones were lost without causing damage. From his Telegram account, Kherson Governor Oleksandr Prokudin said Russian shelling killed one person and wounded five others, and two high-rise buildings and six private houses were damaged. The regional administration in Sumy Oblast says two people were killed when Russian shelling destroyed a two-story apartment building. The report said the victims’ bodies were found in the rubble as rescue crews cleared the area and there are fears more bodies could be found.	https://www.voanews.com/a/us-to-push-russia-to-end-war-in-ukraine-through-sanctions/7966748.html	2025-02-07T08:22:39-08:00

African nations prepare for what's to come after pause on US aid	NAIROBI, KENYA — African governments are gearing up for what is to come following the 90-day pause on most U.S.-funded foreign aid as they worry about the potential effects. In Kenya, for instance, Health Cabinet Secretary Deborah Barasa said Wednesday in Nairobi that as her country navigates complex challenges, ensuring continuation of essential health services, especially with programs related to HIV/AIDS and tuberculosis, is essential. 'For more than 40 years, we’ve been able to depend on partners. PEPFAR has done a great job in ensuring that HIV patients, TB patients are receiving health services,' she said, referring to the U.S. President’s Emergency Plan for AIDS Relief, a program that works with partners in 55 countries worldwide. 'With more than 3.7 million being on HIV medication [in Kenya] … I believe it’s critical for us to think of sustainable solutions ... [and] alternative forms of funding,' Barasa said. While the freeze has been modified to allow waivers for 'life-saving humanitarian assistance,' including 'core life-saving medicine,' which may apply to health programs such as PEPFAR, many countries are working to assess the implications of what may amount to an end of U.S. foreign aid. U.S. Secretary of State Marco Rubio said the waiver is clear: 'If it saves lives, if it’s emergency lifesaving aid — food, medicine, whatever — they have a waiver. I don’t know how much clearer we can be.' South Africa, with 7.8 million people with HIV, has been one of the biggest beneficiaries of the PEPFAR program the past two decades. Its health minister, Aaron Motsoaledi, told reporters last week in Johannesburg that the country was taken by surprise by the pause in aid and that officials are still trying to decipher the full meaning. This week, Motsoaledi met with U.S. Embassy officials to discuss bilateral health cooperation and the new U.S. policies on assistance. The two sides promised to keep the communications channels open as they discuss lifesaving health partnerships, according to a joint statement after the meeting. Asanda Ngoasheng, a South African political analyst, said countries will be affected one way or the other because many public health systems exist only because of the PEPFAR program. 'Even in the case PEPFAR is not funding 100% of the programs, any money that is removed means that countries simply would not be able to afford programs that they were able to afford with the money that was being supplemented by PEPFAR before,' Ngoasheng said. Programs not related to health are also affected. In Senegal, for example, an infrastructure and development project financed by the Millennium Challenge Corporation, an initiative that was started by Republican U.S. President George W. Bush, could lose funding. The $550 million power project being implemented by Millennium Challenge Account Senegal was designed to improve the country’s transmission network and increase electricity access in rural areas and to those on the outskirts of cities in the south and central regions. Mamadou Thior, a journalist and chair of the media watchdog CORED, told VOA: 'The financing coming from the U.S. for this second phase will impact about 12 million people.' Thior referred to a recent speech by Senegalese Prime Minister Ousmane Sonko that emphasized the need for countries to work on being self-sufficient. 'It’s high time for Africans and other people to depend on themselves and not from Western aid because this is what can be the drawbacks,' Thior said. 'They will have to depend on national resources to go ahead with the rest of the [electricity] project because there’s no way to go backwards,' he said. In Nigeria, a country that received about $1 billion in U.S. foreign aid last year, officials this week launched a committee with members from finance, health and environmental ministries to develop an alternative for some U.S.-funded programs.	https://www.voanews.com/a/african-nations-prepare-for-what-s-to-come-after-pause-on-us-aid/7966642.html	2025-02-07T07:22:39-08:00

US employers added just 143,000 jobs last month, jobless rate slips to 4% to start the year	Washington — U.S. employers added just 143,000 jobs last month, but the jobless rate slipped to 4% to start 2025 and the government revised November and December payrolls higher. The first job report of Donald Trump’s second presidency suggested that he inherited a labor market that is solid but unspectacular. Economists had expected about 170,000 new jobs in January. It's a downshift from 2024 which averaged 186,000 new jobs a month, including a surge of 256,000 in December. The unemployment rate is expected to remain low at 4.1%. The future is cloudier. A federal judge on Thursday temporarily blocked President Donald Trump's plan to push out federal workers by offering them financial incentives, yet a federal hiring freeze that Trump imposed January 20 is a 'negative for employment growth,’’ Bradley Saunders, an economist at Capital Economics, wrote in a commentary last week. The freeze came after the Labor Department collected the January jobs numbers, so any impact would be revealed in upcoming employment data. Likewise, a cold snap that probably increased seasonal layoffs in the Midwest and Northeast occurred late in January and won’t register in government jobs data until the February numbers come out, Saunders wrote. Economists are also worried about Trump’s threat to wage a trade war against other countries. He’s already imposed a 10% tax on imports from China. Canada and Mexico — America’s two largest trading partners — remain in his crosshairs, although he gave them a 30-day reprieve from the 25% tariffs he was planning to sock them with on Tuesday, allowing time for negotiations. Trump says that America’s two neighbors and allies haven’t done enough to stem the flow of undocumented immigrants and fentanyl into the United States. Trump is also ready to slap tariffs on the European Union; pointing to America’s deficit in the trade of goods with the EU, which came to $236 billion last year, he says that Europe treats U.S. exporters unfairly. The tariffs, which are paid by U.S. importers who generally try to pass along the cost to customers, could rekindle inflation – which has fallen from the four-decade high it reached in mid-2022 but is still stuck above the Fed’s 2% target. If the tariffs push prices higher, the Fed may cancel or postpone the two interest-rate cuts it had forecast for this year. And that would be bad for economic growth and job creation. The job market already has cooled from the red-hot days of 2021-2023. American payrolls increased by 2.2 million last year, down from 3 million in 2023, 4.5 million in 2022 and a record 7.2 million in 2021 as the economy roared back from COVID-19 lockdowns. The Labor Department also reports that employers are posting fewer jobs. Monthly job openings have tumbled from a record 12.2 million in March 2022, to 7.6 million in December – still a decent number by historical standards. As the labor market cools, American workers are losing confidence in their ability to find better pay or working conditions by changing jobs. The number of people quitting has fallen from a record 4.5 million near the height of the hiring boom in April 2022, to December’s 3.2 million, which is below pre-pandemic levels. Still, layoffs remain below pre-pandemic levels, creating an unusual situation: If you are employed, you probably enjoy job security. If you’re looking for one, things have gotten tougher. The Labor Department also is expected to report annually released revisions Friday that will show job creation from April 2023 through March 2024 wasn’t as strong as originally reported. A preliminary version of the revisions, released in August, showed that 818,000 fewer jobs were created over those 12 months – lowering average monthly hiring during that span from 242,000 to 174,000. Because they are not final, the August estimates have not yet been added to the official government payroll numbers. The revisions out Friday will become official and part of the historic data.	https://www.voanews.com/a/us-employers-added-just-143-000-jobs-last-month-jobless-rate-slips-to-4-to-start-the-year-/7966610.html	2025-02-07T06:46:16-08:00	
Iran's supreme leader criticizes proposed nuclear talks with US	DUBAI, UNITED ARAB EMIRATES — Iran's supreme leader said Friday that negotiations with America 'are not intelligent, wise or honorable' after U.S. President Donald Trump floated the idea of nuclear talks with Tehran. Ayatollah Ali Khamenei also suggested that 'there should be no negotiations with such a government' but stopped short of issuing a direct order not to engage with Washington. Khamenei's remarks upend months of signals from Tehran to the United States that it wanted to negotiate over its rapidly advancing nuclear program in exchange for the lifting of crushing economic sanctions worth billions of dollars. What happens next remains unclear, particularly as reformist President Masoud Pezeshkian promised as recently as Thursday to enter a dialogue with the West. Khamenei’s remarks to air force officers in Tehran appeared to contradict his own earlier remarks in August that opened the door to talks. However, the 85-year-old Khamenei has always been careful with remarks about negotiating with the West. That includes balancing the demands of reformists within the country who want the talks against hard-line elements within Iran’s theocracy, including the paramilitary Revolutionary Guard. Khamenei noted that Trump unilaterally withdrew from the earlier nuclear deal under which Iran drastically limited its enrichment of uranium and overall stockpile of the material, in exchange for crushing sanctions being removed. 'The Americans did not uphold their end of the deal,' Khamenei said. 'The very person who is in office today tore up the agreement. He said he would, and he did.' He added: 'This is an experience we must learn from. We negotiated, we gave concessions, we compromised — but we did not achieve the results we aimed for. And despite all its flaws, the other side ultimately violated and destroyed the agreement.' Mixed messages from Trump It's not clear what sparked Khamenei's remarks. However, they come after Trump suggested he wanted to deal with Tehran, even while signing an executive order to reimpose his 'maximum pressure' approach to Iran on Tuesday. 'I’m going to sign it, but hopefully we’re not going to have to use it very much,' he said from the Oval Office. 'We will see whether or not we can arrange or work out a deal with Iran. 'We don’t want to be tough on Iran. We don’t want to be tough on anybody,' Trump said. 'But they just can’t have a nuclear bomb.' Trump followed with another online message on Wednesday, saying: 'Reports that the United States, working in conjunction with Israel, is going to blow Iran into smithereens, ARE GREATLY EXAGGERATED. 'I would much prefer a Verified Nuclear Peace Agreement, which will let Iran peacefully grow and prosper,' he wrote on Truth Social. 'We should start working on it immediately, and have a big Middle East Celebration when it is signed and completed.' He did not elaborate. Nuclear enrichment Khamenei, like other Iranian leaders, uses elliptical comments to indirectly govern policy while not boxing himself into any one decision. As supreme leader, he's also created a vast bureaucracy that competes with itself for influence, including with its civilian leadership under Pezeshkian. As recently as Thursday, Pezeshkian suggested Iran could open itself up to even more inspections from the United Nations' nuclear watchdog, the International Atomic Energy Agency. 'They [can] come and inspect one hundred times more since we are not supposed to go after' a nuclear weapon, Pezeshkian told foreign diplomats. Iranian diplomats have long pointed to Khamenei’s preachings as a binding fatwa, or religious edict, that Iran won't build an atomic bomb. Iran has long insisted its nuclear program is for peaceful purposes. However, it now enriches uranium to 60% purity — a short, technical step from weapons-grade levels of 90%. Iranian officials increasingly suggest Tehran could pursue an atomic bomb. U.S. intelligence agencies assess that Iran has yet to begin a weapons program but has 'undertaken activities that better position it to produce a nuclear device, if it chooses to do so.' Gaza and oil sanctions Earlier in the week, Trump also said that displaced Palestinians in Gaza could be permanently resettled outside the war-torn territory and proposed the U.S. take 'ownership' in redeveloping the area into 'the Riviera of the Middle East.' Khamenei appeared to reference Trump's Gaza proposal in his remarks. 'The Americans sit, redrawing the map of the world — but only on paper, as it has no basis in reality,' Khamenei said. 'They make statements about us, express opinions and issue threats. If they threaten us, we will threaten them in return. If they act on their threats, we will act on ours. If they violate the security of our nation, we will, without a doubt, respond in kind.' Meanwhile, Iran's Foreign Ministry separately criticized the U.S. Treasury's move to levy sanctions Thursday against firms trading sanctioned Iranian crude oil to China. The Treasury described the firms as forming an 'international network for facilitating the shipment of millions of barrels of Iranian crude oil worth hundreds of millions of dollars.' Foreign Ministry spokesperson Esmail Baghaei called the Treasury's decision 'completely unjustified and contrary to international rules and regulations.'	https://www.voanews.com/a/iran-s-supreme-leader-criticizes-proposed-nuclear-talks-with-us/7966585.html	2025-02-07T06:21:05-08:00

Historical precedent, legal questions swirl around Trump plan to detain migrants at Guantanamo	The Trump administration's expansion of migrant detention facilities, notably its use of the U.S. naval station at Guantanamo Bay, Cuba, has reignited debate among human rights advocates and legal experts. President Donald Trump campaigned on a promise to curb legal migration and deport those in the U.S. without legal status. Late last month, he instructed his administration to prepare the facility for the detention of up to 30,000 'high-priority' unauthorized immigrants with criminal records. The first group arrived on Tuesday. Described as the 'the worst of the worst' by administration officials, the detainees were identified by the Department of Homeland Security as part of the transnational criminal organization 'Tren de Aragua,' which the U.S. designated a foreign terrorist organization on January 20. VOA sent numerous requests to U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement regarding what crimes the migrants committed. ICE directed VOA to contact the Department of Homeland Security, which has not responded to emails. Miriam Pensack, a historian who studies Latin America and the Caribbean and is a postgraduate scholar at Princeton University, said the U.S. government has been using Guantanamo Bay to hold migrants on and off for 30 years. 'There is an ICE office in Guantanamo. ... But obviously what we’re seeing now is a huge expansion of that capacity,' she said. Trump’s decision to use the naval base as a migrant detention center follows his signing of the Laken Riley Act, which mandates detention for those accused of theft or violent crimes while in the country unlawfully. Supporters say that using Guantanamo will alleviate pressure on overcrowded detention facilities and serve as a stronger deterrent against illegal crossings to the United States. Earlier this week, U.S. Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth described Guantanamo as the 'perfect place' to detain migrants as he visited the border with Mexico. The Pentagon will provide any necessary assets 'to support the expulsion and detention of those in our country illegally,' he told Agence France-Presse. Guantanamo and migrant detention The U.S. first used Guantanamo Bay to detain migrants, mostly Haitian and Cuban asylum-seekers under President George H.W. Bush in the early 1990s. Following a military coup in Haiti in 1991, thousands fled by boat to the U.S. but were intercepted at sea and taken to Guantanamo. In 1994, Guantanamo became the site of the world’s first and only prison camp for people with HIV, where more than 300 Haitian refugees, including children, were confined behind razor wire. 'These were refugees fleeing slaughter in their country, whose credible fear of persecution the U.S. officials who screened them acknowledged, who were held for no reason other than their HIV status. When these people protest detention, the response was brutal,' said Pardiss Kebriaei, senior staff attorney at the U.S.-based Center for Constitutional Rights, to reporters during a press call last Thursday. Legal challenges eventually forced the U.S. government to release the detainees, setting a precedent that indefinite offshore detention without due process is legally dubious. In 2002, the George W. Bush administration built a detention camp in Guantanamo Bay to hold terror suspects following the U.S. invasion of Afghanistan shortly after the 9/11 attacks of 2001. But Guantanamo’s use for migrant detention continued with at least two presidents, Bill Clinton and Joe Biden, using the base. The Biden administration sought to close Guantanamo, but Congress never passed the legislation, leaving the base operational for future use. 'The idea of closing Guantanamo as a prison is one thing; closing Guantanamo as a 45-square-mile base held in Cuba is another,' Pensack said. Legal and human rights concerns Advocates warn that offshore detention facilities allow the U.S. to sidestep domestic constitutional protections and limit oversight. Eunice Cho, attorney at the ACLU National Prison Project, told reporters during the press call last Thursday that 'detaining immigrants on military bases in the United States and Guantanamo would subject people to dangerous conditions ... and attempt to avoid scrutiny by lawyers, the press, and congressional oversight.' Historically, legal challenges have helped curb indefinite detentions at Guantanamo. The Supreme Court ruling in Rasul v. Bush (2004) established that Guantanamo detainees have the right to challenge their detention in U.S. courts. However, the Trump administration could attempt to argue that civil immigration detainees fall outside this precedent. While prior administrations may have seen Guantanamo as a law-free zone, 'That is not the case today,' said Kebriaei of the Center for Constitutional Rights, adding that migrants at Guantanamo now 'have due process rights under the Constitution.' '[Meanwhile], people would be detained. … and [litigation] would go on and people would suffer during that time,' she said. In the meantime, the Trump' administration border czar Tom Homan told reporters outside the White House on Thursday that 'President Trump made a commitment that the worst of the worst will go to Gitmo.' Broader immigration, policy implications The Guantanamo facility has historically been used in moments of crisis, from Cuban and Haitian exoduses to post-9/11 military detention. The Trump administration’s decision to include Guantanamo in its mass detention strategy signals a shift toward increasingly punitive measures, according to some analysts. Stacy Suh, program director at Detention Watch Network, emphasized the link between detention expansion and deportations. 'Detention plays a crucial role in deportation. … More detention means more people would be deported,' she said. The Department of Homeland Security has yet to clarify whether the latest White House policy includes detention of migrants without criminal records or whether they would have access to asylum proceedings or be expelled outright. Homan said the U.S. has had a migrant processing at 'Gitmo for decades. So, we’re increasing our footprint there.' Legal response The administration's decision has sparked backlash from advocacy groups, legal experts, and members of Congress, many of whom are calling for oversight hearings and possibly legal action. Cho of the ACLU urged vigilance, saying there is a need for 'a robust response from both the press, from government oversight agencies, Congress, advocacy organizations, and the community.' With Guantanamo’s history of controversial and legally ambiguous detentions, experts predict judicial and political battles over its use for immigration enforcement.	https://www.voanews.com/a/historical-precedent-legal-questions-swirl-around-trump-plan-to-detain-migrants-at-guantanamo-/7966534.html	2025-02-07T05:47:04-08:00	
Israel orders army to plan to let Palestinians leave Gaza	Israel’s defense minister has ordered the Israel Defense Forces to devise a plan for Palestinians to leave the Gaza Strip, following U.S. President Donald Trump’s proposal for how the devastated territory would be administered. 'I have instructed the IDF to prepare a plan to enable voluntary departure for Gaza residents,' Defense Minister Israel Katz said Thursday, adding they could go 'to any country willing to accept them.' Katz said the plan 'will include options for exit and land crossings as well as special arrangement for exit by sea and air.' Katz welcomed what he characterized as Trump's 'bold plan' for Gaza residents to leave the territory, which has been devastated by Israeli ground and air attacks targeting Hamas militants. Trump on Thursday said Israel should turn the Gaza Strip over to the United States after the war with Hamas ends and that no U.S. soldiers would be needed there. Trump, who has called for U.S. ownership of the narrow territory along the Mediterranean Sea, issued the statement on Truth Social. Under his plan, he said, more than 2 million Palestinians 'would have already been resettled in far safer and more beautiful communities, with new and modern homes, in the region.' Trump did not say whether he meant in Gaza or in other countries that as of yet have not agreed to accept them. 'They would actually have a chance to be happy, safe, and free,' he wrote. Meanwhile, Hamas on Thursday called on all Palestinian factions to unite against Trump's proposed Gaza takeover. Trump earlier this week said he could envision sending U.S. troops to Gaza to ease the American takeover but said in his new posting that with the Israeli handover of the land, 'No soldiers by the U.S. would be needed! Stability for the region would reign!!!' Trump's surprise Gaza takeover plan, announced earlier this week alongside Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu at a White House news conference, has been widely assailed by U.S. allies and adversaries alike, many of which remain committed to creation of an independent Palestinian state alongside Israel. The two-state solution had been a long-held U.S. stance but one that Netanyahu opposes. Gaza has been decimated by the more than 15 months of fighting between Israel and Hamas. But in his new comments, Trump said, 'The U.S., working with great development teams from all over the World, would slowly and carefully begin the construction of what would become one of the greatest and most spectacular developments of its kind on Earth.' On Tuesday, Trump said a newly redeveloped Gaza would become the 'Riviera of the Middle East.' U.S. Secretary of State Marco Rubio doubled down on Trump's plan on Thursday, saying that Gaza is 'not habitable' due to unexploded weapons and other dangers, and that people would have to live elsewhere while the region is rebuilt. Guterres: Don't make problem worse Trump's proposal has met widespread criticism, including from U.N. Secretary-General Antonio Guterres. 'In the search for solutions, we must not make the problem worse' by moving Palestinians out of Gaza, Guterres said. 'It is vital to stay true to the bedrock of international law. It is essential to avoid any form of ethnic cleansing.' Forcibly transferring populations is strictly prohibited under international law and can constitute ethnic cleansing. German President Frank-Walter Steinmeier said Wednesday that Trump's proposals 'generate deep concern in some people, even horror' and would be 'unacceptable under international law.' The 22-member Arab League said Trump's plan 'represents a recipe for instability' and would not advance the prospects of Palestinian statehood. 'They must be allowed home,' British Prime Minister Keir Starmer said Wednesday. 'They must be allowed to rebuild, and we should be with them in that rebuild, on the way to a two-state solution.' Following Trump's Gaza ownership suggestion, Australia, China, Germany, Ireland, Russia, Saudi Arabia and Spain all said that they continue to support a two-state solution. Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas called for the United Nations to 'protect the Palestinian people and their inalienable rights,' saying that what Trump wanted to do would be 'a serious violation of international law.' Hamas said Trump's Gaza proposal was a 'recipe for creating chaos and tension in the region. Instead of holding the Zionist occupation accountable for the crime of genocide and displacement, it is being rewarded, not punished.' Fighting in Gaza has halted, other than occasional outbursts, amid a planned six-week ceasefire between Israel and Hamas, a U.S.-designated terror group. Hamas sparked the war with the shock October 2023 attack on Israel, during which the militants killed 1,200 people and took 250 hostages. Israel's counteroffensive has killed more than 47,500 people, more than half women and children, according to the health ministry in Gaza. The Israeli military says it has killed 17,000 Hamas militants. Hamas is believed to be holding about 60 living captives. During the first phase of the ceasefire, the militants released 18 hostages, while Israel has freed hundreds of Palestinian prisoners. More people are due to be set free in the coming weeks, and negotiators are working on the details of a planned second phase of the ceasefire that would bring an end to the conflict, free the remaining hostages and see Israeli troops withdraw from Gaza. Some information for this report came from The Associated Press, Agence France-Presse and Reuters.	https://www.voanews.com/a/israel-orders-army-to-plan-to-let-palestinians-leave-gaza/7966390.html	2025-02-07T03:06:18-08:00	
Trump administration plans to slash all but a fraction of USAID jobs, officials say	WASHINGTON — The Trump administration presented a plan Thursday to dramatically cut staffing worldwide for U.S. aid projects as part of its dismantling of the U.S. Agency for International Development, leaving fewer than 300 workers out of thousands. Late Thursday, federal workers associations filed suit asking a federal court to stop the shutdown, arguing that President Donald Trump lacks the authority to shut down an agency enshrined in congressional legislation. Two current USAID employees and one former senior USAID official told The Associated Press of the administration's plan, presented to remaining senior officials of the agency Thursday. They spoke on condition of anonymity due to a Trump administration order barring USAID staffers from talking to anyone outside their agency. The plan would leave fewer than 300 staffers on the job out of what are currently 8,000 direct hires and contractors. They, along with an unknown number of 5,000 locally hired international staffers abroad, would run the few life-saving programs that the administration says it intends to keep going for the time being. It was not immediately clear whether the reduction to 300 would be permanent or temporary, potentially allowing more workers to return after what the Trump administration says is a review of which aid and development programs it wants to resume. The administration earlier this week gave almost all USAID staffers posted overseas 30 days, starting Friday, to return to the U.S., with the government paying for their travel and moving costs. Workers who choose to stay longer, unless they received a specific hardship waiver, might have to cover their own expenses, a notice on the USAID website said late Thursday. Speaking to reporters Monday in El Salvador, Secretary of State Marco Rubio described the agency as historically 'unresponsive' to Congress and the White House, even though the agency, he claimed, is supposed to take its direction from the State Department. 'USAID has a history of sort of ignoring that and deciding that there's somehow a global charity separate from the national interest,' Rubio said. 'These are taxpayer dollars, and we owe the American people assurances that every dollar we are spending abroad is being spent on something that furthers our national interest.' Speaking in the Dominican Republic on Thursday, Rubio said the U.S. government will continue providing foreign aid. 'But it is going to be foreign aid that makes sense and is aligned with our national interest,' he told reporters. The Trump administration and billionaire ally Elon Musk, who is running a budget-cutting Department of Government Efficiency, have targeted USAID hardest so far in an unprecedented challenge of the federal government and many of its programs. Since Trump’s Jan. 20 inauguration, a sweeping funding freeze has shut down most of the agency’s programs worldwide, and almost all of its workers have been placed on administrative leave or furloughed. Musk and Trump have spoken of eliminating USAID as an independent agency and moving surviving programs under the State Department. Democratic lawmakers and others call the move illegal without congressional approval. The same argument was made by the American Foreign Service Association and the American Federation of Government Employees in their lawsuit, which asks the federal court in Washington to compel the reopening of USAID’s buildings, return its staffers to work and restore funding. Government officials 'failed to acknowledge the catastrophic consequences of their actions, both as they pertain to American workers, the lives of millions around the world, and to U.S. national interests,' the suit says.	https://www.voanews.com/a/trump-administration-plans-to-slash-all-but-a-fraction-of-usaid-jobs-officials-say/7966325.html	2025-02-07T01:33:49-08:00	
VOA Mandarin: China’s DeepSeek banned by several countries out of censorship fear	Several governments, including the U.S., Taiwan and Australia, have banned the use of China’s AI software DeepSeek on official devices. Analysts say these restrictions are justified, as tests show DeepSeek not only collects excessive user data but also filters sensitive topics and promotes Chinese government narratives more aggressively than Baidu and WeChat. This raises concern that it could become a powerful tool for controlling speech and public opinion.

Trump to create religious office in White House, target 'anti-Christian bias'	U.S. President Donald Trump said on Thursday he would create a White House faith office and direct Attorney General Pam Bondi to lead a task force on eradicating what he called anti-Christian bias within the federal government. Trump delivered remarks at the National Prayer Breakfast at the U.S. Capitol and used his speech to call for unity, telling lawmakers his relationship with religion has changed since a pair of failed assassination attempts last year. At a second prayer breakfast in Washington, Trump struck a more partisan tone, took a victory lap for getting 'rid of woke over the last two weeks' and announced steps to protect Christians from what he said was religious discrimination. 'The mission of this task force will be to immediately halt all forms of anti-Christian targeting and discrimination within the federal government, including at the DOJ, which was absolutely terrible, the IRS, the FBI and other agencies,' Trump said. He vowed his attorney general would work to 'fully prosecute anti-Christian violence and vandalism in our society and to move heaven and earth to defend the rights of Christians and religious believers nationwide.' The president did not cite specific examples of anti-Christian bias during his remarks but has previously claimed that the Biden administration used the federal government to target Christians specifically. Trump signed an executive order on Thursday to establish the task force and its responsibilities, which include recommending steps to terminate 'violative policies, practices, or conduct.' Biden's administration announced a strategy in December for countering anti-Muslim and anti-Arab bigotry, and a similar plan to fight antisemitism in September 2023. The actions announced on Thursday could pose constitutional questions about the separation of church and state, with the U.S. Constitution's First Amendment limiting government endorsement of religion. In the last three election cycles, white evangelical Christian voters, who make up a critical piece of the Republican base, have supported Trump. He has embraced the conservative Christian world view and policies that speak to the bloc's anxiety about changing gender norms and family patterns. The president on Thursday also announced he will create a White House Faith Office, led by the Rev. Paula White, who has served as a religious adviser to him for many years. Trump established a similar office at the White House during his first term and regularly consulted with a tight group of evangelical advisers. Trump also said he would create a new commission on religious liberty, and he criticized the Biden administration for the 'persecution' of believers for prosecuting anti-abortion advocates. In 2023, the National Prayer Breakfast split into two events, the one on Capitol Hill attended by lawmakers and a separate private event for thousands at a hotel ballroom after some lawmakers sought to distance themselves from the private religious group following questions over how it was run and funded.	https://www.voanews.com/a/trump-to-create-religious-office-in-white-house-target-anti-christian-bias-/7966209.html	2025-02-06T22:21:21-08:00	
Trump imposes sanctions on International Criminal Court	WASHINGTON — U.S. President Donald Trump on Thursday authorized economic and travel sanctions targeting people who work on International Criminal Court investigations of U.S. citizens or U.S. allies such as Israel, repeating action he took during his first term. The move coincides with a visit to Washington by Israel's Prime Minister Benajmin Netanyahu, who -- along with his former defense minister and a leader of Palestinian militant group Hamas -- is wanted by the ICC over the war in the Gaza Strip. It was unclear how quickly the U.S. would announce names of people sanctioned. During the first Trump administration in 2020, Washington imposed sanctions on then-prosecutor Fatou Bensouda and one of her top aides over the ICC's investigation into alleged war crimes by American troops in Afghanistan. The ICC did not immediately respond to a request for comment. The sanctions include freezing any U.S. assets of those designated and barring them and their families from visiting the United States. The 125-member ICC is a permanent court that can prosecute individuals for war crimes, crimes against humanity, genocide and the crime of aggression against the territory of member states or by their nationals. The United States, China, Russia and Israel are not members. Trump signed the executive order after U.S. Senate Democrats last week blocked a Republican-led effort to pass legislation setting up a sanctions regime targeting the war crimes court. The court has taken measures to shield staff from possible U.S. sanctions, paying salaries three months in advance, as it braced for financial restrictions that could cripple the war crimes tribunal, sources told Reuters last month. In December, the court's president, judge Tomoko Akane, warned that sanctions would 'rapidly undermine the Court's operations in all situations and cases, and jeopardize its very existence.' Russia has also taken aim at the court. In 2023, the ICC issued an arrest warrant for President Vladimir Putin, accusing him of the war crime of illegally deporting hundreds of children from Ukraine. Russia has banned entry to ICC chief prosecutor Karim Khan and placed him and two ICC judges on its wanted list.	https://www.voanews.com/a/trump-imposes-sanctions-on-international-criminal-court/7966207.html	2025-02-06T22:06:51-08:00	
US Senate confirms Trump budget director pick Vought	WASHINGTON — The Republican-led U.S. Senate confirmed President Donald Trump's nominee Russell Vought as budget director on Thursday, placing the reins of government funding in the hands of a hard-line conservative who has advocated for reducing Congress's power over taxpayer dollars. The Senate voted 53-47 to confirm Vought after a marathon overnight session during which Democrats denounced him as a dangerous far-right ideologue and blasted Republicans for rubber-stamping Trump's nomination. Vought, who also headed the Office of Management and Budget during Trump's first presidential term, raised concerns among members of both parties by criticizing a 1974 law preventing presidents from unilaterally blocking congressionally approved funding, a practice known as 'impoundment.' In his two confirmation hearings, Vought repeatedly said he believed a 1974 law was unconstitutional, a position that even the Republican committee chairmen said they did not fully support. Last week, the White House Budget Office issued a memo freezing hundreds of billions of dollars in federal grants and loans. The White House said the freeze was necessary to ensure aid programs were aligned with Trump's priorities including his executive orders to end diversity, equity and inclusion efforts. The White House rescinded the memo and a federal judge temporarily blocked the freeze, but not before the action raised widespread fears about the future critical government-funded services and concerns that Trump could take unilateral action against other government funding. Democrats sought to link Vought's role in the hard-right Project 2025 policy initiative to a range of administration actions, including the Trump administration's unilateral actions to essentially shutter the U.S. Agency for International Development and fire prosecutors at the Justice Department. 'Whether it's with federal workers, whether it's at USAID, whether it's hurting Justice Department prosecutors, all of that is Russell Vought at work,' Senate Democratic leader Chuck Schumer said on a floor speech. 'He's working to hurt you, Mr. and Mrs. America.' Republicans championed Vought’s experience as budget director and the role they expect him to play in cutting wasteful government spending. 'Identifying ways to rein in our spending – and to target government waste – has to be a priority. And I’m confident that Mr. Vought will help lead that charge,' Senate Majority Leader John Thune said this week. 'There is no question that he will be able to hit the ground running.'	https://www.voanews.com/a/us-senate-confirms-trump-budget-director-pick-vought/7966203.html	2025-02-06T21:54:38-08:00	
Zelenskyy marks 6-month anniversary of Ukraine’s Kursk operation	Ukraine President Volodymyr Zelenskyy paid tribute to the country’s 'warriors' in the Kursk operation in an address Thursday marking the six-month anniversary of the operation in Russia. 'With our active operation on Russian territory, we have brought the war home to Russia, and it is there that they must feel what war is. And they do,' Zelenskyy said in his daily address. He said Ukrainian soldiers have shown that, even with limited resources, Ukraine can 'act decisively, unexpectedly, and effectively.' 'We are exposing Russia’s bluff for what it is – a bluff,' he said. In its description of the operation, the Institute for the Study of War, a Washington-based research and advocacy organization, cited the ability of a small group of Ukrainian troops in Kursk oblast to complicate Russian efforts to advance in Ukraine and undermine the Russian military to launch or renew offensive operations in what it called 'low-priority areas of the front line.' 'The war in Ukraine, in other words, is not permanently stalemated. Either side can potentially restore, maneuver and begin to gain or regain significant territory. Russia will be able to do so if the West reduces or cuts off aid. Ukraine may be able to do so if Western support continues to empower Ukrainian innovation,' the Institute said in a Thursday news release. Ukrainian officials reported damage Thursday at a market in the northeastern city of Kharkiv after the latest round of overnight Russian drone attacks targeting multiple parts of the country. Kharkiv Governor Oleh Syniehubov said on Telegram that debris from a downed drone damaged power lines in the city. Ukraine’s military said its air defenses shot down 56 of the 77 total drones deployed by Russian forces. The intercepts took place over the Cherkasy, Chernihiv, Dnipropetrovsk, Kharkiv, Kyiv, Odesa, Poltava, Sumy, Vinnytsia, Zaporizhzhia and Zhytomyr regions, according to the military. Dnipropetrovsk Governor Serhiy Lysask said on Telegram that Russian drone attacks and shelling damaged more than 10 houses in his region. Russia’s Defense Ministry said Thursday it destroyed 28 Ukrainian drones overnight. About half of the drones were shot down over the Sea of Azov, the ministry said, while Russian forces destroyed the others of the Rostov, Krasnodar and Astrakhan regions. Belgorod Governor Vyacheslav Gladkov said a drone struck a car in the village of Logachyovka, killing three people.

200 Kenyan police officers arrive at UN mission in Haiti	Two hundred Kenyan police officers arrived in Haiti on Thursday to join the United Nations-backed mission to fight gangs in the crisis-plagued Caribbean country. More than 600 Kenyan officers had already been stationed in Haiti as part of a multinational force of police officers and soldiers from other countries — including Jamaica, Guatemala and El Salvador — who assist Haiti’s police in fighting the violent gangs in control of much of the capital, Port-au-Prince. 'The Haitian National Police are outnumbered and outgunned by the gangs,' William O'Neill, a U.N. expert on Haiti, told The Associated Press on Thursday. The U.N. mission plays a critical role in establishing security in Haiti, he said. The arrival of the newly deployed police officers from Kenya was cast into doubt earlier this week, when U.S. President Donald Trump announced a freeze on U.S. foreign aid that included $13.3 million slated for the U.N. mission in Haiti. The U.S. State Department, however, announced it has approved waivers for $40.7 million in foreign aid for the Haitian mission and the police. The State Department also said it recently delivered 'much-needed heavy armored equipment' to the mission and the police. Godfrey Otunge, the U.N.’s mission's force commander in Haiti, said in a statement Wednesday that the frozen funds make up under 3% of ongoing assistance to the mission. Both the state and the defense departments 'remain actively engaged' in the mission, Otunge said. 'I want to assure everyone, especially the people of Haiti, that the mission remains on track,' the force commander said. According to Otunge, the U.S. and other partner countries are continuing to contribute logistical, financial, and equipment support to the Haitian mission. 'Steady and predictable funding for the [mission] requires all states to contribute, especially those in the region,' O'Neill, the U.N. expert on Haiti, said. 'More stability in Haiti will reduce the pressure to migrate, which is in everyone's interest.' The Kenyan-led U.N. mission faces a daunting task in a country that has never fully recovered from a devastating earthquake in 2010 and is now without a president or parliament. Haiti is ruled by a transitional body that faces enormous challenges, including gangs and extreme violence and poverty. Almost 6,000 people were killed in gang violence in the country last year. U.S. Secretary of State Marco Rubio spoke with Kenyan President William Ruto Thursday and thanked him for the country’s leadership of the mission in Haiti. Last year, nearly 1 million people in Haiti fled their homes due to gang violence, a figure that French news agency Agence France-Presse reports as three times higher than the previous year. Some information for this story came from The Associated Press and Agence France Presse.	https://www.voanews.com/a/kenyan-police-officers-arrive-at-un-mission-in-haiti/7966157.html	2025-02-06T18:38:37-08:00

Confusion' in South Africa over US HIV funding	JOHANNESBURG, SOUTH AFRICA — Some South African organizations that assist people with HIV are in limbo, after the United States put a 90-day freeze on most foreign aid. The U.S. State Department later added a waiver for 'lifesaving' aid, but NGOs that have already shut their doors say the next steps aren't clear, and they are worried this could set back years of progress. South Africa has the highest number of HIV-positive people in the world — about 8 million — but has also been a huge success story in terms of treatment and preventing new infections. That's largely due to the money poured into expert HIV care here, 17% of which comes from a U.S. program called the President's Emergency Plan for AIDS Relief, also known as PEPFAR. But, a 90-day foreign aid funding freeze is in effect, following an executive order by U.S. President Donald Trump last month to check if U.S.-funded programs overseas are aligned with U.S. policies. This has caused some confusion in South Africa with health care organizations and their patients. Thamsanqa Siyo, an HIV-positive transgender woman in South Africa, is anxious. 'People are frustrated, they're living in fear, they don't know what's going to happen,' said Siyo. 'They don't know if it's stopped temporarily or not temporarily.' The Cape Town clinic that Siyo used to go to has now been closed for two weeks. While the State Department has issued a waiver to continue paying for 'lifesaving' services, what that includes remains unclear to many South African organizations that receive funding from PEPFAR. U.S. Secretary of State Marco Rubio said this week that the waiver was clear. 'If it saves lives, if it's emergency lifesaving aid — food, medicine, whatever — they have a waiver,' said Rubio. 'I don't know how much clearer we can be.' The State Department also issued written clarification and guidance on February 1 regarding which activities are and are not covered by the waiver for PEPFAR programs. The South African government said it was blindsided by the U.S. aid freeze, according to Health Minister Aaron Motsoaledi, who convened a meeting about PEPFAR on Wednesday. Motsoaledi also said he has sought clarity on the waiver. 'If you say American money cannot be used for LGBTQWI+ and we do the counseling and testing and somebody who falls within that category, transgender, tests positive, can they not be helped?' he asked. 'Even if it's lifesaving?' Linda-Gail Bekker is a doctor and scientist who heads the Desmond Tutu HIV Center in South Africa. 'This is not one homogenous picture,' said Bekker. 'In some places, it's parts of services that have been stopped. In other places, the whole clinic, if it was supplied by PEPFAR, has been closed down.' She also said that some transgender health services have been completely closed, and in other areas, counselors haven't been able to come in. In addition, she said some services and drugs are no longer available, such as community-based testing and pre-exposure prophylaxis, a medicine that prevents people at high risk from contracting HIV. Ling Sheperd, who works for Triangle Project, an nongovernmental organization that provides services for the queer community, said there's a risk of 'undoing decades of progress.' 'The impact is devastating,' said Sheperd. 'The PEPFAR funding has been a lifeline for millions and it ensures access to HIV treatment, prevention services, and of course community-based health care. And without it we are seeing interruptions in medication supply, clinics are scaling back services, and community health workers have literally been losing their livelihoods.' About 5.5 million South Africans are on anti-retroviral medication for HIV. Motsoaledi noted that most of that is funded by the government here. However, he said, a PEPFAR shortfall will affect training, facilities and service delivery. The government said it is working on contingency plans that would reduce dependence on foreign aid in the HIV sector. On Wednesday, a group of health organizations sent a letter to the South African government saying at least 900,000 patients with HIV were directly affected by the U.S. stop-work orders.	https://www.voanews.com/a/confusion-in-south-africa-over-us-hiv-funding/7966133.html	2025-02-06T17:44:15-08:00	
Gunfight kills Pakistani soldier, 12 militants near Afghan border	islamabad — Pakistan reported Thursday that one soldier and 12 insurgents were killed in intense predawn clashes in a volatile northwestern district bordering Afghanistan. A military statement said the deadly shootout in North Waziristan occurred after security forces conducted an 'intelligence-based' raid against a 'khawarij' hideout, a term officially used to describe militants affiliated with the banned Tehrik-i-Taliban Pakistan, or TTP. Insurgent attacks targeting security forces and government functionaries occur nearly daily in several districts of Khyber Pakhtunkhwa province, including the Waziristan region. The violence has killed hundreds of people in recent months, with TTP claiming responsibility for most of the attacks. Pakistan maintains that the TTP, recognized as a global terrorist group by the United Nations, conducts attacks from its sanctuaries in Afghanistan, allegedly with the backing of the Taliban authorities in that country. 'We have been emphasizing to Kabul authorities to address the question of sanctuaries on the Afghan territory,' Foreign Ministry spokesperson Shafqat Khan told a weekly news conference in Islamabad earlier Thursday. The violence caused by the TTP is a 'core problem' that is straining relations between the two countries, he said. Khan also confirmed that Islamabad had returned to Kabul on Wednesday the remains of an Afghan combatant killed in a counterterrorism operation against TTP in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa earlier this week. The slain man was identified as the son of the deputy Taliban governor of Badghis, a northwestern province of Afghanistan. Meanwhile, China joined Pakistan in renewing a call Thursday for the Taliban to uphold their counterterrorism pledges and prevent militants from using Afghan territory as a sanctuary. The statement was part of a joint declaration issued after a meeting between Chinese President Xi Jinping and his Pakistani counterpart, Asif Ali Zardari, in Beijing. 'They called on the [Taliban] government to take visible and verifiable actions to dismantle and eliminate all terrorist groups based in Afghanistan, which continue to pose a serious threat to regional and global security,' the statement said. Taliban officials did not immediately respond to the allegations. They have previously denied the presence of foreign militants on Afghan soil, asserting that no one is allowed to threaten neighboring countries from their territory.	https://www.voanews.com/a/gunfight-kills-pakistani-soldier-12-militants-near-afghan-border-/7966135.html	2025-02-06T17:25:17-08:00	
Treaty obliges US to to defend Panama Canal, says Rubio	STATE DEPARTMENT — The United States has a treaty obligation to protect the Panama Canal if it comes under attack, U.S. Secretary of State Marco Rubio said Thursday, amid confusion and what Panama has described as 'lies' regarding whether U.S. Navy ships can transit the Panama Canal for free. 'I find it absurd that we would have to pay fees to transit a zone that we are obligated to protect in a time of conflict. Those are our expectations. … They were clearly understood in those conversations,' Rubio said during a press conference in Santo Domingo, the capital of the Dominican Republic. He held talks with Panamanian President Jose Rauu Mulino in Panama City on Sunday. Rubio was referring to a treaty signed by the U.S. and Panama in 1977. The top U.S. diplomat told reporters that while he respects Panama's democratically elected government and acknowledges that it has 'a process of laws and procedures that it needs to follow,' the treaty obligation 'would have to be enforced by the armed forces the United States, particularly the U.S. Navy.' The U.S. intends to pursue an amicable resolution, Rubio said. Mulino posted on X that he planned to speak with U.S. President Donald Trump on Friday afternoon. On Wednesday, the U.S. State Department said, via a social media post on X, that U.S. government vessels can now transit the Panama Canal without incurring fees, saving the U.S. government millions of dollars annually. But the Panama Canal Authority, an autonomous agency overseen by the Panamanian government, disputed the U.S. claim, saying that it has made no adjustments to these fees. It also expressed its willingness to engage in dialogue with relevant U.S. officials. During his weekly press conference on Thursday, the Panamanian president denied his country had reached a deal allowing U.S. warships to transit the Panama Canal for free, saying he completely rejected the State Department's statement. Belt and Road Initiative Meanwhile, Mulino told reporters that the Panamanian Embassy in Beijing had provided China with the required 90-day notice of its decision to exit the Belt and Road Initiative, also known as BRI. He denied that the decision was made at Washington's request, saying that he was taking time to assess Panama's relationship with China and decide what would best serve his country's interests. 'I don't know what the incentive was for the person who signed that agreement with China,' Mulino said in Spanish, adding that he did not think the BRI had brought major benefits to his country. Panama joined China's BRI under former President Juan Carlos Varela. The agreement was signed in 2018, following Panama's decision in 2017 to establish its diplomatic relations with China and sever ties with Taiwan. Rubio has welcomed Panama's decision not to renew its participation in China's BRI. China describes the BRI, which was launched in 2013 under President Xi Jinping, as a vast infrastructure initiative designed to connect multiple continents through land and maritime routes. The United States has warned that the project is driven by China's mission to manipulate and undermine the global rules-based trading system for its own benefit. In Beijing, Chinese officials dismissed what they called the U.S.'s 'irresponsible remarks on the Panama Canal issue' and accused Washington of intentionally distorting, attacking and mischaracterizing relevant cooperation. 'China firmly opposes it and made stern demarches to the U.S. side,' said Lin Jian, a spokesperson for China's Foreign Ministry. While in Santo Domingo, Rubio met with Dominican President Luis Abinader and Foreign Minister Roberto Alvarez. The Dominican Republic is the final stop on Rubio's five-nation tour across Central America and the Caribbean, which focuses on curbing illegal immigration, combating drug trafficking and countering China's growing influence in the Western Hemisphere.

White House monitoring China’s complaint on Trump tariffs at WTO	white house — The White House on Thursday said it was monitoring a complaint by China to the World Trade Organization that accuses the United States of making 'unfounded and false allegations' about China’s role in the fentanyl trade to justify tariffs on Chinese products. The complaint was made Wednesday, a day after President Donald Trump raised tariffs on Chinese goods by 10%. The White House said the new duties on Chinese goods were aimed at halting the flow of fentanyl opioids and their precursor chemicals. China said it was imposing retaliatory tariffs on some American goods beginning February 10, including 15% duties on coal and natural gas imports and 10% on petroleum, agricultural equipment, high-emission vehicles and pickup trucks. The country also immediately implemented restrictions on the export of certain critical minerals and launched an antitrust investigation into American tech giant Google. In the WTO filing, China said the U.S. tariff measures were 'discriminatory and protectionist' and violated international trade rules. Beijing has requested a consultation with Washington. China’s request will kick-start a process within the WTO’s Appellate Body, which has the final say on dispute settlements. A White House official told VOA the administration was monitoring Beijing’s file but did not provide further details. Analysts say Beijing’s move is largely performative and unlikely to yield much relief. The Appellate Body has been largely paralyzed following the first Trump administration’s 2019 move to block appointments of appellate judges over what it viewed as judicial overreach. The Biden administration continued the policy. China recognizes the WTO is not going to put a lot of pressure on the United States because Washington is fully capable of blocking any legal process there, said Jeffrey Schott, senior fellow at the Peterson Institute for International Economics. 'So instead, I think the Chinese reaction has been moderate in indicating that they will act tit for tat against U.S. trade,' he told VOA. Schott added that there’s 'a desire to keep things cool' and moderate the damage, just as what happened during the first Trump administration when a trade deal was agreed upon after initial retaliatory trade actions. On the U.S. side, the 10% tariffs against China are much lower than the up to 60% that Trump promised during his presidential campaign, he said. Trump-Xi call Trump imposed import duties on Beijing after delaying his actions to impose 25% tariffs on Mexico and Canada following conversations Monday with their leaders. Tariff critics are hoping that a conversation between Trump and Chinese President Xi Jinping could lead to similar results. White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt said Tuesday that the call 'is being scheduled and will happen very soon.' However, Trump has dismissed the negative impact of China’s tariffs and said he was 'in no rush' to speak with Xi. 'We’ll speak to him at the appropriate time,' Trump told reporters at the White House on Tuesday. Unlike Trump’s deal with Mexico and Canada, an agreement with Beijing is unlikely to come quickly, considering strong bipartisan support for placing tariffs on China because of concern about the influx of illegal drugs and other national security concerns, said Rachel Ziemba, an adjunct senior fellow at the Center for a New American Security. 'Even if they come up with some kind of agreement to settle this particular tariff or to remove the countertariffs, there will probably be more tariffs on China later in this administration,' she told VOA. The U.S. Postal Service on Tuesday announced that it was suspending acceptance of inbound packages from China and Hong Kong, closing a loophole that Chinese garment and other consumer goods companies have used in the past. These companies, including Shein and Temu as well as Amazon vendors, bypassed existing U.S. tariffs by shipping to American customers directly from China. On Wednesday, USPS reversed its decision, saying it would work with Customs and Border Protection on a way to collect the new tariffs. The Postal Service 'will continue accepting all international inbound mail and packages from China and Hong Kong Posts,' it said. 'The USPS and Customs and Border Protection are working closely together to implement an efficient collection mechanism for the new China tariffs to ensure the least disruption to package delivery.' It is unclear how the fee will be collected in such direct transactions between Chinese sellers and American buyers. Trump’s trade actions on China, Canada and Mexico, as well as his threat to impose duties on all foreign shipments into the country, including from European allies, have caused confusion and uncertainty across global trade. Businesses usually respond to trade uncertainty by holding off on investments or passing on increased costs to customers. But the damage goes beyond small and large businesses domestically and abroad, Ziemba said. 'If one of the U.S. goals is relying less on China and Chinese supply chains for critical minerals, for energy, for other things like that, then the uncertainty about whether there’s going to be tariffs and investment restrictions on its allies fly in the face of that goal,' she said.	https://www.voanews.com/a/white-house-monitoring-china-s-complaint-on-trump-tariffs-at-wto/7965848.html	2025-02-06T15:34:15-08:00

WHO: More routes out of Gaza needed to evacuate thousands who need lifesaving treatment	UNITED NATIONS — The top official for the World Health Organization in Gaza said Thursday that more routes out of the enclave are urgently needed for the medical evacuation of thousands of Palestinians, including children, in need of lifesaving medical treatment. 'There should be more patients going through Rafah into Egypt, but we also want other medical corridors,' Dr. Rik Peeperkorn told reporters in a video call from Gaza. 'And the first medical corridor we really want to see restored is the traditional referral pathway to the West Bank and east Jerusalem. The hospitals are ready in the east Jerusalem and West Bank to receive the patients.' Peeperkorn said under the ceasefire agreement, up to 50 Palestinian patients a day and their companions can be evacuated from Gaza. So far, they have been able to evacuate no more than 39 patients daily. He said it must be scaled up because 12,000 to 14,000 patients are in need of evacuation, including at least 5,000 children. The patients suffer from trauma, heart issues and diseases, including cancer. Prior to Hamas' Oct. 7, 2023, terror attack inside Israel that triggered the war, there were 50 to 100 patients in Gaza referred each day to hospitals in east Jerusalem and the West Bank, mainly for cardiology issues and cancer treatment, Peeperkorn said. During the first months of the war between Israel and Hamas, nearly 5,000 patients were medevaced through the Rafah crossing into Egypt — and some onto other countries — for treatment. But once the Israeli military shut the Rafah crossing in early May ahead of its offensive in the southern part of Gaza Strip, the numbers dropped dramatically. From May until the ceasefire went into effect in mid-January, fewer than 500 Palestinian patients were evacuated. 'In the meantime, people, and some critical patients including children, because they couldn't be medevaced, they were dying,' Peeperkorn said. Specialized treatment in war-devastated Gaza is difficult. The WHO says only 18 of the Gaza Strip's 36 hospitals are still partially functioning. Some lie in ruins. Many lack basic supplies and adequate fuel. Critical equipment has been destroyed, Peeperkorn said, and there is only one remaining CT scanner and MRI machine left in all of Gaza. Health care needs are immense for all Palestinians in Gaza due to physical and psychological trauma, Peeperkorn said. The ceasefire is allowing WHO to scale-up its response to the general population, including plans to bring more beds into some working hospitals, he said. In the weeks since the ceasefire began, WHO has brought in 105 trucks with medical supplies to cover the health needs of 1.6 million Palestinians.	https://www.voanews.com/a/who-more-routes-out-of-gaza-needed-to-evacuate-thousands-who-need-lifesaving-treatment/7965802.html	2025-02-06T14:46:08-08:00	
Azerbaijan detains two more journalists as watchdogs denounce crackdown	Azerbaijani authorities detained two more journalists this week, bringing the number held in the past year to nearly two dozen. Police on Wednesday arrested Shamshad Agha, of the news website Argument, and Shahnaz Beylargizi of Toplum TV. A court in the capital, Baku, on Thursday ordered the journalists to be held in pretrial detention for two months and one day, and three months and 15 days respectively, according to their lawyers. The journalists are charged with smuggling — a charge used in several other cases since November 2023, as authorities detained at least 23 journalists. Many of those currently detained had worked for the independent outlets Abzas Media and Meydan TV. All the journalists being investigated since November 2023 have denied wrongdoing, and media watchdogs say they believe the cases are designed to silence media. The Committee to Protect Journalists, or CPJ, said that Agha’s arrest 'underscores a grim intent by Azerbaijani authorities to silence and further restrict the country’s small and embattled independent media community.' 'Azerbaijan’s government should immediately reverse its unprecedented media crackdown and release Agha along with all other unjustly jailed journalists,' said a statement from CPJ’s Gulnoza Said. Bashir Suleymanli, who is head of the Baku-based legal assistance group known as the Institute of Civil Rights, believes that the arrests are an attempt by authorities to stifle free speech. 'It seems that the process will continue until the complete elimination of independent journalism in the country,' he told VOA. Lawmaker Bahruz Maharramov, however, says the arrests are not a press freedom issue. 'Law enforcement agencies have taken relevant measures based on facts and irrefutable evidence, the authenticity of which is beyond doubt,' he told VOA. 'Of course, since such media organizations are formed more as instruments of influence of the West, the legal and judicial measures taken against them are observed with inadequate reactions from the West.' Based in Azerbaijan, human rights activist Samir Kazimli says that independent media and news outlets critical of the government are undergoing a difficult period. 'If this policy of repression does not stop, independent media in Azerbaijan may be completely destroyed,' he told VOA. Kazimli said that the international community, including rights groups, politicians and U.S. and European officials 'must take steps using urgent and effective mechanisms to stop the Azerbaijani authorities' attacks on civil society and independent media.' One of the journalists detained this week had recently spoken out about concerns for the future of independent media in Azerbaijan. 'The lives of all independent journalists are in danger,' Agha told VOA in January. The editor of Argument, a news website covering democracy, corruption and human rights, said he has been banned from leaving the country since July. The research organization Freedom House describes Azerbaijan as an 'authoritarian regime' and states that authorities have 'carried out an extensive crackdown on civil liberties in recent years.' Elshan Hasanov of the Political Prisoners Monitoring Center told VOA that the total number of detainees documented by the Azeri nonprofit is 331. Azerbaijani authorities reject criticism on detainees as biased. Parliamentarian Maharramov told VOA that media in the country are free and that conditions for providing everyone with information, including diversity of opinion and freedom of action in the media sector as a whole, are fully ensured. Azerbaijan is among the worst jailers of journalists in the world, according to data by the CPJ. The country ranks 164 out of 180 on the Press Freedom Index, where 1 shows the best environment for media.

US judge blocks Trump offer for government workers until at least Monday	A U.S. judge on Thursday temporarily blocked the Trump administration's proposed incentive for federal workers until at least Monday, giving an initial win to labor unions that sued to stop it. The ruling by U.S. District Judge George O'Toole in Boston pushes back a midnight deadline set by the Trump administration, which is pressing federal workers to leave their jobs in an unprecedented drive to overhaul the federal government. O'Toole could opt to delay the buyout further or block it on a more permanent basis when he next considers the legal challenge by the unions at a hearing on Monday. The proposal has upended Washington, sparking street protests and accusations by labor unions and opposition Democrats that Republican President Donald Trump is violating multiple laws. The offer promises to pay employees' salaries until October, but that may not be ironclad. Current spending laws expire on March 14 and there is no guarantee that salaries will be funded beyond that point. The Education Department told staffers who accept it that their paychecks could stop at any time, media outlets reported. Labor unions and Democrats have said the offer is not trustworthy. Some federal employees said they were heartened by Thursday's court ruling. 'It's a glimmer of hope that the courts might help us and block the whole resignation program,' said an employee at the General Services Administration, which manages federal properties. The buyout encompasses not only employees at domestic agencies like the Environmental Protection Agency that have traditionally drawn the ire of Trump's Republicans, but intelligence agencies like the CIA as well. White House spokesperson Karoline Leavitt said more than 40,000 federal employees had accepted the offer so far, roughly 2% of the federal government's 2.3 million civilian workforce. Roughly 6% of federal workers retire or resign in a typical year, according to the nonprofit Partnership for Public Service. The administration said earlier in the day that those who do not accept the buyout could lose their jobs. The White House has sought to identify workers hired within the last two years, who lack full civil-service protections and would be easier to fire. It has also ordered agency officials to identify those appointed by Trump's predecessor, former President Joe Biden, who remain in civil-service jobs, as well as those who have received poor performance ratings. Federal workers say they are operating in a climate of fear and uncertainty. Workers said they were downloading pay and benefit records that they feared could be erased from government computers as they weighed whether to take a buyout deal that might not be honored or stay on with the knowledge they could be fired. The White House says it is following through on Trump's campaign promise to cut wasteful spending and slim down a bureaucracy that many conservatives see as left-leaning and unresponsive to the president's agenda. Trump has tasked Elon Musk, the world's richest person, with leading the overhaul effort. Musk and his aides have moved rapidly, turning up at agencies throughout Washington to demand access to sensitive information, including personnel files. Their efforts have resulted in purges of staff in several departments and a significant scaling down of operations of America's main humanitarian aid agency, the U.S. Agency for International Development. Among the data Musk's team has been examining are Medicare and Medicaid payments to older Americans and lower-income enrollees.	https://www.voanews.com/a/us-judge-blocks-trump-offer-for-government-workers-until-at-least-monday/7965807.html	2025-02-06T14:30:36-08:00

Though China might aim to fill aid void left by USAID, its own challenges could limit it	WASHINGTON — The U.S. foreign aid agency broadly shut down by the Trump administration has long been criticized by Beijing. But as USAID projects wind down, will Beijing step in to try to build influence? Some analysts say although China will want to fill the vacuum, its own economic problems could limit what it will do. U.S. Secretary of State Marco Rubio, who is now the acting director of U.S. Agency for International Development, said he will bring the agency's activities in line with the agenda of the new government. 'These are taxpayer dollars, and we owe the American people assurances that every dollar we are spending abroad is being spent on something that furthers our national interest,' he told reporters while visiting El Salvador earlier this week. USAID had an annual budget of more than $40 billion and managed aid programs around the world, including a China-related program that has become a target of criticism by the White House. On a 'waste and abuse' fact sheet released on Feb. 3, the White House said USAID had given millions of dollars to EcoHealth Alliance, a U.S. organization working on protections against infectious disease. The organization has been accused of working with Wuhan Institute of Virology on coronavirus research that had caused the COVID-19 pandemic. Both EcoHealth Alliance and the Chinese government have rejected those accusations. Agency has framed funding as strategy In recent years, USAID has increasingly framed its funding for China-related programs as a strategy to contain China's global expansion through aid and investments. An archived page of USAID's now-closed website shows that the agency lauded its 'Countering Chinese Influence Fund' as one of its 'key accomplishments.' The fund 'will advance national-security goals' to 'build more resilient partners that are able to withstand pressure from the CCP and other malign actors.' Michael Schiffer, former USAID assistant administrator for Asia, told a congressional panel in 2023 that the agency had for more than a decade supported data collection on China's overseas investments through AidData, a research group at the College of William and Mary in the U.S. state of Virginia. The funding freeze has put at least one such USAID-funded project in financial trouble. Brian Eyler, a researcher at the Stimson Center in Washington, wrote in a public post on Facebook that his project, Mekong Dams Monitor, has difficulty continuing operation because of the freeze. 'We are ordered to stop work on those grants for 90 days pending further review. And that means our Southeast Asia program might not be able to keep the lights on,' he wrote. Eyler's project was launched by the State Department during the first Trump administration to study how dams built by China and other countries on the Mekong River in southeast Asia have negatively affected communities downstream. According to Eyler's post, the project received funding from both the State Department and USAID. Chinese state media had accused the project of smearing China. VOA Mandarin reached out to Stimson Center for more details but did not receive a response. On Wednesday, Rubio said the Trump administration is in the process of identifying programs that are exempted from the funding freeze. 'This [is] not about ending foreign aid. It is about structuring it in a way that furthers the national interest of the United States,' Rubio said during his multiday trip to Latin America. Critics of USAID USAID also has been a target of Beijing's ire. China's foreign ministry released a report last year accusing USAID programs of corruption and prioritizing the advancement of U.S. interests. The shutdown of USAID has been met with cheers and celebrations on the Chinese internet, where anti-U.S. narratives permeate. Many users praised Elon Musk, the billionaire and head of the Department of Government Efficiency, for closing the agency. Musk previously posted on X describing USAID as 'a criminal organization' and that it is time 'for it to die.' USAID critics Critics of the funding freeze and the shuttering of USAID worry that Beijing will see this as an opportunity to fill the void left by the U.S. 'China has spent trillions of dollars in numerous countries because it is interested in pulling them into its sphere of influence,' U.S. Democratic Senator Chris Coons wrote in The Washington Post. Steven Balla, an associate professor of political science and international affairs at George Washington University in Washington, D.C., told VOA Mandarin he agrees with the assessment. But he said China's plan to expand foreign aid is likely to be hindered by its lingering domestic problems. 'You think about youth unemployment; you think about the real estate bubble and so forth,' he said. 'That might make it difficult for the Xi administration to aggressively expand into new parts of the world because the U.S is pulling back.' Some activists worry that even if China tries to fill the void, certain areas where there once were U.S. aid programs will not receive the same kind of funding, if at all. A former environmental lawyer in China who now lives in the U.S. told VOA Mandarin that, compared to U.S. aid programs, China's assistance is of a more transactional nature and seeks financial returns. She wants to remain anonymous because she fears harassment from Beijing. A 2021 report released by China shows that between 2013 and 2018, China had spent $376 billion on foreign aid, 45% of which went to Africa in areas such as agriculture, medical assistance, food supply, disease control, and climate change. The former environmental lawyer said if it is entirely left for China to provide aid, areas such as women's rights and natural resource management will lose a large portion of funding, if not entirely, because China is not interested in improving local governance. 'There will certainly be a very severe impact on the African people,' she said, 'which isn't something you'll be able to see within just a day or two.'	https://www.voanews.com/a/china-may-fill-aid-void-left-by-usaid-shutdown-but-its-own-challenges-could-limit-it/7965690.html	2025-02-06T13:13:44-08:00	
US imposes new sanctions targeting Iran oil exports	The U.S. Treasury Department announced on Thursday new sanctions on Iran’s oil industry, targeting an international network that facilitates the shipment of millions of barrels of Iranian oil to China. In a release, the Treasury Department’s Office of Foreign Assets Control, or OFAC, said the sanctions target Sepehr Energy, a front company through which Iran’s Armed Forces General Staff, or AFGS, ships the oil. The sanctions include entities and individuals in China, India and the United Arab Emirates, as well as several vessels. The office said Sepehr Energy and its affiliate companies, which operate under the AFGS, use 'deceitful evasion methods,' including the falsification of maritime documents, to disguise the Iranian origin of the oil that it trades and transports to overseas buyers, including China. The OFAC said each year, the illicit sales generate the equivalent of billions of dollars, which Iran uses to fund its destabilizing regional activities and support of multiple regional terrorist groups, including Hamas, the Houthis and Hezbollah. Iran's mission to the United Nations in New York did not immediately respond to a request for comment from Reuters. In the statement, U.S. Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent said Iran also uses the funds to develop its nuclear program and the production of deadly ballistic missiles and military drones. 'The United States is committed to aggressively targeting any attempt by Iran to secure funding for these malign activities,' he said. In a separate statement, U.S. State Department spokesperson Tammy Bruce said the United States will not tolerate Iran’s destructive and destabilizing behavior. 'We will use all tools at our disposal to hold the regime accountable for its destabilizing activities and pursuit of nuclear weapons that threaten the civilized world,' she said. Earlier this week, U.S. President Donald Trump signed an executive order mandating the U.S. government impose maximum pressure on Tehran to dissuade it from pursuing its nuclear program. Iran has said its nuclear program is for peaceful purposes. Some information for this report came from The Associated Press and Reuters.	https://www.voanews.com/a/us-imposes-new-sanctions-targeting-iran-oil-exports/7965708.html	2025-02-06T13:00:44-08:00	
House lawmakers push to ban AI app DeepSeek from US government devices	WASHINGTON — A bipartisan duo in the U.S. House is proposing legislation to ban the Chinese artificial intelligence app DeepSeek from federal devices, similar to the policy already in place for the popular social media platform TikTok. Lawmakers Josh Gottheimer, a Democrat from New Jersey, and Darin LaHood, a Republican from Illinois, on Thursday introduced the 'No DeepSeek on Government Devices Act,' which would ban federal employees from using the Chinese AI app on government-owned electronics. They cited the Chinese government's ability to use the app for surveillance and misinformation as reasons to keep it away from federal networks. 'The Chinese Communist Party has made it abundantly clear that it will exploit any tool at its disposal to undermine our national security, spew harmful disinformation, and collect data on Americans,' Gottheimer said in a statement. 'We simply can't risk the CCP infiltrating the devices of our government officials and jeopardizing our national security.' The proposal comes after the Chinese software company in January published an AI model that performed at a competitive level with models developed by American firms like OpenAI, Meta, Alphabet and others. DeepSeek purported to develop the model at a fraction of the cost of its American counterparts. The announcement raised alarm bells and prompted debates among policymakers and leading Silicon Valley financiers and technologists. The churn over AI is coming at a moment of heightened competition between the U.S. and China in a range of areas, including technological innovation. The U.S. has levied tariffs on Chinese goods, restricted Chinese tech firms like Huawei from being used in government systems, and banned the export of state of the art microchips thought to be needed to develop the highest end AI models. Last year, Congress and then-President Joe Biden approved a divestment of the popular social media platform TikTok from its Chinese parent company or face a ban across the U.S.; that policy is now on hold. President Donald Trump, who originally proposed a ban of the app in his first term, signed an executive order last month extending a window for a long-term solution before the legally required ban takes effect. In 2023, Biden banned TikTok from federal-issued devices. 'The technology race with the Chinese Communist Party is not one the United States can afford to lose,' LaHood said in a statement. 'This commonsense, bipartisan piece of legislation will ban the app from federal workers' phones while closing backdoor operations the company seeks to exploit for access. It is critical that Congress safeguard Americans' data and continue to ensure American leadership in AI.' The bill would single out DeepSeek and any AI application developed by its parent company, the hedge fund High-Flyer, as subject to the ban. The legislation includes exceptions for national security and research purposes that would allow federal employers to study DeepSeek. Some lawmakers wish to go further. A bill proposed last week by Senator Josh Hawley, a Republican from Missouri, would bar the import or export of any AI technology from China writ large, citing national security concerns.	https://www.voanews.com/a/house-lawmakers-push-to-ban-ai-app-deepseek-from-us-government-devices-/7965546.html	2025-02-06T11:04:35-08:00	
US service member, 3 contractors die in plane crash in Philippines	MANILA, PHILIPPINES — One U.S. service member and three defense contractors were killed Thursday when a plane contracted by the U.S. military crashed in a rice field in the southern Philippines, U.S. Indo-Pacific Command said. The aircraft was conducting a routine mission 'providing intelligence, surveillance, and reconnaissance support at the request of our Philippine allies,' the command said in a statement. It said the cause of the crash was under investigation. The Civil Aviation Authority of the Philippines also confirmed the crash of a light plane in Maguindanao del Sur province. It did not immediately provide other details. The bodies of the four people were retrieved from the wreckage in Ampatuan town, said Ameer Jehad Tim Ambolodto, a safety officer of Maguindanao del Sur. Indo-Pacific Command said the names of the crew were being withheld pending family notifications. Windy Beaty, a provincial disaster-mitigation officer, told The Associated Press that she received reports that residents saw smoke coming from the plane and heard an explosion before the aircraft plummeted to the ground less than a kilometer from a cluster of farmhouses. Nobody was reported injured on or near the crash site, which was cordoned off by troops, Beaty said. U.S. forces have been deployed in a Philippine military camp in the country's south for decades to help provide advice and training to Filipino forces battling Muslim militants. The region is the homeland of minority Muslims in the largely Roman Catholic nation.	https://www.voanews.com/a/us-service-member-3-contractors-die-in-plane-crash-in-philippines/7965438.html	2025-02-06T10:10:21-08:00	
UN chief appeals for peace in eastern DR Congo	UNITED NATIONS — The U.N. secretary-general appealed Thursday for peace in the Democratic Republic of Congo, where a recent escalation of fighting between rebels and the national army has killed at least 2,900 people and displaced tens of thousands. 'It is time for mediation. It is time to end this crisis. It is time for peace,' Antonio Guterres told reporters. 'The stakes are too high.' A senior U.N. official in the DRC said Wednesday that nearly 3,000 people have been killed in recent fighting between the M23 movement and the national army over the eastern city of Goma, which fell to the rebels on Jan. 27. Guterres said hundreds of thousands of civilians have been forced to flee their homes, and there are credible reports of grave human rights abuses, including rape. 'The humanitarian situation in and around Goma is perilous,' he said. The M23 is looking to expand its territorial gains and is reported to be about 50 kilometers (30 miles) outside the South Kivu capital of Bukavu. Heavy fighting has been reported this week along the main route between the towns of Kinyezire and Nyabibwe. Guterres spoke a day ahead of a planned crisis summit in Tanzania of the East African Community and the Southern African Development Community. The secretary-general also said he would travel next week to the Ethiopian capital, Addis Ababa, to participate in an African Union Peace and Security Council summit to discuss the DRC. 'As the summit in Tanzania gets under way, and as I prepare to leave for Addis Ababa, my message is clear: Silence the guns. Stop the escalation,' he said. The U.N. chief was adamant that there is no military solution to the crisis and called on the signatories of the Peace, Security and Cooperation Framework for the DRC and the region to honor their commitments. The Congolese government has repeatedly accused Rwanda of supporting the M23, a claim that Rwanda denies but which U.N. observers have said is true. Kigali, in turn, alleges that Kinshasa collaborates with the Democratic Forces for the Liberation of Rwanda, or the FDLR, a Hutu armed group with ties to the perpetrators of the 1994 Rwandan genocide, an allegation the DRC rejects. The DRC government has officially designated the M23 as a terrorist organization, while the United Nations and the United States classify it as an armed rebel group.	https://www.voanews.com/a/un-chief-appeals-for-peace-in-eastern-dr-congo/7965413.html	2025-02-06T09:51:13-08:00	
Trump's US trade negotiator pick vows hard-line policies	WASHINGTON — Jamieson Greer, President Donald Trump's choice to be the top U.S. trade negotiator, promised to pursue the president's hard-line trade policies in testimony Thursday before the Senate Finance Committee. But he faced pushback from senators unsettled by Trump's unpredictable actions on trade. Trump's protectionist approach — involving the heavy use of taxes on foreign goods — will give Americans 'the opportunity to work in good-paying jobs producing goods and services they can sell in this market and abroad to earn an honest living,' Greer said in remarks prepared ahead of his confirmation hearing. As U.S. trade representative, Greer would have responsibility along with commerce secretary nominee Howard Lutnick for one of Trump's top policy priorities: waging — or at least threatening — trade war with countries around the world, America's friends and foes alike. On Saturday, Trump signed orders imposing tariffs on Canada and Mexico — America's two biggest trading partners. Then on Monday, he turned around and gave those countries a 30-day reprieve from the tariffs after their leaders made modest concessions on stopping the flow of undocumented immigrants and illegal drugs into the United States. 'Trump governs by whim, and in trade that hurts American families,' said Oregon Senator Ron Wyden, the top Democrat on the finance committee. 'His tariff bluff created huge uncertainty that is costing American businesses and putting the global economy on a month-to-month lease.' Trump believes that imposing tariffs — import taxes — on U.S. trade partners can reduce America's massive trade deficits, protect U.S. industry from competition, bring manufacturing back to the United States and pressure other countries into making concessions on a variety of issues, including reducing illegal immigration and cracking down on drug trafficking. The hostilities have already begun. On Tuesday, the United States imposed a 10% tariff on Chinese imports on top of levies imposed in Trump’s first term. Beijing promptly lashed back, announcing tariffs on U.S. coal, crude oil and other products, restricting exports of critical minerals and launching an antitrust investigation of Google. But the Chinese tariffs don't take effect until Monday, buying time for the two countries to reach some kind of truce. That is what happened earlier this week. Trump had signed an order Saturday hitting imports from America's two biggest trade partners, Canada and Mexico, with 25% tariffs. They were supposed to take effect Tuesday, too, but were called off — and delayed for 30 days — after Mexican President Claudia Sheinbaum and Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau agreed Monday to do more to stop the flow of undocumented immigrants and fentanyl across U.S. borders. Economists have warned that Trump's tariffs would disrupt trade and drive up prices for American consumers. Democrats and others have also criticized the impulsive and unpredictable way that Trump conducts trade policy and his decision to target America's neighbors and allies, not limiting his tariff onslaught to U.S. geopolitical rival China. Wyden expressed concern about Trump's campaign promises to impose an across-the-board 'universal' tariff on imports as opposed to targeting China and other countries for unfair trade practices or protecting workers in specific industries struggling with foreign competition. The universal tariffs, Wyden said, amount to a 'prescription for hitting our citizens, small businesses, really hard and also raising inflationary pressures.' Greer responded that universal tariffs 'should be studied' as a way to possibly lower America's massive trade deficits. Greer was a veteran of Trump's first-term trade battles, serving as chief of staff to then-U.S. Trade Representative Robert Lighthizer. In that position, Greer was involved in a U.S.-China trade brawl that saw the world's two biggest economies slap tariffs on hundreds of billions of dollars’ worth of each other's goods. He also played a role in Trump's contentious and successful campaign to rewrite a North American trade agreement with Mexico and Canada and to get Congress to approve the new pact. Earlier, Greer, a graduate of the University of Virginia law school, served as a lawyer in the U.S. Air Force's Advocate General's Corps, doing a tour in Iraq and serving as a prosecutor and defense counsel in criminal cases involving U.S. airmen. After Trump's first term, Greer joined the Washington law firm King & Spalding, representing clients in cases before the Commerce Department, the International Trade Commission and federal courts.	https://www.voanews.com/a/trump-us-trade-negotiator-pick-vows-hardline-policies/7965350.html	2025-02-06T09:24:20-08:00	
Iran leverages Hamas' release of hostages for propaganda purposes	An analysis shows Iran is using the release of U.S. citizen Keith Siegel and other hostages to further a misleading narrative – one that says U.S.-designated terror group Hamas has treated its captives fairly and another that Israel subjected Palestinian prisoners to systematic brutality. On Feb. 1, Hamas released three hostages from captivity in Gaza, including Siegel. Hamas abducted Siegel, who also is an Israeli citizen, from his home in Kibbutz Kfar Aza in its Oct. 7, 2023, terror attack on Israel. He spent more than 480 days in captivity. Hamas also released Yarden Bibas and Ofer Kalderon in exchange for 183 Palestinian prisoners amid a fragile ceasefire that went into effect on Jan. 19. Iranian media reports focused on a narrative that Palestinian prisoners exhibited signs of torture and abuse. By contrast, Iranian media said, Siegel and other hostages released in previous exchanges had shown appreciation to Hamas for treating them humanely. On Feb. 2, Iran’s Islamic Republic News Agency (IRNA) released an alleged statement from Siegel in which he thanked Hamas for meeting all of his medical and dietary needs. IRNA also claimed Siegel had 'criticized the Israeli regime for not doing enough to reach a deal to return the prisoners sooner and end the bloody war in Gaza.' A statement from Siegel’s family, however, published by the Times of Israel that same day, said he had been forced to sign off on the thank you letter to Hamas. 'Hamas terrorists forced Keith to write them a detailed thank you letter while holding him captive,' the statement from Siegel’s family read. 'This is just one example of many that demonstrates Hamas’s cruel and cynical behavior and highlights the urgency of bringing all remaining hostages back home.' While Iranian media focused on claims that Hamas had provided Siegel appropriate medical care, they omitted that Siegel’s ribs were broken and he was shot in the hand when militants abducted him on Oct. 7, 2023, along with the other 249 hostages. His wife, whom Hamas also took captive and freed in November 2023, recounted having to beg for food and water. Hamas also paraded Siegel on stage for propaganda purposes, before a banner reading 'Nazi Zionism Will Not Win.' Exploiting other hostages Meanwhile, an article from Iran’s state-run Press TV on Feb. 2 promoted other alleged statements made by hostages in Hamas custody to further Tehran’s propaganda goals. Press TV claimed Gaida Moses, 80, who was released on Jan. 30, 'lived in the same conditions as his captors and ate what they ate together.' Moses’ niece Efrat Machikawa told the BBC that Moses survived primarily on a piece of bread and an olive a day during his 15-plus months in captivity. 'I have no idea how he survived,' she said. 'He lost so much weight.' In December 2023, the Palestinian militant group Islamic Jihad also released a propaganda video in which Moses pleaded for Israel to make a deal to secure his release. Additionally, Press TV focused on Danielle Aloni, a former hostage who was released with her 5-year-old daughter in November 2023 after a month in Hamas’ captivity. Aloni wrote a thank you letter to Hamas’ armed wing, the al-Qassam Brigades. That letter went viral in Arabic language media. Family and Israeli media said the letter was Hamas propaganda. The Times of Israel reported in November 2023 that Aloni’s family members were still in custody when she composed the letter, suggesting she may have been coerced to write it. Hamas also filmed other former captives smiling and waving at their captors while being released during a temporary ceasefire in November 2023. Those filmed gestures, the Times argued, 'were clearly demanded by the captors and made under duress' in a bid by Hamas to 'show the world it has been and is treating the hostages humanely.' The Wall Street Journal reported that Hamas’ attempts to turn the release of hostages into a spectacle was intended to showcase their strength and humiliate their enemy. This tactic, the Journal says, also risks derailing the fragile ceasefire. Press TV also cited a statement from Chen Almog-Goldstein, who was abducted by Hamas with three of her children. Goldstein reportedly said her captors 'protect[ed] us with their bodies from [Israeli] strikes.' That sentiment was reflected in interviews she gave to Western media. At the same time, Goldstein watched Hamas gunmen shoot and kill her husband and eldest daughter on Oct. 7, 2023. Chen’s daughter, Agam, who was taken hostage alongside her, recounted their captivity in far harsher terms. Press TV cites Chen as saying her Hamas captors claimed they would die before she did, signaling their duty to protect her. Press TV further cited Hamas, which claimed the Israeli military 'deliberately and repeatedly' targeted locations where the militants were holding Israeli captives. But Agam said Hamas was intentionally putting hostages in harm’s way. 'But then, in an instant, the low buzz of conversation was drowned out by Hamas launching rockets, just meters away from us, from inside the school compound. The hall erupted in joy, and as the Gazans celebrated, I realized that Hamas had moved us there to serve as human shields,' Agam wrote for The Washington Post in August. Agam also recounted Hamas guards sexually abusing women and hating her 'for being Jewish.'	https://www.voanews.com/a/iran-leverages-hamas-release-of-hostages-for-propaganda-purposes/7965320.html	2025-02-06T08:48:42-08:00	
Swedish police describe 'inferno' at scene of mass shooting	Police in Sweden investigating the nation’s worst mass shooting said at a news briefing Thursday that the scene at an adult learning center was an 'inferno' of smoke, with injured and dead victims. The attack on Tuesday left 10 people dead, including the suspected shooter, at Campus Risbergska in the city of Orebro, about 200 kilometers west of Stockholm. The facility offers adult courses, including Swedish language classes for immigrants. Law enforcement officials say the shooter, who Swedish media have identified as 35-year-old Rickard Andersson, may have been a student at the center. Law enforcement officials have not officially identified the suspect, whose cause of death remains unclear. Orebro police Chief Lars Wiren said at the news conference Thursday that about 130 officers arrived at the scene within 10 minutes of an alarm, where they found 'dead people, injured people, screams and smoke.' As officers entered the building, they reported it was partially filled with smoke, making it difficult for them to see. They reported gunfire that they believed was directed at them but reportedly did not return fire. Police said the smoke was not caused by fire but by 'some sort of pyrotechnics.' Several officers had to seek medical treatment for smoke inhalation. Chief investigator Anna Bergkvist said Thursday that the suspect had a license for four guns, all of which have been confiscated. 'Three of those weapons were next to him when police secured him inside the building,' she said. Bergkvist said investigators have not determined a motive for the mass shooting, telling Agence France-Presse that 'multiple nationalities, different genders and different ages' were among those who were killed. Some information for this report came from The Associated Press, Reuters and Agence France-Presse.	https://www.voanews.com/a/swedish-police-describe-inferno-at-scene-of-mass-shooting/7965271.html	2025-02-06T08:27:21-08:00

Islamabad, Beijing pledge counterterrorism cooperation for security of Chinese workers in Pakistan	Islamabad — Pakistan has assured China it will ensure the safety of Chinese personnel working on infrastructure and development projects in the South Asian country while seeking greater security and economic cooperation during President Asif Ali Zardari’s visit to Beijing. Zardari is in China on a five-day visit from February 4 to 8 along with Interior Minister Mohsin Naqvi, Foreign Minister Ishaq Dar, and other senior officials. Pakistani leaders met with Chinese President Xi Jinping and Premier Li Qiang. Zardari also held delegation level talks with the chairman of the Standing Committee of the National People’s Congress of the People’s Republic of China, Zhao Leji. The Pakistani leadership 'reaffirmed that ensuring the safety and security of Chinese personnel, projects and institutions in Pakistan is the foremost responsibility of Pakistani government as China’s All-weather Strategic Cooperative partner and the host country,' according to a joint communique issued Thursday. Thousands of Chinese nationals are in Pakistan, working primarily on projects under the China-Pakistan Economic Corridor. At least 21 Chinese citizens, however, have been killed in targeted attacks since 2017. This has put pressure on bilateral ties and hurt the progress of the massive infrastructure and development project that has seen more than $25 billion in Chinese investment come to Pakistan. An October 2024 attack in Pakistan’s southern port city of Karachi killed two Chinese citizens. The incident came a few months after a March attack on a convoy killed five Chinese nationals in the Khyber Pakhtunkhwa province. While calling for increased cooperation on counterterrorism, the statement said Pakistan will bring to justice those responsible for attacking Chinese personnel. Pakistan also committed to 'further increase input into security, and take targeted and enhanced measures to effectively ensure the safety and security of Chinese personnel, projects and institutions in Pakistan, and create a safe environment for cooperation between the two countries,' according to the communique. In the latest high-level meetings, Chinese officials offered counterterrorism cooperation to Pakistan. 'The Chinese side…expressed its willingness to provide necessary support for Pakistan’s counter terrorism capacity building,' the lengthy 24-point communique read. Official statements issued by the Pakistani side earlier show security remained a central part of discussions. In his opening statement Wednesday at the start of talks with Xi, Zardari said the friendship between the two countries had 'gone through ups and downs' but would not be broken down by militant attacks that have killed Chinese citizens. 'No matter how many terrors, how many issues crop up in the world, I will stand, Pakistani people will stand, with the people of China,' the Pakistan head of state said. Both sides discussed enhancing intelligence sharing, border security, and the transfer of technology to strengthen the Pakistani police’s capability to secure Chinese interests. 'Mohsin Naqvi said that Pakistan will purchase modern technology and equipment for the police from China,' a statement from the Pakistani interior minister’s office said after a meeting with Qi Yanjun, one of China’s top security officials. Naqvi also informed Xi about efforts to beef up security of the Chinese and boost counter terrorism operations in Pakistan. Pakistan is grappling with a deadly wave of militant attacks primarily targeting Pakistani security personnel since late 2021. On Saturday, militants allegedly affiliated with the Baloch Liberation Army killed 18 soldiers in the southwestern Balochistan province, home to the China-funded Gwadar deep sea port and the country’s largest airport. In January, the country saw 74 militant attacks resulting in 91 deaths, according to the Pakistan Institute for Conflict and Security Studies. Thirty-five of those killed were security personnel while 36 militants died in the incidents. In 2024, close to 1,200 people including almost 1000 civilians and security personnel were killed in militant attacks – a 40% increase in militant attacks compared to 2023. Much of the violence is concentrated in the two provinces bordering Afghanistan. In Khyber Pakhtunkhwa, the proscribed Tehreek-e-Taliban Pakistan has a strong foothold while the banned Baloch Liberation Army is behind much of the violence in Balochistan. Pakistan accuses the Afghan Taliban of taking insufficient measures to reign in anti-Pakistan militants present on Afghan soil, a charge the de facto rulers in Kabul reject. In Thursday’s joint communique, Pakistan and China again pressed Afghan authorities to take stronger counter-terrorism action. 'They called on the Interim Afghan Government to take visible and verifiable actions to dismantle and eliminate all terrorist groups based in Afghanistan which continue to pose a serious threat to regional and global security, and to prevent the use of Afghan territory against other countries,' the statement said. Despite Pakistan’s poor security situation that Beijing has publicly complained about, the joint statement said China would encourage its businesses to invest in Pakistan. Both sides signed more than a dozen Memoranda of Understanding to enhance cooperation in agriculture, technology, and trade, etc. After his first stop in Beijing, Zardari heads to the northeastern city of Harbin to attend the opening ceremony of the 9th Asian Winter Games, taking place from Feb. 7-14.

Trump attends National Prayer Breakfast	WASHINGTON — U.S. President Donald Trump said Thursday that his relationship with religion had 'changed' after a pair of failed assassination attempts last year, as he advocated at the National Prayer Breakfast at the Capitol for Americans to 'bring God back into our lives.' Trump joined a Washington tradition of more than 70 years that brings together a bipartisan group of lawmakers for fellowship. He was also to speak at a separate prayer breakfast at a Washington hotel sponsored by a private group. 'I really believe you can't be happy without religion, without that belief,' Trump said. 'Let's bring religion back. Let's bring God back into our lives.' Trump reflected on having a bullet coming close to killing him at a rally in Butler, Pennsylvania, last year, telling lawmakers and attendees, 'It changed something in me, I feel.' He continued: 'I feel even stronger. I believed in God, but I feel, I feel much more strongly about it. Something happened.' He drew laughs when he expressed gratitude that the episode 'didn't affect my hair.' The president, who's a nondenominational Christian, called religious liberty 'part of the bedrock of American life' and called for protecting it with 'absolute devotion.' Trump and his administration have already clashed with religious leaders, including him disagreeing with the Reverend Mariann Budde's sermon the day after his inauguration, when she called for mercy for members of the LGBTQ+ community and migrants who are in the country illegally. Vice President JD Vance, who is Catholic, has sparred with top U.S. leaders of his own church over immigration issues. And many clergy members across the country are worried about the removal of churches from the sensitive-areas list, allowing federal officials to conduct immigration actions at places of worship. The Republican president made waves at the final prayer breakfast during his first term. That year the gathering came the day after the Senate acquitted him in his first impeachment trial. Trump in his remarks then threw not-so-subtle barbs at Democratic then-House Speaker Nancy Pelosi of California, who publicly said she prayed for Trump, and Senator Mitt Romney of Utah, who had cited his faith in his decision to vote to convict Trump. 'I don't like people who use their faith as justification for doing what they know is wrong.' Trump said then in his winding speech, in which he also held up two newspapers with banner headlines about his acquittal. 'Nor do I like people who say, 'I pray for you,' when they know that that's not so.' Dwight D. Eisenhower was the first president to attend the prayer breakfast, in February 1953, and every president since has spoken at the gathering. Democratic Senator Maggie Hassan of New Hampshire and Republican Senator Roger Marshall of Kansas are the honorary co-chairs of this year's prayer breakfast. In 2023, the National Prayer Breakfast split into two dueling events, the one on Capitol Hill largely attended by lawmakers and government officials and a larger private event for thousands at a hotel ballroom. The split occurred when lawmakers sought to distance themselves from the private religious group that for decades had overseen the bigger event, due to questions about its organization and how it was funded. In 2023 and 2024, President Joe Biden, a Democrat, spoke at the Capitol Hill event, and his remarks were livestreamed to the other gathering.	https://www.voanews.com/a/trump-attends-national-prayer-breakfast/7965175.html	2025-02-06T06:55:10-08:00

Japan’s Ishiba faces balancing act in first meeting with Trump	Seoul, South Korea — When Japanese Prime Minister Shigeru Ishiba meets with U.S. President Donald Trump at the White House on Friday, his goal, according to Japanese officials, will be straightforward: reaffirm the U.S.-Japan alliance and build a strong rapport with Trump. But many in Tokyo see Ishiba’s goal as even simpler: to avoid a diplomatic disaster with a newly re-elected Trump, whose 'America First' foreign policy has returned with even greater intensity than during his first term. Not even three weeks after retaking office, Trump has escalated pressure on U.S. allies and partners, often in abrupt and unpredictable ways. He has threatened tariffs on Mexico and Canada while raising the possibility of military action against cartels and suggesting Canada become the 51st state. He has floated seizing Greenland from fellow NATO member Denmark, and warned Panama that if it doesn’t curb Chinese influence, the U.S. could forcibly take back control of the Panama Canal. The developments have rattled many in Tokyo, which relies on the U.S. nuclear umbrella and has long aligned itself with the concept of a U.S.-led, rules-based international order. 'If you watch Japanese media or listen to what Japanese people say, they’re just hoping that Ishiba can get out of this meeting without being a victim of some kind of new attack from America,' said Jeffrey J. Hall, a Japanese politics specialist at Kanda University of International Studies. Emulating Abe? So far, Japan has been spared Trump’s second-term criticism. Last week, while announcing his meeting with Ishiba, Trump declared, 'I like Japan,' citing his friendship with Shinzo Abe, the country’s deceased former prime minister. Abe, who led Japan for nearly all of Trump’s first term, carefully cultivated the relationship through personal diplomacy and flattery – often playing golf with Trump and even gifting him a gold-plated golf club. Many Japanese commentators hope Ishiba can take a similar approach to maintain smooth relations with Trump. But that may be difficult. Unlike Abe, Ishiba leads an unstable minority government and faces the possibility of his party losing its Upper House majority in crucial elections later this year. Analysts also say Ishiba’s less charismatic personality may make it hard for him to form a personal bond with Trump. 'He doesn’t do the bullet points and assertive style of communication that Trump seems to appreciate,' said Philip Turner, a former senior New Zealand diplomat now based in Tokyo. 'If flattery is the solution, then Ishiba probably is not very good at it.' Better to stay quiet? The situation is so volatile that some in Japan question whether Ishiba should be meeting Trump right now at all. Instead of walking into danger, they ask, why not try to stay off Trump’s radar for as long as possible? But a quiet approach may not work either, said Mieko Nakabayashi, a former Japanese lawmaker. 'Some people say, ‘Don’t wake the sleeping baby,’ but this time Ishiba may have to do it,' said Nakabayashi, a professor at Tokyo’s Waseda University. If Trump eventually threatens Japan with tariffs, Nakabayashi said it will be better for Ishiba to have established a personal relationship with him beforehand to manage the crisis. 'You have to take a risk if you want to have a better relationship with Mr. Trump,' she added. To head off potential pressure, analysts say Ishiba may highlight Japan’s role as the largest foreign investor in the United States. He may also want to raise economic issues like Nippon Steel’s attempted takeover of U.S. Steel, which was blocked by the administration of former U.S. president Joe Biden. But some analysts predict Ishiba may scale back his ambitions, aiming simply to pave the way for a Trump visit to Japan, where officials would try to demonstrate the importance of the alliance firsthand. Hall said that approach may be successful, if only because 'Trump seems to have his plate full with a lot of other things right now and Japan is a sort of reliable partner that doesn’t stir things up.' 'But we’ll have to see. We really can’t predict America and how it will act right now,' he added. 'It’s just at a level of uncertainty that Japan has never experienced before.'	https://www.voanews.com/a/japan-s-ishiba-faces-balancing-act-in-first-meeting-with-trump/7964943.html	2025-02-06T04:21:24-08:00

Baltic nations count final hours to ending electricity ties to Russia	VILNIUS, LITHUANIA — Nearly 3 1/2 decades after leaving the Soviet Union, the Baltic countries of Estonia, Latvia and Lithuania this weekend will flip a switch to end electricity-grid connections to neighboring Russia and Belarus — and turn to their European Union allies. The severing of electricity ties to oil- and gas-rich Russia is steeped in geopolitical and symbolic significance. Work toward it sped up after Russian President Vladimir Putin ordered his troops to invade Ukraine three years ago, battering Moscow’s EU relations. 'This is physical disconnection from the last remaining element of our reliance on the Russian and Belarusian energy system,' Lithuanian President Gitanas Nausėda told The Associated Press in a recent interview. EU chief Ursula von der Leyen and other dignitaries are expected at a ceremony on Sunday as a specially-made 9-meter-tall clock in downtown Vilnius counts down the final seconds of the Baltic states’ electricity ties to Russia. Chilly ties since the fall of the Soviet Union The Baltic countries, which are all NATO members, have often had chilly ties with Russia since declaring independence from the USSR in 1990 — and relations soured further over Russia's full-scale invasion of Ukraine in 2022. Sixteen power lines that used to connect the three Baltic states with Russia and Belarus were dismantled over the years as a new grid linking them with the rest of the EU was created, including underwater cables in the Baltic Sea. On Saturday, all remaining transmission lines between them and Russia, Belarus and Russia’s Kaliningrad — a Russian exclave wedged between EU members Poland and Lithuania and the sea — will be switched off one by one. Then, for 24 hours, the Baltic Power System will operate solo in an 'island operation mode.' The next day, the power system is set to merge with the Continental European and Nordic grids through several links with Finland, Sweden and Poland. The Kaliningrad region, which has no land ties to mainland Russia, already relies on its own power generation, according to Litgrid, Lithuania’s electricity transmission system operator. Kremlin spokesperson Dmitry Peskov said that the disconnection plan was announced in advance by the Baltic countries and the Russian energy sector had taken preparatory steps to ensure smooth operation on its side. 'Those plans were announced a long time ago, and they required certain actions by our and their electric companies,' Peskov told reporters. 'We have taken all necessary measures to ensure reliable and uninterrupted operation of our unified energy system.' Risks of troublemaking? The three Baltic countries, which together share a 1,633-kilometer-long border with Russia and Belarus, officially informed Moscow and Minsk of the disconnection plan in July. Their national transmission system operators credited 1.2 billion euros, or $1.25 billion, in EU and other support, to help the countries synchronize with the Continental Europe Synchronous Area. 'Lithuania has done a lot in the last 30 years to disconnect, to become independent,' Nausėda said. Three years ago, 'we stopped buying any kind of energy resources from Russia. It was our response to the war in Ukraine.' Despite the advance notice, the Baltic nations are still on watch for a possible response from their former Soviet partners. 'The risk of cyberattacks remains substantial,' Litgrid said last week, adding that continued vigilance, collaboration, defensive steps and 'robust' cybersecurity measures were needed to effectively mitigate potential threats. Latvian Prime Minister Evika Siliņa warned Wednesday of possible provocations, but said Latvia was well-prepared and services including the armed forces and national guard were stepping up their vigilance and security measures. 'Clearly there are risks, we understand that very well. But the risks are identified and there is a contingency plan in case these risks materialize,' Siliņa said. After the disconnection plans were announced, propaganda campaigns cropped up on social media and in printed leaflets in city streets that issued fake-news warnings about blackouts, severe energy shortages and sky-high energy bills for consumers. 'We heard those rumors, but we are used to such things already,' said Jolanta Karavaitiene, a retired teacher, in central Vilnius. 'Of course, we must disconnect from them. Given the geopolitical situation, I see no reason for us to be there (in the Russian grid).' Still, some in the region were taking precautionary measures. Estonia's public broadcaster ERR has reported surging sales of generators. Home appliance chain Bauhof sold dozens more generators last month compared to January a year ago, and rival Ehituse ABC had to limit their purchases the report said. A long road toward energy independence The Baltic countries’ steps toward energy independence have been decades in the making. In 2003, prior to joining the EU, Lithuania decided to shut down the Soviet-built Ignalina nuclear power plant in response to concerns in Brussels over its safety. It was decommissioned in 2009. Lithuania built an offshore oil terminal in the Baltic Sea in 1999. Seven years later, it became the country’s sole crude oil import point after Russia’s surprise move to halt supplies of oil to Lithuania through Russia’s vast Druzhba pipeline network. Rokas Masiulis, the CEO of Litgrid, said Lithuania has 'suffered a great deal' because of Russian actions in the past, such as through halting oil supplies and jacking up prices for gas that his country once depended on. He said Lithuania today has 'much more than we need' in terms of electricity capacity, from both fossil fuels but also increasingly solar and wind. 'So we are safe,' he said. The disconnection with Russia 'is neither bad for them, (nor) bad for us,' Masiulis said. 'We were sort of interconnected and interdependent on each other. Now we will just part our ways.' The three Baltic countries have rebuilt power lines and launched a vast construction and reconstruction program to turn their networks away from Russia and toward the West, the Litgrid CEO added, calling it a technological feat. 'Actions by Russia -- by them being aggressive and pushing their neighbors -- has really helped us,' Masiulis said. 'Maybe we’ve suffered a little with oil prices, with gas prices, but we were forced to act. So we built alternative routes.' 'Now we’re in much better state than we were before,' he added. 'So maybe they wished us ill, but ultimately everything worked very well for us.'	https://www.voanews.com/a/baltic-nations-count-final-hours-to-ending-electricity-ties-to-russia/7964850.html	2025-02-06T01:48:13-08:00	
Mexico deploys the first of 10,000 troops to US border after Trump's tariff threat	CIUDAD JUÁREZ, MEXICO — A line of Mexican National Guard and Army trucks rumbled along the border separating Ciudad Juárez and El Paso, Texas, on Wednesday, among the first of 10,000 troops Mexico has sent to its northern frontier following tariff threats by President Donald Trump. Masked and armed National Guard members picked through brush running along the border barrier on the outskirts of Ciudad Juárez, pulling out makeshift ladders and ropes tucked away in the trenches, and pulling them onto trucks. Patrols were also seen on other parts of the border near Tijuana. It comes after a turbulent week along the border after Trump announced he would delay imposing crippling tariffs on Mexico for at least a month. In exchange, Mexican President Claudia Sheinbaum promised she would send the country’s National Guard to reinforce the border and crack down on fentanyl smuggling. Trump has declared an emergency on the border despite migration levels and fentanyl overdoses significantly dipping over the past year. The U.S. said it would, in turn, do more to stop American guns from being trafficked into Mexico to fuel cartel violence, which has rippled to other parts of the country as criminal groups fight to control the lucrative migrant smuggling industry. On Tuesday, the first of those forces arrived in border cities, climbing out of government planes. Guard members in the Wednesday patrol confirmed that they were part of the new force. 'There will be permanent surveillance on the border,' José Luis Santos Iza, one of the National Guard leaders heading off the deployment in the city, told media upon the arrival of the first set of soldiers. 'This operation is primarily to prevent drug trafficking from Mexico to the United States, mainly fentanyl.' At least 1,650 troops were expected to be sent to Ciudad Juárez, according to government figures, making it one of the biggest receivers of border reinforcements in the country, second only to Tijuana, where 1,949 are slated to be sent. During U.S. Secretary of State Marco Rubio’s trip through Latin America — where migration was at the top of the agenda — the top American diplomat thanked the Mexican government for the forces, according to a statement by the Mexican government. The negotiation by Sheinbaum was viewed by observers as a bit of shrewd political maneuvering by the newly elected Mexican leader. Many had previously cast doubt that she’d be able to navigate Trump’s presidency as effectively as her predecessor and ally, former President Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador.	https://www.voanews.com/a/mexico-deploys-the-first-of-10-000-national-guard-troops-to-us-border-after-trump-s-tariff-threat/7964846.html	2025-02-06T01:30:38-08:00	
Russian drone attack damages Kharkiv market	Ukrainian officials reported damage Thursday at a market in the northeastern city of Kharkiv after the latest round of overnight Russian drone attacks targeting multiple parts of the country. Kharkiv Governor Oleh Syniehubov said on Telegram that debris from a downed drone damaged power lines in the city. Ukraine’s military said its air defenses shot down 56 of the 77 total drones deployed by Russian forces. The intercepts took place over the Cherkasy, Chernihiv, Dnipropetrovsk, Kharkiv, Kyiv, Odesa, Poltava, Sumy, Vinnytsia, Zaporizhzhia and Zhytomyr regions, according to the military. Dnipropetrovsk Governor Serhiy Lysask said on Telegram that Russian drone attacks and shelling damaged more than 10 houses in his region. Russia’s Defense Ministry said Thursday it destroyed 28 Ukrainian drones overnight. About half of the drones were shot down over the Sea of Azov, the ministry said, while Russian forces destroyed the others of the Rostov, Krasnodar and Astrakhan regions.	https://www.voanews.com/a/russian-drone-attack-damages-kharkiv-market/7964840.html	2025-02-06T01:13:56-08:00	
Israeli defense minister tells army to prepare for Palestinians to leave Gaza	Israeli Defense Minister Israel Katz said Thursday he instructed the army to prepare plans for large numbers of Palestinians to leave the Gaza Strip via land crossings as well as sea and air routes. Katz welcomed what he called U.S. President Donald Trump’s 'bold plan' for Gaza residents to leave the territory, which has been devastated by Israeli ground and air attacks targeting Hamas militants. Palestinian officials rejected Trump’s suggestion made in a Tuesday news conference alongside Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu that the United States take ownership of the Gaza Strip, force 2 million Palestinians to move to other countries and then turn the territory along the Mediterranean Sea into 'the Riviera of the Middle East.' Netanyahu told Fox News late Wednesday that Palestinians could leave Gaza while it is rebuilt and then return. 'It's a remarkable idea, and I think it should be really pursued, examined, pursued and done, because I think it will create a different future for everyone,' Netanyahu said. Trump’s proposal has met widespread criticism, including from the United Nations, with U.N. spokesperson Stephane Dujarric telling reporters Wednesday that any forced displacement 'is tantamount to ethnic cleansing.' German President Frank-Walter Steinmeier said Wednesday that Trump’s proposals 'generate deep concern in some people, even horror,' and would be 'unacceptable under international law.' The 22-member Arab League said Trump’s plan 'represents a recipe for instability' and would not advance the prospects of Palestinian statehood. The United States has long supported a negotiated two-state solution to resolve decades of Israel-Palestinian conflict. 'They must be allowed home,' British Prime Minister Keir Starmer said Wednesday. 'They must be allowed to rebuild, and we should be with them in that rebuild, on the way to a two-state solution.' Australia, China, Germany, Ireland, Russia, Saudi Arabia and Spain all said following Trump’s proposal that they continue to support a two-state solution. Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas called for the United Nations to 'protect the Palestinian people and their inalienable rights,' saying that what Trump wanted to do would be 'a serious violation of international law.' Hamas said Trump's Gaza proposal was a 'recipe for creating chaos and tension in the region. Instead of holding the Zionist occupation accountable for the crime of genocide and displacement, it is being rewarded, not punished.' Even before Trump called for U.S. ownership of Gaza, Egypt and Jordan had in recent days rejected his suggestion that Gaza’s Palestinian population be relocated to their countries. Egypt's foreign ministry issued a statement stressing the need for rebuilding in Gaza 'without moving the Palestinians out of the Gaza Strip.' United Nations human rights chief Volker Turk said Wednesday that deporting people from Israeli-occupied Gaza was illegal. 'The right to self-determination is a fundamental principle of international law and must be protected by all states, as the International Court of Justice recently underlined afresh,' Turk said in a statement. 'Any forcible transfer in or deportation of people from occupied territory is strictly prohibited.' Later, U.N. Secretary-General Antonio Guterres said in a speech that 'in the search for solutions, we must not make the problem worse. It is vital to stay true to the bedrock of international law. It is essential to avoid any form of ethnic cleansing.' Fighting in Gaza has halted amid a six-week ceasefire between Israel and Hamas, a U.S.-designated terror group. Hamas sparked the war with an October 2023 attack on Israel during which the militants killed 1,200 people and took 250 hostages. Israel’s counteroffensive has killed more than 47,500 people, more than half women and children, according to the health ministry in Gaza. The Israeli military says it has killed 17,000 Hamas militants. Hamas is believed to be holding about 60 living captives. During the first phase of the ceasefire, the militants have released 18 hostages, while Israel has freed hundreds of Palestinian prisoners. More people are due to be set free in the coming weeks, and negotiators are working on the details of a planned second phase of the ceasefire that would bring an end to the conflict, free the remaining hostages and see Israeli troops withdraw from Gaza. Some information for this report came from The Associated Press, Agence France-Presse and Reuters.	https://www.voanews.com/a/israeli-defense-minister-tells-army-to-prepare-for-palestinians-to-leave-gaza/7964838.html	2025-02-06T01:03:45-08:00	
China, Pakistan pledge to boost cooperation on infrastructure, mining projects	HONG KONG — China and Pakistan will upgrade and reconstruct Pakistan's railway network and further develop its Gwadar port, while Chinese companies can invest in the South Asian nation's offshore oil and gas developments, the official Xinhua news agency reported on Thursday. The comments came as Pakistan's President Asif Ali Zardari visits China from Feb. 4-8, where he also will attend the opening ceremony of the Asian Winter Games. Chinese investment and financial support for Pakistan since 2013 have been a boon for the South Asian nation's struggling economy. The two countries have had close ties underpinned by long-standing wariness of their common neighbor, India, and a desire to hedge against U.S. influence across the region. Pakistan and China recognized the importance of Pakistan's 'Gwadar Port and agreed to fully unleash its potential as a key node for connectivity and trade,' Xinhua said quoting a joint statement from the two countries. Chinese-funded enterprises would be encouraged to 'carry out mining investment cooperation in Pakistan' and cooperate in terrestrial and marine geological resources. 'Pakistan welcomes Chinese companies to participate in the development of offshore oil and gas resources in Pakistan.' Longtime Pakistan ally China has thousands of nationals working on projects grouped under the China-Pakistan Economic Corridor (CPEC). The $65 billion investment is part of President Xi Jinping's Belt and Road Initiative, designed to expand Beijing's global reach by road, rail and sea.	https://www.voanews.com/a/china-pakistan-pledge-to-boost-cooperation-on-infrastructure-mining-projects/7964832.html	2025-02-06T00:39:05-08:00	
UK's Grenfell Tower to be demolished more than seven years after blaze	LONDON — London's Grenfell Tower, which was engulfed in flames more than seven years ago in a disaster that killed 72 people, will be demolished, bereaved families and survivors said on Thursday. The fire ripped through the 23-story social housing block in one of London's richest areas during the early hours of June 14, 2017. It was Britain's deadliest blaze in a residential building since World War II. Grenfell Next of Kin (GNK), which represents relatives of nearly half of those who died, said Britain's deputy prime minister, Angela Rayner, announced her decision to a room of families and survivors in a meeting on Wednesday evening. According to the group, the demolition of the tower, which remains standing but covered in protective wrap, will start after the eighth anniversary of the tragedy in June this year. Engineers advising the government said the structure of the tower would worsen over time, and that the building, or part of it that was significantly damaged, should be carefully taken down. 'Do we wish the whole tower could stand forever? Yes. Is that an option? Not from a structural point of view,' GNK said. Grenfell United said the voices of bereaved families and survivors were not heard or considered by Rayner, during what they described as a short four-week consultation. 'Ignoring the voices of bereaved on the future of our loved ones' gravesite is disgraceful and unforgivable,' it said. The department of housing, communities and local government did not immediately reply to a request for comment, but the decision was confirmed by Joe Powell, the member of parliament for Kensington, the area where the tower is located. He said on X that the decision had not been taken lightly: 'Grenfell Tower will always be in our hearts as a community.' A public inquiry into the fire, which published its final report last year, blamed the disaster on failings by the government, by the construction industry and, most of all, by the firms involved in fitting the exterior with flammable cladding. Several survivors and families have said the inquiry has delayed any criminal proceedings. A commission looking at a future memorial on the site of the disaster said in its 2023 report that if the tower came down it should be 'dismantled with care and respect.' A final design for the memorial is expected by spring 2026, and construction could begin that year. The decision on the tower's future came after some relatives of those who died raised concerns about a letter notifying them that a small quantity of human remains were still being stored by the police.	https://www.voanews.com/a/uk-s-grenfell-tower-to-be-demolished-more-than-seven-years-after-blaze/7964830.html	2025-02-06T00:30:25-08:00	
South Korea's impeached prime minister says Cabinet had concerns over martial law	SEOUL, SOUTH KOREA — South Korea's impeached prime minister told parliament on Thursday that 'everyone' in a hastily arranged meeting of ministers expressed concerns about President Yoon Suk Yeol's martial law plan before he announced it on Dec. 3. Han Duck-soo, who was briefly acting president after Yoon was impeached and suspended from power on Dec. 14, before being impeached himself, on Thursday joined acting President Choi Sang-mok, the finance minister, in facing parliamentary questioning over their role in the shock martial law decision. 'Everyone objected and expressed worry and raised the problems with this decision to the president,' Han told a special committee, referring to the meeting where Yoon told some cabinet members of his intention to declare martial law. The martial law lasted around six hours before Yoon rescinded the order in the face of opposition from parliament, but it sent shockwaves through Asia's fourth-largest economy and sparked a spiraling political crisis. Choi told the committee that the biggest challenges in the country right now include the livelihood of the people and changes in the international order. 'There's the need to stabilize government administration,' he said. Yoon appeared on Thursday at a hearing in his impeachment trial at the Constitutional Court, which will decide whether to reinstate him or remove him permanently from office. Senior military officials testified in the court about their role in deploying to parliament that night. 'My mission was to blockade the parliament building and the members' hall, and secure those buildings,' said Army Colonel Kim Hyun-tae, who personally led about 97 special forces troops on the ground. Kim said after they entered the building, his commander, Kwak Jong-geun, ordered him to get in the main chamber of the building where lawmakers had gathered to lift the martial law. '(My commander) asked if we could get in because he said there shouldn't be more than 150 people,' Kim testified, though he said he did not know the significance of that number at the time, or whether his commander meant lawmakers. Kwak, the commander of the Army Special Warfare Command, has said he was told to stop 150 lawmakers or more from gathering, the quorum needed to vote down the martial law decree. Kim said he told Kwak his troops were not able to enter the chamber. Eventually 190 lawmakers defied the cordon to vote against Yoon's decision. Kwak took the stand at the court later on Thursday and faced Yoon in the same courtroom. Kwak has been saying that Yoon directly ordered him to 'drag out' lawmakers but Yoon did not ask him to protect civilians or withdraw his troops, contradicting Yoon's claims. Yoon has flatly denied any wrongdoing and allegations about attempted arrests of politicians. He has defended the martial law announcement two months ago as his right as the head of the state. Yoon is in jail and separately faces a criminal trial on insurrection charges.	https://www.voanews.com/a/south-korea-s-impeached-prime-minister-says-cabinet-had-concerns-over-martial-law/7964811.html	2025-02-05T23:16:05-08:00	
2 years after quake disaster, Turkey's painful recovery continues	ANKARA, TURKEY — Two years after the deadliest and most destructive earthquake in modern Turkish history, hundreds of thousands of people remain displaced, with many still living in temporary housing, as rebuilding efforts lag behind initial targets. The 7.8 magnitude earthquake on Feb. 6, 2023, and its aftershocks rattled 11 Turkish provinces and parts of northern Syria, killing more than 55,000 people and injuring more than 107,000. The disaster reduced entire towns to rubble, including homes, hospitals, and historical landmarks, with Hatay, Kahramanmaras and Adiyaman hardest hit. The government has pledged to build 650,000 homes, with President Tayyip Erdogan promising in the weeks after the tremor that 319,000 would be delivered within a year. 'We are fortunate to have delivered 201,431 independent units to their rightful owners less than two years after the earthquake,' Erdogan said after a Cabinet meeting on Monday. Environment and Urbanization Minister Murat Kurum said $75 billion had been spent on rebuilding across the quake region. The critical phases of reconstruction have been completed, he said, adding that housing and business projects were progressing rapidly. Many residents, however, remain in makeshift conditions, while others have left their home provinces entirely, disrupting communities and livelihoods. Ozgur Ozel, leader of the main opposition CHP, said only 30% of the pledged reconstruction had been completed. The housing completion rate in Hatay, one of the worst-hit provinces, was only 18%, he said. 'Only three out of 10 who believed in Erdogan now have homes, while the other seven are still in containers or seeking refuge in the homes of relatives,' Ozel said on Tuesday. 'How can they look into the eyes of those they forced to live in containers for two years and say, 'We have kept all our promises, thank God'?' Lingering hardships International and local aid groups say a full recovery remains far off, with thousands of Turks still facing barriers to returning home. The Hatay Earthquake Victims' Association said in a report that more than 400,000 people remain in container-home cities, facing poor sanitation, inadequate health care, and an uncertain future. It also raised concerns about asbestos exposure from unregulated demolitions and land seizures under emergency decrees. The International Federation of Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies (IFRC) said that millions of people in Turkey and Syria were still struggling to rebuild their lives. It called the pace of reconstruction 'far too slow' for such a disaster. Delays in reconstruction hurt long-term stability and risk depopulation of the region, some aid groups say. In Hatay, in southernmost Turkey, empty streets, shuttered businesses, and demolition work still define the city, which was once a bustling mixture of cultures and religions, and a draw for tourism. Ankara says its response to the earthquake has been effective and on track. Kurum, the government minister, said 423,000 homes and workplaces will be handed over to survivors by the end of 2025, adding that Turkey had allocated $19 billion for recovery efforts.	https://www.voanews.com/a/years-after-quake-disaster-turkey-s-painful-recovery-continues/7964802.html	2025-02-05T22:35:31-08:00	
Philippine Senate can't hear impeachment until June	MANILA, Philippines — The Philippine Senate can act on the impeachment complaint against Vice President Sara Duterte only on June 2, when Congress resumes after the midterm elections, Senate President Francis Escudero told a briefing on Thursday. Escudero said the senators who will act as jurors need to swear an oath while Congress is in session before they can convene as an impeachment court. 'Legally, it cannot be done,' Escudero said. The House of Representatives on Wednesday impeached Duterte, the daughter of the country's firebrand former leader Rodrigo Duterte. The impeachment complaint stemmed from allegations Duterte misused public funds while she was vice president and education minister, amassed unexplained wealth, and threatened the lives of President Ferdinand Marcos Jr, the first lady and the lower house speaker. She has repeatedly denied wrongdoing. She became the second-most-senior elected official in the Philippines to be impeached after former President Joseph Estrada in 2000.	https://www.voanews.com/a/philippine-senate-can-t-hear-impeachment-until-june/7964800.html	2025-02-05T22:25:17-08:00	
US government vessels can sail Panama Canal without fees, US says	WASHINGTON — The U.S. Department of State said on Wednesday American government vessels can now transit the Panama Canal without charge fees. 'The government of Panama has agreed to no longer charge fees for U.S. government vessels to transit the Panama Canal,' the department said in a post on X. It said the agreement will save the U.S. government millions of dollars each year. The Panama Canal Authority did not immediately respond to a request for comment. U.S. Secretary of State Marco Rubio met with Panama's President Jose Raul Mulino on Sunday during a trip to Central America. Panama has become a focal point of the Trump administration as President Donald Trump has accused the Central American country of charging excessive rates to use its passage. 'If the principles, both moral and legal, of this magnanimous gesture of giving are not followed, then we will demand that the Panama Canal be returned to us, in full, and without question,' Trump said last month. Mulino has dismissed Trump's threat that the U.S. retake control of the canal, which it largely built. The U.S. administered territory surrounding the passage for decades. But the U.S. and Panama signed a pair of accords in 1977 that paved the way for the canal's return to full Panamanian control. The United States handed it over in 1999 after a period of joint administration.	https://www.voanews.com/a/us-government-vessels-can-sail-panama-canal-without-fees-us-says/7964750.html	2025-02-05T20:05:35-08:00

New attorney general orders review of Trump cases as she takes over the Justice Dept.	WASHINGTON — New Attorney General Pam Bondi on Wednesday issued a series of directives designed to overhaul a Justice Department that President Donald Trump says is biased against conservatives. Hours after she was sworn in at the White House, Bondi called for the creation of 'weaponization working group' that will scrutinize the work of special counsel Jack Smith, who charged Trump in two criminal cases. The group will also review 'unethical prosecutions' stemming from the Jan. 6, 2021, riot at the U.S. Capitol, among other things, according to the memo. Trump and his allies have contended that the Justice Department under the Biden administration had become weaponized against conservatives. Some of the department’s most high-profile probes concerned the Democratic president and his son, and there's been no evidence to support the idea that the prosecutions against Trump were launched for a partisan purpose. It was one of 14 directives signed by Bondi designed to roll back Biden administration policies and align the Justice Department with the priorities of a White House that seeks to exert control over federal law enforcement and purge agencies of career employees it views as disloyal. Among other directives Bondi signed were orders to lift the moratorium on the federal death penalty and end federal grants administered by the Justice Department for jurisdictions that 'unlawfully interfere with federal law enforcement.' The Justice Department will provide quarterly reports to the White House on the progress of the working group’s review, which will look for instances where agencies' actions 'appear to have been designed to achieve political objectives or other improper aims rather than pursuing justice,' according to the memo. In another memo, Bondi wrote that prosecutors could face firings if they refuse to sign onto briefs or appear in court to argue on behalf of the administration, saying it's the department lawyers' job to 'vigorously defend presidential policies and actions against legal challenges.' The flurry of activity signals a dramatic reshaping of the Justice Department under Bondi, a longtime Trump ally and former Florida attorney general who defended the president during his first impeachment trial against allegations that he abused the power of his office. Democrats who opposed Bondi's confirmation have raised concerns about whether she would be able to lead a Justice Department free of influence from the White House given her close relationship with the president, who repeatedly suggested on the campaign trail that he would seek to use the justice system to exact revenge on his perceived enemies. Bondi has said that politics will play no role in her decision-making, but she also refused at her confirmation hearing last month to rule out potential investigations into Trump's adversaries. She also has repeated Trump's claims that the prosecutions against him amounted to political persecution, telling senators that the Justice Department 'had been weaponized for years and years and years, and it's got to stop.' Despite the wide-ranging ambitions of the 'weaponization working group' memo, there's no indication that the group will have prosecutorial powers or tools such as subpoenas that could compel subjects of the inquiries to cooperate with the new unit. And though the memo purports to take aim at the 'weaponization' of the Justice Department, it excludes from review investigations into Democrats by Biden's Justice Department, including special counsel probes into the former president's handling of classified information and his son Hunter's gun and tax allegations, which resulted in felony convictions before he was pardoned by his father in December. Smith's team investigated Trump over his efforts to overturn the 2020 presidential election and his hoarding of classified documents at his Mar-a-Lago estate in Florida. Both of those cases resulted in indictments that were withdrawn after Trump's November presidential win because of long-standing Justice Department policy prohibiting the federal prosecution of a sitting president. Bondi takes over department, which has been roiled by the firings of career prosecutors and senior FBI officials, along with the highly unusual scrutiny of thousands of agents involved in the sprawling Jan. 6 investigation. FBI agents this week sued after the Justice Department demanded that the bureau turn over the names of all agents involved in the Jan. 6 probe, which agents believe may be a precursor to mass firings.	https://www.voanews.com/a/new-attorney-general-orders-review-of-trump-cases-as-she-takes-over-the-justice-dept-/7964766.html	2025-02-05T19:15:31-08:00

British foreign minister meets with Zelenskyy, announces $68.7M financial package	British Foreign Minister David Lammy met Wednesday with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy in Kyiv and announced a new $68.7 million financial package for Ukraine as its war with Russia continues. 'Our support for Ukraine remains unbreakable,' Lammy said. 'We are determined to put Ukraine in the strongest possible position, both in its fight against Russia and beyond.' Later Wednesday, Zelenskyy told reporters that an international force of troops would be needed if forces were deployed to Ukraine in the event of a ceasefire deal with Russia. It would be a 'major mistake' if U.S. troops were not included, the president said. 'This isn't just a matter of numbers. It's about sharing responsibility and ensuring security guarantees.' Ukraine and Russia exchanged captured soldiers on Wednesday. Each country returned 150 prisoners of war. Zelenskyy shared on Telegram photographs of some of the Ukrainian soldiers, saying, 'They are all from different sectors of the front, but they have one thing in common — they fought for Ukraine.' A Ukrainian drone attack sparked a fire at an oil depot in Russia's Krasnodar region, the area's governor said Wednesday. The fire, which was later put out, happened in the village of Novominskaya. Krasnodar Governor Veniamin Kondratyev said that debris from a destroyed drone caused the fire, and that there were no injuries. Russia's Defense Ministry said Wednesday it shot down two Ukrainian drones over the Kursk region and two more drones over Belgorod, both of which border Ukraine. Officials in Kursk reported damage to a building but no casualties. Ukraine's military said Wednesday it shot down 57 of the 104 drones that Russian forces launched in overnight attacks. The intercepts took place over the Cherkasy, Chernihiv, Kharkiv, Khmelnytskyi, Kirovohrad, Kyiv, Poltava, Sumy and Zhytomyr regions.

Greenlanders explore Pacific Islands’ relationship with Washington	WASHINGTON — Greenland’s representative in the United States met recently with at least one ambassador from the Pacific Islands to learn more about a political arrangement that some think could create an opportunity for the Arctic island and Washington, VOA has learned. President Donald Trump has repeatedly expressed his interest in either buying or taking control of Greenland, a resource-rich semiautonomous territory of Denmark, noting its strategic importance and position in the Arctic Ocean where Russia and China are rapidly advancing. But there has been pushback from the island’s residents, political leaders, Denmark and Europe. Greenland representatives have declined to comment to VOA on their meeting that focused on a framework that Pacific Island nations have with Washington — known as the Compacts of Free Association, or COFA. The compacts give the United States military access to three strategic Pacific Islands — the Republic of the Marshall Islands, the Federated States of Micronesia, and the Republic of Palau — in exchange for economic aid. Jackson Soram, ambassador to the United States from the Federated States of Micronesia, told VOA that the discussions took place at the end of January and focused on 'basic questions' on the 'provisions of economic assistance, and also the security and defense provisions of the compacts.' Soram said he met with representatives from Greenland and the Faroe Islands, another self-ruled Danish territory. Alexander Gray, a former National Security Council chief of staff during the first Trump administration who worked on Pacific Island issues, told VOA he encouraged the Pacific Islands’ ambassadors to conduct these meetings. '[The Greenlanders] want independence from Denmark,' Gray, who is now a managing partner of American Global Strategies, said in an emailed response. 'An independent Greenland, with a tiny population and the second-least densely populated geography on the planet, will quickly become dominated and its sovereignty undermined by Beijing and Moscow.' Russia has been reopening bases in the region even as Beijing has invested more than $90 billion in infrastructure projects in the Arctic Circle. Both the United States and Denmark have military bases in Greenland. Gray said arctic dominance by Moscow and Beijing poses 'a unique strategic threat' to the United States. He said a COFA 'would allow Greenland to maintain its sovereignty, while allowing the U.S. to ensure that sovereignty is truly protected.' Denmark’s Prime Minister Mette Frederiksen has repeatedly told Trump that Greenland is 'not for sale.' But Monday, she said Copenhagen welcomes additional U.S. military investment in the strategic island. 'So, if this is about securing our part of the world, we can find a way forward,' she said. US-Greenland defense agreement Some analysts say that neither Washington nor Nuuk needs a COFA agreement to increase the U.S. military presence in Greenland. In 2004, the United States, Greenland and Denmark signed the Igaliku Agreement to reduce the U.S. military presence in Greenland to a single air base, the Thule Air Base, which has been renamed Pitfuffik Space Base. It provides Washington with missile defense and space surveillance. The 2004 agreement provides for 'any significant changes to U.S. military operations or facilities' in Greenland to be made through consultation between Washington, Nuuk and Copenhagen. 'Washington can already achieve its objectives through working with Greenland and Denmark,' Otto Svendsen, an associate fellow at the Center for Strategic and International Studies, wrote last month on CSIS’s website. A Danish Institute for International Studies policy brief in 2022 pointed out that COFA has created economic dependence between the Marshall Islands and the United States, as U.S. donor money makes up 70% of the Marshall Islands’ total GDP. This is the opposite of what Greenland’s leaders say they want. Search for independence A 2009 law called the Act on Greenland Self-Government outlines a 'road map' —-drawn up by Nuuk and Copenhagen — for an independent Greenland, which requires a successful referendum. In his New Year’s address, Greenland Prime Minister Mute Egede said, 'The upcoming new election period must, together with the citizens, create these new steps,' opening the door for a referendum during parliamentary elections in April. A 2019 survey suggested that more than two-thirds of Greenlanders want independence at some point. Yet in a poll released in January by two newspapers in Denmark and Greenland, 85% say they do not want to be part of the United States. Fifty-five percent, however, see Trump’s interest in Greenland as an opportunity. Gray told VOA that the U.S., Denmark and Greenland should enter trilateral discussions for a compact. 'Working together, Washington, Copenhagen, and Nuuk can find common ground and move forward on a post-independence arrangement that works for all parties,' he said in an emailed response. As far back as 2010, Greenland told the United Nations it was exploring the idea of negotiating independence through a 'free association' with Denmark. Egede said he is ready to meet with Trump, but, 'We do not want to be Danes. We do not want to be Americans.' Soram said he is trying to get ambassadors from Palau and the Marshall Islands to attend additional meetings with Greenland, the Faroe Islands and Denmark.	https://www.voanews.com/a/greenlanders-explore-pacific-islands-relationship-with-washington/7964723.html	2025-02-05T17:48:29-08:00	
Congressional Democrats vow to fight changes at USAID	Congressional Democrats warned President Donald Trump this week that they would use government funding talks as leverage to fight changes at agencies such as USAID, the nation's lead provider of humanitarian aid overseas. VOA Congressional Correspondent Katherine Gypson reports.	https://www.voanews.com/a/congressional-democrats-vow-to-fight-changes-at-usaid-/7964701.html	2025-02-05T17:16:59-08:00	
US communications agency reinstates complaints, starts investigating media	WASHINGTON — The U.S. Federal Communications Commission has launched investigations over the past two weeks into three news outlets and reinstated complaints against three others. Earlier this week, CBS News complied with an FCC request to hand over the raw footage and transcript from an October interview with Democratic presidential candidate Kamala Harris. The FCC's request for the material was 'unusual,' according to Harold Furchtgott-Roth, a Republican who served as an FCC commissioner under President Bill Clinton. 'The commission doesn't usually ask for transcripts,' he said. That interview is at the center of one FCC complaint — and a $10 billion lawsuit from President Donald Trump — that says CBS doctored the interview. CBS denied any wrongdoing when Trump filed the lawsuit, but its parent company, Paramount, is now considering a settlement, according to media reports. The FCC complaint against CBS is one of four that former FCC chair Jessica Rosenworcel, a Democrat, dismissed earlier in January, saying the complaints 'seek to weaponize the licensing authority of the FCC in a way that is fundamentally at odds with the First Amendment.' Rosenworcel's successor, Trump-appointed Republican chair Brendan Carr, revived the CBS complaint, plus complaints against NBC and ABC. He did not revive a complaint against Fox News, which Rosenworcel had also dismissed. In an interview with CNN, Carr defended the inquiry into CBS. 'I don't see how the FCC can reasonably adjudicate this claim of news distortion without seeing what was actually said,' Carr said. On Wednesday afternoon, CBS published the unedited transcripts on its website, showing that the shows '60 Minutes' and 'Face the Nation' used slightly different parts of the same answer from Harris, which is common practice in journalism. FCC Commissioner Anna Gomez, a Democrat, has said the move against CBS was 'designed to instill fear in broadcast stations.' On Wednesday, she called on the FCC to 'dismiss this fishing expedition to avoid further politicizing our enforcement actions' because the transcript and footage showed 'no evidence' that CBS and its affiliates had violated FCC rules. The 'news distortion' complaint against ABC claims fact-checking by the moderators in the preelection Harris-Trump TV debate favored Harris. The complaint against NBC claims Harris' appearance on the comedy show 'Saturday Night Live' shortly before the election violated 'equal time' rules that govern political programming. Soon after, NBC provided Trump with equal time by giving him a chance to directly address voters following a NASCAR race. ABC, CBS and NBC did not reply to VOA's email requesting comment. The Center for American Rights, which filed the three complaints, told VOA it applauded Carr's decision to reopen them. 'Broadcasters are required to serve the public interest in exchange for their access to the public airwaves,' Daniel Suhr, the group's president, said in an emailed statement. 'Free speech does not include blatantly distorting the news or violating long-standing commission rules,' Suhr added. 'We are encouraged to see Chairman Carr addressing these serious issues.' But Kim Zarkin, a professor of communication at Westminster University in Utah who has researched the FCC for three decades, told VOA she believes the three complaints don't have any merit because NBC eventually gave Trump equal time, and the CBS and ABC complaints pertain to content. 'It's the idea that the FCC would punish news organizations for editorial decisions,' she said. 'It challenges almost the entire history of the FCC and how the FCC looks at content.' The FCC has also launched investigations into National Public Radio (NPR), the Public Broadcasting Service (PBS), and radio station KCBS, which is based in San Francisco, California. 'It is possible that NPR and PBS member stations are broadcasting underwriting announcements that cross the line into prohibited commercial advertisements,' Carr wrote in a January 29 letter notifying the two outlets about the investigations. The FCC does not directly regulate NPR, PBS or other major networks. But the independent government agency does evaluate the actions of public broadcasting stations around the U.S. that hold FCC licenses to use public airwaves. If an FCC investigation finds wrongdoing, the agency can impose a fine or revoke a station's broadcast license. Public broadcasting stations are not allowed to run commercials, so they run corporate underwriting spots, which are similar to commercials but don't include a 'call to action' urging listeners to do things such as buy a specific product. Both NPR and PBS have rejected any wrongdoing. What stood out to Zarkin about the NPR and PBS investigations is how broad they are, she said. These kinds of investigations are typically directed at specific member stations and refer to specific incidents, she said, but that's not the case here. 'The idea that they're sweepingly investigating NPR and PBS just in general — that's not how the FCC has historically done business,' said Zarkin, who has written two books on the FCC. On Monday, Republican Representative Marjorie Taylor Greene invited the CEOs of NPR and PBS to testify at a subcommittee hearing on what she considers 'systemically biased news coverage' from the outlets. NPR and PBS receive a small amount of federal funding from the U.S.-chartered Corporation for Public Broadcasting. Their reporting should 'serve the entire public,' Greene said, 'not just a narrow slice of like-minded individuals.' In his letter to NPR and PBS, Carr said he was sharing it with lawmakers because he thought it could inform the debate about whether to cut funding to the two outlets. 'For my own part, I do not see a reason why Congress should continue sending taxpayer dollars to NPR and PBS given the changes in the media marketplace,' Carr wrote. During his campaign, Trump threatened to revoke broadcasters' licenses if elected. The recent flurry of FCC investigations and complaints has raised press freedom concerns among media experts and current and former Democratic FCC commissioners.	https://www.voanews.com/a/us-communications-agency-reinstates-complaints-starts-investigating-media/7964421.html	2025-02-05T16:50:34-08:00	
Trump signs order intended to ban transgender athletes from female sports	U.S. President Donald Trump signed an executive order on Wednesday intended to ban transgender athletes from participating in girls' and women's sports. The order, titled 'Keeping Men Out of Women's Sports,' gives federal agencies wide latitude to ensure entities that receive federal funding abide by Title IX in alignment with the Trump administration's view, which interprets 'sex' as the gender someone was assigned at birth. 'With this executive order, the war on women's sports is over,' Trump said at a signing ceremony in the East Room that included lawmakers and female athletes who have come out in support of a ban, including former collegiate swimmer Riley Gaines. White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt said the order 'upholds the promise of Title IX' and will require 'immediate action, including enforcement actions, against schools and athletic associations' that deny women single-sex sports and single-sex locker rooms. Advocates condemn move The order was condemned by trans-rights advocates, including the National Women's Law Center and GLAAD. 'Contrary to what the president wants you to believe, trans students do not pose threats to sports, schools or this country, and they deserve the same opportunities as their peers to learn, play and grow up in safe environments,' said Fatima Goss Graves, president and CEO of the National Women's Law Center. The timing of the order coincided with National Girls and Women in Sports Day and is the latest in a string of executive actions from the Republican president aimed at transgender people. The order offers some clarity. For example, it authorizes the Education Department to penalize schools that allow transgender athletes to compete, citing noncompliance with Title IX, which prohibits sexual discrimination in schools. Any school found in violation could potentially be ineligible for federal funding. Enforcing Trump's orders will be a priority of the department. In a call this week, the acting director of the Office for Civil Rights told staff they would need to align their investigations with Trump's priorities, according to people who were on the call who spoke on the condition of anonymity to AP for fear of reprisals. Since Trump took office, the department has opened an inquiry into Denver, Colorado, public schools over an all-gender bathroom that replaced a girls' bathroom, while leaving another one exclusive to boys. Trump also issued a warning to the International Olympic Committee ahead of the 2028 Summer Olympics in Los Angeles. The president said he had empowered Secretary of State Marco Rubio to make it clear to the IOC that 'America categorically rejects transgender lunacy. We want them to change everything having to do with the Olympics and having to do with this absolutely ridiculous subject.' The IOC has deferred to the international federations for each sport. That could change, however, when a new IOC president comes on to replace the retiring Thomas Bach. Former track star Sebastian Coe, now the leader of World Athletics, is among the candidates up for election in March. Coe has been a strong proponent of limiting participation in female sports to cisgender women. Trump also said that Secretary of Homeland Security Kristi Noem will 'deny any and all visa applications made by men attempting to fraudulently enter the United States while identifying themselves as women athletes to try and get into the Games.' Organizers for the 2028 Olympics did not immediately respond to requests for comment. Other actions focus on gender The order is the latest of a series of moves by the Trump administration targeting transgender people. Previous ones have sought to have the federal government reject the idea that people can transition to a gender other than the one assigned at birth. That has implications for areas including passports and prisons. Trump also has opened the door to barring transgender service members from the military; called to end federal health insurance and other funding for gender-affirming care for transgender people younger than 19; and restrict the way lessons on gender can be taught in schools. Pushback on some of the administration's initiatives has begun in court. Transgender people have sued over several of the policies, and more lawsuits are likely to come. Civil rights lawyers handling the cases have asserted that in some instances, Trump's orders violate laws adopted by Congress and protections in the Constitution — and that they overstep the authority of the president. There could be similar questions for this order, for instance: Can the president demand that the NCAA change its policies? NCAA President Charlie Baker said its Board of Governors was reviewing the order and 'will take necessary steps to align NCAA policy in the coming days, subject to further guidance from the administration.' Baker, who said last year he was aware of fewer than 10 active NCAA athletes who identified as transgender, noted the order at least provides a uniform policy instead of a patchwork of state laws.	https://www.voanews.com/a/trump-signs-order-to-ban-transgender-athletes-from-female-sports/7964689.html	2025-02-05T16:42:00-08:00	
Second bird flu strain found in US dairy cattle, agriculture agency says	U.S. dairy cattle tested positive for a strain of bird flu that previously had not been seen in cows, the U.S. Department of Agriculture said on Wednesday, ramping up concerns about the persistent spread of the virus. The H5N1 virus has reduced milk output in cattle, pushed up egg prices by wiping out millions of hens, and infected nearly 70 people since April as it has spread across the country. Genome sequencing of milk from Nevada identified the different strain, known as the D1.1 genotype, in dairy cows for the first time, the USDA said. Previously, all 957 bird flu infections among dairy herds reported since last March had been caused by another strain, the B3.13 genotype, according to the agency. Reuters reported news of the detection of the second strain on Wednesday ahead of USDA's announcement. The second strain was the predominant genotype among wild birds this past fall and winter and has also been found in poultry, the USDA said. It was identified in dairy cattle through an agency program that began testing milk for bird flu in December. 'We're seeing the H5N1 virus itself be smarter than all of us,' said Beth Thompson, South Dakota's state veterinarian. 'It's modifying itself so it's not just staying in the poultry and the wild waterfowl. It's picking up a home in the mammals.' Wild birds likely transmitted the second strain to cattle in Nevada, said J.J. Goicoechea, Nevada's agriculture director. Farmers need to ramp up safety and security measures to protect their animals, he said. 'We obviously aren't doing everything we can and everything we should or the virus wouldn't be getting in,' he said. The Nevada Department of Agriculture said on Jan. 31 that herds in two counties had been placed under quarantine because of bird flu detections. It is important for the USDA to contain the outbreak in the state quickly, so the strain does not spread to dairy cattle elsewhere, said Gail Hansen, a veterinary and public health consultant. Last year, bird flu spread across the country as infected cattle were shipped from Texas after the virus first leapt to cows from wild birds. 'We didn't get a hold on it before,' Hansen said. 'We want to avoid that same scenario from happening in Nevada.' Dairy herds that were formerly infected may be at risk again from the second strain, experts said. 'Now it looks like we have new strains of virus that may escape some of the immunity associated with the other strains of viruses that could exacerbate the epidemics among animals and wildlife,' said Gregory Gray, a University of Texas Medical Branch professor studying cattle diseases. 'It's alarming.'	https://www.voanews.com/a/second-bird-flu-strain-found-in-us-dairy-cattle-agriculture-agency-says/7964683.html	2025-02-05T16:40:54-08:00

French PM survives no-confidence vote	France's prime minister survived a no-confidence vote by parliament on Wednesday after he invoked special constitutional powers to force through the country's 2025 budget. Only 128 lawmakers voted in favor of the no-confidence motion against Francois Bayrou, falling short of the 289 votes required to pass. Far-left lawmakers called for the measure after Bayrou invoked Article 49.3, which grants the minority government special constitutional powers to pass legislation without a parliamentary vote. The no-confidence motion appeared to have no chance of succeeding after the Socialists and the far-right National Rally lawmakers announced they would not support it. Under France's Constitution, the no-confidence motion's failure meant that the 2025 budget automatically became law. The French political scene has been challenging since President Emmanuel Macron called snap elections last year, a move that resulted in no party having a majority in parliament. Some information for this story came from Reuters and The Associated Press.	https://www.voanews.com/a/french-pm-survives-no-confidence-vote/7964400.html	2025-02-05T15:08:46-08:00

UN: Deaths near 3,000 in fighting for DRC's Goma	UNITED NATIONS — A senior U.N. official in the Democratic Republic of Congo said Wednesday that nearly 3,000 people have been killed in a fighting between M23 militants and the national army over control of a key eastern city. Vivian van de Perre, the deputy head of the United Nations mission in the DRC, told reporters in a video call from Goma that U.N. teams are 'actively helping' the M23 to collect the dead from the city’s streets. She said that, so far, 2,000 bodies have been retrieved and 900 others are in hospital morgues. 'We expect this number to go up,' she said. 'There are still many decomposing bodies in many areas. The World Health Organization is really worried about what kind of epidemic outbreaks that can contribute to.' In early January, the M23 broke a ceasefire agreement, launching a large-scale offensive in the mineral-rich east with the support of the Rwandan army. On Jan. 27, the M23 said it had captured Goma, the capital of North Kivu province and a city of more than a million people, thousands of whom have been displaced from other conflict areas. The DRC government has repeatedly accused Rwanda of supporting the M23 rebel group, a claim that Rwanda denies. Kigali, in turn, alleges that Kinshasa collaborates with the Democratic Forces for the Liberation of Rwanda, or the FDLR, an armed Hutu group with ties to the perpetrators of the 1994 Rwandan genocide, an allegation the DRC rejects. M23 holds Goma Van de Perre said Goma is 'firmly under control at the moment of M23.' The Congolese government has officially designated the M23 as a terrorist organization, while the United Nations and the United States classify it as an armed rebel group. 'All exit routes from Goma are under their control, and the airport, also under M23 control, is closed until further notice,' she told reporters. 'The escalating violence has led to immense human suffering, displacement and a growing humanitarian crisis.' She said nearly 2,000 civilians are sheltering at U.N. peacekeeping bases in Goma and that 'our bases are full, full, full.' She said they cannot handle any more people, and they are concerned that the overcrowding and unsanitary conditions could lead to disease outbreaks at the bases. Water and electricity had been cut off to the city during the intense fighting but have been partially restored. Markets are also reopening, but van de Perre said prices have skyrocketed. She said peacekeepers with the U.N. mission, known as MONUSCO, are operating under limited movements imposed by the M23. They are not patrolling the city, but they are able to resupply their bases. 'Any movement we have to announce 48 hours in advance,' she said. Asked about reports that M23 rebels have suspended some aid work and are interfering with the work of journalists, she said that there are indications of harassment, but that she did not know the extent of it. On the move The M23 is reported to be progressing toward the South Kivu capital of Bukavu. Van de Perre said heavy fighting has been reported along the main route between Kinyezire and Nyabibwe. 'In Bukavu, tensions are rising as the M23 moves closer, just 50 kilometers north of the city,' she said. MONUSCO has been in the process of drawing down its peacekeepers at the request of the Congolese government. In June, it left South Kivu province entirely. 'While the 4 February unilateral ceasefire announced by the M23 offers assurances that Bukavu will not be taken, we are gravely concerned for Kavumu airport, which is critical for ongoing civilian and humanitarian use,' she said of South Kivu’s airport.	https://www.voanews.com/a/un-deaths-near-3-000-in-fighting-for-drc--goma/7964371.html	2025-02-05T14:42:39-08:00

Rubio pledges support for Guatemala's infrastructure, issues foreign aid waivers	WASHINGTON — Secretary of State Marco Rubio announced on Wednesday the U.S. plans to support Guatemala with new infrastructure projects and to sign waivers on foreign aid to strengthen the United States' partnership with the Central American country. Speaking alongside Guatemalan President Bernardo Arevalo in a joint press conference, Rubio said he had signed 'a letter of support' pledging full State Department cooperation on a partnership between Guatemala and the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers. The initiative aims to 'begin preliminary planning for the expansion' of 'two new port facilities,' along with highway and railroad connections to position Guatemala as a regional trade hub and boost its economic opportunities. 'Today, I'll be signing waivers on foreign aid that will continue that partnership, and hope to build on it,' Rubio told reporters. Deportation flight Guatemala has reached a new migration agreement with the United States and will accept more deportation flights, Arevalo announced Wednesday after talks with Rubio. 'In this framework, we have agreed to increase by 40% the number of flights of deportees' of Guatemalan nationals and 'deportees from other nationalities' for repatriation, said the president through a translator. He clarified that the 'safe third country' was not discussed in title or content, emphasizing that the new arrangement with the U.S. ensures safe and humane conditions for repatriation. Safe third country agreement In 2019, former Guatemalan President Jimmy Morales signed an Asylum Cooperative Agreement, commonly known as the safe third country agreement, with the first Trump administration. The agreement was seen as part of Trump's strategy to curb the flow of migrants to the United States. In 2021, the Biden administration fulfilled a campaign promise and suspended the agreement, which allowed the U.S. to deny asylum seekers at the border and deport them to a designated third country, where they would be required to apply for asylum. Critics argued that the policy exposed asylum seekers to unsafe conditions.	https://www.voanews.com/a/rubio-pledges-support-for-guatemala-s-infrastructure-issues-foreign-aid-waivers/7964367.html	2025-02-05T14:19:33-08:00	
UN sounds alarm over Pakistan's new Afghan deportation plans	ISLAMABAD — The United Nations agencies focused on refugees and migration jointly voiced their concerns Wednesday over Pakistan's plans to begin a new round of mass deportations of Afghan refugees and asylum-seekers. The reaction came a week after Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif approved a multistage plan targeting nearly 3 million Afghan citizens residing in Pakistan. They include legally declared refugees, documented as well as undocumented migrants, and those who are awaiting promised relocation to the United States and other Western countries. The official plan seen by VOA mandates the immediate relocation of all Afghans from the national capital, Islamabad, and the adjacent city of Rawalpindi to designated camps before their repatriation to Afghanistan. The document emphasized without mentioning a timeline that no public announcement should be made regarding the deportations. In a joint statement Wednesday, the U.N. High Commissioner for Refugees, UNHCR, and the International Organization for Migration, IOM, said they 'are seeking clarity over the modality and timeframe of this relocation.' Both agencies urged Pakistan to consider human rights standards when implementing relocation measures. This includes ensuring due process for legal refugees and economic migrants who have been granted Afghan Citizen Cards or ACC, by Pakistan in collaboration with IOM, the statement explained. Official estimates put the ACC population at more than 800,000. 'Forced return to Afghanistan could place some people at increased risk. We urge Pakistan to continue to provide safety to Afghans at risk, irrespective of their documentation status,' said Philippa Candler, the UNHCR country representative. Mio Sato, the IOM chief of mission in Islamabad, said her organization is committed to working with the Pakistani government and UNHCR to develop a mechanism to register, manage and screen Afghan nationals in Pakistan. 'This will open the door to tailored solutions, including international protection to those in need and pathways for Afghan nationals with long-standing socioeconomic and family ties in the country,' she said. In the first phase, the deportation plan requires authorities to relocate people possessing an ACC, along with undocumented Afghan migrants, from Islamabad and Rawalpindi and send them back to Afghanistan. Pakistan has allowed more than 1.4 million legal Afghan refugees to remain in the country until June 30, 2025. The new plan requires their relocation from the two cities in the second phase without stating whether they will also be deported to Afghanistan. Sharif has also ordered authorities to deport around 40,000 Afghans from Islamabad and Rawalpindi by March 31 in the third phase of the deportation plan and subsequently arrange for their repatriation if their relocation and resettlement cases to third countries are not processed expeditiously. These individuals fled Afghanistan after the Taliban regained control of the country in 2021, primarily seeking shelter from potential retribution due to their affiliations with the U.S. and NATO forces. Last month, President Donald Trump halted the U.S. Refugee Admission Program to assess whether reinstating it serves the interests of Washington, leaving at least 15,000 Afghan allies in Pakistan approved or being assessed for relocation to the U.S. in a state of uncertainty. Since 2023, Pakistani authorities have forcibly repatriated more than 800,000 undocumented Afghans from its territory. The deportations resulted from a government crackdown on foreigners living in the country without legal permission or whose visas had expired. Islamabad has attributed a recent rise in crimes and militancy in Pakistan to Afghan nationals. UNHCR and IOM said that they recognize the challenges Islamabad faces, especially in security, and that refugees, like all, must abide by Pakistan’s laws. 'The overwhelming majority of Afghan nationals in Pakistan are law-abiding individuals whose situation needs to be seen through a humanitarian lens,' they said in their joint statement. The two U.N. agencies expressed their particular concern for Afghan nationals who may face harm upon their return, including ethnic and religious minorities, women and girls, journalists, human rights activists and members of artistic professions such as musicians. The Islamist Taliban leaders have placed sweeping restrictions on women’s access to education, employment and public life and have banned music in Afghanistan.	https://www.voanews.com/a/un-sounds-alarm-over-pakistan-s-new-afghan-deportation-plans/7964352.html	2025-02-05T14:11:50-08:00	
Scores killed in Somalia in clash between security forces, Islamic State	WASHINGTON — Nearly 70 people were killed and up to 50 others wounded during 24 hours of fighting between Islamic State fighters and security forces from Somalia’s Puntland region, officials said Wednesday. At least 15 Puntland soldiers and more than 50 militants were slain in the fierce fighting around the Dharin and Qurac areas of the Cal Miskaad mountains in Puntland’s Bari region, multiple Puntland security officials told VOA, speaking on condition of anonymity because they were not authorized to brief the media. In an interview Wednesday with VOA’s Somali Service, a spokesperson for Puntland security operations, Brigadier General Mohamud Mohamed Ahmed, said the fighting, which began Tuesday, was the heaviest since Puntland launched an offensive last month against Islamic State groups that have hideouts in the mountains. 'We have confirmed that at least 57 Islamic State militants, all of them foreigners, were killed during the fighting in the last 24 hours,' Ahmed said. Ahmed declined to say how many Puntland soldiers were wounded or lost but suggested casualties were heavy. 'The fighting is taking place in a mountainous area where the militants are using improvised explosives. The fighting of this nature in such an environment, the attacking force often suffers more casualties than the defenders,' he said. VOA could not independently verify the claim of 57 militants killed but graphic video circulated on social media was said to show scenes of militants’ bodies strewn in a mountainous area. Ahmed said Tuesday night the United Arab Emirates conducted a drone strike against the IS militants in the area to support Puntland forces. A statement from the Puntland forces said their troops have gained ground. 'Puntland forces have successfully captured the strategic village of Dharin in Togga Jecel, dealing a significant blow to the extremist group’s operational capabilities in the region,' the statement said. It added: 'The forces have expelled the enemy from the areas they fought along the Togga Jecel.' These latest clashes came just days after U.S. warplanes targeted the Islamic State affiliate in Somalia, hitting what officials described as high-ranking operatives in the terror group's mountainous stronghold. U.S. President Donald Trump announced the airstrike Saturday on social media, describing the main target as a 'Senior ISIS Attack Planner and other terrorists he recruited and led.' Somali President Hassan Sheikh Mohamud thanked the U.S. for its 'unwavering support' in the 'fight against international terrorism.' Military campaign Puntland began a military offensive dubbed 'Hilac Campaign' last month against extremist groups in the region following months of preparations. Claims by Puntland commanders made regarding different battles indicate more than 150 Islamic State militants have been killed. Puntland’s leader, Said Abdullahi Deni, appealed to the public to support the operation, which he said is aimed at dislodging the Islamic State militants from their hideouts in mountainous areas. The operation has garnered public support. Monday, hundreds of residents took to the streets of Bosaso, the commercial hub of Puntland state, to demonstrate against the terrorist group and show support for the military campaign. Puntland is a member state of Somalia but its relationship with the country’s federal government has been strained by political conflicts and the region is considered semi-autonomous. Analysts say the rift between the two sides has limited any collaboration between the federal government and the Puntland regional state, including the fight against terrorists. 'An operation like this needs logistical support and reinforcements, and the regional states alone cannot handle it. Federal government support and involvement is a must,' Somalia’s former Prime Minister Omar Abdirashid Ali Sharmake told VOA. 'The Islamic State is a common enemy for Somalis. Politicians should separate the national interests and the political differences that can be later solved through negotiations. National interests including security and development should not be politicized,' former national intelligence chief Brigadier General Abdirahman Turyare told VOA. IS in Puntland Puntland has endured terrorist attacks perpetrated by al-Shabab and Islamic State militants, but the ongoing military operation appears to be focused on IS. The group has a relatively small presence in Somalia compared to the al-Qaida-linked al-Shabab, but experts have warned of growing activity. U.S. military officials and Somali security experts reported that IS increased its membership numbers in Somalia last year. The group was previously estimated to have between 100 and 400 fighters, but Somali security and intelligence experts say the number has grown to between 500 and 600. Most of the newcomers are said to be from the Middle East and eastern and northern Africa.

10 'high-threat illegal aliens' arrive at Guantanamo Bay	PENTAGON — The first undocumented migrants — described by U.S. officials as the 'the worst of the worst' — are being held in jail cells at the U.S. detention center at Guantanamo Bay, Cuba, waiting to be sent home. The Pentagon Wednesday confirmed 10 'high-threat illegal aliens' arrived Tuesday at the detention facility, where they are being held under the watch of officers with U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement, or ICE. VOA first reported on the transfer — and arrival — of the migrants, flown from Fort Bliss, Texas, to Guantanamo Bay aboard a U.S. military C-17 cargo plane Tuesday. According to the Pentagon, the detention of the high-threat migrants at the Guantanamo Bay detention facility is a temporary measure. ICE 'is taking this measure to ensure the safe and secure detention of these individuals until they can be transported to their country of origin or other appropriate destination' the Pentagon said in a statement. U.S. Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem on Tuesday posted photos on X of some of the migrants as they prepared to board the military cargo plane, calling them 'the worst of the worst,' and warning the effort to deport them is just getting started. The Department of Homeland Security later said all of the migrants on the military flight were members of Tren de Aragua, a Venezuelan street gang with transnational reach. Officials did not say when or how they were first taken into custody. The White House has announced plans to designate Tren de Aragua as a Foreign Terrorist Organization. Noem, posting on X on Wednesday, said her department has overseen the arrest of 'convicted murderers, rapists, child abusers, drug traffickers, MS-13 gang members, cartel members,' in just the past few days. Since President Donald Trump's executive order last month, the Pentagon has deployed 300 Marines to Guantanamo to expand the facilities to support holding operations for undocumented immigrants. According to media reports, they have set up tents to house the migrants inside a fenced area at a separate part of the naval base. Those facilities are not yet ready for migrants, according to Fox News. 'The number of service members will continue to fluctuate as additional forces are tasked to deploy and will be scaled, based on the requirements of the Department of Homeland Security, which is the lead federal agency,' U.S. Southern Command, which oversees operations in South America, Central America and the Caribbean, announced in a statement on Monday. The migrants who arrived Tuesday will be held at the U.S. detention facility, according to a U.S. official who spoke on background. The facility is known mostly for housing military prisoners and terror suspects, including those involved in the September 11, 2001, attacks and members of the Taliban. 'If you're a violent gang banger, and you've been taken out of our country, and we're waiting to bring you to your country, we're going to put you in a cell box built for al-Qaida,' Secretary of Defense Pete Hegseth told Fox News this week. In his executive order last month, Trump instructed the departments of Defense and Homeland Security to prepare the U.S. naval base to hold up to 30,000 migrants. 'Some of them are so bad we don't even trust the countries to hold them because we don't want them coming back. So, we're going to send them out to Guantanamo,' Trump said. Closing Guantanamo Democratic administrations under former Presidents Barack Obama and Joe Biden had sought to close the detention camp, which was built by the administration of former President George W. Bush in 2002, following the U.S. invasion of Afghanistan that began shortly after the 9/11 attacks of 2001. Sue Hendrickson, president and CEO of Human Rights First, said in a statement that sending migrants to Guantanamo would create a human rights catastrophe. 'The Trump administration may find the symbolism of sending migrants to Guantanamo darkly appealing; its practical result would be more injustice, waste and self-inflicted loss of credibility,' Hendrickson said. At its height during the global war on terror campaign, the detention facility held about 680 prisoners. As of January 6, there were just 15 detainees at the facility, according to the Pentagon. Before being used to detain terror suspects, the U.S. naval facility was also used to house migrants from Cuba and Haiti in the early 1990s.

Trump's plan for US to take over Gaza meets mixed reactions	U.S. President Donald Trump’s idea for the United States to take over the Gaza Strip has shocked Israelis and Palestinians. While some Israelis welcome the idea, Palestinians categorically reject it. Linda Gradstein reports for VOA from Jerusalem.	https://www.voanews.com/a/trump-s-plan-for-us-to-take-over-gaza-meets-mixed-reactions/7964086.html	2025-02-05T10:27:05-08:00	
Trump's birthright citizenship order gets put on hold by 2nd federal judge	GREENBELT, MARYLAND — A U.S. federal judge on Wednesday ordered a second temporary pause on President Donald Trump's executive order seeking to end birthright citizenship for anyone born in the United States to someone in the country illegally. U.S. District Judge Deborah Boardman said no court in the country has endorsed the Trump administration's interpretation of the 14th Amendment. 'This court will not be the first,' she said. Trump's inauguration week order had already been on temporary hold nationally because of a separate lawsuit brought by four states in Washington state, where a judge called the order 'blatantly unconstitutional.' In total, 22 states, as well as other organizations, have sued to try to stop the executive action. Boardman, nominated by former President Joe Biden, agreed to the preliminary injunction after a hearing in federal court in Greenbelt, Maryland. Bringing the suit before Boardman are immigrant-rights advocacy groups CASA and Asylum Seeker Advocacy Project, and a handful of expectant mothers. At the heart of the lawsuits is the 14th Amendment to the Constitution, ratified in 1868 after the Civil War and the Dred Scott Supreme Court decision that determined Scott, a slave, wasn't a citizen. 'The principle of birthright citizenship is a foundation of our national democracy, is woven throughout the laws of our nation, and has shaped a shared sense of national belonging for generation after generation of citizens,' the plaintiffs argued in the suit. The Trump administration asserts that children of noncitizens are not 'subject to the jurisdiction' of the United States and therefore not entitled to citizenship. 'The Constitution does not harbor a windfall clause granting American citizenship to, inter alia: the children of those who have circumvented (or outright defied) federal immigration laws,' the government argued in reply to the Maryland plaintiffs' suit. The 14th Amendment was added in the aftermath of the Civil War to ensure citizenship for former slaves and free African Americans. It states: 'All persons born or naturalized in the United States and subject to the jurisdiction thereof, are citizens of the United States and of the State wherein they reside.' In addition to the 22 states with Democratic attorneys general seeking to stop the order, 18 Republican attorneys general announced this week that they're seeking to defend the president's order by joining one of the federal suits brought in New Hampshire. The U.S. is among about 30 countries where birthright citizenship — the principle of jus soli or 'right of the soil' — is applied. Most are in the Americas, and Canada and Mexico are among them. During his first week in office, Trump signed 10 executive orders on immigration and issued edicts to carry out promises of mass deportations and border security. Some actions were felt immediately. Others face legal challenges. If they happen at all, other orders may take years to happen but have led to fear in immigrant communities. Whether Trump can enact his agenda could come down to money. Congress is expected to consider funding support soon. Trump may use emergency powers to tap the Defense Department, as he did for a border wall during his first term.	https://www.voanews.com/a/trump-s-birthright-citizenship-order-gets-put-on-hold-by-2nd-federal-judge/7964060.html	2025-02-05T10:18:33-08:00	
Countries’ leaders denounce Trump proposal for US ownership of Gaza	U.S. allies and adversaries alike on Wednesday denounced President Donald Trump’s proposal for the United States to take ownership of the Gaza Strip, force 2 million Palestinians to move to other countries and then turn the territory along the Mediterranean Sea into 'the Riviera of the Middle East.' The world reaction to Trump’s suggestion, offered at a White House news conference Tuesday evening alongside Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, was swift and mostly universal in opposition to the idea advanced by the one-time New York real estate magnate. Britain, China, Germany, Ireland, Russia and Spain said they continue to support a two-state solution — creation of an independent Palestinian state that would include Gaza and the Israeli-occupied West Bank existing next to Israel. The two-state proposal, aimed at ending decades of Middle East conflict and wars, has long been the bedrock of U.S. policy in the region even though Netanyahu’s government opposes it. Saudi Arabia, an important oil-producing American ally in the Middle East, weighed in quickly in a sharply worded statement, saying its call for an independent Palestinian state was a 'firm, steadfast and unwavering position.' 'Australia's position is the same as it was this morning, as it was last year, as it was 10 years ago,' Australian Prime Minister Anthony Albanese said in support of a two-state solution. Netanyahu offered support for the plan, saying Tuesday that one of his war goals is to ensure that Palestinian militant group Hamas never again poses a threat to Israel. But Trump, Netanyahu said, is 'taking it to a much higher level.' 'I think it’s something that could change history, and it’s worthwhile really pursuing this avenue,' he said. Trump was noncommittal when asked Tuesday whether he supports the two-state solution. His plan on Gaza 'doesn't mean anything about a two-state or one-state or any other state,' he said. Palestinians, nearby countries reject Trump ideas Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas called for the United Nations to 'protect the Palestinian people and their inalienable rights,' saying that what Trump wanted to do would be 'a serious violation of international law.' Hamas said Trump's Gaza proposal was a 'recipe for creating chaos and tension in the region. Instead of holding the Zionist occupation accountable for the crime of genocide and displacement, it is being rewarded, not punished.' Even before Trump called for U.S. ownership of Gaza, Egypt and Jordan had in recent days rejected his suggestion that Gaza’s Palestinian population be relocated to their countries. Egypt's Foreign Ministry issued a statement stressing the need for rebuilding in Gaza 'without moving the Palestinians out of the Gaza Strip.' United Nations human rights chief Volker Turk said Wednesday that deporting people from Israeli-occupied Gaza was illegal. 'The right to self-determination is a fundamental principle of international law and must be protected by all states, as the International Court of Justice recently underlined afresh,' Turk said in a statement. 'Any forcible transfer in or deportation of people from occupied territory is strictly prohibited.' Trump sees ‘unlimited jobs’ with Gaza development But Trump said at his news conference that Jordan's King Abdullah and Egyptian President Abdel Fattah al-Sisi would come around to his idea, contending they will 'open their hearts and will give us the kind of land that we need to get this done and people can live in harmony and in peace.' Trump’s Gaza proposal was his first major Middle East policy statement since taking office for a second four-year term two weeks ago. Trump said he envisioned building a resort on the shores of the Mediterranean where international communities could live in harmony. Much of the coastal territory currently lies in ruins, after more than 15 months of Israeli bombardment that has killed more than 47,000 people, more than half women and children. The Israeli military says it has killed 17,000 Hamas militants. Trump’s Gaza proposal comes amid a six-week ceasefire to halt the fighting that erupted Oct. 7, 2023, when Hamas attacked southern Israel, killing 1,200 people and capturing 250 as hostages. About 60 living captives are still believed to be held by Hamas, a U.S.-designated terror group. During the truce so far, Hamas has released 18 hostages, while Israel in exchange has freed hundreds of Palestinian prisoners. At his news conference, Trump said, 'The U.S. will take over the Gaza Strip, and we will do a job with it, too. We'll own it and be responsible for dismantling all of the dangerous unexploded bombs and other weapons on the site, level the site, and get rid of the destroyed buildings, level it out, create an economic development that will supply unlimited numbers of jobs. 'Everybody I've spoken to loves the idea of the United States owning that piece of land, developing and creating thousands of jobs with something that will be magnificent, in a really magnificent area,' he said. Trump offered no details on how he plans to exert control over Gaza, which has been decimated by the war, but he did not rule out sending in U.S. troops. 'If it’s necessary, we’ll do that. We’re going to take over that piece, and we’re going to develop it,' he said. Trump’s Gaza ownership idea was a pronounced shift from his past criticism of America’s involvement in Middle East conflicts. Trump said he envisions a 'long-term ownership position' for the U.S. that would bring 'great stability to that part of the Middle East, and maybe the entire Middle East.' 'This was not a decision made lightly,' he said. The U.S. leader’s Gaza overture was his latest suggestion of an American show of force in far-flung reaches of the world. He has voiced the need for the U.S. to retake control of the Panama Canal from the Panamanian government; buy Greenland, for centuries a Danish territory, and for Canada to be annexed to become the 51st U.S. state. Panama, Denmark and Canada have all rejected his demands. Reactions in the United States Several U.S. lawmakers joined the chorus of world leaders opposing Trump’s Gaza offering. Democratic Senator Chris Coons of Delaware called the comments 'offensive and insane and dangerous and foolish.' The idea, Coons said, 'risks the rest of the world thinking that we are an unbalanced and unreliable partner because our president makes insane proposals.' Coons noted the irony of the proposal coming shortly after Trump had moved to dismantle the U.S. Agency for International Development, the prime conduit for U.S. foreign aid. Democratic Representative Rashida Tlaib, a Palestinian American member of Congress from Michigan, accused Trump in a social media post of 'openly calling for ethnic cleansing' with the idea of resettling Gaza's entire population. But a Trump supporter, Representative Nancy Mace of South Carolina, adopted a light-hearted assessment, saying, 'Let’s turn Gaza into Mar-A-Lago,' referring to Trump’s Atlantic oceanside resort residence and club in south Florida that he calls the Winter White House. House Speaker Mike Johnson, the leader of the narrow Republican majority in the House of Representatives, offered support for Trump’s Gaza takeover, saying, 'Yeah, we're trying to get the details of it, but I think this is a good development.' Senate Republican Majority Leader John Thune, in a neutral view, said Trump 'wants a more peaceful and secure Middle East and put some ideas out there.' Some information for this report came from The Associated Press, Agence France-Presse and Reuters.	https://www.voanews.com/a/countries-leaders-denounce-trump-proposal-for-us-ownership-of-gaza/7963989.html	2025-02-05T09:38:48-08:00	
Earthquakes keep rattling Greece's volcanic island of Santorini every few minutes	ATHENS, GREECE — Earthquakes rattled Greece's volcanic island of Santorini every few minutes through the night and into Wednesday as authorities bolstered their emergency plans in case the hundreds of temblors over the past few days are a harbinger of a larger quake to come. A coast guard vessel and a military landing craft were in the wider area as a contingency should an evacuation be required, Civil Protection Minister Vassilis Kikilias said Wednesday during an emergency meeting with security officials, scientists and the prime minister in Athens. 'We are obliged to draw up scenarios for better and for worse regarding the prolonged seismic activity,' Kikilias said during the meeting, which was televised live. Predicting earthquakes is not scientifically possible, and experts cannot yet determine definitively whether the seismic activity between the islands of Santorini and Amorgos could be a precursor to a significantly larger earthquake, or is part of an earthquake swarm that could continue shaking the area with small or moderate intensity quakes for weeks or months. 'I understand the fear of what it means at the moment to be on a Santorini that is constantly moving,' Prime Minister Kyriakos Mitsotakis said, as he called on residents to remain calm and follow authorities' instructions. Rescue crews with a sniffer dog and drones have been deployed on Santorini as a precaution since Sunday, while authorities have banned access to several coastal areas and ordered schools on several islands to shut for the week. Public events on Santorini have been banned, and local authorities were restricting access to clifftop areas that are among the biggest tourist draws to the island. Thousands of residents and visitors have already left Santorini, frightened by the hundreds of earthquakes measuring between magnitude 3 and magnitude 5 that have struck the area since the weekend. Ferry lines and commercial airlines have added ships and flights to their schedules this week to accommodate the increased demand. However, ferry services were disrupted on Wednesday due to rough weather. The quakes, which all have epicenters beneath the seabed between Santorini and the Amorgos, have so far caused no injuries or major damage, although limited rockslides and cracks in some older buildings have been reported on Santorini. Greece lies in a highly seismically active part of the world and earthquakes are frequent. But it is extremely rare for any part of the country to experience such an intense barrage of frequent earthquakes. Last week, authorities said monitors had picked up increased volcanic activity within Santorini's caldera, or flooded crater, but scientists say this is unrelated to the current quakes. They have also said the seismic activity northeast of the island is unlikely to trigger either of the two volcanoes in the area. Southeast Aegean regional governor Giorgos Hatzimarkos told Greek state television that the country's electricity provider had sent staff and equipment to the island to prepare contingency plans in case of power cuts, while civil engineers were checking the road network. Digital Governance Deputy Minister Konstantinos Kyranakis said the government was working with telecommunications providers to ensure backup plans in case of a network outage in the area.	https://www.voanews.com/a/earthquakes-keep-rattling-greece-s-volcanic-island-of-santorini-every-few-minutes/7963901.html	2025-02-05T08:12:18-08:00	
Argentina says it will withdraw from WHO, echoing Trump	BUENOS AIRES — President Javier Milei has ordered Argentina's withdrawal from the World Health Organization due to profound differences with the U.N. agency, a presidential spokesperson said Wednesday. Milei's action echoes that of his ally, U.S. President Donald Trump, who began the process of pulling the United States out of the WHO with an executive order on his first day back in office on Jan. 21. Argentina's decision is based on 'profound differences in health management, especially during the [COVID19] pandemic,' spokesperson Manuel Adorni said at a news conference in Buenos Aires. He said that WHO guidelines at the time had led to the largest shutdown 'in the history of mankind.' He also said that the WHO lacked independence because of the political influence of some countries, without elaborating which countries. Argentina will not allow an international organization to intervene in its sovereignty 'and much less in our health,' Adorni said. The WHO is the United Nations’ specialized health agency and is the only organization mandated to coordinate global responses to acute health crises, particularly outbreaks of new diseases and persistent threats such as Ebola, AIDS and mpox.	https://www.voanews.com/a/argentina-says-it-will-withdraw-from-who-echoing-trump/7963895.html	2025-02-05T08:11:09-08:00

US deportation flight carrying illegal Indian migrants lands in Punjab	New Delhi — A U.S. deportation flight carrying Indian nationals accused of entering the U.S. illegally landed in the northern state of Punjab Wednesday – the first such flight to India since the Trump administration launched a crackdown on illegal immigrants. The military aircraft, which landed amid tight security, brought 104 deportees, according to media reports. Authorities did not confirm the number, but said the deportees will be received in a friendly manner. New Delhi, which does not want to make illegal immigration a contentious issue with Washington, has said that it is open to the return of undocumented Indians in the United States if their nationality is verified. President Donald Trump said last week that Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi had assured him that the country would 'do what's right' in taking back illegal immigrants. His comment came following a phone conversation with Modi. In New Delhi, foreign ministry spokesperson Randhir Jaiswal told a media briefing on Friday that India and the United States are engaged in a process to deter illegal migration and 'cooperation between India and the U.S. is strong and effective in this domain. This will be evident in times to come.' Trade and migration are expected to be key issues during a meeting that could take place next week between Trump and Modi. 'India does not want to focus on the issue of illegal migrants being deported. We know it is big business in India, sending migrants illegally. Instead, the government’s interest is in ensuring that legal migration channels to the U.S. for Indian nationals are not restricted by the Trump administration,' according to Manoj Joshi, Distinguished Fellow at the Observer Research Foundation in New Delhi. Those legal routes are H-1B visas for skilled workers and visas for students. 'Both sides are engaged in a process to deter illegal migration, while also creating more avenues for legal migration from India to the U.S.,' Jaiswal has said. The number of Indian migrants attempting to enter the U.S. unlawfully has grown in recent years, with India now accounting for the largest number of illegal immigrants to the United States from Asian countries, according to U.S. Customs and Border Protection data. Their overall numbers, however, are still small; Indians account for only about 3 percent of illegal crossings. The United States has identified some 18,000 undocumented Indian migrants to be sent back home, according to a Bloomberg report last week. Deportation flights to India are not new — between October 2023 and September 2024, more than 1,000 Indian nationals were repatriated, but Wednesday's flight was the first time that they were sent back via military aircraft. The deportation flight was routed to Amritsar city in Punjab, which is among the three states where much of the illegal migration from India to the U.S. originates. The others are Haryana in the north and the western state of Gujarat. Hours before the flight landed, Punjab’s minister for NRI (Non-Resident Indians) Affairs, Kuldeep Singh Dhaliwal, urged people in the state to avoid illegal migration and instead focus on acquiring skills and education to access global opportunities through legal channels.	https://www.voanews.com/a/us-deportation-flight-carrying-illegal-indian-migrants-lands-in-punjab-/7963746.html	2025-02-05T06:09:08-08:00

US Postal Service suspends inbound parcels from China, Hong Kong	HONG KONG/SEOUL/SHANGHAI — The U.S. Postal Service said it would temporarily suspend parcels from China and Hong Kong, after President Donald Trump ended a trade provision this week used by retailers including Temu and Shein to ship low-value packages duty-free to the U.S. The Trump administration imposed an additional 10% tariff on Chinese goods that came into effect on Tuesday and moved to close the 'de minimis' exemption that allows U.S. shoppers to avoid paying tariffs for shipments below $800. The extra tariff and the elimination of de minimis follow repeated warnings by Trump that Beijing was not doing enough to halt the flow of fentanyl, a dangerous synthetic opioid, into the U.S. Reuters reported previously that Chinese suppliers use the duty-free provision to export chemical materials for fentanyl by disguising them as gadgets and other low-cost goods. 'This is huge... People waiting for orders from Amazon, Shein and Temu have no way of knowing when they can receive those orders,' said Ram Ben Tzion, founder of Ultra Information Solution, the firm behind digital shipment vetting platform Publican. USPS said the change will not impact the flow of letters and 'flats' — mail that can be up to 15 inches (38 cm) long or 3/4 inches (1.9 cm) thick — from China and Hong Kong. It did not immediately comment on whether this was tied to Trump's change to ending de minimis shipments from China and other countries. 'The USPS would require some time to sort out how to execute the new taxes before allowing Chinese packages to arrive in the U.S. again,' said Chelsey Tam, a senior equity analyst at Morningstar. 'This is a significant challenge for them because there were 4 million de minimis packages per day in 2024, and it is difficult to check all the packages — so it will take time.' At a Hong Kong post office, a businessman who had come to check the status of a package he sent to the U.S. earlier expressed frustration after a staffer told him it wasn't possible to ascertain where his delivery might be now. 'This political war is affecting the local people, not just in Hong Kong but in other places too. It's very disturbing for us,' John Khan, who has run a trading business for nearly 30 years, told Reuters. China's foreign ministry called on Wednesday for dialog and consultation between Beijing and Washington, adding that reducing demand for drugs at home and enhancing law enforcement cooperation was the fundamental way for the U.S. to solve its fentanyl crisis. Greater scrutiny Logistics provider Easyship warned clients who regularly send sub-$800 shipments to the U.S. were likely to face much greater scrutiny and advised them to set up distribution centers within the U.S., partner with a local warehouse or U.S. fulfillment center. Some other international couriers including FedEx FDX.N and SF Express, China's largest express delivery company, said they continue to send packages to the U.S. FedEx, however, added it had suspended its money-back guarantee for U.S. inbound shipments effective Jan. 29, citing recent regulatory changes, according to a notice on its website. Fast-fashion retailer Shein and online dollar-store Temu, both of which sell products ranging from toys to smartphones, have grown rapidly in the U.S. thanks in part to the de minimis exemption. The two firms together likely accounted for more than 30% of all packages shipped to the United States each day under the de minimis provision, the U.S. congressional committee on China said in a June 2023 report. Nearly half of all packages shipped under de minimis come from China, according to the report. Shein and Temu did not immediately reply to a request for comment. 'Doing the paperwork for customs declarations was not something these companies had to deal with very often before,' said Basile Ricard, operations director at Ceva Logistics Greater China. 'So this is a very new process for them. If this remains a largely manual process it will be incredibly difficult... It's really not clear for us at this stage how they are going to manage that.' Amazon also has a large seller base in China, with e-commerce consultancy Marketplace Pulse estimating in February that China-based sellers represent nearly half of the top 10,000 sellers on Amazon in the U.S. Amazon did not immediately respond to a request for comment. In November, the U.S. company set up Amazon Haul to allow shoppers to purchase $5 handbags and $10 sweaters from China-based sellers. Delays in deliveries Trump's crackdown on de minimis would make the products sold by the likes of Shein and Temu more expensive but is unlikely to dramatically impact shipment volumes, experts said. 'E-commerce volumes out of China grew 20-30% last year, so it's going to take a sledgehammer to crack that level of consumer demand and I'm not sure de minimis alone is enough,' said Niall van de Wouw, Chief Airfreight Officer at freight platform Xeneta. 'They will still be cheaper than buying through retailers in the U.S. Delays in receiving the goods due to operational disruptions could have a bigger impact than price.' Shein has previously said it supports reform of the de minimis provision. Both Temu, a subsidiary of Chinese e-commerce giant PDD Holdings, and Singapore-headquartered Shein, which plans to list in London this year, have taken measures such as sourcing more products from outside China, opening U.S. warehouses and bringing more U.S. sellers on board, to mitigate the impact. In what would be another blow to the two China-founded e-commerce platforms, the U.S. is discussing whether to add Shein and Temu to the Department of Homeland Security's 'forced labor' list, Semafor reported on Tuesday.	https://www.voanews.com/a/us-postal-service-suspends-inbound-parcels-from-china-hong-kong-/7963688.html	2025-02-05T05:12:38-08:00	
Bird flu pushes egg prices up; US retailers, consumers worry	The latest outbreak of bird flu is wiping out chicken flocks and driving higher prices for eggs in the United States.

VOA UZBEK: What will happen to USAID programs in Central Asia?	The United States Agency for International Development’s regional efforts in Central Asia focus on five main sectors, which are foundational for regional prosperity and security: energy; trade and enterprise development; environment and transboundary water management; countering trafficking-in-persons; and countering violent extremism. Experts say the work in the five countries — Kazakhstan, the Kyrgyz Republic, Tajikistan, Turkmenistan, and Uzbekistan — is not as significant as in other regions. However, they believe the region is still suffering, including the lack of programs to train and retain essential personnel.

South Africa's unity government steady after stormy start	Johannesburg — In the seven months since it was formed, South Africa's unlikely unity government has been stretched and cracked but remains intact under the leadership of President Cyril Ramaphosa, who delivers its first state of the nation address Thursday. Several loud quarrels have erupted over sticking points such as language education in schools and Ramaphosa's warm words towards Russia but nothing that has made real the threats and fears of collapse. 'They think we are at each other's throats. We are not. We continue to meet and talk,' Ramaphosa said in the wake of the latest crisis sparked by his signing of a property expropriation bill last month. The second-largest partner in the 10-party coalition, the Democratic Alliance, was angry that Ramaphosa signed the act without consulting his partners in the government of national unity (GNU). 'This is not how coalitions work,' DA leader John Steenhuisen fumed. 'We will not be reduced to being spectators.' But the party did not object to the need for land reform in the country, where most farmland is owned by whites. It also sided with Ramaphosa when the bill was attacked by US President Donald Trump for allowing the 'confiscation' of property, saying this was untrue. The DA has six ministries in exchange for propping up Ramaphosa's ANC in government after it failed to win enough votes in the May election to govern alone, a first since the party took power in 1994 and ended decades of white-minority apartheid rule. It was an unlikely collaboration, with the DA a long and critical rival of the African National Congress (ANC). But the GNU, which includes eight other smaller parties, has been credited with bringing some stability to the continent's most industrialized economy as it faces a host of challenges, from an unemployment rate topping 30%, to high rates of crime. Big business While it has fumed and flexed, the center-right DA is also aware that, should it quit the unity government, the ANC could find support from the radical-left EFF and the populist MK parties, now in opposition. It is a scenario it calls a 'doomsday coalition'. 'This is something the DA will move Table Mountain to avoid,' Sunday Times editor-in-chief Makhudu Sefara wrote in a weekend column. 'And therein lies the extent to which they're prepared to compromise.' The DA will not walk out, said political scientist Sandile Swana. 'It is the political party of big business,' he said. 'And the GNU was mandated, or demanded or directed, to come into existence by big business in South Africa.' Despite some cynical maneuvring at local government level -- for example, to push out the DA mayor of the city of Tshwane in September -- the coalition will even survive bitter local elections due in late 2026, said political scientist Susan Booysen told AFP. 'They could actually go into a poisonous, toxic local government election campaign and continue with the national coalition,' she said. 'It's such a schizophrenic type of coalition.' Ramaphosa, meanwhile, is walking a fine line within his own party, where a large faction of the ANC wants him to assert that it 'is not in the DA's pocket,' Booysen said. But even if Ramaphosa does not complete his term as president, with his future as head of the party not guaranteed after ANC leadership elections in 2027, his successor is also unlikely to end the fractious collaboration, Swana said. 'Even if Ramaphosa is removed, I do not think they will kick the DA out of government,' Swana said. 'The GNU, as things stand, will last the five-year period.'	https://www.voanews.com/a/south-africa-s-unity-government-steady-after-stormy-start/7963593.html	2025-02-05T02:51:01-08:00	
China says it is willing to work with EU on 'global challenges'	BEIJING — China is willing to work with the European Union on boosting cooperation and responding to 'global challenges,' its foreign ministry said on Wednesday, as the bloc faces potential U.S. tariffs on its shipments to the world's largest economy. China attaches great importance to EU ties and hopes the bloc will become a reliable cooperation partner, said Lin Jian, spokesperson at the Chinese ministry. The EU's trade chief said on Tuesday that the bloc wanted to engage swiftly with the United States over President Donald Trump's planned tariffs. European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen forecast negotiations with Washington would be tough. As transatlantic ties come under strain with Trump's tariff threats, China hawks within the EU such as von der Leyen are showing signs of willingness to rethink the relationship between Beijing and Brussels, a bond that had been tested by trade tensions and China's ties with Russia. Speaking in Brussels on Tuesday, von der Leyen said the EU would keep 'de-risking' its relationship with China but added that there was room to 'find solutions' in their mutual interest and 'find agreements' that could even expand trade and investment ties. She did not give details on what those agreements could be. In Davos, Switzerland, last month, von der Leyen also said both sides should find solutions of mutual interest. In October, the EU imposed double-digit tariffs on China-made electric vehicles after an anti-subsidy investigation, in addition to its standard car import duty of 10%. The move drew loud protests from Beijing, which in return, raised market entry barriers for certain EU products such as brandy.	https://www.voanews.com/a/china-says-it-is-willing-to-work-with-eu-on-global-challenges-/7963583.html	2025-02-05T02:40:02-08:00	
Thailand cuts power, fuel and internet supply to parts of Myanmar	Bangkok — Thailand has cut electricity, internet and fuel supplies to five border areas in Myanmar, a senior Thai minister said on Wednesday, as the Southeast Asian nation steps up efforts to choke scam centers that have become a growing security concern. 'They may face challenges of lower power supply, but we are at the point now where no one can blame Thailand for being part of or play a part in supporting illegal acts,' Deputy Prime Minister and Interior Minister Anutin Charnvirakul told reporters. 'They may turn to other sources of power supply or generate their own electricity.' Scam compounds in Southeast Asia, including those along the Thai-Myanmar border, are suspected to have entrapped hundreds of thousands of people in illegal online operations, generating billions annually, according to a 2023 U.N. report. Myanmar's state-run Global New Light of Myanmar newspaper in a rare article on scam centers last month said basic essentials, including power and internet, are not provided by Myanmar but by other countries, in a veiled reference to Thailand. International pressure to dismantle these centers has grown after Chinese actor Wang Xing was abducted after arriving in Thailand last month. He was later freed by Thai police who found him in Myanmar. For Thailand, the proliferation of these centers has impacted its vital tourism sector and the country has sought to allay safety concerns of visitors from China, a key source market. Thailand's Provincial Electricity Authority said it had cut a total of 20.37 megawatts of supply to five areas along the border starting from 9 a.m. on Wednesday, which would lead to a loss of 600 million baht ($17.84 million) in revenue per year. It said the affected locations in Myanmar include Tachileik, Myawaddy and Phaya Thonsu, which all lie along the border with Thailand. A resident of Phaya Thonsu, opposite Thailand's Kanchanaburi Province, said many locals have faced power cuts since Wednesday morning, while Chinese businesses, including scam centers, continue to operate on generators. 'Since the last two days, we have seen big generators arriving into the town. Today, those generators are running and their businesses including scam centers are still operating,' he told Reuters, asking not to be named due to the sensitivity of the issue. 'The businesses owned by locals have stopped and the town's people are in trouble.'	https://www.voanews.com/a/thailand-cuts-power-fuel-and-internet-supply-to-parts-of-myanmar/7963575.html	2025-02-05T02:23:21-08:00	
Philippine House votes to impeach VP Sara Duterte, process moves ahead	Manila, Philippines — Philippine lawmakers on Wednesday voted to impeach Vice President Sara Duterte, who has fallen out spectacularly with the country's leader, paving the way for a Senate trial that could see her removed from office. While specifics of the impeachment were not divulged, the vote follows the filing of a trio of complaints in December accusing Duterte of crimes ranging from the 'brazen misuse' of millions of dollars in public funds to plotting President Ferdinand Marcos's assassination. 'Having been filed by more than one-third of the membership of the House of Representatives, or a total of 215 members ... the motion is approved,' House Speaker Martin Romualdez told lawmakers. The fate of Duterte, daughter of the former president, now lies in the hands of the Philippines' 24 senators, two-thirds of whom must vote for her impeachment to remove her from office and disqualify her from future public positions. A trial date has yet to be set. Wednesday's filing comes days before campaigning officially begins for mid-term elections, widely expected to set the table for the 2028 presidential race. Whether 16 senators cast their vote for Duterte's impeachment could come down to President Marcos, Dennis Coronacion, chairman of the political science department at the University of Santo Tomas, told AFP. 'If (Marcos) is committed to this one, to the impeachment process ... I think getting the required number of Senate votes is possible,' he said, adding Wednesday's vote had come as something of a surprise. But should the administration stay hands-off, the chances of Duterte being impeached are closer to 50-50, Coronacion said, pointing to the sitting senators' need for votes from Duterte stronghold Mindanao in the coming election. Family feud The relationship between Duterte and President Marcos is at a nadir, their former alliance giving way to a months-long public battle that has seen the trading of wild accusations, including an alleged death threat that remains under investigation. But Marcos had previously urged Congress not to pursue Duterte's impeachment, calling it a 'storm in a teacup' that would distract the legislature from its primary responsibilities. Marcos's executive secretary Lucas Bersamin, however, said Monday that the Office of the President would 'not interfere' with the impeachment complaints. A public relations official told AFP the Senate was expecting the articles of impeachment to arrive at its security office late Wednesday. House of Representatives member Percival Cendana, who had backed one of the three impeachment complaints, urged his colleagues to take quick action, speaking Friday at a rally that drew thousands calling for Duterte's impeachment. Every day of inaction 'condones the impunity, the abuse of power and the harassment that Duterte is doing to our country's leaders,' he told reporters. But that rally was dwarfed by one a conservative sect organized that drew hundreds of thousands to the street on Jan. 13 opposing the vice president's impeachment. Duterte was widely tipped to succeed her father Rodrigo as president in 2022 elections but stepped aside to back Marcos and later ran for vice president on his ticket. But the alliance has since imploded. In November, she delivered an expletive-laden speech saying she had ordered someone to kill Marcos if she herself was assassinated. She later denied that her comments constituted a death threat, saying she had only been expressing 'consternation' with the administration's failures. The alleged assassination threat was among the allegations included in the last of the three complaints filed against Duterte, lodged Dec. 19 by seven Manila-based Catholic priests. With her impeachment, Duterte becomes one of only four high-ranking officials to share that fate since the Philippines returned to democracy after the 20-year rule of Ferdinand Marcos Sr came to an end in 1986. Along with a Supreme Court justice and a high-profile prosecutor, then-president Joseph Estrada was impeached in November 2000 on charges of embezzlement and taking kickbacks from illegal gambling operations. When the Senate tribunal refused to accept key evidence, Filipinos took to the streets in a bloodless revolt, leading Estrada to step down when the military withdrew its support.	https://www.voanews.com/a/philippine-house-votes-to-impeach-vp-sara-duterte-process-moves-ahead/7963572.html	2025-02-05T02:13:56-08:00	
Swedish police warn of online misinformation after mass school shooting	OREBRO, Sweden — Swedish police said on Wednesday there was no evidence of 'ideological motives' behind a mass shooting at an adult education center on Tuesday, and warned of misinformation spread on social media about the Nordic country's deadliest gun attack. At least 11 people died and many others were wounded in the shooting at the Risbergska school in Orebro, a town of over 100,000 people, where large numbers of police continued to cordon off the center and several schools located on its campus complex. A vigil with candles and flowers had been set up nearby. 'We want to be clear that based on investigative and intelligence information at present, there is no information pointing to the culprit acting on ideological motives,' police said in a brief statement on its website. Police have said the motive for the crime was not immediately known, and that they believed the suspected perpetrator, who was among the dead and was not known previously to the police, acted alone. Prime Minister Ulf Kristersson on Tuesday said the attack was the worst mass shooting in Swedish history, calling it a 'painful day,' while King Carl XVI Gustav conveyed his condolences. Flags at official buildings in Orebro, some 200 km west of Stockholm, as well as at the Swedish parliament and the royal palace in the capital, were flying at half-mast as a sign of respect and mourning. 'Our task is to take care of those attending the affected school, those who work there as well as inhabitants of Orebro, who are worried and sad,' Orebro Municipal Director Peter Larsson said in a statement. Many students in Sweden's adult school system are immigrants seeking to improve their basic education and gain degrees to help them find jobs in the Nordic country while also learning Swedish. Police said in a statement it did not see any general threat against schools or pre-schools in the country, nor against adult education schools, including Swedish classes for immigrants. 'We also at present don't see any danger to the public, even if we understand that the incident raises concerns and many questions,' it said. Sweden has been struggling with a wave of shootings and bombings caused by an endemic gang crime problem that has seen the country of 10 million people record by far the highest per capita rate of gun violence in the EU in recent years. However, fatal attacks at schools are rare. Ten people were killed in seven incidents of deadly violence at schools between 2010 and 2022, according to the Swedish National Council for Crime Prevention.	https://www.voanews.com/a/swedish-police-warn-of-online-misinformation-after-mass-school-shooting/7963559.html	2025-02-05T01:44:13-08:00	
Islamic State members held for years in a Syria prison say they know nothing of the world	HASSAKEH, Syria — Men of various ages and nationalities sit silently in their cells, a small window in the metal doors their only opening to the world. All are alleged members of the Islamic State group, captured during the final days of the extremists' so-called caliphate declared in large parts of Iraq and Syria. The Gweiran Prison, now called Panorama, has held about 4,500 IS-linked detainees for years. The Associated Press was given an exclusive visit to the prison, nearly two months after the fall of the 54-year Assad dynasty in Syria — an upheaval the detainees might not even know about as prison officials try to limit outside information. Syrian President Bashar Assad's ouster during a lightning insurgent offensive in December has led to new attention, and new pressures, on such detention centers in the country's northeast that have been holding some 9,000 IS members without trial. The centers are guarded by members of the U.S.-backed and Kurdish-led Syrian Democratic Forces, that in March 2019 captured the last sliver of land that IS members once held, the eastern town of Baghouz. SDF chief commander Mazloum Abdi told the AP that after the fall of Assad, IS members captured large amounts of weapons in eastern Syria from posts abandoned by forces loyal to the former president. An SDF security official warned that the extremists might attack detention facilities and try to free their comrades. He spoke on condition of anonymity in line with regulations. The detainees are 'a literal and figurative ‘ISIS army’ in detention,' Gen. Michael Erik Kurilla, commander of the U.S. Central Command, said during a visit to Syria last month. The prison visit occurred in a corridor with six cells on each side and with masked guards holding clubs. A window in a cell door was opened, and the detainees were told they could speak briefly to journalists. A young man moved forward and identified himself as Maher, a nurse from Melbourne, Australia. Prison authorities asked that only first names be used. 'I’d love to go back to Australia,' the man said, adding that he was not arrested in 2019 in Baghouz but gave himself up when the U.S.-led coalition opened a humanitarian corridor. 'I didn’t do anything to anyone. I’ve been here for seven years without judgment. Without anything,' he said, and expressed regret for 'a lot of things.' Maher said he married a Syrian woman and has two sons, and they are at one of the camps housing families of IS members in northeast Syria. He said he has not had information about them, and that he sent a letter to his parents via the International Committee of the Red Cross and never received an answer. The security of the detention centers is a growing question since Assad's fall. One of the most serious threats to the centers came in January 2022 when IS gunmen stormed the prison, leading to 10 days of battles with the SDF that left nearly 500 people dead. The prison, formerly the classrooms of a technical school, was later renovated with the help of the U.S.-led coalition. Security was tight when the AP visited, with armed fighters stationed on roads leading to the facility. But SDF officials have said that recent clashes between their fighters and Turkey-backed gunmen in northern Syria, which coincided with the insurgent offensive that led to Assad's fall, are affecting their ability to protect the prisons. During a visit to Turkey last month by Syria’s foreign minister, Asaad al-Shibani, his Turkish counterpart Hakan Fidan told reporters that Ankara was ready to help Syrian authorities manage the detention centers as well as the camps where more than 40,000 people, many of them women and children, with alleged IS links are held. But the SDF chief commander didn't welcome the idea. 'The way Turkey can help is to stop its attacks on us so that we concentrate on the protection of al-Hol and the prisons,' Abdi said. He added that the fate of al-Hol and other prisons can be solved within Syria. The country's future is being discussed in talks between the SDF, which controls nearly 25% of Syria, and the new government in Damascus led by the Hayat Tahrir al-Sham group. Inside the cells, the men wait for word on their own fate. A British prisoner from London, who asked that his name not be made public, said he wants to return to Britain and stand trial there. He was 18 when he came to Syria a decade ago after seeing media reports on 'the killings of kids' by Assad’s government forces during a popular uprising that turned into civil war. He said he later wanted to leave Syria but could not. 'Once you enter (IS), it's hard to leave,' he said. He claimed he had not been a fighter but instead bought and sold cars while living in IS-held areas. He said all men captured by the SDF in the Baghouz area in early 2019 were classified as IS members. Seven years have passed in detention. 'To survive a day in this place is a miracle,' he said, adding that he and fellow detainees know nothing of the world now, not even the date. Asked what day it was, he replied: 'We are in early 2025.'	https://www.voanews.com/a/islamic-state-members-held-for-years-in-a-syria-prison-say-they-know-nothing-of-the-world-/7963554.html	2025-02-05T01:32:50-08:00	
Russia says Ukrainian drone attack sparks oil depot fire in Krasnodar	A Ukrainian drone attack sparked a fire at an oil depot in Russia’s Krasnodar region, the area’s governor said Wednesday. The fire, which was later put out, happened in the village of Novominskaya. Krasnodar Governor Veniamin Kondratyev said debris from a destroyed drone caused the fire, and that there were no injuries. Russia’s Defense Ministry said Wednesday it shot down two Ukrainian drones over the Kursk region and two more drones over Belgorod, both of which border Ukraine. Officials in Kursk reported damage to a building, but no casualties. Ukraine’s military said Wednesday it shot down 57 of the 104 drones that Russian forces launched in overnight attacks. The intercepts took place over the Cherkasy, Chernihiv, Kharkiv, Khmelnytskyi, Kirovohrad, Kyiv, Poltava, Sumy and Zhytomyr regions. Kharkiv Governor Oleh Syniehubov said the attacks damaged several buildings and injured one person. Officials also reported damage to buildings in Kharkiv, Khmelnytskyi, Kirovohrad and Sumy. The head of the International Atomic Energy Agency warned Tuesday that Russian attacks on Ukraine's power grid or substations could disrupt supply and pose the risk of a nuclear accident. Rafael Grossi visited an electrical substation in Kyiv on Tuesday, saying on X that the structure is 'an important part of Ukraine's power grid essential for nuclear safety.' Grossi said that 'the situation is quite dire. ... We should not hide the fact that as you can see ... this infrastructure has been degraded.' He also said that he was 'impressed' with the work now being done 'to ensure nuclear safety.' Some information for this story was provided by The Associated Press, Agence France-Presse and Reuters.	https://www.voanews.com/a/russia-says-ukrainian-drone-attack-sparks-oil-depot-fire-in-krasnodar/7963534.html	2025-02-05T00:28:39-08:00	
India PM Modi's party seeks to oust anti-corruption crusader in New Delhi state elections	NEW DELHI — Thousands begin voting in the Indian capital’s state legislature election on Wednesday, with Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s Hindu nationalist party trying to unseat a powerful regional group that has ruled New Delhi for over a decade. Voters walked to polling booths on a cold, wintry morning to cast their ballots across the sprawling capital. Manish Sisodia, a key Aam Aadmi Party leader, and others offered prayers in a temple before voting. Modi’s Bharatiya Janata Party is up against the AAP, led by Arvind Kejriwal, which runs New Delhi and has built a vast support base on its welfare policies and an anti-corruption movement. Kejriwal, a popular crusader against corruption, suffered a setback as he himself faced graft allegations. The AAP won 62 out of 70 seats in a landslide victory in the last election, held in 2020, leaving BJP with only eight and the Congress party with none. The AAP had also swept the 2015 state elections, winning 67 seats, with the BJP taking three. Modi and Kejriwal have both campaigned vigorously in roadshows with thousands of supporters tailing them. They have offered to revamp government schools and provide free health services and electricity, and a monthly stipend of over 2,000 rupees ($25) to poor women. Voting ends later Wednesday, with results due on Saturday. More than 15 million people are eligible to vote in New Delhi's election. Arati Jerath, a political commentator, predicted a tight contest between the two parties, saying, 'Even since the AAP rose to prominence, it has been a one-sided contest.' Delhi, a city of more than 20 million people, is a federal territory that Modi’s party has not won for over 27 years despite having a sizable support base there. Kejriwal and other AAP leaders recently faced graft allegations in a liquor license case. Neerja Chowdhury, a political analyst, said the liquor policy case — in which several AAP leaders, including Kejriwal, went to jail — had dented Kejriwal's clean image. Kejriwal was arrested last year along with two key leaders of his party ahead of national elections on charges of receiving bribes from a liquor distributor. They have consistently denied the accusations, saying they are part of a political conspiracy. The Supreme Court allowed the release of Kejriwal and other ministers on bail. Kejriwal later relinquished the chief minister’s post to his most senior party leader. The BJP, which failed to secure a majority on its own in last year’s national election but formed the government with coalition partners, has gained some lost ground by winning two state elections in northern Haryana and western Maharashtra states. Modi’s party hopes to benefit after last week’s federal budget slashed income taxes on the salaried middle class, one of its key voting blocks. Opposition parties widely condemned Kejriwal’s arrest, accusing Modi’s government of misusing federal investigation agencies to harass and weaken political opponents, and pointed to several raids, arrests and corruption investigations of key opposition figures in the months before the national election. Kejriwal vowed to be an anti-corruption crusader and formed the AAP in 2012 after tapping into public anger against the then-Congress party government over a series of corruption scandals. His pro-poor policies have focused on fixing state-run schools and providing cheap electricity, free health care and bus transport for women. The BJP was voted out of power in Delhi in 1998 by the Congress party, which ran the government for 15 years. In the 2015 and 2020 elections in Delhi, the AAP won landslide victories.	https://www.voanews.com/a/india-pm-modi-s-party-seeks-to-oust-anti-corruption-crusader-in-new-delhi-state-elections-/7963530.html	2025-02-05T00:17:30-08:00	
Decorated pilot Harry Stewart, Jr., one of the last surviving Tuskegee Airmen, dies at 100	Retired Lt. Col. Harry Stewart Jr, a decorated World War II pilot who broke racial barriers as a Tuskegee Airmen and earned honors for his combat heroism, has died. He was 100. Stewart was one of the last surviving combat pilots of the famed 332nd Fighter Group also known as the Tuskegee Airmen. They were the nation’s first Black military pilots. The Tuskegee Airmen National Historical Museum confirmed his death. The organization said he died peacefully at his home in Bloomfield Hills, Michigan, on Sunday. Stewart earned the Distinguished Flying Cross for downing three German aircraft during a dogfight on April 1, 1945. He was also part of a team of four Tuskegee Airmen who won the U.S. Air Force Top Gun flying competition in 1949, although their accomplishment would not be recognized until decades later. 'Harry Stewart was a kind man of profound character and accomplishment with a distinguished career of service he continued long after fighting for our country in World War II,' Brian Smith, president and CEO of the Tuskegee Airmen National Historical Museum, said. Born on July 4, 1924, in Virginia, his family moved to New York when he was young. Stewart had dreamed of flying since he was a child when he would watch planes at LaGuardia airport, according to a book about his life titled 'Soaring to Glory: A Tuskegee Airmen’s Firsthand Account of World War II.' In the wake of Pearl Harbor, an 18-year-old Stewart joined what was then considered an experiment to train Black military pilots. The unit sometimes was also known as the Tuskegee Airmen for where they trained in Alabama or the Red Tails because of the red tips of their P-51 Mustangs. 'I did not recognize at the time the gravity of what we are facing. I just felt as though it was a duty of mine at the time. I just stood up to my duty,' Stewart said of World War II in a 2024 interview with CNN about the war. Having grown up in a multicultural neighborhood, the segregation and prejudice of the Jim Crow-era South came as a shock to Stewart, but he was determined to finish and earn his wings according to the book about his life. After finishing training, the pilots were assigned to escort U.S. bombers in Europe. The Tuskegee Airmen are credited with losing significantly fewer escorted bombers than other fighter groups. 'I got to really enjoy the idea of the panorama, I would say, of the scene I would see before me with the hundreds of bombers and the hundreds of fighter planes up there and all of them pulling the condensation trails, and it was just the ballet in the sky and a feeling of belonging to something that was really big,' Stewart said in a 2020 interview with WAMC. Stewart would sometimes say in a self-effacing way that he was too busy enjoying flying to realize he was making history, according to his book. Stewart had hoped to become a commercial airline pilot after he left the military, but was rejected because of his race. He went on to earn a mechanical engineering degree at New York University. He relocated to Detroit and retired as vice president of a natural gas pipeline company. Stewart told Michigan Public Radio in 2019 that he was moved to tears on a recent commercial flight when he saw who was piloting the aircraft. 'When I entered the plane, I looked into the cockpit there and there were two African American pilots. One was the co-pilot, and one was the pilot. But not only that, the thing that started bringing the tears to my eyes is that they were both female,' Stewart said. The Air Force last month briefly removed training courses with videos of its storied Tuskegee Airmen and the Women Airforce Service Pilots, or WASPs in an effort to comply with the Trump administration’s crackdown on diversity, equity and inclusion initiatives. The materials were quickly restored following a bipartisan backlash.	https://www.voanews.com/a/decorated-pilot-harry-stewart-jr-one-of-the-last-surviving-tuskegee-airmen-dies-at-100-/7963520.html	2025-02-04T23:49:26-08:00	
Trump says US will take ownership of war-torn Gaza	U.S. President Donald Trump said he wants the U.S. to take ownership of Gaza, moving beyond his earlier statements of forcing Gazans to relocate to neighboring Jordan and Egypt.

Trump says U.S. will take ownership of Gaza	WASHINGTON — U.S. President Donald Trump said he wants the United States to take ownership of Gaza, moving beyond his earlier statements of forcing Palestinians in the war-torn enclave to relocate to neighboring Jordan and Egypt. 'The U.S. will take over the Gaza Strip, and we will do a job with it, too,' he said during a joint press conference with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu at the White House Tuesday evening. In recent days hundreds of thousands of Palestinians in the southern parts of Gaza have marched north toward their homes after Israel allowed people to return as part of the ceasefire for a hostage release deal with Hamas. Trump said he wants to develop the area into what he calls 'the Riviera of the Middle East.' 'Everybody I've spoken to loves the idea of the United States owning that piece of land, developing and creating thousands of jobs with something that will be magnificent, in a really magnificent area,' he said. Netanyahu said one of his war goals is to ensure that Hamas never poses a threat to Israel again. But Trump, Netanyahu said, is 'taking it to a much higher level.' 'I think it’s something that could change history, and it’s worthwhile really pursuing this avenue,' he added. Trump did not share details on how he plans to exert control over the area ravaged by 15 months of war, but he did not rule out sending U.S. troops. 'If it’s necessary, we’ll do that. We’re going to take over that piece, and we’re going to develop it,' he said. Trump’s comments mark a remarkable shift from his criticism of America’s involvement in Middle East conflicts. He sees a 'long-term ownership position,' for the U.S. that would bring 'great stability to that part of the Middle East, and maybe the entire Middle East.' 'This was not a decision made lightly,' he said. However, any discussion of relocation will certainly be met with resistance from Palestinians. Hundreds of thousands were driven from their homes in what is now called Israel: in the 1948 war surrounding Israel’s creation and during Israel’s 1967 seizure of the West Bank and Gaza Strip. The Palestinian Authority and Arab League countries including Egypt, Jordan and Saudi Arabia earlier this month rejected Trump’s plans to relocate Palestinians. They warned that such plans 'threaten the region's stability, risk expanding the conflict, and undermine prospects for peace and coexistence among its peoples.' It’s unclear how occupying Gaza would fit into Trump’s own stated goal of expanding the Abraham Accords to include Riyadh. He brokered the deal that normalized ties between Israel and Arab countries in 2020. Saudi Arabia has publicly said it would only agree to recognize Israel, if the Gaza war ends and Palestinians have a path to statehood. Earlier Tuesday when asked whether the Saudis are demanding a Palestinian state, Trump said, 'No they're not.' Trump’s statement on Gaza is his latest signaling of expansionist ambitions, following his statements to acquire Greenland from Denmark, taking over the Panama Canal, and absorbing Canada. Ceasefire renegotiation Speaking to reporters at the White House earlier Tuesday, U.S. Middle East envoy Steve Witkoff said the administration has begun negotiations toward Phase 2 of the three-phase ceasefire-for-hostage-release deal, which includes the release of all remaining hostages held in Gaza, a permanent halt in fighting and Israel’s withdrawal from the territory. Hamas, a U.S.-designated terror group, has released 18 hostages so far, while Israel has freed hundreds of Palestinian prisoners. Witkoff suggested that the administration is considering renegotiating parts of the agreement that took effect on Jan. 19, the day before Trump was inaugurated. 'Part of the problem is that it wasn’t such a wonderful agreement that was first signed. That was not dictated by the Trump administration. We had nothing to do with it,' he said. 'Now we’re working within that rubric, and we’re figuring things out.' He doubled down on Trump’s suggestion to remove Gazans, saying that the five-year reconstruction plan for Gaza as outlined in phase three is 'physically impossible.' Trump’s insistence on relocating Gazans could signal a desire to renegotiate the ceasefire deal, particularly the second phase, said Ahmed Fouad Alkhatib, a senior fellow at the Atlantic Council. 'The goal might be to force Hamas into choosing between relinquishing control of Gaza or leaving the Strip if it wants an Israeli withdrawal or reconstruction, or risk the entirety of the population facing forcible removal, though how that would be carried out is unknown,' he told VOA. Also Tuesday, Trump ended support for the UN agency that helps Palestinian refugees and withdrew the U.S. from what he calls the antisemitic UN Human Rights Council. Iran nuclear Shortly before his meeting with Netanyahu, Trump directed his aides to restore his 'maximum pressure' campaign on Iran to prevent it from getting a nuclear weapon and to drive down its oil exports to zero. 'I'm unhappy to do it, but I really have not so much choice, because we have to be strong and firm, and I hope that it's not going to have to be used in any great measure at all,' he said. 'It's very simple. Iran cannot have a nuclear weapon.' As of September 2024, U.S. intelligence concluded in a report that Iran is not building a nuclear weapon. However, Iran has 'undertaken activities that better position it to produce one, if it so chooses,' the report said. In November, the Justice Department under the Biden administration announced that an Iranian plot to kill Trump before the presidential election had been thwarted. Trump said he has directed his aides to 'obliterate' Tehran if the Iranian regime moves to assassinate him. 'If they did that they would be obliterated,' Trump said. 'I’ve left instructions if they do it, they get obliterated, there won’t be anything left.' Pressure on Netanyahu Trump’s meeting with Netanyahu comes as the Israeli leader faces pressure from his right-wing coalition to end the ceasefire. Both Trump and Netanyahu share the goal of ending Hamas’ rule in Gaza and return the remaining Israeli hostages, said Jonathan Rynhold, head of the Department of Political Studies at Bar Ilan University. However, the two men place different priorities on different aspects of the goal. For Netanyahu, the priority is to ensure Hamas has no political future, Rynhold told VOA, while for Trump it’s to maintain the ceasefire 'so that he can move to an Israeli-Saudi Arabian normalization agreement.' U.S. administrations under Presidents George W. Bush to Joe Biden have stated their support for Palestinian statehood under the two-state solution. In 2020 during his first term, Trump announced his Middle East peace plan that would deny Palestinians having their own state. Trump was non-committal when asked Tuesday whether he supports the two-state solution. His plan on Gaza 'doesn't mean anything about a two-state or one-state or any other state,' he said. The war in Gaza began with the Oct. 7, 2023, Hamas attack that killed 1,200 people in Israel and took about 250 people hostage. Israel’s counteroffensive has killed more than 47,500 Palestinians, more than half of them women and children. Israel’s military says the death toll includes 17,000 Hamas militants.	https://www.voanews.com/a/trump-says-u-s-will-take-ownership-of-gaza/7963488.html	2025-02-04T20:55:16-08:00	
South Africa tests radioactivity in rhino horns to deter poachers	Scientists are testing a novel technique to deter poachers targeting endangered rhinoceros for their prized horns. As part of a pilot study in South Africa, researchers have injected small, radioactive pellets into the horns of live rhinos. The goal is to make the horns radioactive so there is less demand for them on the black market. Marize de Klerk reports from the UNESCO Waterberg Biosphere Reserve in South Africa.	https://www.voanews.com/a/south-africa-tests-radioactivity-in-rhino-horns-to-deter-poachers-/7963474.html	2025-02-04T20:42:19-08:00	
Senate confirms Pam Bondi as US attorney general	WASHINGTON — The Senate confirmed Pam Bondi as U.S. attorney general on Tuesday evening. The vote fell almost entirely along party lines, with only Sen. John Fetterman, a Pennsylvania Democrat, joining with all Republicans to pass her confirmation 54-46. Bondi, a former Florida attorney general and corporate lobbyist, is expected to oversee a radical reshaping of the department that has been the target of Trump's ire over the criminal cases it brought against him. She enters with the FBI, which she will oversee, in turmoil over the scrutiny of agents involved in investigations related to the president, who has made clear his desire to seek revenge on his perceived adversaries. Republicans have praised Bondi as a highly qualified leader they contend will bring much-needed change to a department they believe unfairly pursued Trump through investigations resulting in two indictments. 'Pam Bondi has promised to get the department back to its core mission: prosecuting crime and protecting Americans from threats to their safety and their freedoms,' said Senate Majority Leader John Thune, R-S.D. But Bondi has faced intense scrutiny over her close relationship with the president, who during his term fired an FBI director who refused to pledge loyalty to him and forced out an attorney general who recused himself from the Justice Department's investigation into potential ties between Russia and his 2016 presidential campaign. While Bondi has sought to reassure Democrats that politics would play no part in her decision-making, she also refused at her confirmation hearing last month to rule out potential investigations into Trump's adversaries. And she has repeated Trump's claims that the prosecutions against him amounted to political persecution, saying the Justice Department 'had been weaponized for years and years and years, and it's got to stop.' Bondi's confirmation vote came just hours after FBI agents sued the Justice Department over efforts to develop a list of employees involved in the January 6 prosecutions, which agents fear could be a precursor to mass firings. Acting Deputy Attorney General Emil Bove last week ordered the acting FBI director to provide the names, titles and offices of all FBI employees who worked on the January 6 cases — which Trump has described as a 'grave national injustice.' Bove, who defended Trump in his criminal cases before joining the administration, said Justice Department officials would carry out a 'review process to determine whether any additional personnel actions are necessary.' Justice Department officials have also recently forced out senior FBI executives, fired prosecutors on special counsel Jack Smith's team who investigated Trump and terminated a group of prosecutors in the District of Columbia’s U.S. attorney's office who were hired to help with the massive Jan. 6 investigation. Bondi repeatedly stressed at her confirmation hearing that she would not pursue anyone for political reasons, and vowed that the public, not the president, would be her client. But her answers at times echoed Trump's campaign rhetoric about a politicized justice system.	https://www.voanews.com/a/senate-confirms-pam-bondi-as-us-attorney-general/7963471.html	2025-02-04T20:07:15-08:00	
High threat' undocumented migrants sent to Guantanamo	PENTAGON — A small number of migrants were transferred from Texas to a detention facility in Guantanamo Bay, Cuba, on Tuesday via U.S. military aircraft, U.S. defense officials told VOA. Fewer than 20 migrants, which the administration has deemed to be 'high threat,' are being transported on the first C-17 flight from Fort Bliss, one defense official said, speaking to VOA on background, a method often used by U.S. officials to remain anonymous, before the flight landed in Cuba. U.S. Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem on Tuesday posted photos on X of some of the migrants as they prepared to board the military cargo plane, calling them 'the worst of the worst,' and warning the effort to deport them is just getting started. The Department of Homeland Security later said all of the migrants on the military flight from Texas to Guantanamo Bay were members of Tren de Aragua, a Venezuelan street gang with transnational reach. Officials did not say when or how they were first taken into custody. The White House has announced plans to designate Tren de Aragua as a Foreign Terrorist Organization. Since President Donald Trump's executive order last month, the Pentagon has deployed 300 Marines to Guantanamo to expand the facilities to support holding operations for undocumented immigrants. According to media reports, they have set up tents to house the migrants inside a fenced area at a separate part of the naval base. Those facilities are not yet ready for migrants, according to Fox News. 'The number of service members will continue to fluctuate as additional forces are tasked to deploy and will be scaled, based on the requirements of the Department of Homeland Security, which is the lead federal agency,' U.S. Southern Command, which overseas operations in South America, Central America and the Caribbean, announced in a statement on Monday. The migrants who arrived Tuesday will be held at the U.S. detention facility, according to a U.S. official who spoke on background. The facility is known mostly for housing military prisoners and terror suspects, including those involved in the September 11, 2001, attacks and members of the Taliban. 'If you're a violent gang banger, and you've been taken out of our country, and we're waiting to bring you to your country, we're going to put you in a cell box built for al-Qaida,' Secretary of Defense Pete Hegseth told Fox News this week. In his executive order last month, Trump instructed the departments of Defense and Homeland Security to prepare the U.S. naval base to hold up to 30,000 migrants. 'Some of them are so bad we don't even trust the countries to hold them because we don't want them coming back. So, we're going to send them out to Guantanamo,' Trump said. Closing Guantanamo Democratic administrations under Barack Obama and Joe Biden had sought to close the detention camp, which was built by the George W. Bush administration in 2002 following the U.S. invasion of Afghanistan that began shortly after the 9/11 attacks of 2001. Sue Hendrickson, president and CEO of Human Rights First, said in a statement that sending migrants to Guantanamo would create a human rights catastrophe. 'The Trump administration may find the symbolism of sending migrants to Guantanamo darkly appealing; its practical result would be more injustice, waste and self-inflicted loss of credibility,' Hendrickson said. At its height during the Global War on Terror, the detention facility held about 680 prisoners. As of January 6, there were just 15 detainees at the facility, according to the Pentagon. Before being used to detain terror suspects, the U.S. naval facility was also used to house migrants from Cuba and Haiti in the early 1990s.	https://www.voanews.com/a/high-threat-undocumented-migrants-sent-to-guantanamo/7963451.html	2025-02-04T19:36:11-08:00	
Analysts: American Iron Dome reduces nuclear coercion but drives arms race	WASHINGTON — U.S. President Donald Trump’s order to build an American version of the Iron Dome to shield the U.S. from aerial attacks will deter China and Russia from coercing the U.S. using nuclear weapons but could drive a three-way arms race, said analysts. The U.S. government’s Missile Defense Agency on Friday asked the defense industry to identify technologies and capabilities available to construct the Iron Dome for America. The deadline is the end of February. It made the request in response to Trump’s executive order signed on Jan. 27, setting forth a motion to build an American Iron Dome. 'The United States will provide for the common defense of its citizens and the Nation by deploying and maintaining a next-generation missile defense shield,' the executive order stated. The American Iron Dome will defend the U.S. 'against ballistic, hypersonic, advanced cruise missiles, and other next-generation aerial attacks from peer, near-peer, and rogue adversaries,' according to the statement. It will ensure the U.S. has 'its second-strike capability,' meaning it would be able to launch nuclear retaliation. The Iron Dome would also include a review of missile defense posture to identify ways for U.S. allies and partners to increase cooperation on missile defense development and operations. Trump ordered Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth to draw up a plan in the next three months to build the missile shield. Strengthening deterrence Robert Peters, research fellow for Nuclear Deterrence and Missile Defense at the Heritage Foundation, said on Thursday via phone, the Iron Dome for America 'will take away the option for nuclear coercion that an actor could try to hold over the U.S.' in addition to defending the U.S. from an actual strike. 'It is feasible for us to build an Iron Dome,' he said, 'and there is no reason why we should not do so, particularly given that we are seeing the autocrats in North Korea, China, and Russia engaging in nuclear coercion.' Russian President Vladimir Putin has threatened to use nuclear weapons multiple times during an ongoing war in Ukraine that began with its invasion in 2022. In November, Putin revised the Russian threshold for using nuclear weapons in a doctrine issued after former U.S. President Joe Biden allowed Ukraine to strike targets inside Russia with U.S.-made longer-range missiles. The doctrine announced that Russia has the right to use nuclear weapons to respond to a conventional weapons attack. Previously, Russia reserved the right to use nuclear weapons only when an attack threatened its existence. Patrycja Bazylczyk, a research associate for the Missile Defense Project at the Center for Strategic and International Studies, said, 'If implemented well, an ‘iron dome for America’ could bolster American defense and affect the strategic calculus of our adversaries.' She told VOA on Monday, 'Improving homeland air and missile defenses reduces the confidence of a potential attacker, thereby raising the threshold for attack and contributing to deterrence.' The Iron Dome plan resembles former President Ronald Reagon's proposed dual objective of Strategic Defense Initiative (SDI) and nuclear disarmament, said Hans Kristensen, the director of the Nuclear Information Project at the Federation of American Scientists (FAS). The SDI, also came to be called Star Wars, was announced in 1983 to develop a space-based defense system to protect the U.S. from nuclear missiles. Risk of arms race Trump's 'Iron Dome initiative, to some extent, echoes his concern about nuclear weapons,' but 'a stronger U.S. missile defense system would almost certainly make it more difficult to reach a nuclear agreement with Russia and China because of their concern that more effective missile defenses would increase the threat to their nuclear retaliatory capability,' continued Kristensen. Trump said in a video message to the World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland, on Jan. 23 that he wants to discuss 'denuclearization' with Russia, and that China would need to come along. Kristensen told VOA on Thursday that 'FAS applauds Trump's remarks about the need for nuclear limits and eventually denuclearization and urge the administration to pursue these goals.' He added, 'Nuclear deterrence can be maintained with far fewer nuclear weapons' and having nuclear reduction talks is 'urgent because the New START treaty expires in about one year.' The New Strategic Arms Reduction Treaty (New START), a nuclear arms reduction treaty between the U.S. and Russia, is set to expire in February 2026. Daryl Kimball, executive director of Arms Control Association, told VOA on Friday Trump envisions 'more ambitious system to thwart strategic missile attacks by Russia or China' than his efforts in 2019. 'It is not realistic to believe that an effective system would be feasible anytime soon, if ever, mainly because adversaries will respond by seeking to overwhelm missile defense systems in order to maintain their own capacity to deter U.S. conventional or nuclear attack,' he said. Kimball added, however, 'We welcome Trump's interest in negotiating agreements with Russia and China to reduce the 'tremendous' costs of nuclear weapons by reducing or 'denuclearizing' with Russia and China. Without such a deal, we could see a costly three-way offensive nuclear arms races that no one can win.' The U.S. has about 5,044 nuclear warheads while Russia has over, 5,500 and China has approximately 500 nuclear warheads, according to the FAS. The Pentagon in its annual report released in December on China's military estimates that China will have more than 1,000 operational nuclear warheads by 2030. North Korea, through its state-run KCNA, on Monday expressed opposition to the U.S. plan to build the Iron Dome, describing it as a 'hegemonic attempt to maintain its military supremacy.' The Chinese Embassy in Washington told VOA on Monday that it does not have any comments on the issue at this time. A top Russia diplomat quoted by the state news agency Tass on Thursday said America’s Iron Dome 'puts an end to the prospects of strategic offensive arms reduction on nuclear and missile arsenals in favor of their quantitative and qualitative increase.' Richard Weitz, director for the Center for Political-Military Analysis at Hudson Institute, said, 'The Russians and Chinese have always said that if the U.S. builds better defenses, they’re going to build better offenses so they can overcome these defenses.' He told VOA on Thursday, the Iron Dome effort, along with Trump’s interest in having nuclear reduction talks with China and Russia, aims to reduce overall threats to the U.S., but it would be difficult to get China on board denuclearization talks.	https://www.voanews.com/a/analysts-american-iron-dome-reduces-nuclear-coercion-but-drives-arms-race/7963461.html	2025-02-04T19:26:52-08:00	
US judge blocks Trump from sending transgender women to men's prisons	WASHINGTON — A U.S. judge on Tuesday blocked President Donald Trump's administration from moving transgender women to men's prisons and ending their gender-affirming care. In a broad ruling temporarily halting an executive order that Trump, a Republican, signed on his first day back in office on Jan. 20, U.S. District Judge Royce Lamberth in Washington found that three transgender inmates who sued would likely succeed in arguing the policy was unconstitutional. The decision marked the second time that a federal judge had sided with LGBTQ+ legal rights groups who sued to prevent the U.S. Bureau of Prisons from implementing the order. Lamberth's order applies to all 16 transgender women currently housed in federal women's prisons. It goes further than a Jan. 26 decision by a federal judge in Boston blocking prison officials from transferring an individual transgender woman to a men's facility. A spokesperson for the Justice Department, which defended the Trump administration in court, declined to comment. The Bureau of Prisons did not immediately respond to a request for comment. The three transgender women who brought the Washington case argued transgender women would face violence and sexual assault in men's prisons, which would violate their right to not be subjected to cruel and unusual punishment as guaranteed by the Eighth Amendment to the U.S. Constitution. U.S. Justice Department attorney John Robinson had argued that the Bureau of Prisons has broad authority to make inmate placement decisions. He urged Lamberth, an appointee of Republican President Ronald Reagan, to wait for the agency to revise its policies before issuing any order compelling the continuation of medical treatment. In his decision, Lamberth wrote that the government did not dispute the plaintiffs' assertion that transgender persons were at a higher risk of physical and sexual violence than other inmates when housed in a facility corresponding to their biological sex. Trump's executive order directed the federal government to only recognize two, biologically distinct sexes, male and female; house transgender women in men's prisons; and cease funding for any gender-affirming medical care for inmates. Prior to Trump's order, the Bureau of Prisons had been operating under guidelines adopted in 2022 during Democratic former President Joe Biden's tenure requiring prisons to consider inmates' 'current gender expression' when deciding where to house them. Biden's policy was a reversal from earlier guidance during Trump's first term. The lawsuit filed on Jan. 30 also argued that Trump's executive order discriminates against transgender people on the basis of sex in violation of the U.S. Constitution's Fifth Amendment. About 2,230 transgender inmates are housed in federal custodial facilities and halfway houses, according to the U.S. Department of Justice. About two thirds of them, 1,506, are transgender women, most of whom are housed in men's prisons.	https://www.voanews.com/a/us-judge-blocks-trump-from-sending-transgender-women-to-men-s-prisons/7963446.html	2025-02-04T18:48:03-08:00	
Trump takes aim at new South African land expropriation law	WHITE HOUSE — President Donald Trump has taken aim at a new South African law meant to address the nation’s apartheid legacy of racially unequal land distribution, threatening to withdraw funding, including to the world’s largest HIV treatment program. Africa observers told VOA on Tuesday that some members of the U.S. Congress have jumped on this grievance to 'upend the status quo in U.S.-South Africa relations as a response.' Trump fired the first volley Sunday night, in a post on his social media site. 'South Africa is confiscating land, and treating certain classes of people VERY BADLY,' Trump wrote. He continued to describe the situation as 'a massive Human Rights VIOLATION, at a minimum.' South African politicians — both the supporters and the opponents of the newly inked Expropriation Act that Trump was referring to — quickly fired back at his description of the new law, which repeals apartheid-era legislation to align land distribution with the nation’s progressive constitution. Under the apartheid system, laws such as the 1913 Natives Land Act severely restricted Black land ownership. Other now-defunct laws determined where members of the nation’s Black majority could travel or live, what public facilities they could use, and whom they could marry. Apartheid also denied full citizenship rights to Black people until its fall in the early 1990s. Black people first gained the right to vote in the 1994 elections that ushered in democratic rule. 'South Africa, like the United States of America and other countries, has always had expropriation laws that balance the need for public usage of land and the protection of rights of property owners,' South African President Cyril Ramaphosa said in a statement this week. 'We look forward to engaging with the Trump administration over our land reform policy and issues of bilateral interest. We are certain that out of those engagements, we will share a better and common understanding over these matters.' The new law allows for limited cases of land expropriation without compensation, and that clause alone provoked years of public consultations and debate in South African parliament and civil society before it was adopted recently by the nation’s newly sworn-in coalition government. In her article on the website The Conversation, law professor Zsa-Zsa Temmers Boggenpoel of Stellenbosch University explained the move as 'a potential tool to reduce land inequality.' 'This has become a matter of increasing urgency,' she wrote. 'South Africans have expressed impatience with the slow pace of land reform.' A government land audit in 2017 found that 72% of the country's farms and agricultural holdings were white-owned. 'I am not convinced that the act, in its current form, is the silver bullet to effect large-scale land reform — at least not the type of radical land reform that South Africa urgently needs,' Boggenpoel wrote. 'Understandably, the act will have a severe impact on property rights. But it still substantially protects landowners affected by expropriation. Only in very limited cases would they not be compensated.' South Africa's opposition parties stood against the new law. After the bill was signed last month, opposition party ActionSA , which vowed to pursue legal action, said in a statement, 'While other parties assert that this bill does not compromise the ‘willing buyer, willing seller doctrine,’ it ultimately allows the government to unilaterally set the price if an agreement cannot be reached.' The center-right Democratic Alliance party not only strenuously opposed the new law — along with ActionSA and the pro-Afrikaner Freedom Front Plus party — it also objected to Trump’s characterization, calling it 'unfortunate.' 'It would be a tragedy if this funding were terminated because of a misunderstanding of the facts,' the party said in a statement. It continued: 'It is not true that the Act allows land to be seized by the state arbitrarily, and it does require fair compensation for legitimate expropriations in terms of Section 25 of the Constitution.' But these nuances may not be seized upon by the U.S. Congress, which has bristled at some of Pretoria’s moves — not least, the nation’s decision to pursue a genocide case against Israel at the U.N.’s highest court, said Michael Walsh, an Africa analyst at the Foreign Policy Research Institute, The U.S. strenuously opposed South Africa’s petition to the court in late 2023, with the White House telling VOA the case was 'without merit.' 'My key takeaway was [Trump's] reference to massive human rights violations,' Walsh told VOA. 'That terminology will play into the hands of those interest groups who have been pushing for Magnitsky sanctions to be imposed on ANC and EFF officials prior to the G20 Johannesburg Summit,' he added, referring to the African National Congress, Ramaphosa's party, and the far-left Economic Freedom Fighters. The 2012 Magnitsky Act allows the U.S. to impose sanctions on human rights violators. 'Many South African experts have assumed that any Magnitsky sanctions would be based on acts of corruption,' Walsh said. 'However, members of Congress are considering Magnitsky sanctions on the grounds of human rights violations as well.' This all sets up the scene, he said, for a diplomatic showdown when world leaders converge in Johannesburg in November for the summit of G20 nations. Host nation South Africa has set the agenda for that meeting of the world’s top 20 economies to include two issues that don’t jibe with Trump’s isolationist, pro-energy exploration, America-first approach: mobilizing climate financing and increasing debt relief for developing countries.	https://www.voanews.com/a/trump-takes-aim-at-new-south-african-land-expropriation-law/7963443.html	2025-02-04T18:41:26-08:00	
US Treasury says Musk team has 'read-only access' to payment data	WASHINGTON — The U.S. Treasury said on Tuesday that Elon Musk's government-efficiency team has been granted 'read-only access' to its payment system codes and denied that this cut off any government payments including for Social Security or Medicare. The confirmation of a Musk associate's access to the system codes came in a letter from a Treasury official to Democratic Senator Ron Wyden. The letters said the review was being undertaken to 'maximize payment integrity for agencies and the public.' Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent has not commented on reports in recent days that Musk's informal Department of Government Efficiency had gained access to the system responsible for disbursing more than $6 trillion of annual government spending. Several thousand people gathered outside the Treasury on Tuesday to protest DOGE's Treasury access amid his sweeping incursion into government operations, which this week led to the shutdown of the U.S. Agency for International Development, merging its aid mission into the State Department. The payment system review 'is not resulting in the suspension or rejection of any payment instructions submitted to Treasury by other federal agencies across the government,' Jonathan Blum, principal deputy assistant secretary in the Office of Legislative Affairs wrote to Senator Ron Wyden of Oregon. The DOGE team at Treasury conducting the review is led by technology firm chief executive Tom Krause, whom the letter described as a 'Treasury employee.' Krause is CEO of Cloud Software Group, which owns former independent software firms Citrix and Tibco. Wyden raised alarms over the weekend when reports first surfaced that a team under the direction of Musk, appointed by President Donald Trump to conduct a broad review of government operations, was at the Treasury. 'I'm sure the Treasury Secretary and the president want to save face and downplay the risks as Elon Musk seizes power, but nothing they're saying is believable or trustworthy,' Wyden said in response to Blum's letter. Outside the Treasury, protesters waved placards with slogans including: 'Nobody Elected Musk' and 'Bessent, you have 1 job!! Protect our money. You already failed.' About three dozen Democratic members of the Senate and House of Representatives tried to enter the Treasury to confront Bessent on the issue but they said they were denied access. Rebecca Weiss, who lives in suburban Maryland, told Reuters that she attended the protest because she is worried about what Musk will do with the payments data. 'He's obviously a data guy, and now he has access, potentially, to everybody's personal identifiable information, which he might take advantage of for his business purposes,' she said. 'The bottom line is, we didn't elect him.'	https://www.voanews.com/a/us-treasury-says-musk-team-has-read-only-access-to-payment-data-/7963412.html	2025-02-04T18:15:15-08:00	
Trump reimposes 'maximum pressure' on Iran, aims to drive oil exports to zero	WASHINGTON — U.S. President Donald Trump on Tuesday restored his 'maximum pressure' campaign on Iran that includes efforts to drive its oil exports down to zero in order to stop Tehran from obtaining a nuclear weapon. Ahead of his meeting with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, Trump signed the presidential memorandum reimposing Washington's tough policy on Iran that was practiced throughout his first term. As he signed the memo, Trump described it as very tough and said he was torn on whether to make the move. He said he was open to a deal with Iran and expressed a willingness to talk to the Iranian leader. 'With me, it's very simple: Iran cannot have a nuclear weapon,' Trump said. Asked how close Tehran is to a weapon, Trump said: 'They're too close.' Iran's mission to the United Nations in New York did not immediately respond to a request for comment. Iran is accelerating enrichment of uranium to up to 60% purity, close to the roughly 90% weapons-grade level, the U.N. nuclear watchdog chief told Reuters in December. Iran has denied wanting to develop a nuclear weapon. Trump's memo, among other things, orders the U.S. Treasury secretary to impose 'maximum economic pressure' on Iran, including sanctions and enforcement mechanisms on those violating existing sanctions. It also directs the Treasury and State Department to implement a campaign aimed at 'driving Iran's oil exports to zero.' U.S. oil prices pared losses on Tuesday on the news that Trump planned to sign the memo. Tehran's oil exports brought in $53 billion in 2023 and $54 billion a year earlier, according to U.S. Energy Information Administration estimates. Output during 2024 was running at its highest level since 2018, based on OPEC data. Trump had driven Iran's oil exports to near-zero during part of his first term after re-imposing sanctions. They rose under Biden's tenure as Iran succeeded in evading sanctions. The Paris-based International Energy Agency believes Saudi Arabia, the United Arab Emirates and other OPEC members have spare capacity to make up for any lost exports from Iran, also an OPEC member. China does not recognize U.S. sanctions and Chinese firms buy the most Iranian oil. China and Iran have also built a trading system that uses mostly Chinese yuan and a network of middlemen, avoiding the dollar and exposure to U.S. regulators. Kevin Book, an analyst at ClearView Energy, said the Trump administration could enforce the 2024 Stop Harboring Iranian Petroleum (SHIP) law to curtail some Iranian barrels. SHIP, which the Biden administration did not enforce strictly, allows measures on foreign ports and refineries that process petroleum exported from Iran in violation of sanctions. Book said a move last month by the Shandong Port Group to ban U.S.-sanctioned tankers from calling into its ports in the eastern Chinese province signals the impact SHIP could have. Trump also directed his U.N. ambassador to work with allies to 'complete the snapback of international sanctions and restrictions on Iran,' under a 2015 deal between Iran and key world powers that lifted sanctions on Tehran in return for restrictions on its nuclear program. Britain, France and Germany told the United Nations Security Council in December that they are ready — if necessary — to trigger a snapback of all international sanctions on Iran to prevent the country from acquiring a nuclear weapon. They will lose the ability to take such action on October 18 when a 2015 U.N. resolution expires. The resolution enshrines Iran's deal with Britain, Germany, France, the United States, Russia and China that lifted sanctions on Tehran in exchange for restrictions on its nuclear program. Iran's U.N. ambassador, Amir Saeid Iravani, has said that invoking the 'snap-back' of sanctions on Tehran would be 'unlawful and counterproductive.' European and Iranian diplomats met in November and January to discuss if they could work to defuse regional tensions, including over Tehran's nuclear program, before Trump returned.	https://www.voanews.com/a/trump-reimposes-maximum-pressure-on-iran-aims-to-drive-oil-exports-to-zero/7963388.html	2025-02-04T17:31:54-08:00	
Former Google engineer faces new US charges he stole AI secrets for Chinese companies	U.S. prosecutors on Tuesday unveiled an expanded 14-count indictment accusing former Google software engineer Linwei Ding of stealing artificial intelligence trade secrets to benefit two Chinese companies he was secretly working for. Ding, 38, a Chinese national, was charged by a federal grand jury in San Francisco with seven counts each of economic espionage and theft of trade secrets. Each economic espionage charge carries a maximum 15-year prison term and $5 million fine, while each trade secrets charge carries a maximum 10-year term and $250,000 fine. The defendant, also known as Leon Ding, was indicted last March on four counts of theft of trade secrets. He is free on bond. His lawyers did not immediately respond to requests for comment. Ding's case was coordinated through an interagency Disruptive Technology Strike Force created in 2023 by the Biden administration. The initiative was designed to help stop advanced technology from being acquired by countries such as China and Russia or potentially threatening national security. Prosecutors said Ding stole information about the hardware infrastructure and software platform that lets Google's supercomputing data centers train large AI models. Some of the allegedly stolen chip blueprints were meant to give Google an edge over cloud computing rivals Amazon and Microsoft, which design their own, and reduce Google's reliance on chips from Nvidia. Prosecutors said Ding joined Google in May 2019 and began his thefts three years later when he was being courted to join an early-stage Chinese technology company. Ding allegedly uploaded more than 1,000 confidential files by May 2023 and later circulated a PowerPoint presentation to employees of a China startup he founded, saying that country's policies encouraged development of a domestic AI industry. Google was not charged and has said it cooperated with law enforcement. According to court records describing a December 18 hearing, prosecutors and defense lawyers discussed a 'potential resolution' to Ding's case, 'but anticipate the matter proceeding to trial.' The case is U.S. v. Ding, U.S. District Court, Northern District of California, No. 24-cr-00141.	https://www.voanews.com/a/former-google-engineer-faces-new-us-charges-he-stole-ai-secrets-for-chinese-companies-/7963387.html	2025-02-04T17:18:06-08:00	
VOA Kurdish: Fake stock exchange scams steal millions from Kurdistan region	Millions of dollars have been taken from people in the Kurdistan Region through fake stock exchange companies. According to Mohammed Hussein from the Iraqi Economists Network, some websites were created to trade commodities internationally, but they were scams that stole people's money. Experts say the lack of laws to regulate online trading in Iraq and Kurdistan has allowed these scams to grow. Many people without financial experience invest in the stock market and lose large amounts of money, while some companies sell far more than their actual value.

Syria's Sharaa meets with Turkey's Erdogan	Syria's new interim leader Ahmed al-Sharaa on Tuesday met with Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan in Ankara, where they discussed improved security ties and how to respond to Kurdish fighters in northeastern Syria. Sharra flew into Turkey from Saudi Arabia where he sought Riyadh's funding to rebuild Syria after a devastating 13-year civil war. After meeting with Sharaa, Erdogan said, 'I would like to express our satisfaction for the strong commitment my brother Ahmed al-Sharaa has shown in the fight against terrorism.' As leader of Hayat Tahrir al-Sham, or HTS — long considered a terrorist group by U.S. officials — Sharaa led a campaign in December to wrest control of Damascus from ex-President Bashar al-Assad, whose flight to Russia ended more than a half-century of oppressive rule by Bashar and his late father, Hafez. Turkey was a solid ally to the forces seeking to oust Assad, including Sharaa and HTS. Among the topics discussed in Tuesday's meeting were the Syrian Kurdish militias in northeastern Syria, where U.S.-backed Syrian Democratic Forces (SDF) have been fighting Turkish-backed forces. Turkey shares a 910-kilometer border with Syria and wants the SDF, which Turkey views as an extension of the outlawed Kurdistan Workers, disbanded and removed from border regions. Syria's new rulers are reported to have called on SDF to relinquish their weapons. In an Associated Press report, SDF commander Mazloun Abdi said he recently met with Sharaa in Damascus and that negotiations are underway with mediators to find answers regarding the future of Syrian Kurds. In addition, Turkey has also called for the removal of Islamic State militants in Syria. Erdogan said he told Sharaa that Turkey is 'ready to provide the necessary support to Syria in the fight against all kinds of terrorism.' Also Tuesday, Syria's new leader invited Turkey's president to visit Syria 'at the earliest opportunity.' Sharaa also thanked Turkey for taking in millions of Syrians who fled their homeland during the civil war. He said Syria would 'never forget [Turkey's] historic stance.' 'That significant support is still tangible through Turkey's ongoing efforts to ensure the success of the current leadership in Syria, politically and economically,' Sharaa said. Some information was provided from the Associated Press and Agence France-Presse.	https://www.voanews.com/a/syria-s-sharaa-meets-with-turkey-s-erdogan/7963366.html	2025-02-04T16:54:58-08:00	
Trump orders target several UN bodies	WASHINGTON — U.S. President Donald Trump on Tuesday stopped U.S. engagement with the U.N. Human Rights Council, extended a halt to funding for the Palestinian relief agency UNRWA and ordered a review of the U.N. cultural agency UNESCO. 'It's got great potential and based on the potential we'll continue to go along with it, but they got to get their act together,' Trump told reporters. 'It's not being well run, to be honest and they're not doing the job. 'A lot of these conflicts that we're working on should be settled, or at least we should have some help in settling them. We never seem to get help. That should be the primary purpose of the United Nations,' the U.S. president said. U.N. spokesperson Stephane Dujarric said, 'From day one, U.S. support for the United Nations has saved countless lives and advanced global security.' 'The secretary-general looks forward to continuing his productive relationship with President Trump and the U.S. government to strengthen that relationship in today's turbulent world.' Trump said that he was not looking to take away money from the 193-member world body, though he complained that Washington had to pay a disproportionate amount. Washington is the U.N.'s largest contributor - followed by China - accounting for 22% of the core U.N. budget and 27% of the peacekeeping budget. The U.N. has said the U.S. currently owes a total of $2.8 billion, of which $1.5 billion is for the regular budget. These payments are not voluntary. UNRWA Trump's order on Tuesday was largely symbolic and mirrored moves he made during his first term in office, from 2017-2021. Since taking office for a second term on Jan. 20, Trump has ordered the U.S. to withdraw from the World Health Organization and from the Paris climate agreement - also steps he took during his first term in office. The U.S. was UNRWA's biggest donor - providing $300 million-$400 million a year - but former President Joe Biden paused funding in January 2024 after Israel accused about a dozen UNRWA staff of taking part in the deadly Oct. 7, 2023, attack by Palestinian militants Hamas that triggered the war in Gaza. The U.S. Congress then formally suspended contributions to UNRWA until at least March 2025. UNRWA provides aid, health and education services to millions of Palestinians in Gaza, the West Bank, including East Jerusalem, Syria, Lebanon and Jordan. The United Nations has said that nine UNRWA staff may have been involved in the Oct. 7, 2023, attack and were fired. A Hamas commander in Lebanon - killed in September by Israel - was also found to have had a UNRWA job. The U.N. has vowed to investigate all accusations made and repeatedly asked Israel for evidence, which it says has not been provided. Human Rights Council The first Trump administration also quit the 47-member Human Rights Council halfway through a three-year term over what it called chronic bias against Israel and a lack of reform. The U.S. is not currently a member of the Geneva-based body. Under Biden, the U.S. was re-elected and served a 2022-2024 term. A council working group is due to review the U.S. human rights record later this year, a process all countries undergo every few years. While the council has no legally binding power, its debates carry political weight and criticism can raise global pressure on governments to change course. Trump's executive order on Tuesday also asks Secretary of State Marco Rubio to review and report back to him on international organizations, conventions, or treaties that 'promote radical or anti-American sentiment.' He specified that the U.N. Education, Scientific and Cultural Organization (UNESCO) should be reviewed first because Washington had previously accused it of anti-Israel bias.	https://www.voanews.com/a/trump-orders-target-several-un-bodies/7963365.html	2025-02-04T16:45:26-08:00	
Congressional Democrats to Trump: Changes can't be done in secrecy	Congressional Democratic leadership warned President Donald Trump on Tuesday that they would use upcoming government funding talks as leverage to fight the administration's changes in U.S. government agencies. Democrats' warnings come as the Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE), led by Elon Musk, moved the U.S. Agency for International Development (USAID) under the control of the U.S. State Department earlier this week. The administration has said they are reviewing USAID’s foreign assistance activities to 'ensure it is in alignment with an America First agenda.' 'Whatever DOGE is doing, it's not democracy,' Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer told reporters Tuesday. 'We know what democracy looks like. It's out in the open. It's not secret.' Democrats could push back on some of the most recent changes in the U.S. government by withholding votes on a new spending bill. A short-term continuing resolution keeping the government running is set to expire on March 14. On Monday, congressional Democrats protested outside closed USAID offices, saying the Trump administration had overreached its authority. 'If you want to change an agency, introduce a bill and pass a law,' Democratic Senator Brian Schatz said. 'You cannot wave away an agency that you don't like or that you disagree with by executive order, or by literally storming into the building and taking over the servers. That is not how the American system of government works.' USAID manages tens of billions of dollars in U.S. foreign assistance programs. 'The Constitution requires that the funding be spent by the president and the administration,' House Democratic Leader Hakeem Jeffries said Tuesday. 'The Constitution requires the president has a responsibility to take care that the laws are faithfully executed. Spending agreements passed through the appropriations process are law, and when those laws are violated, the Constitution is being violated, which is why there has been a flurry of righteous litigation that has been unleashed.' Congressional Republicans have expressed support for attempts to weed out fraud and abuse in the U.S. aid system. 'I don't think they're closing an agency, but I do think they have the right to review funding and how those decisions are made and what priorities are being funded,' Senate Majority Leader John Thune told reporters Tuesday. 'I think that's probably true of any administration. When they come in, there are lots of programs authorized and funded through that agency, some which I think are operating the way in which they were intended, some which aren't.' The White House criticized USAID-funded projects supporting diversity, equity and inclusion (DEI) initiatives and other efforts it argues are a waste of taxpayer funds. 'If there's massive fraud, if the funds aren't being directed to where the Congress has appropriated and the president has signed, then we need to know about that,' Roger Wicker, the Senate Armed Services chairman, told American news networks CNN and CBS Monday. 'I have felt for a long time that USAID is our way to combat the Belt and Road Initiative, which is China's effort to really gain influence around the world, including Africa and South America and the Western Hemisphere,' Wicker continued. 'So we need an aid program to match the Chinese effort, but it needs to be done in a way that the policymakers of the United States have decided ought to be done.' Schumer said Tuesday he's supportive of efforts to eliminate fraud and abuse but criticized the speed and secrecy of the process.	https://www.voanews.com/a/congressional-democrats-to-trump-changes-can-t-be-done-in-secrecy-/7963362.html	2025-02-04T16:32:18-08:00

Rubio pledges US support for Costa Rica's fight against cyberattacks, drug trafficking	STATE DEPARTMENT — Secretary of State Marco Rubio on Tuesday pledged U.S. support to bolster Costa Rica's cybersecurity defenses, 5G telecommunications infrastructure, and its battle against narcotics. Rubio made the statement at a joint press conference with Costa Rican President Rodrigo Chaves, whose Central American nation faces more than 100 million cyberattacks annually. 'It's very serious — 110 million cyberattacks a year for a country of this size — it's extraordinary, and they have faced it very bravely,' Rubio told reporters in San Jose, Costa Rica's capital. In late 2024, local media reported that Costa Rican officials, in collaboration with the U.S. Embassy, identified cyber intrusions by criminal groups in China targeting the country's telecommunications and technology system, an allegation the Chinese Embassy in Costa Rica denied. In August 2023, Chaves issued a decree regulating 5G mobile network development, limiting involvement to companies based in signatory-states to the Budapest Convention on Cybercrime — an international treaty addressing cybercrime. San Jose should be lauded for being 'very firm,' Rubio said, against companies 'backed by governments like the government of China that likes to threaten, that likes to sabotage, that likes to use economic coercion to punish you.' VOA has reached out to the Chinese Embassy in Washington for comment but has not yet received a response. US aid waiver Rubio also vowed that Washington wouldn't 'eliminate foreign aid' but prioritize assistance for trusted partners and allies. He pledged continued cooperation with Costa Rica, offering FBI and Drug Enforcement Administration support to investigate drug trafficking to the U.S. 'We issued a waiver today because Costa Rica' has used U.S. aid effectively to fix problems that also benefit the United States, Rubio said. 'They're stopping drugs, they're stopping criminals, they're identifying terrorists.' The State Department's Office of Foreign Assistance has not responded to VOA's inquiry for further details on the waiver. Rubio's five-nation tour across Central America and the Caribbean marks his first major diplomatic mission as secretary of state, with key priorities including curbing illegal immigration into the U.S. and combating drug trafficking. On Tuesday afternoon, the secretary arrived in Guatemala following discussions with leaders from Panama, El Salvador and Costa Rica. He is scheduled to travel to the Dominican Republic on Wednesday.	https://www.voanews.com/a/rubio-pledges-us-support-for-costa-rica-s-fight-against-cyberattacks-drug-trafficking-/7963015.html	2025-02-04T14:21:34-08:00

Nigeria announces measures to soften impact of USAID programs' suspension	Abuja, Nigeria — Nigerian officials have launched a committee to develop a transition and sustainability plan for USAID-funded health programs following U.S. President Donald Trump’s 90-day halt of most foreign aid. The multi-ministerial committee aims to secure new financial support for critical health programs. Nigeria’s health minister said the committee—comprising officials from the ministries of finance, health, and environment—intends to ensure that patients receiving treatment for HIV, tuberculosis, and malaria do not experience setbacks amid the uncertainty over U.S. foreign policy. Shortly after taking office two weeks ago, U.S. President Donald Trump ordered a 90-day pause on U.S. foreign aid. But days later, he approved a temporary waiver for life-saving humanitarian assistance, covering medicine, medical services, food, and shelter. Despite the exemption, concerns remain over the future of U.S. funding for global health programs. Public health expert Ejike Orji welcomed Nigeria’s proactive response to the U.S. funding freeze. 'What this means is that they're going to do a review, situation assessment of what's going on and that would give them the opportunity to make recommendations to the government. They (U.S.) gave a ninety-day review because of the strategic importance of continuing the HIV program in Nigeria, so that means there's still a possibility after their review, they might say, ‘Look, we don't want to continue this funding,' said Orji. Nigeria is a significant recipient of U.S. foreign aid, receiving $1.02 billion in 2023, much of it through agencies like USAID. USAID funding to Nigeria plays a pivotal role in HIV/AIDS treatment, maternal and child care, and disease prevention efforts. On Monday, the Nigerian Federal Executive Council approved $1 billion for healthcare sector reforms and allocated an additional $3.2 million to procure 150,000 HIV treatment packs over the next four months. Authorities said the new funding will support improvements in primary healthcare services, maternal and child healthcare, and training of healthcare professionals. But Ndeayo Iwot, general secretary of the Health Sector Reforms Coalition, said it will be difficult to sustain those programs without continued U.S. support. 'Even when they're releasing the available funds on time, they will not be able to cover all the areas that those funds [aid] were helping them to achieve. It will take time, probably two, three years,' said Iwot. Approximately 1.8 million Nigerians are living with HIV. The country also accounts for the world's highest number of malaria deaths and ranks among the top countries for tuberculosis cases. Iwot said Nigeria needs new partnerships for health programs. 'Health needs a multi sectoral approach, it works on partnerships, there are certain things you shouldn't do alone as a country. Going through resource pulling from many partners and stakeholders is a recommended approach to financing health activities,' said Iwot. Currently, only about 4% of Nigeria’s annual budget is allocated to the health sector—far below the 15 percent target set by African leaders in the 2001 Abuja Declaration. It's unclear whether the U.S. will reverse its decision after the 90-day pause. But with uncertainty looming, analysts say careful implementation of policies and new partnerships may be Nigeria’s best path forward.	https://www.voanews.com/a/nigeria-announces-measures-to-soften-impact-of-usaid-programs-suspension/7962960.html	2025-02-04T13:07:13-08:00

Trump, Xi to discuss tariffs imposed on each other's exports	U.S. President Donald Trump and Chinese leader Xi Jinping are set soon to hold a high-stakes phone call on the tit-for-tat tariffs each has imposed on the other country’s exports. Trump’s new 10% tariff on Chinese goods took effect at midnight Monday, with China quickly announcing it would impose 15% tariffs on U.S. coal and liquified natural gas, as well as 10% tariffs on crude oil, agricultural machinery and some automobiles. Trump on Monday retreated for a month from imposing 25% tariffs on most exports from the United States’ other top-three trading partners, Mexico and Canada. Mexican President Claudia Sheinbaum and Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau agreed to increase efforts to curb the flow of fentanyl, the deadly opioid that has killed several hundred thousand Americans over recent years. Trump said he imposed the tariff on Chinese exports to pressure China to take action to prevent fentanyl smuggling into the U.S., which identified China as a major source of the precursor chemicals used by Mexican drug cartels to manufacture fentanyl. China said it has taken steps to crack down on the industry and other illicit drug trade. 'China hopefully is going to stop sending us fentanyl, and if they're not, the tariffs are going to go substantially higher,' Trump said. White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt said Trump’s call with Xi 'is being scheduled and will happen very soon.' The U.S. and China, the world’s two biggest economies, engaged in an escalating trade war in 2018 during Trump’s first term in office when he repeatedly raised tariffs on Chinese goods, and Beijing responded each time. This time, China is much better prepared, analysts say. The country announced numerous measures that go beyond tariffs and cut across different sectors of the U.S. economy. China is also more wary of upsetting its own fragile and heavily trade-dependent economy. China's tariffs and other moves China’s State Council Tariff Commission said in a statement announcing its levy on U.S. products, 'The U.S.'s unilateral tariff increase seriously violates the rules of the World Trade Organization. It is not only unhelpful in solving its own problems, but also damages normal economic and trade cooperation between China and the U.S.' But the impact on U.S. exports could be limited. Although the U.S. worldwide is the biggest exporter of liquid natural gas, it does not export much to China. In 2023, the U.S. exported 173,247 million cubic feet of LNG to China, about 2.3% of its total natural gas exports, according to the U.S. Energy Information Administration. China imported fewer than 110,000 vehicles from the U.S. last year, although auto market analyst Lei Xing told The Associated Press that the tariffs could be painful for General Motors, which is adding the Chevrolet Tahoe and GMC Yukon to its China lineup, and for Ford, which exports the Mustang and F-150 Raptor pickup. In addition to the tariff hike, China announced export controls on several elements critical to the production of modern high-tech products. They include tungsten, tellurium, bismuth, molybdenum and indium, many of which are designated as critical minerals by the U.S. Geological Survey, meaning they are essential to U.S. economic or national security that have supply chains vulnerable to disruption. The export controls are in addition to ones China placed in December on such key elements as gallium. The Commerce Ministry also placed two American companies on an unreliable entities list: PVH Group, which owns clothing companies Calvin Klein and Tommy Hilfiger, and Illumina, which is a biotechnology company with offices in China. The listing could bar them from engaging in China-related import or export activities and from making new investments in the country. The ministry said its investigations show the two U.S. companies have 'disrupted normal business with Chinese companies, taken discriminatory measures against Chinese companies and severely harmed the legitimate rights of Chinese companies.' Beijing began investigating PVH Group in September 2024 over what it described as 'improper Xinjiang-related behavior' after the company allegedly boycotted the use of Xinjiang cotton. Illumina competes with the Chinese biotech firm BGI in gene-sequencing. In a statement, Illumina said it complies with regulations wherever it operates. 'We are assessing this announcement with the goal of finding a positive resolution,' the company said. Mexico and Canada tariffs On Monday, Sheinbaum said she would dispatch 10,000 National Guard troops to the U.S.-Mexico border to try to curb the flow of drugs into the United States. 'Mexico will reinforce the northern border … to stop drug trafficking from Mexico to the United States, in particular fentanyl,' she posted on X after talking with Trump. 'The United States commits to work to stop the trafficking of high-powered weapons to Mexico.' Trudeau said Canada would deploy new technology and personnel along its southern border with the United States to stop the flow of fentanyl. 'I just had a good call with President Trump,' Trudeau said on X. 'Proposed tariffs will be paused for at least 30 days while we work together.' Effects on US consumers Trump acknowledged Sunday that the new tariffs on the three biggest U.S. trading partners could hit inflation-weary Americans with higher prices for groceries, gasoline, cars and other consumer goods but said the higher tariffs would be 'worth the price' to bolster U.S. interests. U.S. consumers could face higher prices because companies that pay the tariffs to the federal government to import goods from other countries often pass on at least part, if not all, of their higher costs to consumers, rather than absorb the extra expenses themselves. Some material in this report came from The Associated Press, Agence France-Presse and Reuters.	https://www.voanews.com/a/trump-xi-to-discuss-tariffs-imposed-on-each-other-s-exports/7962932.html	2025-02-04T13:00:16-08:00	
Trump pick for intelligence chief edges closer to confirmation	WASHINGTON — Former Democratic congresswoman turned President Donald Trump supporter Tulsi Gabbard is one step closer to leading the U.S. intelligence community following a party-line vote in the Senate Intelligence Committee. All nine Republicans on the committee voted late Tuesday to send Gabbard's nomination to serve as director of national intelligence for a vote before the full Senate. The committee's eight Democrats voted against Gabbard's nomination. Trump praised Gabbard's 'fearless spirit' when he first nominated her for the top U.S. intelligence post in November. But the former Democratic representative from the state of Hawaii, and a one-time Democratic presidential candidate, has faced criticism from Democrats and some Republicans, who have questioned her experience and some of her past statements. 'It's fair to say Ms. Gabbard's nomination has generated a bit more interest and attention than do most nominees before this committee,' Senate Intelligence Committee Chairman Tom Cotton, a Republican, acknowledged during Gabbard's confirmation hearing last week. During the hearing, Gabbard was questioned repeatedly by both Republicans and Democrats about Edward Snowden, a former National Security Agency contractor accused of leaking thousands of classified documents before ultimately fleeing to Russia, and specifically about legislation she introduced to pardon him. But each time they asked whether she considered Snowden a traitor, Gabbard declined to answer. 'Senator, my heart is with my commitment to our Constitution and our nation's security,' Gabbard said during one exchange with Republican Senator James Lankford. Senators also questioned Gabbard about a 2017 trip to Syria, during which she met with then-Syrian President Bashar al-Assad, despite allegations he had used chemical weapons against civilians, and about her comments about Russia's February 2022 invasion of Ukraine. 'I continue to have significant concerns about your judgment and your qualifications,' said committee Vice Chairman Mark Warner, a Democrat. 'Repeatedly, you have excused our adversaries' worst actions, [and] instead often blame them on the United States.' In the days since the hearing, however, Gabbard managed to find common ground with the committee's Republican senators. 'In response to my questions during our discussion in my office and at the open hearing, as well as through her explanation at the closed hearing before the Senate Intelligence Committee, Ms. Gabbard addressed my concerns regarding her views on Edward Snowden,' Republican Susan Collins said in a statement late Monday. 'I look forward to working with Ms. Gabbard to strengthen our national security,' Collins added. Republican Senator Todd Young, likewise, voiced his backing for Gabbard's nomination early Tuesday, before the committee's vote. 'I appreciate Tulsi Gabbard's engagement with me on a variety of issues to ensure that our intelligence professionals will be supported, and policymakers will receive unbiased information under her leadership,' Young posted on social media platform X. 'Having now secured these commitments, I will support Tulsi's nomination.' Young also shared a letter from Gabbard, in which she pledged to hold U.S. intelligence employees and contractors accountable for intelligence leaks and to 'not advocate for any protections which should only be extended to lawful and legitimate whistleblowers.' Gabbard, in the letter, further promised to not make any recommendation 'regarding the legal standing of Edward Snowden' to the U.S. attorney general or to President Trump. And she pledged to support the use of warrantless surveillance capabilities despite her opposition to the program while she was a lawmaker.	https://www.voanews.com/a/trump-pick-for-intelligence-chief-edges-closer-to-confirmation/7962928.html	2025-02-04T12:48:03-08:00	
Man charged with stabbing Salman Rushdie goes on trial; author to take stand	MAYVILLE, NEW YORK — In 2022, Salman Rushdie was about to deliver a lecture before a live audience in western New York when a man ran toward him and plunged a knife into the author’s hand as he raised it in self-defense. 'After that there are many blows, to my neck, to my chest, to my eye, everywhere,' Rushdie recalled in a memoir that followed. 'I feel my legs give way, and I fall.' In the coming weeks, Rushdie is expected to return to the same New York county to recount the experience as one of the first witnesses in the trial of the man charged with wielding the knife that day, Hadi Matar. Jury selection got underway Tuesday. Matar, 27, of Fairview, New Jersey, has pleaded not guilty to charges of attempted murder and assault. Under different circumstances, Rushdie’s book, which details his account of that day and his recovery, might offer important evidence in the Aug. 12, 2022, attack that left the 77-year-old blind in his right eye and his hand permanently damaged. But 'this isn’t a back-alley event that occurs unwitnessed in a dark alley,' said Chautauqua County District Attorney Jason Schmidt following a pretrial hearing. 'This is something that was recorded, it was witnessed live by thousands of people.' Jurors will be shown video of the attack, as well as photos and documentation, and an estimated 15 witnesses are expected to take the stand. Judge David Foley said once jury selection is complete, the trial would take up to a week and a half. Matar’s lawyer, Nathaniel Barone, has not explained how he plans to defend his client and has clapped back at critics who question why Matar did not take a plea deal. 'That's not what this is about. It's about due process,' Barone said. 'It's about receiving a fair trial. ... If someone wants to exercise those rights, they're entitled to do that.' In a separate indictment, federal authorities allege that Matar was motivated by a terrorist organization’s endorsement of a fatwa, or edict, calling for Rushdie’s death. A separate trial on the federal charges — terrorism transcending national boundaries, providing material support to terrorists and attempting to provide material support to a terrorist organization — will be scheduled in U.S. District Court in Buffalo. Foley asked potential jurors Tuesday whether they could fairly consider a case involving someone of Muslim descent or with strong religious beliefs. All indicated they could. But finding jurors who have not already formed an opinion was proving harder. Nearly all of the 27 men and women being screened Tuesday said they knew about what happened to Rushdie, either from news reports or acquaintances, and several said they had formed opinions that are unlikely to change based on what they hear at trial. Matar's attorney sought unsuccessfully to move the trial out of Chautauqua County last year, citing pretrial publicity and potential prejudice against people of Middle Eastern descent among the small rural county's mostly white residents. Rushdie spent years in hiding after the late Iranian leader Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini issued the fatwa in 1989 after publication of the novel The Satanic Verses, which some Muslims consider blasphemous. In the federal indictment, authorities allege Matar believed the edict was backed by the Lebanon-based militant group Hezbollah and endorsed in a 2006 speech by the group’s then-leader, Hassan Nasrallah. But jurors in the Chautauqua County case are unlikely to hear about the fatwa, according to Schmidt. He has said he doesn’t anticipate needing to show Matar’s possible motive to get a conviction on the state charges. 'From my standpoint, this is a localized event. It’s a stabbing event. It’s fairly straightforward,' Schmidt said. 'I don’t really see a need to get into motive evidence, whether that’s applicable or not applicable and what that consists of. I’d like to avoid all of that.' Barone, the defense attorney, said jurors should be screened for prejudice nonetheless, given the discussions of the fatwa during previous court proceedings. 'They’ve talked about the reason why this alleged crime supposedly occurred was because of this book involving Muslims, all that. So, it’s kind of like the barn door’s been opened,' he said. Matar was born in the U.S. but holds dual citizenship in Lebanon, where his parents were born. Rushdie is a native of India who lived for years in London. He became a U.S. citizen in 2016. Matar has been held without bail since his arrest after being subdued by onlookers who rushed the amphitheater stage. The event’s moderator, Henry Reese, co-founder of City of Asylum in Pittsburgh, also was wounded.	https://www.voanews.com/a/man-charged-with-stabbing-salman-rushdie-goes-on-trial-author-to-take-stand-/7962880.html	2025-02-04T12:12:16-08:00	
El Salvador joins UN-backed mission on the ground in Haiti to combat gang violence	PORT-AU-PRINCE, HAITI — A contingent from El Salvador arrived in Haiti on Tuesday to bolster a U.N.-backed mission led by Kenyan police to help fight gangs that killed thousands of people last year and control much of the capital. The 70 personnel will provide expertise in air support, which Kenyan officials said will be critical for medical evacuations. The Salvadoreans are the latest to join the mission in recent months. Additional police officers from Kenya were deployed last month for a total of more than 600 now in Haiti. They have been joined by police, soldiers and other officials from countries including Jamaica and Guatemala. Gang violence keeps surging across Port-au-Prince and beyond, with gunmen in recent days killing at least 40 people in an upscale community. The U.S. and other countries have warned that the Kenya-led mission lacks funding and personnel as they push to transform it into a U.N.-peacekeeping mission. More than 5,600 people were reported killed last year across Haiti and more than 2,200 others were injured. Gang violence has left more than one million people homeless in recent years, according to the U.N.	https://www.voanews.com/a/el-salvador-joins-un-backed-mission-on-the-ground-in-haiti-to-combat-gang-violence/7962828.html	2025-02-04T11:31:26-08:00

Doug Collins confirmed as veterans affairs secretary as Trump Cabinet takes shape	WASHINGTON — The U.S. Senate on Tuesday confirmed Doug Collins as secretary of veterans affairs, putting the former congressman and Iraq War veteran at the helm of a department that provides crucial care to America's veterans. Collins, a former Air Force chaplain, was confirmed on a 77-23 vote, becoming the latest addition to President Donald Trump's Cabinet. 'We must take care of our brave men and women in uniform, and Doug will be a great advocate for our active duty service members, veterans, and military families to ensure they have the support they need,' Trump said in a November statement announcing Collins' nomination. The Department of Veterans Affairs manages a more than $350 billion budget and oversees nearly 200 medical centers and hospitals nationwide. It also manages national cemeteries and works closely with the Defense Department on personnel matters. Collins has promised to cut regulations across the department and elevate the quality of care for veterans. The challenges facing the department have evolved in recent years, with a younger generation of veterans bringing new health challenges from their service in the Iraq and Afghanistan wars. 'I'm an Iraq War veteran. I understand burn pits because I slept next to one for many months,' Collins said in his opening remarks during his January confirmation hearing. Collins said that he understands the challenges facing veterans today who 'went time and time again, deployment after deployment' to conflict zones. Collins served in the House of Representatives from 2013 to 2021. He has been an outspoken conservative since his time in the Georgia state legislature and was a close Trump ally during the president's first term. He ran unsuccessfully for Senate in 2020 but lost the Republican primary to Kelly Loeffler, a major GOP donor who Trump has tapped to lead the U.S. Small Business Association. Senator Kevin Cramer, a Republican from North Dakota, called Collins a 'friend' who has 'an engaging personality that attracts people to what he's working on.' 'It's not that they're better doctors or better psychiatrists or better nurses or technicians. It's that they're empathetic,' Cramer said. 'While they appreciate access to community care, they appreciate the empathy of a fellow veteran, and Doug brings that. But, guys, he's a chaplain. I mean, come on, how perfect is that?' Collins' nomination sailed through the Senate Veterans' Affairs Committee in a 18-1 vote. The lone dissenter, Senator Mazie Hirono, a Democrat from Hawaii, said she was concerned that Collins would limit access to reproductive care like IVF or abortion for veterans. Senator Tammy Duckworth, an Illinois Democrat, said she had a productive conversation with Collins during his confirmation hearing but pressed him on whether he'd commit to working with Congress to 'strengthen and refine' the department 'rather than resorting to privatization.' Collins said he would be focused on addressing wait times and increasing preventative care.	https://www.voanews.com/a/doug-collins-confirmed-as-veterans-affairs-secretary-as-trump-cabinet-takes-shape/7962717.html	2025-02-04T10:34:39-08:00

As quakes rattle Greek islands, a few brave tourists enjoy having Santorini to themselves	Santorini, Greece — More Greek islands closed schools Tuesday as hundreds of earthquakes rattled the Aegean Sea, while a handful of hardy tourists enjoyed having Santorini's stunning views to themselves. Thousands of residents and seasonal workers have left the Cycladic Islands as hundreds of quakes up to magnitude 5 were recorded in the volcanic region since Friday. Ferry and commercial flight operators added services to accommodate departures. The quakes have caused cracks in some older buildings but no injuries have been reported so far. On Tuesday, schools were shut on 13 islands, up from four the previous day. Santorini earlier canceled public events, restricted travel to the island and banned construction work in certain areas. Efthimios Lekkas, head of the state-run Earthquake Planning and Protection Organization, said that the epicenter of earthquakes in the Aegean Sea was moving northward away from Santorini, emphasizing that there was no connection to the area's dormant volcanoes. 'This may last several days or several weeks. We are not able to predict the evolution of the sequence in time,' Lekkas told state-run television. In Santorini's main town, Fira, the narrow, whitewashed streets along the island's clifftops were deserted — a rare sight even in the offseason — except for small pockets of tour groups, many from Asian countries. Joseph Liu, from Guangzhou in southern China, said that he had wanted to visit Santorini for years after seeing it in a documentary. He joined family and tour group members on a balcony deck typically used for high-end wedding receptions. 'This place is amazing, really beautiful. Just like I saw in the program: the mystery, the scenery,' he said. 'The [group] leader told us about the earthquakes before we came so it was not a surprise.' Retired police officer and ship worker Panagiotis Hatzigeorgiou, who has lived on Santorini for more than three decades, said that he has turned down offers to stay with relatives in Athens. 'Older residents are used to the earthquakes ... But it's different this time. It's not the same to have earthquakes every 2-3 minutes. The main thing is not to worry,' he said, adding with a laugh: 'Now we can listen to music alone and have coffee by ourselves.' In Athens, government officials are continuing to hold daily high-level planning and assessment meetings with briefings from island officials.	https://www.voanews.com/a/as-quakes-rattle-greek-islands-a-few-brave-tourists-enjoy-having-santorini-to-themselves/7962618.html	2025-02-04T09:26:52-08:00	
M23 declares ceasefire in DRC as regional leaders try to forge peace	NAIROBI — The rebel group M23 declared a ceasefire in areas under its control in the eastern Democratic Republic of the Congo, citing humanitarian reasons. The streets of Goma were busy as aid groups rushed Tuesday to help the thousands of people wounded and displaced during the past week’s fighting between M23 and pro-Congolese government forces. The M23 group also halted its military advance in other areas, most notably around the South Kivu provincial capital of Bukavu, where M23 fighters are stationed a few kilometers from the town. Chrispin Mvano, a political and security expert in Goma, told VOA that people there were going about their business peacefully. According to Mvano, residents in the city center reported seeing numerous trucks carrying petrol and other goods from Tanzania, Uganda and Rwanda, and many people who fled the conflict were returning. The M23 ceasefire comes hours after the East African Community, or EAC, and Southern Africa Regional Community agreed to hold a joint summit to discuss the conflict in Congo, in hopes of bridging the differences between Kinshasa and Rwanda. Congo accuses Kigali of supporting the M23, a claim denied by Rwanda but verified by U.N. observers. According to U.N. agencies, 770 bodies have been recovered from the streets of Goma, and 2,880 were injured in the conflict. The Red Cross said Monday that it will need four more days to collect the bodies. Due to a lack of morgue space, it said, all bodies will be buried after identification. Hassane Hamdou, the Norwegian Refugee Council regional director for central and west Africa, said the ceasefire is only a first step, as it will take lasting peace to bring relief in eastern Congo and allow lifesaving assistance to reach those who are in desperate need. Stephane Dujjaric, spokesperson for U.N. Secretary-General Antonio Guterres, said U.N. agencies are assessing the situation and are developing a plan to distribute humanitarian aid to the hundreds of thousands of displaced people in Congo and neighboring countries. The U.N. humanitarian affairs office is calling for the urgent reopening of the Goma airport to help with evacuation of the injured and delivery of medical supplies. The agency said those involved in the conflict must guarantee access to humanitarian aid and supplies to people in need. Mvano warned that the ceasefire remains fragile, as other armed groups in eastern Congo could spoil the lull in fighting. For example, the Wazalendo group frequently disrupts peace efforts, Mvano said, adding that it’s important to remember that these rebel groups, who are not part of the negotiations, refuse to recognize the ceasefire agreement. Eastern Congo is home to more than 100 armed groups fighting for land, resources and control of the area’s rich mines. Congolese President Felix Tshisekedi, who boycotted an EAC summit last week, is expected to attend the regional summit scheduled for Friday and Saturday, as is Rwandan President Paul Kagame. Tanzania will host the meeting, but some leaders may attend online.	https://www.voanews.com/a/m23-declares-ceasefire-in-drc-as-regional-leaders-try-to-forge-peace-/7962611.html	2025-02-04T09:08:09-08:00

Chadians who worked for now-departed French troops appeal to government for jobs	Yaounde, Cameroon — More than 400 civilians rendered jobless by the departure of French troops from Chad are asking the government to hire them and provide the job benefits they had when they worked for the French. The last French troops left Chad on January 31, following an order by President Mahamat Idriss Deby Itno. Chadian officials say hundreds of civilians who were employed by the French assembled in the capital N'djamena on Monday to ask the government to immediately give them jobs. French forces departed Chad at the order of the central African state’s president, Field Marshal Mahamat Idriss Deby. The last French troops left the country on Friday after handing over the Kossei military base in N'djamena, which they had occupied for about 70 years. Earlier, French forces handed over two other bases at Faya-Largeau and Abeche. Mbaitoubam Bruno, the spokesperson for civilians who worked at the French military bases, spoke to VOA from N'djamena via a messaging app. He said Chad's government should immediately recruit them because at least half of the over 400 Chadians who lost their jobs as French troops departed are already in precarious situations that do not permit them to support their families. Mbaitoubam added that it is imperative for Chad's government to guarantee the security and social well-being of all former workers at French military bases by making sure each and every one of them has a job. The former workers mostly held jobs in hospitals, schools and dining facilities that served the French troops. Others provided humanitarian assistance to those who lived around the bases. Mbaitoubam said a majority of the workers were asked to leave French military bases on November 28 when Chad announced an end to military cooperation with France. The workers say they have remained without jobs and salaries and cannot take care of their medical bills. Aziz Mahamat Saleh is a member of a Chadian commission overseeing the dismantling of military agreements between Paris and N'Djamena. He is also Chad's former communications minister and government spokesman. He said Chad's president, Field Marshal Mahamat Idriss Deby, ordered the commission to make a census of all civilians who worked with French troops in three bases at Kossei, Faya-Largeau and Abeche. He says after the census, the commission will propose a list of workers whose services are needed to the government of Chad for recruitment. Mahamat spoke on Chad's state TV. He said Deby has asked health and humanitarian workers to continue working in hospitals formerly controlled by French troops. He said he was pleading with the former workers to have confidence in their government, which he said is doing everything possible to protect their rights and provide jobs despite the difficult economic situation the country is facing. The workers say that under the French, they earned an average salary of more than 130 dollars per month. Before leaving Chad last week, General Pascal Ianni, the commander of French forces in Africa, told Chadian state TV that their departure was abrupt. Paris has not said anything concerning the former workers, Chad's government says. The workers say the decision to order out the French may have been patriotic for the government, but that it undermined their well-being, and did not take into consideration the needs of several thousand civilians who had health care and education thanks to the French troops’ presence.	https://www.voanews.com/a/chadians-who-worked-for-now-departed-french-troops-appeal-to-government-for-jobs-/7962503.html	2025-02-04T08:05:10-08:00	
Syria's Sharaa aims to restore US ties, no contacts yet with Trump administration	Beirut, Lebanon — Syria's interim President Ahmed al-Sharaa said his government aims to restore ties with the United States in the coming days but has not yet had any contact with the Trump administration, according to an interview with The Economist. Sharaa, declared Syria's interim head of state last week, also noted that U.S. troops were in Syria without government approval, adding that any such presence should be agreed with the state. He described U.S. sanctions still imposed on Syria as 'the gravest risk' to the country. 'I believe that President [Donald] Trump seeks peace in the area, and it is a top priority to lift the sanctions. The United States of America does not have any interest in maintaining the suffering of the Syrian people,' Sharaa said in the interview published late on Monday. Sharaa led the Islamist armed group Hayat Tahrir al-Sham (HTS), a former al-Qaida affiliate, in the lightning offensive that toppled former President Bashar al-Assad on December 8. Syria has been under tough sanctions for years, imposed by the United States and other Western powers to isolate Assad over his brutal crackdown and to generate pressure for a political solution after more than a decade of civil war. In January, the outgoing Biden administration issued a sanctions exemption for transactions with Syrian governing institutions for six months. It followed a visit to Damascus by senior U.S. diplomats in December. The United States, however, continues to designate HTS as a terrorist entity, even though it severed ties with al-Qaida in 2016. The U.S. embassy in Damascus suspended its operations in 2012. Terrorist designation 'meaningless' Sharaa said HTS's terrorist designation had 'become meaningless' following a decision to dissolve all the armed factions that fought Assad. The United States deployed forces to Syria a decade ago during the campaign against Islamic State. They still have a presence in the north and northeast backing a Syrian ally, the Kurdish-led Syrian Democratic Forces (SDF). 'In light of the new Syrian state, I believe any illegal military presence should not continue. Any military presence in a sovereign state should take place under a certain agreement, and there has been no such agreement between us and the United States of America,' Sharaa said. He also said his administration was 'reassessing the Russian military presence' in Syria, where Moscow propped up Assad. Russia, seeking to retain both a naval and air base in Syria, sent a senior official to Damascus last week. 'We might reach an agreement [with them] or not, but in one way or another, any military presence should be with the agreement of the host state,' Sharaa said. Asked whether he could imagine normalizing ties with Israel, Sharaa said 'we want peace with all parties' but it was a sensitive issue because of regional wars and Israel's occupation of the Golan Heights, captured from Syria in a 1967 war. 'There are many priorities in front of us, so it is too early to discuss such a matter because it requires wide public opinion. It also requires a lot of procedures and laws in order to discuss it, and to be honest, we have not considered it yet.'	https://www.voanews.com/a/syria-s-sharaa-aims-to-restore-us-ties-no-contacts-yet-with-trump-administration/7962500.html	2025-02-04T08:00:11-08:00

Senate committee advances Robert F. Kennedy Jr. nomination to be health secretary	Washington — Robert F. Kennedy Jr., the controversial environmental lawyer turned public health critic, cleared his first hurdle on Tuesday to become the nation's top health official when the senate finance committee voted to advance his nomination for a floor vote. Republicans voted together to advance his nomination, while Democrats all opposed. His nomination now will face a full senate vote, despite concerns about the work he's done to sow doubts around vaccine safety and his potential to profit off lawsuits over drugmakers. To gain control of the $1.7 trillion Health and Human Services agency, Kennedy will need support from all but three Republicans if Democrats uniformly oppose him. Republican Sen. Bill Cassidy of Louisiana, who is also a physician and sits on the finance committee, voted to advance Kennedy's confirmation. Last week, during Kennedy's hearings, Cassidy repeatedly implored Kennedy to reject a disproven theory that vaccines cause autism, to no avail. He ended the hearing by saying he was 'struggling' with the vote. 'Your past, undermining confidence in vaccines with unfounded or misleading arguments, concerns me,' Cassidy told Kennedy. Republican Sens. Susan Collins of Maine, Lisa Murkowski of Alaska and Mitch McConnell of Kentucky are all seen as potential no votes, too, because they voted against President Donald Trump's defense secretary nominee and have expressed concerns about Kennedy's anti-vaccine work. In a CBS '60 Minutes' interview that aired Sunday, McConnell declined to say how he would vote on Kennedy's nomination but reiterated 'vaccines are critically important.' Democrats, meanwhile, continue to raise alarms about Kennedy's potential to financially benefit from changing vaccine guidelines or weakening federal lawsuit protections against vaccine makers if confirmed as health secretary. 'It seems possible that many different types of vaccine-related decisions and communications — which you would be empowered to make and influence as Secretary — could result in significant financial compensation for your family,' Democratic Sens. Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts and Ron Wyden of Oregon wrote in a letter sent over the weekend to Kennedy. Kennedy said he'll give his son all of the referral fees in legal cases against vaccine makers, including the fees he gets from referring clients in a case against Merck. Kennedy told the committee he's referred hundreds of clients to a law firm that's suing Merck's Gardasil, the human papillomavirus vaccine that prevents cervical cancer. He's earned $2.5 million from the deal over the past three years. As secretary, Kennedy will oversee vaccine recommendations and public health campaigns for the $1.7 trillion agency, which is also responsible for food and hospital inspections, providing health insurance for millions of Americans and researching deadly diseases. Kennedy, a longtime Democrat, ran for president but withdrew last year to throw his support to Trump in exchange for an influential job in his Republican administration. Together, they have forged a new and unusual coalition made up of conservatives who oppose vaccines and liberals who want to see the government promote healthier foods. Trump and Kennedy have branded the movement as 'Make America Healthy Again.'	https://www.voanews.com/a/senate-committee-advances-robert-f-kennedy-jr-nomination-to-be-health-secretary-/7962491.html	2025-02-04T07:48:50-08:00	
Thai Prime Minister heads to China amid growing global uncertainties	Taipei, Taiwan — Thailand’s Prime Minister Paetongtarn Shinawatra kicks off a four-day trip to China on Wednesday that is expected to focus on economic and trade ties. During the visit, which will include a meeting with China’s leader Xi Jinping, analysts say the prime minister will also seek Beijing’s help in boosting Chinese tourists’ confidence in traveling to Thailand. Paetongtarn's trip comes amid growing concerns among Chinese tourists about the risks of traveling to Thailand. In January a television actor from China, Wang Xing, was abducted from the Southeast Asian country and forced to work in a scam center in neighboring Myanmar. 'China is pretty concerned about what’s going on in Thailand, especially the cyber scam centers, so the Thai Prime Minister’s visit is to assure the Chinese that the Thais are doing whatever they can to deal with the scam center [issue],' said Rahman Yaacob, a research fellow at the Lowy Institute’s Southeast Asia program. In recent weeks, Thai and Chinese law enforcement joined forces publicly to crack down on the dozens of cyber scam operations dotting the Chinese-Thai-and-Myanmar border, including the arrest of a man suspected of involvement in the abduction of the Chinese artist Wang Xing. Chinese and Thai officials agreed to further enhance cooperation in the fight against the cyber scam gangs, including setting up a coordination center in Bangkok. 'Thai Prime Minister may allow Chinese police freer rein to operate in Thailand, including working more formally with Thai police and establishing Chinese police stations in Thailand,' Paul Chambers, an expert on Southeast Asian affairs at Naresuan University in Thailand, told VOA in a written response. During the COVID-19 pandemic, foreign tourism to Thailand plunged, pummeling the economy. Numbers have started to recover and some 35 million visited the country in 2024, with more than 6.2 million from China. The recent abduction case, however, has presented a new challenge. 'Bringing back tourism is so important for Thailand, and they need the Chinese government’s support due to Beijing’s control over the media,' said Zachary Abuza, a professor at the National War College in Washington, who focuses on Southeast Asia politics. While the cyber scam centers have posed challenges to Thailand and China, some analysts say this issue won’t fundamentally change relations between the two countries. 'Some recent cooperation on this front [between China and Thailand] signals that both countries are going to be pragmatic about this and not let the overall concerns rock the official relationship,' Hunter Marston, a research fellow at La Trobe University in Australia, told VOA by phone. Improving economic ties In addition to tackling illegal cyber scam operations, experts say the Thai prime minister also will seek to strengthen bilateral cooperation in areas such as infrastructure development with China during her trip. 'Thailand may offer China some new choices for infrastructure projects,' Paul Chambers in Thailand said. One project that is likely to be high on the agenda is the 609-kilometer-long high-speed rail project that Thailand hopes to finish building by 2030. The railway, when complete, will connect Thailand with southern China by traveling through neighboring Laos. 'The high-speed rail will be the priority for Thailand when it comes to their engagement with China, and China sees this project as beneficial to their regional vision for connectivity in the long run,' Marston said. Despite the mutual interest in deepening collaboration over infrastructure projects, Thailand also faces challenges posed by the influx of cheap Chinese goods. Last year, the Thai government set up a task force made up of 28 agencies to review and revise regulations to curb the threats to Thai businesses posed by cheap Chinese imports. While these challenges remain serious, Yaacob at Lowy Institute in Australia said Bangkok is likely to focus on more than just trade concerns. 'The Thai government will be keen to look at what areas they can work with the Chinese, such as attracting Chinese investments that could create jobs for the Thai people,' he told VOA in a video interview through Zoom. Hedging between U.S. and China Ahead of Paetongtarn’s trip to China, rights groups and countries around the world, including the U.S., have called on Thailand not to deport 48 Uyghur detainees back to China. U.S. Secretary of State Marco Rubio had suggested that he would use diplomacy and the 'longstanding U.S.-Thailand alliance to keep that from happening. Marston says the Thai government may comply with Beijing’s demands. 'Thailand might use China’s request for the deportation of Uyghurs to ask for some deliverables from China, such as receiving Chinese support to become an advanced economy or to dominate certain sectors,' he told VOA. Yaacob believes Thailand is likely to continue its longstanding foreign policy stance of hedging between Beijing and Washington. However, he adds that if the Trump administration comes down hard on Southeast Asia in terms of trade policies, it could give Beijing more room to seek closer ties with Bangkok. 'Southeast Asian countries rely on trade, so if they are affected [by the Trump administration’s policies], they may look at China as an alternative,' Yaacob told VOA. In his view, security is an area where Beijing may seek to reduce Washington’s influence in Southeast Asia. 'The U.S. has played a major security role in Southeast Asia and China is quite interested in reducing American influence in that domain since they view Southeast Asia as their backyard,' Yaacob said.	https://www.voanews.com/a/thai-prime-minister-heads-to-china-amid-growing-global-uncertainties/7962476.html	2025-02-04T07:40:00-08:00	
5 shot at adult education center in Sweden	OREBRO, SWEDEN — Five people were shot at an adult education center in Sweden on Tuesday, police said. The conditions of the victims weren't immediately clear. The Swedish news agency TT reported, without providing its sources, that the perpetrator died by suicide. Police didn't immediately confirm that reporting. The adult education center is on the outskirts of the city of Orebro, which is located about 200 kilometers west of Stockholm. The school, called Campus Risbergska, serves students who are over age 20, according to its website. Primary and upper secondary school courses are offered, as well as Swedish classes for immigrants, vocational training and programs for people with intellectual disabilities. Teacher Lena Warenmark told SVT News that there were unusually few students on the campus Tuesday afternoon because many went home after a national test. She also told the broadcaster that she heard probably 10 gunshots. Video from the scene showed a large police presence and other emergency vehicles. Students were sheltering in nearby buildings. Other parts of the school were evacuated following the shooting, which began around 12:30 p.m. Andreas Sundling, 28, was among those forced to barricade themselves inside the school. 'We heard three bangs and loud screams,' he told Expressen newspaper while sheltering in a classroom. 'Now we're sitting here waiting to be evacuated from the school. The information we have received is that we should sit and wait.' It wasn't immediately clear whether police were counting the perpetrator among the five shot. Police said that no officers were shot during the violence. 'The reports of violence in Orebro are very serious. The police are on site and the operation is in full swing,' Justice Minister Gunnar Strommer told TT. During a news conference on the Swedish employment market, another government official addressed the violence in Orebro, which has a population of around 155,000. 'The government is following developments very closely and has a continuous dialogue with the police about this,' Mats Persson, minister for employment and integration, said Tuesday.	https://www.voanews.com/a/shot-at-adult-education-center-in-sweden/7962399.html	2025-02-04T07:08:28-08:00	
Taliban threaten to use US arms to thwart attempts to retake them	ISLAMABAD — The Taliban have warned that the military weapons left behind by the United States in Afghanistan now belong to them as 'spoils of war' and will be utilized to defend against any attempts to reclaim them. The statement marks the first official response from the internationally unrecognized government in Kabul to President Donald Trump’s pledge on the eve of his Jan. 20 inauguration to retrieve U.S. arms from the de facto Islamist Afghan leaders. 'The weapons that America abandoned in Afghanistan, as well as those provided to the former Afghan regime, are now in the possession of the Mujahideen [or Taliban forces] as spoils of war,' claimed Zabihullah Mujahid, the chief Taliban spokesperson, while participating in an X space session late on Monday. 'The Afghan people now own these weapons and are utilizing them to defend their independence, sovereignty, and Islamic system. No external force can compel us to surrender these weapons, nor will we accept any demands for their surrender,' Mujahid stated. 'We will use these weapons to repel invaders who dare to seize them.' U.S.-led Western troops were stationed in Afghanistan for nearly two decades to counter terrorist groups and protect the internationally backed government in Kabul at the time. They hastily and chaotically withdrew in August 2021, just days after the then-insurgent Taliban stormed back to power. A U.S. Department of Defense report in 2022 found that about $7 billion worth of military hardware was left behind in Afghanistan after the military withdrawal was completed. The equipment, including aircraft, air-to-ground munitions, military vehicles, weapons, communications equipment, and other materials, was subsequently seized by the Taliban. Trump stated in his pre-inauguration remarks at a rally in Washington last month that his predecessor, Joe Biden, 'gave our military equipment, a big chunk of it, to the enemy.' He went on to warn that future financial assistance to Taliban-ruled Afghanistan would be contingent upon the return of U.S. military arms. 'If we’re going to pay billions of dollars a year, tell them we’re not going to give them the money unless they give back our military equipment,' Trump said then, without elaborating. Mujahid, while speaking on Monday, rejected Trump’s assertions, saying the Taliban have not received 'a single penny' from the U.S. in financial aid since regaining control of the country. He stated that Kabul has neither anticipated nor sought any assistance from Washington. The Taliban have displayed U.S. military gear in their so-called victory day celebrations since returning to power in Afghanistan. The U.S. troop exit from Afghanistan stemmed from the February 2020 Doha Agreement that the first Trump administration negotiated with the then-insurgent Taliban. Biden completed and defended the military withdrawal, saying the choice he had was either to follow through on that agreement or be prepared to go back to fighting the Taliban.	https://www.voanews.com/a/taliban-threaten-to-use-us-arms-to-thwart-attempts-to-retake-them-/7962251.html	2025-02-04T04:37:57-08:00	
Israeli military troops killed gunman in West Bank	Israel’s military said Tuesday its forces killed a gunman in the occupied West Bank who had fired at soldiers. The Israel Defense Forces said the exchange of gunfire took place at a checkpoint in the village of Tayasir. Israeli emergency services said at least six people were injured, including two soldiers. In recent weeks the Israeli military has been conducting an operation in the area, particularly around Jenin, that it says it aimed at thwarting terrorism. The military said Sunday it had killed at least 50 militants since launching the operation two weeks ago, while Palestinian health officials said Israeli forces have killed 70 people in the West Bank since the start of the year. Violence in the West Bank surged following the October 2023 Hamas attack on Israel and the subsequent Israeli counteroffensive against the U.S.-designated terror group in the Gaza Strip. Palestinian health officials say Israeli troops and settlers have killed more than 800 Palestinians during that time, while Israel says Palestinian attacks have killed at least 30 Israelis. Some information for this story was provided by The Associated Press, Agence France-Presse and Reuters.	https://www.voanews.com/a/israeli-military-troops-killed-gunman-in-west-bank-/7962166.html	2025-02-04T03:26:05-08:00	
Thailand to cut power to Myanmar border areas linked to scam centers	BANGKOK — Thailand will suspend electricity supply to some border areas with Myanmar in an effort to curb scam centres, its government said on Tuesday, amid growing pressure on the illegal compounds that have ensnared vast numbers of people of multiple nationalities. According to the United Nations, hundreds of thousands of people have been trafficked by criminal gangs and forced to work in scam centers and illegal online operations across Southeast Asia, including along the Thai-Myanmar border. A 2023 U.N. report estimated the fast-growing operations generate billions of dollars annually. 'We must take action to cut off the electricity immediately,' Thai Deputy Prime Minister Phumtham Wechayachai told reporters, adding authorities would instruct the Provincial Electricity Authority that supplies power to these areas to cut it off. The scam compounds have come into renewed focus after Chinese actor Wang Xing was abducted after arriving in Thailand last month. He was later freed by Thai police who found him in Myanmar. Thailand has been concerned about the impact on its vital tourism sector and has sought to allay safety concerns of visitors from China, a key source market. Prime Minister Paetongtarn Shinawatra said talks would be held on Tuesday with the National Security Council on various measures to address the scam compounds, including stopping the power supply. 'What happened has had a huge impact on many Thai people and the image of the country,' she said. Asked when power would be cut off, she said: 'Today, if we talk and it's clear, then we can do it today.' The security council's chief on Monday said evidence showed transnational crime syndicates operating in Myanmar's Tachileik, Myawaddy, and Payathonzu - outlining areas that the power supply cuts may target. Myanmar's state-run Global New Light of Myanmar, in a rare article on scam centers last month, said basic essentials, including power and internet, are not provided by Myanmar but by other countries, in a veiled reference to Thailand. It said 'foreign organizations' were investing in this infrastructure. Myanmar's military government has since October 2023 repatriated more than 55,000 foreigners, overwhelmingly Chinese, who were forced to work in scam compounds to their home countries, the newspaper said.	https://www.voanews.com/a/thailand-to-cut-power-to-myanmar-border-areas-linked-to-scam-centers/7962150.html	2025-02-04T02:49:44-08:00	
Ukraine says Russian drone attacks damaged buildings	Ukrainian officials said Tuesday that Russian drone attacks overnight damaged houses and other buildings in multiple regions. Ukraine’s military said its air defenses shot down 37 of the 65 drones that Russian forces launched in the attacks, with intercepts taking place in the Cherkasy, Chernihiv, Kyiv, Poltava and Sumy regions. The Sumy Regional Military Administration said the attacks damaged eight houses and a school in the region. Cherkasy Governor Ihor Taburets said on Telegram that debris from destroyed drones caused fires at three businesses. In Kyiv, officials said falling drone debris damaged several schools and a clinic. Russia’s Defense Ministry said Tuesday its air defenses destroyed a Ukrainian guided missile over the Sea of Azov. Rare earth minerals U.S. President Donald Trump said Monday he possibly would be interested in continuing U.S. aid to Ukraine in exchange for access to Ukraine’s rare earth minerals. 'We’re putting in hundreds of billions of dollars. They have great rare earth. And I want security of the rare earth, and they’re willing to do it,' Trump told reporters at the White House. Rare earth minerals like those in Ukraine include lithium and titanium. They are essential for an array of modern high-tech products. In his daily address Monday, before Trump’s announcement, Ukraine’s president reiterated the country’s need to defend itself against Russia’s ongoing attacks. He said Russia is 'focusing primarily' on Ukraine’s energy sector. 'They continue their attacks, constantly adjusting their strikes to the capabilities of our defense, making them more difficult to repel,' Volodymyr Zelenskyy said. 'There is a constant rapid evolution of electronic warfare,' the president said and urged Ukraine to 'be much faster' in adjusting to the continuous changes. The supply of air defense systems for Ukraine is another issue for the Eastern European country. Zelenskyy said that the supplies of the systems for Ukraine are 'critical and must not stop.' 'We must constantly search worldwide for ways to strengthen defense, increase production of necessary equipment in Ukraine, expand localization of production and obtain licenses from our partners,' the president said. 'This is a huge undertaking, and much of Ukraine’s future depends on it.' Some information for this story was provided by The Associated Press and Reuters.	https://www.voanews.com/a/ukraine-says-russian-drone-attacks-damaged-buildings/7962120.html	2025-02-04T01:24:17-08:00	
Philippines, U.S. hold joint air patrol over South China Sea, angering China	The air forces of the Philippines and the United States held joint patrols over the South China Sea on Tuesday, a move that angered China, which also conducted a 'routine patrol' over a disputed shoal. The Philippines and the United States have ramped up security arrangements under President Ferdinand Marcos Jr. against a backdrop of rising tension between Manila and Beijing stemming from overlapping claims in the busy waterway. The one-day exercise by the treaty allies took place in the West Philippine Sea, Philippine air force spokesperson Maria Consuelo Castillo said, using Manila's term for waters in the South China Sea that fall within its exclusive economic zone. 'The exercise aimed to enhance operational coordination, improve air domain awareness, and reinforce agile combat employment capabilities between the two air forces,' Castillo said in a statement. Castillo said three Philippine FA-50 fighter aircraft and two U.S. B1-B bombers participated in the exercise, which included flying over Scarborough Shoal, where the Chinese air force also carried out what it called a routine patrol. In a statement on Tuesday, China's military accused the Philippines of joining patrols it said were organized by foreign countries to 'undermine peace and stability in the South China Sea.' China's air force units would maintain a 'high degree of alert, resolutely defend China's territorial sovereignty and maritime rights and interests, and control any military activities that disrupt the South China Sea,' the Southern Theatre Command added. China claims almost all the strategic waterway, a conduit for $3 trillion in annual commerce, despite overlapping claims by Indonesia, Malaysia, the Philippines and Vietnam. At a briefing on Tuesday, the Philippine navy said it was 'closely monitoring' three Chinese navy vessels within Manila's maritime zones, including a Jiangkai-class guided missile frigate. 'The presence of People's Liberation Army-Navy reflects the People's Republic of China's complete disregard for international law and undermines the peace and stability in the region,' said navy spokesperson John Percie Alcos. On Monday, state news agency Xinhua said the passage of the Chinese fleet was consistent with international law, quoting a spokesperson of the PLA's Southern Theater Command. An international arbitration tribunal ruled in 2016 that China's claims, based on its historic maps, have no basis under international law, but Beijing does not recognize the decision.	https://www.voanews.com/a/philippines-u-s-hold-joint-air-patrol-over-south-china-sea-angering-china/7962117.html	2025-02-04T01:11:58-08:00

EU leaders agree to step up defense efforts	BRUSSELS — European Union leaders agreed Monday to do more to bolster their defenses against Russia and other threats by hiking spending and filling gaps in their military capabilities. 'A lot has been done already but we need to do more. We need to do it better, stronger, faster - and we need to do it together,' Antonio Costa, the president of the European Council of EU leaders, said after a one-day summit on defense in Brussels. However, the leaders left largely unanswered the question of how their planned surge in defense spending would be paid for. European countries have already ramped up defense spending in recent years, in response to Russia's 2022 invasion of Ukraine and a growing view that they cannot rely so much on the United States to protect the continent in years to come. Their efforts have been fueled by questions about U.S. President Donald Trump's commitment to the NATO security alliance and by his demands for European nations to spend more on the continent's defenses. The start of the EU summit was overshadowed by Trump declaring at the weekend that he will soon impose tariffs on imports from the EU, having ordered similar measures on goods from Canada and Mexico - which were paused on Monday - and from China. The EU leaders agreed to focus on filling critical gaps in their defenses such as air and missile defense, missiles, ammunition and military transport, Costa told reporters. The leaders discussed how such priorities could be funded but did not reach a detailed agreement. The European Commission, however, agreed to look for flexibility in rules it oversees on EU countries' public finances to make defense spending easier. 'Europe needs, basically, a surge in defense. And for that, our defense industrial base must be strengthened,' European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen told reporters after the summit. 'For many, many years, we have under-invested in defense. Thus, there's a great urgency to increase the defense spending with a big magnitude,' she said. NATO Secretary General Mark Rutte and British Prime Minister Keir Starmer also took part in the Brussels talks. Spending hike Last year, EU countries spent an average of 1.9% of GDP on defense, or about $334.5 billion - a 30% increase on 2021, according to EU estimates. But many EU leaders have said they will need to spend even more. The Commission, the EU's executive body, has estimated the bloc may need to spend an extra $510 billion over the next decade to fill the critical gaps in European defenses. Trump has said NATO's European members should spend 5% of GDP on defense - a figure no member of the alliance including the United States currently reaches. Von der Leyen and Costa said the EU had several potential defense-financing options, including national spending, an expanded role for the EU's European Investment Bank and private capital. Leaders avoided directly addressing in public the politically sensitive question of whether the EU should issue joint debt to pay for defense spending. Diplomats say borrowing to finance loans rather than grants for military projects may be a possible compromise.	https://www.voanews.com/a/eu-leaders-agree-to-step-up-defense-efforts/7962096.html	2025-02-04T00:32:55-08:00	
A Russia-like crackdown has jailed dozens in Georgia	Tbilisi, Georgia — Jailed journalist Mzia Amaghlobeli gets weaker every day as her hunger strike has reached three weeks in Rustavi, a town near the Georgian capital of Tbilisi, her lawyer says. Now the 49-year-old is having difficulty walking the short distance from her cell to the room where they usually meet, and human rights officials, colleagues and family fear for her life. Amaghlobeli was arrested Jan. 12 during an anti-government protest in the coastal city of Batumi, one of over 40 people in custody on criminal charges from a series of demonstrations that have hit the South Caucasus nation of 3.7 million in recent months. The political turmoil follows a parliamentary election that was won by the ruling Georgian Dream party, although its opponents allege the vote was rigged. Its outcome pushed Georgia further into Russia's orbit of influence. Georgia aspired to join the European Union, but the party suspended accession talks with the bloc after the election. As it sought to cement its grip on power, Georgian Dream has cracked down on freedom of assembly and expression in what the opposition says is similar to President Vladimir Putin's actions in neighboring Russia, its former imperial ruler. Accusations of fomenting revolution Prime Minister Irakli Kobakhidze defended the actions of his government, accusing the protesters of seeking 'to inflict harm on the state' and trying to stage a revolution akin to the uprising in Ukraine in 2014 that ousted a pro-Kremlin leader. Georgian Dream last year adopted a series of laws similar to ones in Russia imposing restrictions on rights groups and media outlets and severely curtailing LGBTQ+ rights. Those laws, condemned by the EU, also drew protests. Amaghlobeli, founder of two prominent independent media outlets in Georgia, faces charges of assaulting a police officer, with a possible prison sentence of up to seven years. Many of those detained by police have reported being abused physically and verbally by police or while in detention. International human rights groups are sounding the alarm. 'All of that paints a picture of an aggressive campaign to halt these demonstrations of which the large majority are reported to have been peaceful,' Alice Jill Edwards, the U.N. special rapporteur on torture and other cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment, told The Associated Press. Allegations of abuse in custody A video released by the media showed Amaghlobeli slapping Batumi's police chief in the protest. Witnesses and her lawyers say police physically and verbally abused her beforehand, and the slap was her reaction to it. The abuse continued while in custody, when the police chief 'spat in Mzia’s face and denied her access to drinking water or using the toilet,' her lawyer, Juba Sikharulidze, told AP. Authorities were investigating the accusations, the lawyer said. The Interior Ministry has not responded to an AP request for comment. Kobakhidze has said authorities would investigate any excessive use of force, but in Amaghlobeli’s case, her actions came 'in front of cameras.' 'This crime is absolutely clear,' the prime minister said. Amaghlobeli, who founded the independent media sites Batumelebi and Netgazeti, began a hunger strike in protest, and now Georgian and Western rights advocates say her life is in danger. Michael O’Flaherty, the Council of Europe’s commissioner for human rights, told Radio Free Europe/Radio Liberty that Amaghlobeli’s situation 'requires urgent action.' 'This is not just a matter of freedom and imprisonment – this is a matter of life and death. And I very much hope that the authorities will act with the necessary speed in this extremely difficult situation,' O’Flaherty was quoted by the outlet as saying. Amaghlobeli's arrest has had a chilling effect on other journalists, said Nestan Tsetskhladze, editor of Netgazeti. 'If this is how they are treating the founder of the most prominent independent media, a director and media manager who is free from any political influences and influential groups, others can be treated the same way or even worse,' Tsetskhladze told AP. Prominent actor sees a Kafkaesque scene Another prominent Georgian jailed for taking part in protests is Andro Chichinadze, a theater and film actor. Chichinazde, 28, actively participated in the protests that reignited in November. Police raided his home and arrested him Dec. 5, and he faces charges of 'participating in group violence,' punishable by up to nine years in prison. His lawyers say prosecutors have videos of Chichinadze swinging a stick and throwing a bottle, which they allege was hurled at him by police. They also say there is no evidence he hit anyone and no one has come forward as a victim of his alleged violence. Chichinadze denied the accusations. At a pre-trial detention hearing, he compared himself to a 'Kafka character who is on trial and could not figure out what is happening to him.' His mother, Lika Guntsadze, called the case against her son 'absurd, just absurd' in an interview with AP. Plans for harsher penalties More arrests — so far on petty 'administrative' charges punishable by fines or short stints in jail — took place over the weekend, during continued demonstrations in Tbilisi. On Monday, police said a total of 31 people had been detained. According to media reports, some were released shortly afterward. Many reported physical abuse by police both during their arrest and after being taken into police vans, according to the office of Georgia's Public Defender, a human rights ombudsman elected by parliament. Georgian Dream announced plans Monday to adopt harsher punishment for both criminal and administrative offenses that protesters can be accused of, including increased jail time, higher fines and prison terms. Eka Gigauri, executive director of Transparency International Georgia, told AP she believed the government was 'using the Russian and Belarusian playbook' in targeting government opponents. 'There is nothing new in how they attack the civic activists,' she said. 'This was happening in Russia years ago.' The mother of Andro Chichinadze, the actor who was arrested, echoed this sentiment, in describing the crackdown that followed Georgia's aspirations to join the EU. 'We chose Europe and were taken to Russia,' Lika Guntsadze said.	https://www.voanews.com/a/a-russia-like-crackdown-has-jailed-dozens-in-georgia/7962094.html	2025-02-04T00:30:10-08:00	
France pitches AI summit as 'wake-up call' for Europe	PARIS — France hosts top tech players next week at an artificial intelligence summit meant as a 'wake-up call' for Europe as it struggles with AI challenges from the United States and China. Players from across the sector and representatives from 80 nations will gather in the French capital on February 10 and 11 in the sumptuous Grand Palais, built for the 1900 Universal Exhibition. In the run-up, President Emmanuel Macron will on Feb. 4 visit research centers applying AI to science and health, before hosting scientists and Nobel Prize winners at his Elysee Palace residence on Wednesday. A wider science conference will be held at the Polytechnique engineering school on Thursday and Friday. 'The summit comes at exactly the right time for this wake-up call for France and Europe, and to show we are in position' to take advantage of the technology, an official in Macron's office told reporters. In recent weeks, Washington's announcement of $500 billion in investment to build up AI infrastructure and the release of a frugal but powerful generative AI model by Chinese firm DeepSeek have focused minds in Europe. France must 'not let this revolution pass it by,' Macron's office said. Attendees at the summit will include Sam Altman, head of OpenAI -- the firm that brought generative models to public consciousness in 2022 with the launch of ChatGPT. Google boss Sundar Pichai and Nobel Prize winner Demis Hassabis, who leads the company's DeepMind AI research unit, will also come, alongside Arthur Mensch, founder of French AI developer Mistral. The Elysee has said there are 'talks' on hosting DeepSeek founder Liang Wenfeng, and has yet to clarify whether X owner Elon Musk -- who has his own generative initiative, xAI -- has accepted an invitation. Nor is it clear who will attend from the United States and China, with the French presidency saying only 'very high level' representatives will come. Confirmed guests from Europe include European Commission chief Ursula von der Leyen and German Chancellor Olaf Scholz. 'Stoke confidence' The tone of the AI summit will be 'neither catastrophizing, nor naive,' Macron's AI envoy Anne Bouverot told AFP. Hosting the conference is also an opportunity for Paris to show off its own AI ecosystem, which numbers around 750 companies. Macron's office has said the summit would see the announcement of 'massive' investments along the lines of his annual 'Choose France' business conference, at which $15.4 billion of inward investment were pledged in 2024. Beyond the economic opportunities, AI's impact on culture including artistic creativity and news production will be discussed in a side-event over the weekend. Debates open to the public, such as that one, are aimed at showing off 'positive use cases for AI' to 'stoke confidence and speed up adoption' of the technology, said France's digital minister Clara Chappaz. For now, the French public is skeptical of AI, with 79 percent of respondents telling pollsters Ifop they were 'concerned' about the technology in a recent survey. More 'inclusive' AI? Paris says it also hopes the summit can help kick off its vision of a more ethical and accessible and less resource-intensive AI. At present, 'the AI under development is pushed by a few large players from a few countries,' Bouverot said, whereas France wants 'to promote more inclusive development.' Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi has been invited to co-host the Paris summit, in a push to bring governments on board. One of the summit's aims is the establishment of a public-interest foundation for which Paris aims to raise $2.5 billion over five years. The effort would be 'a public-private partnership between various governments, businesses and philanthropic foundations from different countries,' Macron's office said. Paris hopes at the summit to chart different efforts at AI governance around the world and gather commitments for environmentally sustainable AI -- although no binding mechanism is planned for now. 'There are lots of big principles emerging around responsible, trustworthy AI, but it's not clear or easy to implement for the engineers in technical terms,' said Laure de Roucy-Rochegonde, director of the geopolitical technology center at the French Institute for International Relations.	https://www.voanews.com/a/france-pitches-ai-summit-as-wake-up-call-for-europe/7962090.html	2025-02-04T00:19:33-08:00	
Rice stockpile eyed as Japan PM orders swift relief from rising prices	TOKYO — Japanese Prime Minister Shigeru Ishiba has ordered the swift implementation of measures to give consumers relief from inflated food prices, including an unprecedented release of stockpiled rice to bring down costs, a minister said on Tuesday. At a news conference, Economy Minister Ryosei Akazawa said Ishiba had instructed the cabinet to proceed quickly with countermeasures as the prices of rice, vegetables and other living costs have soared in recent months. 'Citizens are suffering greatly and feeling pain,' he said, noting that the elevated price of rice had been unexpected. The average transaction price of rice produced last year jumped 55% to $153 per 60 kg, from the previous year, according to government data. The agriculture ministry last week agreed on a new policy that would allow the government to sell stockpiled rice to farm cooperatives on the condition that the buyers would sell back the equivalent amount to the government within a year. It would be the first time stockpiled rice has been released to bring down prices. Details such as the sale price and timing are yet to be decided, a ministry official said on Tuesday. Japanese consumer prices rose 3.6% in December from the previous year, marking the biggest jump in almost two years, while the share of households' spending on food hit a four-decade high last year.	https://www.voanews.com/a/rice-stockpile-eyed-as-japan-pm-orders-swift-relief-from-rising-prices/7962066.html	2025-02-03T22:36:10-08:00	
Trump hosting Netanyahu for White House talks amid Gaza ceasefire	U.S. President Donald Trump is set to host Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu for talks Tuesday at the White House with Israel’s ceasefire with Hamas militants in the Gaza Strip at the top of the agenda. The talks come at a key phase in the ceasefire. Israel and Hamas have less than four weeks to agree on the terms of the second phase, which would include the release of all remaining hostages held in Gaza, a permanent halt in fighting and Israel’s withdrawal from the territory. 'I have no guarantees that the peace is going to hold,' Trump told reporters Monday. Ahead of the White House visit, Netanyahu met Monday with U.S. Middle East envoy Steve Witkoff, who was part of the push to secure the ceasefire deal. Netanyahu’s office said in a statement that the meeting was 'positive and friendly,' and that he would meet with his Security Cabinet upon returning from the U.S. in order to 'discus Israel’s overall positions regarding the second stage of the deal.' Witkoff is expected to hold talks with Qatari and Egyptian officials as the three countries continue in their role of mediating the halt in fighting. In addition to the ceasefire, Netanyahu said he and Trump would discuss countering Iranian aggression and expanding diplomatic relations with Arab countries. Trump brokered normalization agreements between Israel and four Arab countries in his first term. He now is seeking a wider agreement in which Israel would forge ties with Saudi Arabia. But Saudi Arabia has said it would only agree to such a deal if the war in Gaza ends and there is a credible pathway to a Palestinian state in Gaza, the West Bank and east Jerusalem, territories Israel captured in the 1967 Middle East war. The U.S. supports Palestinian statehood, but Netanyahu's government is opposed. Hamas, a U.S.-designated terror group, has released 18 hostages so far, while Israel has freed hundreds of Palestinian prisoners. The war in Gaza began with the Oct. 7, 2023, attack in which Hamas militants killed 1,200 people and took about 250 people hostage. Israel’s counteroffensive during 15 months of warfare has killed more than 47,500 Palestinians, more than half of them women and children. Israel’s military says the death toll includes 17,000 militants it has killed.

S. Korea wants to rebuild air safety system after crash, fire	SEOUL, South Korea — South Korea aims to rebuild its aviation safety system from scratch, the transport ministry said on Tuesday, launching a new committee to improve air travel in the country that suffered two major aviation incidents a month apart. 'In order to restore trust in our country's aviation safety system, the government will make a determined effort to rebuild the aviation safety system from the ground up,' Deputy Minister of Land, Infrastructure and Transport Baek Won-kuk will tell the committee, the ministry statement said. The government must address aviation safety as a top priority, he added. In the deadliest air disaster ever on South Korean soil, a plane belonging to budget airline Jeju Air crashed at the country's Muan airport on Dec. 29, killing all but two of the 181 passengers and crew members on board. Duck remains were found in both engines of the plane, a preliminary investigation report said, indicating bird strikes occurred before the crash. Air accidents are nearly always caused by a combination of factors, according to experts. Last week, an Air Busan plane was engulfed in flames at Busan's international airport as the low-cost carrier's jet prepared to depart, with all on board evacuated safely. The fire was first detected by a flight attendant in an overhead luggage bin in the rear of the plane, Air Busan has said. Investigations into the causes of both incidents are ongoing. The 10-week committee will include private sector experts and will look at issues including maintenance and aircraft utilization rates at budget airlines, and airport construction and operation. In response to the Jeju Air crash, which saw the plane belly land but then plow into a concrete embankment supporting navigation equipment past the end of Muan's runway, authorities already said they would amend similar structures at seven airports around the country.	https://www.voanews.com/a/s-korea-wants-to-rebuild-air-safety-system-after-crash-fire-/7962057.html	2025-02-03T21:53:43-08:00	
US tariffs on Chinese goods go into effect	New U.S. tariffs on Chinese goods went into effect Tuesday, a day after U.S. President Donald Trump backed off plans to impose tariffs on Mexican and Canadian goods. The new 10% duty that Trump announced Saturday is a first step in pressuring China, the president said Monday. China has said it would take countermeasures in response to the tariff, including action at the World Trade Organization. Trump pledged to impose the tariff to push China to take action to prevent fentanyl smuggling into the United States. The U.S. government has identified China as a major source of the precursor chemicals used by Mexican drug cartels to manufacture fentanyl. China has said it has taken steps to crack down on the industry and illicit drug trade. 'China hopefully is going to stop sending us fentanyl, and if they're not, the tariffs are going to go substantially higher,' Trump said. White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt said Monday that Trump would speak with Chinese President Xi Jinping in the coming days. Trump on Monday announced a one-month pause for the 25% tariffs on Mexican and Canadian goods after he spoke with Mexican President Claudia Sheinbaum and Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau. Sheinbaum said she would dispatch 10,000 National Guard troops to try to curb the flow of fentanyl into the United States. 'Mexico will reinforce the northern border … to stop drug trafficking from Mexico to the United States, in particular fentanyl,' Sheinbaum posted on X after talking with Trump. 'The United States commits to work to stop the trafficking of high-powered weapons to Mexico.' The Mexican leader added that the two countries would continue talks on security and trade and that 'the tariffs are put on pause for a month from now.' Trudeau said Canada would deploy new technology and personnel along its border with the United States to stop the flow of fentanyl. 'I just had a good call with President Trump,' Trudeau said on X. 'Proposed tariffs will be paused for at least 30 days while we work together.' Both Sheinbaum and Trudeau, representing two of the three biggest U.S. trading partners along with China, protested Trump’s tariff plans and vowed to retaliate. Kevin Hassett, director of the White House National Economic Council, said Monday that it was misleading to characterize the showdown over tariffs as a trade war, despite the planned retaliations from Mexico, Canada and China and the risk of escalation. 'Read the executive order where President Trump was absolutely, 100% clear that this is not a trade war,' Hassett said. 'This is a drug war.' Trump acknowledged Sunday that the new tariffs on the three biggest U.S. trading partners could hit inflation-weary Americans with higher prices for groceries, gasoline, cars and other consumer goods, but said the higher tariffs would be 'worth the price' to bolster U.S. interests. U.S. consumers could face higher prices because companies that pay the tariffs to the federal government to import goods from other countries then often pass on at least part, if not all, of their higher costs to consumers, rather than absorb their extra expenses themselves. Tensions ramped up Monday with the leader of Canada's most populous province of Ontario announcing that he is ending a contract with Elon Musk's Starlink internet services in response to Trump's new tariff on Canada. Musk, possibly the world’s richest man, is a key Trump adviser seeking to sharply cut U.S. government spending and trim the ranks of 2.3 million federal civilian workforce through buyouts. Ontario Premier Doug Ford, who said he is also banning American companies from provincial contracts, signed a $68 million deal with Musk's company in November to deliver high-speed internet to remote residents in rural and northern Ontario. 'We'll be ripping up the province's contract with Starlink. Ontario won't do business with people hellbent on destroying our economy,' Ford said in a post on X.

Rwanda-backed rebels in DRC declare a unilateral ceasefire	GOMA, Democratic Republic of Congo — The Rwanda-backed rebels who seized eastern Democratic Republic of Congo’s key city of Goma announced a unilateral ceasefire in the region Monday for humanitarian reasons, following calls for a safe corridor for aid and hundreds of thousands of displaced people. The M23 rebels said the ceasefire would start Tuesday. The announcement came shortly after the U.N. health agency said at least 900 people were killed in last week’s fighting in Goma between the rebels and Congolese forces. The city of 2 million people is at the heart of a region home to trillions of dollars in mineral wealth and remains in rebel control. The M23 were reported to be gaining ground in other areas of eastern Congo and advancing on another provincial capital, Bukavu. But the rebels said Monday they did not intend to seize Bukavu, though they earlier expressed ambition to march on Congo's capital, Kinshasa, a thousand miles away. 'It must be made clear that we have no intention of capturing Bukavu or other areas. However, we reiterate our commitment to protecting and defending the civilian population and our positions,' M23 rebel spokesman Lawrence Kanyuka said in a statement. There was no immediate comment from Congo's government. The rebels' announcement came ahead of a joint summit this week by the regional blocs for southern and eastern Africa, which have called for a ceasefire. Kenya’s President William Ruto said the presidents of Congo and Rwanda would attend. Foreign ministers from the Group of Seven advanced economies, or G7, urged parties in the conflict to return to negotiations. In a statement on Monday, they called for a 'rapid, safe and unimpeded passage of humanitarian relief for civilians.' Congolese authorities have said they are open to talks to resolve the conflict, but that such a dialogue must be done within the context of previous peace agreements. Rwanda and the rebels have accused the Congo government of defaulting on previous agreements. The M23 rebels are backed by some 4,000 troops from neighboring Rwanda, according to U.N. experts, far more than in 2012 when they first briefly captured Goma then withdrew after international pressure. They are the most potent of the more than 100 armed groups vying for control in Congo’s east, which holds vast deposits critical to much of the world’s technology. The latest fighting forced hundreds of thousands of people who had been displaced by years of conflict to carry what remained of their belongings and flee again. Thousands poured into nearby Rwanda. The fighting in Congo has connections with a decades-long ethnic conflict. M23 says it is defending ethnic Tutsis in Congo. Rwanda has claimed the Tutsis are being persecuted by Hutus and former militias responsible for the 1994 genocide of 800,000 Tutsis and others in Rwanda. Many Hutus fled to Congo after the genocide and founded the Democratic Forces for the Liberation of Rwanda militia group. Rwanda said the group is 'fully integrated' into the Congolese military, which denies the charges. On Monday, families desperate to identify their loved ones besieged morgues as body bags were loaded onto trucks for burials in Goma. A weeping Chiza Nyenyezi recalled how her son died from a gunshot injury after a bullet went through his chest. 'His entire chest was open,' Nyenyezi said. Louise Shalukoma said her son’s body could not be immediately recovered from the streets because a bomb detonated as people tried to retrieve it. 'My God, my fourth child, when I saw that he was dead I said, ‘Lord, what am I going to do?’' she lamented. 'This M23 war came for me in Goma.'	https://www.voanews.com/a/rwanda-backed-rebels-in-drc-declare-a-unilateral-ceasefire-/7962050.html	2025-02-03T20:52:18-08:00	
US, El Salvador reach 'unprecedented' deal to curb illegal immigration	STATE DEPARTMENT — The United States and El Salvador have reached what U.S. Secretary of State Marco Rubio called 'the most unprecedented and extraordinary' deal to further curb illegal immigration. After about three hours of meetings with Salvadoran President Nayib Bukele at his residence in Lake Coatepeque, San Salvador, Rubio said that Bukele has offered to house dangerous American criminals in Salvadoran jails, including U.S. citizens and legal residents. Bukele has also 'agreed to accept for deportation any illegal aliens in the United States' who are criminals, regardless of nationality, in addition to fully cooperating on the repatriation of Salvadorans who are in the United States illegally, Rubio told reporters. Rubio visited El Salvador on Monday to address illegal migration and other strategic issues. The State Department said Rubio also raised strategies to counter the influence of the Chinese Communist Party in the Western Hemisphere to safeguard the sovereignty and interests of both nations and the region. His visit comes amid the restructuring of a U.S. agency overseeing foreign aid, which has sparked a showdown between congressional Democrats and President Donald Trump’s administration. Rubio announced that he is now the acting administrator of the U.S. Agency for International Development but has delegated his authority to another official. He stressed that the agency must align U.S. foreign aid with national interests and comply with State Department policy directives. Late Monday, the United States and El Salvador also signed a memorandum of understanding, or MOU, on civil nuclear cooperation, expanding strategic relations between the two nations. The State Department said the MOU marks an initial step toward building a robust civil nuclear partnership, aiming to enhance energy security and foster economic cooperation. Curtailing illegal immigration Bukele is regarded as a key ally of the United States in its regional efforts to address the migration crisis. On Oct. 7, 2024, the United States and El Salvador signed a Customs Mutual Assistance Agreement, further strengthening border security and facilitating trade between the two countries. El Salvador was once the third-largest source of nationals captured at the U.S. southwest border. Today, it no longer ranks among the top 10. Chinese influence U.S. President Trump has maintained warm relations with Salvadoran President Bukele, who also strengthened ties with Chinese President Xi Jinping following his state visit to Beijing in December 2019. During Bukele’s visit, China promised millions in development projects for the Central American country through a series of agreements. Among them were a soccer stadium, a national library, a tourist pier, and funding for water treatment improvements. In April 2024, China and El Salvador began negotiations on a free trade agreement, though the United States remains El Salvador’s primary trading partner. El Salvador formally recognized the People's Republic of China on Aug. 21, 2018, severing diplomatic ties with Taiwan. Panama Earlier Monday, Rubio observed a U.S.-funded deportation flight departing from Albrook International Airport in Panama, returning dozens of undocumented Colombians to their home country. A total of 32 men and 11 women were repatriated, including seven individuals with criminal records. The top U.S. diplomat said it sent 'a clear message' that people who sought to enter the U.S. border irregularly would be stopped and sent back to their countries of origin. On July 1, 2024, the first day of Panamanian President José Raúl Mulino’s term, the U.S. and Panama signed a memorandum of understanding aimed at jointly reducing the number of migrants illegally crossing through Panama’s Darién region en route to the United States. The program is funded by the U.S. State Department and implemented by the Department of Homeland Security. Monday’s deportation was carried out under the MOU and following a State Department waiver that lifted a previous pause on U.S. foreign aid. 'This is an effective way to stem the flow of illegal migration, of mass migration, which is destructive and destabilizing,' Rubio told reporters at the Albrook International Airport. 'This flight today was possible due to a waiver that we've issued,' he added. 'We’re going to issue a broader one to continue this cooperation.' Under the 2024 MOU, the United States has provided nearly $2.7 million to fund flights and tickets to repatriate migrants to their countries of origin. Since the first repatriation flight on August 20, 2024, over 40 charter flights have been conducted from Panama to more than 14 countries, returning more than 1,700 undocumented migrants. Destinations have included Colombia, Ecuador, India, and Vietnam. Panama recently reported a 90% decrease in migrants crossing the Darién region compared to the same period last year. Canal controversy On Sunday, Rubio warned Panama that Washington will 'take necessary measures' if Panama does not take immediate steps to end what U.S. President Donald Trump described as China's 'influence and control' over the Panama Canal. 'Secretary Rubio made clear that this status quo is unacceptable,' State Department spokesperson Tammy Bruce said in a statement after Rubio’s talks with Mulino. Mulino also announced that Panama has decided not to renew a 2017 memorandum with China on Beijing’s Belt and Road Initiative and will seek to void agreements with the Chinese government before their official expiration dates. 'We'll study the possibility of terminating it early,' Mulino added on Sunday. The Belt and Road Initiative, or BRI, is a massive infrastructure project launched by China in 2013 under President Xi Jinping, aiming to connect multiple continents through land and maritime routes. The United States has cautioned that the BRI 'is fueled by China's mission to manipulate and undermine the global rules-based trading system for its own benefit.' At the United Nations, Chinese Ambassador Fu Cong dismissed the accusations against China as 'totally false' and 'pointless.' He said that China has never participated in the management or operation of the Panama Canal nor interfered in its affairs. He also reaffirmed respect for Panama’s sovereignty and the canal’s status as a neutral international gateway. The Chinese ambassador further called Panama’s decision not to renew the BRI agreement 'regrettable.' After visiting Panama and El Salvador, Rubio will travel to Costa Rica on Tuesday, followed by stops in Guatemala and the Dominican Republic.

Scientists hope these tiny froglets can save their species	LONDON — It was quite the journey for such tiny froglets: traveling thousands of miles from the forests of southern Chile to London, carried and brooded inside their fathers' vocal sacs for safety. London Zoo said Monday that 33 endangered Darwin's frogs, named after scientist Charles Darwin, who discovered the species, were born in their new home as part of a rescue mission to save the species from extinction. Known populations of Darwin's frogs have suffered a 90% decline within a year since a deadly disease known as chytrid fungus arrived in 2023 in their habitat, the Parque Tantauco forests in southern Chile. The fungus has affected hundreds of amphibian species around the world. The creatures have a unique reproductive strategy: after the females lay eggs, the male frogs protect and rear the tiny tadpoles inside their distensible vocal sacs for them to develop in safety. A team of conservationists traveled to Chile's forests in October in search of healthy Darwin's frogs free of the infectious disease. They collected 52 frogs, which were then placed in climate-controlled boxes for a 11,265-kilometer ride by boat, car and plane to their new home in London. Of the group, 11 male frogs — each measuring under 3 centimeters — carried 33 tadpoles that were born at the zoo. 'We knew we were embarking on something special — the clock was ticking, and we needed to act quickly if we were going to save these frogs,' said Ben Tapley, curator of amphibians at London Zoo. He said the successful parent-rearing of the froglets was a 'powerful symbol of hope for the species.' The frogs are now kept in pairs inside dozens of glass tanks filled with moss and with temperatures that mimic their natural habitat. Keepers said the zoo will set up a breeding program for them, and any frogs they breed may later be reintroduced into the wild. Andres Valenzuela-Sanchez, a researcher at ZSL, the conservation charity behind London Zoo, said the project will ensure the species has a fighting chance of recovery. 'These frogs are not only vital for the future of their species but also help us better understand how we can combat chytrid fungus and safeguard other amphibians globally,' he said.	https://www.voanews.com/a/scientists-hope-these-tiny-froglets-can-save-their-species-/7962025.html	2025-02-03T19:23:57-08:00	
Trump suggests Ukraine’s rare minerals as condition for continued support	U.S. President Donald Trump said he would possibly be interested in continuing U.S. aid to Ukraine in exchange for access to Ukraine’s rare earth minerals. 'We’re looking to do a deal with Ukraine where they’re going to secure what we’re giving them with their rare earth and other things,' Trump said Monday in the Oval Office. Trump has indicated Ukraine is open to the possibility of an agreement of delivering rare earth minerals to the U.S. in exchange for the continuation of U.S. aid to Ukraine for its war against Russia, according to an Associated Press report. 'We’re putting in hundreds of billions of dollars. They have great rare earth. And I want security of the rare earth, and they’re willing to do it,' the U.S. president said. Rare earth minerals like those in Ukraine, include lithium and titanium. They are essential for an array of modern high-tech products. In his daily address Monday, before Trump’s announcement, Ukraine’s president reiterated the country’s need to defend itself against Russia’s ongoing attacks. He said Russia is 'focusing primarily' on Ukraine’s energy sector. 'They continue their attacks, constantly adjusting their strikes to the capabilities of our defense, making them more difficult to repel,' Volodymyr Zelenskyy said. 'There is a constant rapid evolution of electronic warfare,' the president said and urged Ukraine to 'be much faster' in adjusting to the continuous changes. The supply of air defense systems for Ukraine is another issue for the Eastern European country. Zelenskyy said that the supplies are 'critical and must not stop.' 'We must constantly search worldwide for ways to strengthen defense, increase production of necessary equipment in Ukraine, expand localization of production and obtain licenses from our partners,' the president said. 'This is a huge undertaking, and much of Ukraine’s future depends on it.' Zelenskyy also said in his daily address that he talked Monday with Ukraine’s military Commander in Chief Oleksandr Syrskyi about modernizing the country’s armed forces. As part of that discussion, the two men also talked about appointing corps commanders who 'must be the most prepared, most promising officers, with combat experience and [a] modern mindset.' While the president said, 'The army must be modern,' he also said, 'most importantly, it must value its people.' Earlier Monday, Russian officials said that Ukrainian drone attacks targeted energy facilities in two regions in southwestern Russia. Volgograd Governor Andrei Bocharov said falling debris from drones destroyed by Russian air defenses sparked fires at an oil refinery. Astrakhan Governor Igor Babushkin said the Ukrainian attacks focused on fuel and energy facilities, starting a fire in his region but causing no casualties. The officials did not give details about the sites involved in the attacks. Russia’s Defense Ministry said Monday it shot down 70 Ukrainian drones overnight, including over the Rostov, Volgograd, Astrakhan, Voronezh, Belgorod and Kursk regions. Belgorod Governor Vyacheslav Gladkov said on Telegram the attacks damaged three houses and an agricultural business. Ukraine’s military said Monday it destroyed 38 of the 71 drones that Russian forces launched in overnight attacks. The intercepts took place over the Cherkasy, Chernihiv, Dnipropetrovsk, Kharkiv, Khmelnytskyi, Kyiv, Poltava, Sumy, Vinnytsia and Zaporizhzhia regions. Cherkasy Governor Ihor Taburets said on Telegram that falling drone debris damaged four residential buildings. Kharkiv Governor Oleh Syniehubov reported the Russian attack damaged a school.

Ecuador's Noboa closes borders ahead of presidential election	QUITO, ECUADOR — Ecuadorian President Daniel Noboa has announced the closure of Ecuador's borders starting Saturday for three days, including the first round of the presidential election on Sunday in which he is a candidate. 'Faced with attempts at destabilization by armed groups, from Saturday 8 to Monday 10 February, the borders will remain closed,' the leader declared on his social media X account Monday. The 37-year-old head of state also decided to strengthen the military presence in border areas and to 'immediately militarize the ports.' On Saturday, Daniel Noboa spoke of the arrest by his security team of 12 people dressed in police and army uniforms, carrying rifles, ammunition and equipped with a drone, while he was campaigning for his reelection, speaking of 'narco-terrorists' seeking to 'destabilize' the country. Noboa, the son of a billionaire banana king, came to power in November 2023 to complete the 18-month term of his predecessor Guillermo Lasso, who had called early elections to avoid his impeachment amid corruption accusations. In January 2024, the young president declared the country in 'internal armed conflict' after the escape of a powerful drug lord from a Guayaquil prison sparked a wave of violence. In Ecuador, at least twenty gangs are dedicated to drug trafficking, kidnapping and extortion, sowing terror and death in this country of 17 million inhabitants. Located on the Pacific and with a dollarized economy, Ecuador — once considered a haven amid Peru and Colombia, the world's largest cocaine producers — has in recent years become a logistical hub for drug shipments. Gang conflicts have sparked unprecedented violence there. In 2023, the country recorded a record rate of 47 homicides per 100,000 people. Through states of emergency including the deployment of the army in the streets, the Noboa government claims to have reduced this homicide rate to 38 by 2024. The liberal president and his left-wing opponent, lawyer Luisa Gonzalez, are due to face off again at the polls Sunday for the first round of the presidential election in Ecuador, after a first electoral contest in October 2023 won by Noboa with 52.1% of the vote. Indigenous leader Leonidas Iza is also a candidate.	https://www.voanews.com/a/ecuador-s-noboa-closes-borders-ahead-of-presidential-election-/7961641.html	2025-02-03T18:30:01-08:00

Rubio in El Salvador to push US migration crackdown, counter China's growing influence	STATE DEPARTMENT — U.S. Secretary of State Marco Rubio visited El Salvador on Monday to press the country to stem the flow of illegal migration and address other strategic issues.

American bald eagles are having a moment, ecologically, culturally	WEST ORANGE, New Jersey — Along the long road from American icon to endangered species and back again, the bald eagle — the national bird of the United States, often seen against a clear blue sky — is having a moment. The eagles find themselves in an environmental updraft of sorts since the early 2000s, when the federal government took the thriving birds off its endangered species list with more states following suit. Culturally, too, the animals are soaring. In December, Joe Biden signed legislation making the raptor the country's national bird (thought that was already the case? More in a bit). New Jersey became the latest state to delist the bald eagle as endangered in January, citing a remarkable comeback for the creatures associated with strength and independence — and that occupied just a single nest in the state decades ago. And to the chagrin or elation of football fans, the Philadelphia Eagles will be vying for a championship in the Super Bowl this weekend. How did the storied birds find their way back? As with so many tales, it's complex. Their well-being was intertwined with an insecticide The story — there was a single nesting pair in New Jersey in the 1980s and roughly 300 now, for instance — centers on the banning of DDT, a chemical insecticide with environmental side effects that included thin-shelled eagle eggs. That touched off a cratering in the number of eagles across the country, and officials prohibited the pesticide in 1972. To rebuild the birds' numbers in their historic range across the country, conservationists imported birds from places where their populations were stable, including from Canada. Early on, they also removed eggs from nesting birds' nests, replacing them with artificial ones for the eagles to 'incubate' while the real eggs were safely hatched outside the nest before being returned, as eaglets for their parents to raise according to Kathy Clark, the head of New Jersey's Endangered and Nongame Species Program. 'They’re one of the few conservation success stories of animals that almost went extinct on our continent. And so, I think now it’s really important to make sure people know that story and learn from it,' said Maia Edwards, the science director at the American Bald Eagle Foundation in Alaska. Clark, whose work with the birds spans decades and includes the period when their numbers were so small they lived only in a remote part of the state, said the eagles have taught officials a number of lessons. One is that they're 'fairly adaptable' and now live across densely populated (with people) New Jersey — from suburban Bergen County near New York to the wetlands along the shore in the south. She recalled the story of one fledgling eagle in a suburban town — New York Giants territory, as it were, sorry, Eagles fans — that found itself on a backyard woodpile and walking around the street. Volunteer observers worried over the bird's well-being, given the realities of suburban living. But a year later, observers spotted the eagle, identified by a band. It had apparently made it. 'Those birds that, you know, have that tolerance to live like in such a densely human structured environment is something I have a hard time understanding,' she said. 'They're Jersey birds. You got to have attitude, right?' The birds do face dangers as they expand into suburbia, though. Jilian Fazio, director of the Essex County Turtle Back Zoo in suburban northern New Jersey, said the zoo rescues a number of birds hit by cars. There are threats, as well. Habitat preservation and clean, open water, since the eagles feed heavily on fish, is a worry, but there's also the current outbreak of avian influenza or bird flu. Clark says officials are going to maintain surveillance amid the outbreak. A resurgence in popularity, too Beyond the birds coming off endangered lists, they made headlines recently for finally getting their due as the county's national bird, an oversight left undone in law because the bald eagle was already on the national seal and many thought it already had that status, said Sen. Amy Klobuchar of Minnesota, who sponsored legislation that Biden signed last month. She and colleagues worked with Native American and veterans' groups to get buy-in for the legislation, she said, and it passed the typically divisive House and Senate last year with no dissent. The birds are revered in several Native American cultures as symbols of strength, particularly in the Pacific Northwest, according to Paul Apodaca, a retired academic who specializes in folklore and mythology. The eagles' perch as symbols of the country contributes to their conservation, with experts considering them an 'umbrella species,' whose need for large open spaces and waterways helps preserve lesser-known wildlife. 'Americans are always going to have that sort of personal relationship with bald eagles,' Clark said. New Jersey Sen. Andy Kim, a native of Philadelphia Eagles territory, took his two young sons to the NFC championship game last week, a memory he said they won't forget. 'Let's never forget that Bald Eagle was officially named America's national bird at the same time the Eagles are headed back to the Super Bowl,' he said in a text message. Experiencing seeing a bird in the wild or even as you're driving along a business-lined highway can leave an impression. Dan Day, a birder who's spotted bald eagles some 50 times in recent years both on nature walks and just driving around suburban New Jersey, remembered never having seen the birds as a kid growing up in Cleveland. Now a New Jersey resident and Philadelphia Eagles fan, he regularly goes out in his green 'Birds' cap and binoculars. 'Just the mere thrill of seeing one — a lot of people just have never, ever looked at one,' he said. 'It really elevates your day to see a bald eagle.' Enjoy watching them, experts say, but give them space, too. Because rescuing animals threatened with extinction is expensive, uncertain work. Said Clark, the New Jersey Department of Environmental Protection official: 'I don’t think I ever will lose that perspective of, of being on the brink there, not knowing if... if you’re going to be able to save the species.'	https://www.voanews.com/a/american-bald-eagles-are-having-a-moment-ecologically-culturally/7961976.html	2025-02-03T17:28:04-08:00	
1714 Stradivarius violin could become most expensive instrument ever auctioned	NEW YORK — A violin made by the famed Antonio Stradivari in 1714 has the potential to become the most expensive musical instrument ever sold when it goes up for auction Friday at Sotheby's in New York. The auction house is estimating the value of the 'Joachim-Ma Stradivarius' at $12 million to $18 million. If it sells at the top end of that range, it could best the $15.9 million paid in 2011 for another Stradivarius, the 'Lady Blunt,' made in 1721 and named by Guinness World Records as the most expensive instrument ever sold at auction. Mari-Claudia Jimenez, Sotheby’s Americas president and head of global business, said Stradivari made the violin during his 'Golden Period,' which began around 1700 and was marked by an improvement in his craftmanship. 'So, this is the peak of his output,' Jimenez said. 'This is the best violin of this era.' Sotheby's says the violin's preservation is remarkable, and its ownership history extraordinary. It's named for two of its famed owners — violin virtuosos Joseph Joachim of Hungary, who lived from 1831 to 1907, and Si-Hon Ma, who was born in China in 1926, moved to the U.S. in 1948 and died 2009. It is believed that legendary composer Johannes Brahms was influenced by the Joachim-Ma when he wrote his 'Violin Concerto in D Major' because of its rich, resonant tone, and that Joachim played that violin during the concerto's 1879 premiere, according to Sotheby's. Ma acquired the violin in 1969, and his estate gifted it to the New England Conservatory in Boston after his death. Ma attended the conservatory, where he earned a master's degree in 1950. The conservatory is now putting the violin up for auction, with all the proceeds going to student scholarships.	https://www.voanews.com/a/stradivarius-violin-could-become-most-expensive-instrument-ever-auctioned/7961965.html	2025-02-03T17:12:50-08:00	
Trump administration opens antisemitism inquiries at 5 colleges, including Columbia and Berkeley	The Trump administration is opening new investigations into allegations of antisemitism at five U.S. universities including Columbia and the University of California, Berkeley, the Education Department announced Monday. It's part of President Donald Trump's promise to take a tougher stance against campus antisemitism and deal out harsher penalties than the Biden administration, which settled a flurry of cases with universities in its final weeks. It comes the same day the Justice Department announced a new task force to root out antisemitism on college campuses. In an order signed last week, Trump called for aggressive action to fight anti-Jewish bias on campuses, including the deportation of foreign students who have participated in pro-Palestinian protests. Along with Columbia and Berkeley, the department is now investigating the University of Minnesota, Northwestern University and Portland State University. The cases were opened using the department's power to launch its own civil rights reviews, unlike the majority of investigations, which stem from complaints. Messages seeking comment were left with all five universities. A statement from the Education Department criticized colleges for tolerating antisemitism after Hamas' Oct. 7, 2023, attack on Israel and a wave of pro-Palestinian protests that followed. It also criticized the Biden administration for negotiating 'toothless' resolutions that failed to hold schools accountable. 'Today, the Department is putting universities, colleges, and K-12 schools on notice: this administration will not tolerate continued institutional indifference to the wellbeing of Jewish students on American campuses,' said Craig Trainor, the agency's acting assistant secretary for civil rights. The department didn't provide details about the inquiries or how it decided which schools are being targeted. Presidents of Columbia and Northwestern were among those called to testify on Capitol Hill last year as Republicans sought accountability for allegations of antisemitism. The hearings contributed to the resignation of multiple university presidents, including Columbia's Minouche Shafik. An October report from House Republicans accused Columbia of failing to punish pro-Palestinian students who took over a campus building, and it called Northwestern's negotiations with student protesters a 'stunning capitulation.' House Republicans applauded the new investigations. Representative Tim Walberg, chair of the Education and Workforce Committee, said he was 'glad that we finally have an administration who is taking action to protect Jewish students.' Trump's order also calls for a full review of antisemitism complaints filed with the Education Department since Oct. 7, 2023, including pending and resolved cases from the Biden administration. It encourages the Justice Department to take action to enforce civil rights laws. Last week's order drew backlash from civil rights groups who said it violated First Amendment rights that protect political speech. The new task force announced Monday includes the Justice and Education departments along with Health and Human Services. 'The Department takes seriously our responsibility to eradicate this hatred wherever it is found,' said Leo Terrell, assistant attorney general for civil rights. 'The Task Force to Combat Anti-Semitism is the first step in giving life to President Trump's renewed commitment to ending anti-Semitism in our schools.'	https://www.voanews.com/a/trump-administration-opens-antisemitism-inquiries-at-5-colleges-including-columbia-and-berkeley-/7961961.html	2025-02-03T17:11:03-08:00	
Australia hits right-wing online network 'Terrorgram' with sanctions	Sydney — Australia on Monday imposed sanctions on extreme right-wing online network 'Terrorgram' as part of its efforts to combat a rise in antisemitism and online extremism, following similar moves by Britain and the United States. Foreign Minister Penny Wong said the government's action would make it a criminal offense to engage with 'Terrorgram' and help prevent children from becoming caught up in far-right extremism. 'Terrorgram is an online network that promotes white supremacy and racially-motivated violence,' Wong said in a statement. 'It is the first time any Australian Government has imposed counterterrorism financing sanctions on an entity based entirely online.' Offenders will face up to 10 years in jail and heavy fines, she said. The Australian government also renewed sanctions on four right-wing groups: the National Socialist Order, the Russian Imperial Movement, Sonnenkrieg Division and The Base, Wong said. U.S. President Joe Biden's administration in January designated 'Terrorgram,' which primarily operates on the Telegram social media site, accusing it of promoting violent white supremacy. Britain in April made it a criminal offense in the country to belong to or promote the group. In a statement, Telegram said calls to violence have no place on its platform. 'Moderators removed several channels that used variations of the 'Terrorgram' name when they were discovered years ago. Similar content is banned whenever it appears,' it said. Australia has also seen an escalating series of attacks on synagogues, buildings and cars since the Israel-Gaza war began in October 2023, sparking fear among Australia's nearly 115,000 Jewish people. Police last week arrested members of a neo-Nazi group in the South Australian city of Adelaide when the country marked its National Day and charged a man for displaying a Nazi symbol.	https://www.voanews.com/a/australia-hits-right-wing-online-network-terrorgram-with-sanctions/7961963.html	2025-02-03T17:07:08-08:00	
Education Department workers put on leave over DEI order	WASHINGTON — Dozens of employees at the U.S. Education Department were put on paid administrative leave in response to President Donald Trump’s order banning diversity, equity and inclusion programs in the federal government, according to a labor union that represents hundreds of workers in the agency. It's unclear how many workers were put on leave or for what reasons, said Sheria Smith, president of American Federation of Government Employees Local 252. The majority of employees placed on leave do not work in DEI initiatives and span all branches of the agency, she said, from an office that sends billions of dollars to K-12 schools to an office that enforces civil rights laws. The shakeup comes as Elon Musk's Department of Government Efficiency, or DOGE, pushes to cut programs and federal workers at departments across the government, including the U.S. Agency for International Development. A DOGE team was working at the Education Department on Monday to implement Trump's executive orders and agenda, said Madison Biedermann, an Education Department spokesperson. The department did not immediately comment on the personnel changes and would not say how many employees were placed on leave. At least 55 Education Department workers received an email Friday saying they were being put on paid leave effective immediately pursuant to Trump's executive order. It wasn’t being done for 'any disciplinary purpose,' according to a copy of the email obtained by The Associated Press. Those placed on leave lost access to their government email accounts and were told not to report to the office. They include a range of staff members and managers across the department, which employs more than 4,000 workers in Washington and regional offices across the country. Most of those on leave appear to have taken a voluntary diversity training seminar offered by the department, Smith said. The Diversity Change Agent program has been promoted by the agency for years, including during Trump’s first term in office. Graduates of the two-day program were expected to serve as role models and help improve the department's 'capacity to attract and retain a diverse workforce,' according to an internal email from 2019 obtained by the AP. Smith said hundreds of employees have taken the training, but it was unclear if all of them were placed on leave. She said many people were under the impression the training was strongly encouraged or required. 'It seems unfair to encourage or require people to take a training and then four or five years later place them on administrative leave,' Smith said. Some current employees who are on leave said the action could disrupt the agency's core work, including the management of federal student loans and the FAFSA form for student financial aid. The workers spoke on the condition of anonymity for fear of reprisals. Senator Patty Murray, D-Wash., a former teacher and member of the Senate Health, Education, Labor and Pensions Committee, said Trump is 'purging' employees for taking a training course that his administration encouraged them to take. 'This won’t help our kids learn or even save us money,' Murray said on the social media site X. 'He’s just breaking services people rely on.' Trump’s order called for all DEI staff in the federal government to be put on paid leave and eventually laid off. It’s part of a broader crackdown on diversity programs that the Republican president says are racist. Trump campaigned on a promise to shut down the Education Department, which he says has been infiltrated by 'radicals, zealots and Marxists.' He said the agency's power should be turned over to states and schools.	https://www.voanews.com/a/education-department-workers-put-on-leave-over-dei-order-/7961960.html	2025-02-03T17:05:01-08:00	
US foreign aid programs face major restructuring under Trump	The U.S. Agency for International Development (USAID), which manages tens of billions of dollars' worth of U.S. foreign aid programs, was essentially closed down on Monday, with employees locked out of their offices and computer systems. Several senior figures in the agency were placed on leave as the Trump administration took steps to fold its functions into the Department of State. Speaking to reporters in El Salvador, where he was traveling, Secretary of State Marco Rubio said he is now USAID’s acting director and would be taking steps to bring the agency’s activities in line with the policies of the administration. Rubio described the agency as historically 'unresponsive' to Congress and the White House, even though the agency, he claimed, is supposed to take its direction from the State Department. 'USAID has a history of sort of ignoring that and deciding that there's somehow a global charity separate from the national interest,' Rubio said. 'These are taxpayer dollars, and we owe the American people assurances that every dollar we are spending abroad is being spent on something that furthers our national interest.' Rubio’s comments were less harsh than those of billionaire Elon Musk, who President Donald Trump has given significant power to overhaul the federal government, and whose newly formed Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE) sent representatives into USAID offices over the weekend. 'USAID is a criminal organization,' Musk wrote on the social media platform X on Sunday. 'Time for it to die.' Democrats protest Democrats in Washington described the effort to dismantle USAID as blatantly illegal and vowed to challenge it. On Sunday, all 10 Democratic members of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee sent a letter to Rubio outlining their objections. 'Congress established the U.S. Agency for International Development (USAID) as an independent agency, separate from the Department of State, to ensure that we can deploy development expertise and U.S. foreign assistance quickly, particularly in times of crisis, to meet our national security goals,' they wrote. 'For this reason, any effort to merge or fold USAID into the Department of State should be, and by law must be, previewed, discussed, and approved by Congress,' the letter said. In a news conference in front of USAID headquarters in Washington, Democratic Senator Chris Van Hollen, a member of the Foreign Relations Committee, said that he and his colleagues would prevent Trump from filling vacancies at the State Department in response to the administration’s actions. 'We will do everything we can to block State Department nominees from going forward until this illegal action is reversed,' he said. USAID history USAID was created in the early 1960s, at a time when there was a widespread understanding in post-World War II Washington that U.S. aid efforts, administered by a patchwork of agencies, were inefficient, often duplicative, and sometimes contradictory. In many cases, aid was also explicitly tied to the United States’ political priorities, rather than the objective level of need present in nations receiving assistance. In 1961, President John F. Kennedy’s administration undertook a broad review of U.S. aid programs, and he subsequently asked Congress for the authority to develop a new agency to coordinate foreign aid efforts. In a message to Congress, Kennedy proposed an agency that would create country-specific teams that would operate on the ground in recipient nations to develop long-term plans. He described these as 'a carefully thought-through program tailored to meet the needs and the resource potential of each individual country, instead of a series of individual, unrelated projects.' 'Frequently, in the past, our development goals and projects have not been undertaken as integral steps in a long-range economic development program,' Kennedy said. 'Long-term planning and financing — the only way to make meaningful and economical commitments.' Created by executive order Later that year, Congress passed the Foreign Assistance Act of 1961, requiring the abolition of several existing aid programs and directing the president to designate a new entity to take responsibility for their operations. The act also explicitly separated foreign military aid from humanitarian aid programs. Shortly thereafter, Kennedy signed the bill into law and issued Executive Order 10973, creating the U.S. Agency for International Development. The agency was structured such that its administrator reported directly to the Secretary of State, rather than up through the chain of command within the State Department. It was an arrangement that allowed USAID some freedom of operation, but one that would be challenged repeatedly over the years, as successive secretaries of state sought to force USAID’s priorities into closer alignment with State Department policies. Many successes Over the ensuing 60-plus years, USAID tallied a considerable number of successes, and also weathered numerous controversies and scandals, many of which were catalogued by journalist John Norris in a history of the agency published in 2021, the year of its 60th anniversary. USAID-provided food aid has saved countless lives around the world, and its early focus on developing competent local governance structures was central to helping countries like South Korea and Taiwan develop flourishing industrial bases. In the late 1960s, the agency took on a leading role in the global effort to eradicate smallpox, which had killed an estimated 300 million people since the dawn of the 20th century alone. The agency helped spearhead inoculation programs across the developing world that contributed to the first known global eradication of disease in the human population through a public health program. USAID also helped pioneer the use of oral rehydration therapy (ORT) for children afflicted with diarrhea. By distributing packets of water-soluble salts and sugars, the agency has helped prevent the deaths of millions of children in developing countries. The agency has also been at the forefront of efforts to reduce the incidence in developing countries of mothers’ deaths during childbirth and reducing the spread of sexually transmitted diseases, in particular HIV. Controversies Despite Kennedy’s hope that the distribution of U.S. aid could be disentangled from geopolitics, USAID has, many times in its history, found itself supporting abusive or autocratic governments, frequently in Latin America, because the federal government believed doing so was in the national interest. Public discontent with USAID grew in tandem with frustration at the war in Vietnam, where the agency had played a major role in unsuccessful 'pacification' programs meant to win the 'hearts and minds' of the Vietnamese people. President Richard Nixon attempted to capitalize on that discontent to abolish the agency and decentralize foreign aid programs. Instead, Congress took steps to refocus the agency’s efforts, directing it to back away from high-level engagement with foreign governments in favor of work on rural development and aid to the neediest. In the ensuing years, however, controversies continued to emerge, none more prominent than those arising from the agency’s activities during the wars in Afghanistan and Iraq. Widespread questions were raised, including by members of Congress, about how the agency spent funds earmarked for reconstruction of those two countries.

Judge extends block on Trump administration federal funding freeze	WASHINGTON — A judge in the nation's capital kept a temporary block on a Trump administration plan for a freeze on federal funding Monday after some nonprofit groups said they're still struggling to get promised grants and loans. U.S. District Judge Loren L. AliKhan extended an order she issued last week that paused a sweeping plan to freeze potentially trillions in federal spending. While the memo outlining it has since been rescinded, the Republican administration has said some kind of funding freeze is still planned as part of his blitz of executive orders. A second judge in Rhode Island has also blocked any federal spending pause in a separate lawsuit filed by nearly two dozen Democratic states. In the Washington lawsuit, several groups reported being unable to access promised federal funding even after the memo was rescinded. They ranged from childcare in Wisconsin to disability services in West Virginia to a small business research project on neutron generation and detection. 'For many, the harms caused by the freeze are non-speculative, impending, and potentially catastrophic,' AliKhan wrote. The Trump administration argues a brief pause in funding to align federal spending with the president's agenda is within the law, and the court lacks constitutional authority to block it. President Donald Trump’s executive orders have sought to increase fossil fuel production, remove protections for transgender people and end diversity, equity and inclusion efforts. AliKhan though, found that 'furthering the President’s wishes cannot be a blank check for OMB to do as it pleases,' she wrote, referring to the Office of Management and Budget, the White House office that doles out federal money. Lawyers with the advocacy group Democracy Forward are representing the nonprofits. They say the sweeping funding pause breaks federal law, puts nonprofits at risk of being shuttered and violates their First Amendment rights.	https://www.voanews.com/a/judge-extends-block-on-trump-administration-federal-funding-freeze-/7961927.html	2025-02-03T16:10:00-08:00	
Tariff threats take aim at fentanyl trafficking; here's how drug reaches US	President Donald Trump's plan to impose tariffs on goods from Mexico, Canada and China is partly aimed at combating the illicit flow of fentanyl into the U.S., where the opioid is blamed for some 70,000 overdose deaths annually. Mexico agreed Monday to send 10,000 troops to the U.S.-Mexico border as part of a deal with Trump to pause the tariffs for a month — and hold off levying its own. Neither Canada nor China has signaled major changes to tackle the flow of fentanyl into the U.S., and each has said it would retaliate for any U.S. tariffs. What role do Mexico, Canada and China play in fentanyl reaching the U.S.? And how much can their governments do? Where does fentanyl come from? The ingredients in fentanyl are largely produced by companies in China and used by pharmaceutical companies to make legal painkillers. But a portion of those chemicals is purchased by the Sinaloa and Jalisco cartels in Mexico. Cartels make the synthetic opioid in labs and then smuggle it into the U.S., largely at official land crossings in California and Arizona. The small amounts of fentanyl in any shipment — the drug is 50 times more potent than heroin — and its lack of odor make detection and seizures extremely challenging. Fentanyl is also made in Canada and smuggled into the U.S., but to a much lesser extent. U.S. customs agents seized 19.5 kilograms (43 pounds) of fentanyl at the Canadian border during the last fiscal year, compared with 9,570 kilograms (21,100 pounds) at the Mexican border. Seizures of fentanyl jumped by as much as tenfold under President Joe Biden, an increase that may reflect improved detection. What changed after Trump threatened tariffs? Mexico announced in December the seizure of more than a ton of fentanyl pills in what it described as the largest bust of synthetic opioids in the country's history. The haul was striking because fentanyl seizures in Mexico had fallen dramatically in the first half of 2024. Under President Claudia Sheinbaum, who took office in October, Mexico's security forces appear to be far more aggressive than they were under her predecessor. Former President Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador denied that fentanyl was even produced in Mexico, contradicting officials in his own administration. To pause the tit-for-tat tariffs, Mexico agreed to immediately deploy 10,000 National Guard troops to the border to battle drug-trafficking, while the U.S. committed to do more to stop the trafficking of guns into Mexico, said Trump and Sheinbaum on social media. Facing tariff threats, Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau has highlighted his country's recent $1.3 billion investment in border enforcement, including chemical detection tools at entry ports and a new unit focused on the oversight of precursor chemicals. Once Trump ordered the tariffs, Trudeau rebuked the move. 'We, too, are devastated by the scourge that is fentanyl,' Trudeau said at a press conference Sunday. 'As neighbors, we must work collaboratively to fix this. Unfortunately, the actions taken today by the White House split us apart instead of bringing us together.' China defended its efforts to combat fentanyl in what has been years of touch-and-go cooperation with the U.S. China doesn't have the same fentanyl crisis among its own population, and doesn't view it as a priority, said Zongyuan Zoe Liu, a senior fellow for China studies at the Council on Foreign Relations. How much can Mexico, Canada and China do? Combating the production and movement of illicit fentanyl is particularly challenging. Unlike heroin and cocaine, which are produced from plants, fentanyl is made with ingredients used for legal pharmaceutical drugs, and can be made in cheap labs that can be erected relatively quickly. And despite the dangers, demand in the U.S. for the highly addictive drug remains strong. Mike Vigil, the former chief of international operations at the U.S. Drug Enforcement Agency, said he was skeptical that Mexico’s extra troops at the border on their own would make much of a dent in trafficking. Once fentanyl leaves the labs, it’s usually well concealed in hidden compartments of vehicles or in huge cargo trucks; better detection technology is crucial, in addition to more troops, he said. The other challenge, Vigil said, is that combating the fentanyl trade will likely require more than just collaboration between the U.S. and its neighbors. 'Even if Mexico, Canada and these other countries snap their fingers and did away with the drug trade, as long as we have that demand, there will be another country that will satisfy that demand.'	https://www.voanews.com/a/tariff-threats-take-aim-at-fentanyl-trafficking-here-s-how-the-drug-reaches-the-us/7961689.html	2025-02-03T15:43:52-08:00	
Tanker attacked last year crosses Red Sea as Houthi ceasefire holds	CAIRO — Liberian-flagged crude oil tanker Chrysalis, which was attacked by Yemen's Houthis last year, sailed through the Red Sea this week, the Suez Canal said Monday, in one of the first voyages since the militia announced a halt in attacks on ships not linked to Israel. Shipping companies, many of which have suspended Red Sea voyages and rerouted vessels around southern Africa to avoid potential Houthi attacks, have been anxiously waiting for confirmation of safe voyages through the Red Sea since the Gaza ceasefire. The Iran-aligned Houthis, which have carried out more than 100 attacks on ships since November 2023 and sunk two vessels, said on Jan. 20 after the Gaza ceasefire that they would limit their attacks on shipping lanes to Israel-linked vessels. Previously they had targeted ships linked to the U.K. and U.S. although other vessels with no connection have also been hit. 'It is the vessel's first transit since it was attacked in the Red Sea last July,' Egypt's Suez Canal Authority said Monday, hailing the return of the Chrysalis.	https://www.voanews.com/a/tanker-attacked-last-year-crosses-red-sea-as-houthi-ceasefire-holds-/7961688.html	2025-02-03T15:41:12-08:00

Ecuador's Noboa closes borders ahead of presidential election	QUITO, ECUADOR — Ecuadorian President Daniel Noboa has announced the closure of Ecuador's borders starting Saturday for three days, including the first round of the presidential election on Sunday in which he is a candidate. 'Faced with attempts at destabilization by armed groups, from Saturday 8 to Monday 10 February, the borders will remain closed,' the leader declared on his social media X account Monday. The 37-year-old head of state also decided to strengthen the military presence in border areas and to 'immediately militarize the ports.' On Saturday, Daniel Noboa spoke of the arrest by his security team of 12 people dressed in police and army uniforms, carrying rifles, ammunition and equipped with a drone, while he was campaigning for his reelection, speaking of 'narco-terrorists' seeking to 'destabilize' the country. Noboa, the son of a billionaire banana king, came to power in November 2023 to complete the 18-month term of his predecessor Guillermo Lasso, who had called early elections to avoid his impeachment amid corruption accusations. In January 2024, the young president declared the country in 'internal armed conflict' after the escape of a powerful drug lord from a Guayaquil prison sparked a wave of violence. In Ecuador, at least twenty gangs are dedicated to drug trafficking, kidnapping and extortion, sowing terror and death in this country of 17 million inhabitants. Located on the Pacific and with a dollarized economy, Ecuador — once considered a haven amid Peru and Colombia, the world's largest cocaine producers — has in recent years become a logistical hub for drug shipments. Gang conflicts have sparked unprecedented violence there. In 2023, the country recorded a record rate of 47 homicides per 100,000 people. Through states of emergency including the deployment of the army in the streets, the Noboa government claims to have reduced this homicide rate to 38 by 2024. The liberal president and his left-wing opponent, lawyer Luisa Gonzalez, are due to face off again at the polls Sunday for the first round of the presidential election in Ecuador, after a first electoral contest in October 2023 won by Noboa with 52.1% of the vote. Indigenous leader Leonidas Iza is also a candidate.	https://www.voanews.com/a/7961641.html	2025-02-03T15:04:27-08:00	
Dramatic drop in monarch butterfly count nears record 30-year low	MADISON, WISCONSIN — The number of monarch butterflies spending the winter in the western United States has dropped to its second-lowest mark in nearly three decades as pesticides, diminishing habitat and climate change take their toll on the beloved pollinator. Here's what to know: The survey began in 1997 Monarch butterflies, known for their distinctive orange-and-black wings, are found across North America. Monarchs in the eastern United States spend their winters in Mexico and are counted by the World Wildlife Fund, which has yet to release data for this year. Monarchs west of the Rocky Mountains typically overwinter along the California coast. The Xerces Society for Invertebrate Conservation has been counting western overwinter populations along the California coast, northern Baja California and inland sites in California and Arizona for the last 28 years. The highest number recorded was 1.2 million in 1997. The organization announced Friday that it counted just 9,119 monarchs in 2024, a decrease of 96% from 233,394 in 2023. The total was the second lowest since the survey began in 1997. The record-low was 1,901 monarchs in 2020. The survey noted that a site owned by The Nature Conservancy in Santa Barbara that saw 33,200 monarchs last winter hosted only 198 butterflies this year. Heat may have doomed western monarchs Monarchs across the continent face mounting threats, chief among them vanishing milkweed, the host plant for the insect's caterpillars. The plant has been disappearing before a combination of drought, wildfires, agriculture and urban development, according to Monarch Joint Venture, a group that works to protect monarchs. Pesticides have contaminated much of the remaining plants, according to the Xerces Society. It's unclear what caused such a sharp drop-off in the western population in just one year, said Emma Pelton, an endangered species biologist with the Xerces Society. The monarch population is already small, she said, and triple-digit heat in the western states last year may have slowed breeding. Monarchs suffer when the mercury gets up to 37.7 degrees Celsius (100 degrees Fahrenheit) and any temperatures above 42.2 C (108 F) are lethal to the insects, Pelton said. The western states saw a heat wave in July that drove temperatures in some areas well past 37.7 C (100 F). Palm Springs, for example, hit a record 51.1 C (124 F) on July 5. Another heat wave cooked northern California in early October, with multiple cities breaking heat records. Western monarchs' future looks murky Pelton said that it's too early to tell what long-term impact the dramatic losses might have on the overall western monarch population. Insects do have the potential for exponential growth, Pelton said. After bottoming out at 1,901 butterflies in 2020, the population rebounded to 247,246 insects the following year, an increase of nearly 13,000%. The year after that the survey recorded 335,479 monarchs. 'This is bad news,' Pelton said of the 2024 population drop. 'But we have seen incredible recovery. This doesn’t mean we’re not going to have western monarchs. It's hopefully a wake-up call that a bad year can set them back pretty significantly.' Federal officials working on protections The U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service announced in December 2024 that it was working to list monarchs as threatened, a move that would prohibit anyone from killing them, transporting them or making changes that would render their property permanently unusable for the species, such as eradicating all milkweed from the land. The listing also would protect 1,779 hectares (4,395 acres) in seven coastal California counties that serve as overwinter sites for western monarchs. A public comment period on the proposal is set to end in March. The agency has until December to officially list the monarch as threatened if officials decide to move forward. Earthjustice, an environmental law firm, petitioned the Environmental Protection Agency in December 2024 to mandate testing pesticide effects on insects such as bees, moths and butterflies.	https://www.voanews.com/a/dramatic-drop-in-monarch-butterfly-count-nears-record-30-year-low-/7961657.html	2025-02-03T15:03:03-08:00	
Uganda begins Ebola vaccine trial	Uganda began a vaccine trial Monday against the Sudan strain of Ebola that has killed one person in the outbreak declared last week. World Health Organization Director-General Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus said Monday in a post on the X social media platform that the trial was 'initiated with record speed, only three days since the outbreak was declared, while ensuring full compliance with international and national regulatory and ethical requirements.' Officials have not identified the vaccine manufacturer that is providing the East African country with access to more than 2,000 doses of the candidate vaccine. WHO is supporting Uganda’s response to the outbreak with a $1 million allocation from its Contingency Fund for Emergencies. So far, there has been only one death attributed to the virus — a nurse who worked at the Mulago National Referral Hospital in Kampala, Uganda’s capital. Two more cases were confirmed on Monday. The Associated Press reported they were members of the nurse’s family. The nurse sought treatment at several hospitals and had also consulted with a traditional healer before tests confirmed an Ebola diagnosis, according to authorities. Dr. Matshidiso Moeti, WHO regional director for Africa said in a statement after the outbreak was confirmed, 'We welcome the prompt declaration of this outbreak, and as a comprehensive response is being established, we are supporting the government and partners to scale up measures to quicky identify cases, isolate and provide care, curb the spread of the virus and protect the population.' Uganda’s Health Ministry has identified at least 234 of the nurse’s contacts, according to the AP. Containing the virus could prove challenging in Kampala with its population of 4 million people. The symptoms of Ebola, an often-fatal disease, include fever, vomiting, diarrhea, muscle pain and at times internal and external bleeding. According to the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, health care workers and family members caring for someone with Ebola are at high risk for contracting the disease. WHO said Ebola 'is transmitted to people from wild animals (such as fruit bats, porcupines and non-human primates) and then spreads in the human population through direct contact with the blood, secretions, organs or other bodily fluids of infected people, and with surfaces and materials (e.g., bedding, clothing) contaminated with these fluids.' Ebola’s fatality rate is around 50%, WHO said on its website, but it also said that fatality rates have varied from 25% to 90% in some outbreaks. The outbreak in Uganda is the first Ebola outbreak since U.S. President Donald Trump announced the U.S. withdrawal from the World Health Organization. Some information was provided by The Associated Press and Agence France-Presse.	https://www.voanews.com/a/uganda-begins-ebola-vaccine-trial-/7961663.html	2025-02-03T15:01:08-08:00	
Report: China using strict travel restrictions to control Uyghurs	TAIPEI, TAIWAN — In a new report released Monday, Human Rights Watch says the Chinese government continues to impose strict controls on Uyghurs who seek to travel abroad or visit family members living in Xinjiang, measures the New York-based rights organization adds violate their freedom of movement. While Uyghurs have been allowed to apply for passports and briefly reunite with family members, a slight improvement compared to the widespread confiscation of Uyghurs’ passports since 2016, the 'Chinese government continues to deny Uyghurs their right to leave the country, restrict(s) their speech and associations when abroad, and punish(es) them for having foreign ties,' said Yalkun Uluyol, China researcher at Human Rights Watch. Uluyol told VOA that Beijing uses travel restrictions to maintain control over the Uyghur community at home and abroad and attempts to create 'a public image of normalcy' in Xinjiang. Since 2017, China has put more than a million Uyghurs into internment camps, according to Amnesty International. In 2022, the U.N. high commissioner for human rights said Beijing’s treatment of ethnic minorities in Xinjiang may constitute 'crimes against humanity.' Both the previous Trump administration and the administration of former President Joe Biden have voiced concerns about China's treatment of the Uyghurs and characterized what is happening in Xinjiang as genocide and crimes against humanity. U.S. Secretary of State Marco Rubio was one of the leading figures in facilitating the passage and enforcement of the Uyghur Forced Labor Prevention Act during his time as a senator. According to the Human Rights Watch report, Uyghurs in China need to provide detailed information, including their purpose of travel, or personal information of family members abroad, to authorities in Xinjiang. Those permitted to travel abroad need to avoid engaging in activism and must return to China within a specified time, normally between a few days and several months. Some Uyghurs said local 'authorities had told them that only ‘one person from each family’ can travel at the same time, [while others] said authorities had also required them to provide a ‘guarantor’ before granting them permission to travel,' Human Rights Watch said in the report, adding that failure to comply with restrictions could result in harsh punishments against their family members or guarantors. During trips, Uyghurs must check in with a designated official in China regularly, and upon their return, authorities will confiscate their passports. 'Officials from the neighborhood committee, the local police station, and the public security bureau visited my father after his return. They asked about whom he met, where he went, and what he told people,' an unnamed Uyghur told Human Rights Watch. Government-organized trips to Xinjiang In addition to maintaining strict control on Uyghurs seeking to travel abroad, the Chinese government also imposes strict conditions on Uyghurs in the diaspora who want to reunite with family members in Xinjiang. According to the report, Uyghurs with foreign passports need to go through stringent vetting processes to obtain approval from local authorities in Xinjiang. Once they are in China, these Uyghurs are subject to repeated questioning and are only allowed to stay at hotels rather than their relatives’ homes. In some cases, Chinese embassies will tell some Uyghurs abroad to participate in official tours to Xinjiang organized by the local Communist Party propaganda department. Abduweli Ayup, a Uyghur linguist and activist based in Norway, said Chinese embassies in countries like Turkey, Kazakhstan and Kyrgyzstan have organized these group tours through Chinese immigrant associations in those countries since 2019. 'Four Chinese immigrant associations were competing to organize these propaganda tours in Turkey,' he told VOA by phone. Before traveling to China, the report said Uyghurs need to provide copies of personal identification and detailed personal information. Once they are in Xinjiang, local authorities will closely monitor them and maintain strict restrictions on them. Uyghurs on these tours 'said they had to seek permission to visit their families and [had] to speak Mandarin Chinese, even among themselves,' Human Rights Watch said in the report. Apart from the strict conditions, Uyghurs visiting Xinjiang will be asked by local authorities to 'take part in propaganda activities,' including praising the Communist Party for its Xinjiang policies. 'I realized everything was orchestrated, the tour was closely surveilled by police, and I had to ask for permission from the neighborhood committee and the local police to stay with my family after the tour,' one unnamed Uyghur told Human Rights Watch. Uluyol said the Chinese government uses these highly restricted trips to Xinjiang to maintain control over Uyghurs in the diaspora community. The Uyghur diaspora begins to 'self-censor while stopping engaging in peaceful political activism or sending their children to Uyghur schools,' he told VOA by phone. He said the Chinese government’s approach, which is a form of transnational repression, 'creates a distrust in the diaspora community' and may lead to the further fragmentation of the community. VOA reached out to China's foreign ministry and the Chinese Embassy in Washington for comment but has yet to receive a response. Since 2022, the Chinese government has organized several trips to Xinjiang for representatives from foreign countries. During a trip attended by delegates from several Islamic countries in October 2024, Chinese state newspaper China Daily claimed the foreign guests expressed 'their admiration for the social stability, harmony, and collaborative development' among ethnic groups in Xinjiang. Since China is likely to maintain the travel restrictions on Uyghurs, Uluyol said foreign countries should 'protect citizens and residents' from threats posed by Beijing while international bodies like the United Nations should try to prioritize these challenges and address them at the international level.	https://www.voanews.com/a/report-china-using-strict-travel-restrictions-to-control-uyghurs/7961635.html	2025-02-03T14:19:46-08:00	
Trump administration moves to end deportation protections for 348,000 Venezuelans	WASHINGTON/MARACAIBO, Venezuela — U.S. Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem on Monday moved to remove protection against deportation from hundreds of thousands of Venezuelans in the U.S., part of President Donald Trump's expanding immigration crackdown. The decision means about 348,000 Venezuelans with Temporary Protected Status, more than half of all Venezuelans in the program, could be deported and lose work permits in April, according to a government notice. The notice said the protections were contrary to U.S. interests and no longer justified by conditions in Venezuela. Trump, a Republican, took office on Jan. 20 vowing to crack down on illegal immigration and humanitarian programs he says go beyond the intent of U.S. law. Trump tried to end most enrollment in the temporary protection program during his first term but was stymied by federal courts. The status is available to people whose home country has experienced a natural disaster, armed conflict or other extraordinary event. 'I don't know what will happen,' said Venezuelan migrant Ana Maria Pirela, 26, who lives in California and has temporary protected status. 'Yesterday they fired my husband from his job — he had been managing a food store for two months — and I'm two months pregnant. I don't want to go back to Venezuela,' she said by phone. Former President Joe Biden, a Democrat, greatly expanded the temporary protection program. It now covers more than 1 million people from 17 nations, some in the U.S. for decades, and they could face immediate deportation if they lose the status. Hundreds of thousands of Venezuelans arrived in the U.S. during Biden's presidency, many via legal humanitarian pathways, and deporting them has been challenging due to frosty U.S.-Venezuela relations. On Saturday, Trump said Venezuela had agreed to accept all deported people but provided few details. Last week, Noem canceled an 18-month extension of temporary protections for Venezuelans by her Biden-era predecessor, saying the Trump administration did not want to be bound by that determination. On Monday, she stopped their status from automatically renewing for six months. About 300,000 additional Venezuelans have Temporary Protected Status that expires in September and were not affected by Monday's decision. The Department of Homeland Security said in the termination notice that while some challenging conditions remain in Venezuela, 'there are notable improvements in several areas such as the economy, public health, and crime that allow for these nationals to be safely returned to their home country.' The termination will be effective 60 days after publication in the Federal Register, the notice said, or about the first week in April. Venezuelan President Nicolas Maduro's government has taken some steps to control inflation, which previously was in the triple digits, but economic conditions in Venezuela remain dire for most people. The monthly minimum wage equals about $3. Maduro was inaugurated for his third term in January, despite a six-month-long election dispute, international calls for him to stand aside and an increase in the U.S. reward offered for his capture. The U.S. charged Maduro and several allies with drug trafficking in 2020, charges he denies. The Venezuelan opposition, which has faced arrests and other crackdown measures since the July election, asked the U.S. to keep the temporary protection program in place. Opposition leader Edmundo Gonzalez, who moved abroad after Venezuela issued an arrest warrant for him, recently said on X that the opposition was still discussing with the U.S. how to protect Venezuelans there. Venezuelan migrant Tatiana Vazques, who lives in Atlanta, said by phone that her family submitted a U.S. asylum application but was anxious after seeing other Venezuelans arrested by U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE). 'Yesterday ICE took a friend and her husband. There's anguish,' she said.	https://www.voanews.com/a/trump-administration-moves-to-end-deportation-protections-for-348-000-venezuelans-/7961630.html	2025-02-03T14:07:06-08:00	
Multiple earthquakes rattling Greece's volcanic island of Santorini	Multiple earthquakes are rattling Santorini, a volcanic island in Greece, prompting authorities to dispatch rescuers with tents, a sniffer dog and drones, and to shut schools on four islands. Residents have been warned to avoid indoor gatherings, check escape routes, stay away from cliffs and to drain swimming pools to reduce potential structural damage to buildings in the event of a large earthquake. Greece lies in a highly seismically active part of the world, and earthquakes are frequent. The vast majority cause no injuries and little or no damage, but the country has also seen deadly quakes. Earthquakes can't be predicted, but authorities are taking measures as a precaution. Santorini, one of Greece's most popular tourist destinations, took its present crescent shape following a massive volcanic eruption in antiquity. Now, millions of visitors each year come to see its dramatic scenery of whitewashed houses and blue-domed churches clinging to the cliff along the flooded caldera, or volcanic crater. Last week, scientists said they had noticed increased volcanic activity in the caldera but say this isn't linked to the earthquakes. Here's a look at the current situation: What's going on? About 200 quakes with magnitudes between 3 and 4.9 were registered from Saturday to Monday afternoon between Santorini and the nearby island of Amorgos, authorities said. Seismologist Gerasimos Papadopoulos said on Greece's ERT television that the seismic activity began on Jan. 24, but intensified Saturday, with increasing frequency and magnitudes. The fault line producing the current earthquakes runs for about 120 kilometers (75 miles), but only the southern part between Santorini and Amorgos has been activated. The earthquakes have epicenters beneath the seabed, roughly 30-40 kilometers (18-25 miles) from any of the islands. Scientists say this is good news, as an epicenter beneath land could potentially be more destructive. But a large quake could also trigger a tsunami, so authorities have warned people to stay away from coastal areas and head inland if they feel a significant earthquake. So far, there has been no damage or injuries reported, although some rockslides have occurred. Could the earthquakes trigger a volcanic eruption? Santorini lies along the Hellenic Volcanic Arc, which stretches from the Peloponnese in southern Greece through the Cycladic islands. Last Wednesday, Greece's Climate Crisis and Civil Protection Ministry announced monitoring sensors had picked up 'mild seismic-volcanic activity' inside the island's caldera. Similar volcanic activity had been recorded in 2011, when it lasted for 14 months and ended without any major issues. Another volcano — a submarine one called Kolumbo — lies about 8 kilometers (5 miles) northeast of Santorini, nearer to the epicenter of the current earthquakes. But seismologists say the quakes aren't related to the volcanoes. A meeting between government officials and scientists determined that seismic activity within Santorini's caldera 'remains at the same low levels as in recent days,' the Civil Protection Ministry said Monday, but that it was 'particularly increased' between Santorini and Amorgos. What worries authorities? Scientists are still trying to determine definitively whether the multiple quakes are foreshocks — smaller earthquakes before a major temblor. Papadopoulos said that there was a 'high probability' they are. Santorini's main villages are built along the rim of the volcano's caldera — producing the dramatic scenery of cascading whitewashed houses and sunset viewpoints that make the island so popular but also raising concerns in the event of a major earthquake. The sheer cliffs also make some areas prone to rockslides. What precautions are being taken? Authorities sent a team of rescuers with a sniffer dog and drones to Santorini, where they set up tents in a basketball court next to the island's main hospital as a staging area. Push alerts have been sent to cellphones warning people to stay away from areas where rockslides could occur and banning access to some coastal areas. Residents and hotels have been asked to drain swimming pools, as the water movement in a major quake could destabilize buildings. People have been told to avoid old buildings and check for exit routes when in built-up areas. Schools on Santorini, as well as the nearby islands of Anafi, Amorgos and Ios, will remain shut all week. What's the history? The fault line that has been activated was the site of Greece's largest quake in the last century: a 7.7 magnitude temblor dubbed the Amorgos earthquake that struck in 1956, triggering a roughly 20-meter (65-foot) tsunami, causing significant damage in Amorgos and Santorini and killing more than 50 people. Santorini is also the site of one of the largest volcanic eruptions in human history. Known as the Minoan eruption, it occurred around 1,600 B.C. and destroyed much of the formerly round island, giving Santorini its current shape. The eruption is believed to have contributed to the decline of the ancient Minoan civilization. Although it's still an active volcano, the last notable eruption occurred in 1950.	https://www.voanews.com/a/multiple-earthquakes-rattling-greece-s-volcanic-island-of-santorini/7961608.html	2025-02-03T13:57:10-08:00	
Sudan fighting escalates; at least 65 killed	Port Sudan, Sudan — Fierce fighting in south and west Sudan killed at least 65 people and wounded more than 130 Monday, medics said, as the devastating war between the army and paramilitary forces rages on. In South Kordofan, artillery fire on the state capital Kadugli killed at least 40 people and wounded 70, according to two medical sources. The city, controlled by the Sudanese army, was targeted in an attack that Governor Mohamed Ibrahim blamed on a faction of the Sudan People's Liberation Movement-North (SPLM-N), led by Abdel Aziz al-Hilu, which also maintains a foothold in the state. 'Hilu's attack on civilians in Kadugli aims to destabilize' the area, Ibrahim said in a statement to AFP, vowing to 'clear the mountains around Kadugli' of rebel forces. The governor said that the shelling targeted a local market. SPLM-N has clashed with both the army and the paramilitary Rapid Support Forces (RSF) in different parts of South Kordofan throughout their war. Sudan has been mired in conflict since April 2023, with battles between the regular army and RSF escalating in recent weeks. In the vast western region of Darfur, a military air strike on South Darfur's capital, Nyala, killed 25 people and wounded 63 on Monday, a medical source told AFP. The attack hit 'the Cinema District in Nyala,' an area under RSF control, the source told AFP on condition of anonymity over safety concerns. The RSF holds sway over much of Darfur, including Nyala, which lies 195 kilometers from El-Fasher, the besieged capital of North Darfur, which is the only state in the region still under army control. El-Fasher is home to some two million people who have been under RSF siege since May. The city has seen some of the worst fighting of the war as the army battles to keep its last foothold in the region. The attacks in South Kordofan and Darfur also come amid intensified fighting between the army and the RSF in Khartoum, where the army has made advances against the paramilitaries. Last week, the army broke a siege of its headquarters in the capital and the Signal Corps in Khartoum North, which had both been encircled by the RSF since the war began. On Saturday, at least 60 people were killed and more than 150 injured when the RSF shelled a busy market in army-controlled Omdurman, part of greater Khartoum. Across the Nile in the capital itself, an air strike on an RSF-controlled area left two civilians dead and dozens wounded, rescuers said. Both warring sides have been repeatedly accused of targeting civilians and indiscriminately shelling residential areas. The war has killed tens of thousands of people, uprooted more than 12 million and devastated Sudan 's fragile infrastructure, forcing most health facilities out of service. The U.N.'s migration agency said on Monday that more than 600,000 people have been displaced from North Darfur since April 2024. The International Organization for Migration reported 95 incidents across North Darfur, more than half occurring in El-Fasher. 'These incidents displaced an estimated 605,257 individuals (121,179 households),' the IOM report said. The U.N. secretary-general's spokesperson Stephane Dujarric expressed alarm on Monday over reports of summary executions of civilians in Khartoum North, allegedly by fighters and militias allied with the army. 'Many of the victims of these incidents were allegedly originally from Darfur or the Kordofan regions of Sudan,' he said, calling on all parties to stop fighting and work towards a lasting peace. Sudanese women, children and men 'are paying the price for the continued fighting by the belligerents,' Dujarric added.	https://www.voanews.com/a/sudan-fighting-escalates-at-least-65-killed/7961607.html	2025-02-03T13:53:47-08:00	
Gangs attack neighborhood in Haiti that's home to country's elite	PORT-AU-PRINCE — Heavily armed gangs in Haiti have attacked a neighborhood that's home to most of the country's elite and had been largely untouched by criminals, and police have demanded help repelling the assault that has killed at least 40 people. 'It's been eight days since Kenscoff has been under attack,' Mayor Jean Massillon told The Associated Press on Monday. He blamed the attack on the Viv Ansanm gang coalition, with gunmen going home to home and indiscriminately opening fire. 'As we speak, they have surrounded the area,' Massillon said as he called for reinforcements. The dead include pastors, teachers and children, although the number is expected to be higher because authorities haven't been able to reach certain parts of the neighborhood, which is home to many politicians and business leaders. Many victims are working-class people who tend crops on the outskirts of the neighborhood in the foothills of a mountain range. Gangs already control 85% of Port-au-Prince, and the United Nations secretary-general warned last month they could overrun the capital. The assault on Kenscoff occurred days after the government and police warned about imminent attacks in the capital, but the warnings did not say where they might occur. Jean Bertho Valmo, a 45-year-old farmer who fled Kenscoff, told the AP that 12 members of one family were among the dead. He said he woke to another round of gunfire before dawn Monday. He and his family sought shelter in the yard of the mayor's office along with dozens of others. 'There is not enough water and food for everyone,' he said, and lamented the loss of his crops including cabbage, carrots and broccoli. 'I invested everything I had in them,' Valmo said. 'The police, the government need to put a stop to this.' The attack on Kenscoff that began January 27 has left more than 1,660 people homeless, according to the International Organization for Migration on Monday. Overall, gang violence has left more than 1 million people homeless across Haiti in recent years. On Friday, one police union said the attack on Kenscoff 'could have been avoided if police had good equipment' including a helicopter and an all-terrain vehicle, as well as funds to gather intelligence. 'Despite these bad conditions, our policemen are making tireless sacrifices, but we cannot tolerate the negligence of the authorities on what must be done to protect their lives and the safety of the population,' the union, SPNH-17, said in a statement.	https://www.voanews.com/a/gangs-attack-neighborhood-in-haiti-that-s-home-to-country-s-elite/7961592.html	2025-02-03T13:41:07-08:00

Botswana, De Beers reach diamond sales agreement after years of negotiations	Gaborone, Botswana — The government of Botswana and South African diamond firm De Beers say they have reached a new, 10-year sales agreement following talks that had dragged on since 2019. Analysts say the diamond industry is sure to welcome the deal, as Botswana, after Russia, is the world’s second-largest producer of diamonds. Under terms of the new agreement, Botswana’s government will be allowed to sell 30% of rough diamonds mined through a joint mining venture with De Beers. The share rises to 50% by the end of the deal in 2035. Botswana hopes that will reverse a decline in diamond revenue. The government once received $7 billion a year through De Beers, but that figure declined to $4.2 billion in 2023, amid falling diamond sales worldwide. Addressing journalists on Monday, De Beers CEO Al Cook applauded the new government for ensuring a smooth conclusion to the talks. Under the previous government, negotiations were often tense, with former President Mokgweetsi Masisi threatening to sever ties with De Beers. The talks made more progress once President Duma Boko took over in November. Elodie Daguzan, executive director at the World Diamond Council (WDC), told VOA the organization is happy to see the sides finally reach a deal. 'The World Diamond Council is thrilled about this development which underscores the importance of long-term, stable partnerships in the diamond sector. Botswana has been a leading example of how responsible diamond mining, through successful collaboration with the private sector, can drive sustainable growth,' she said. Daguzan said the agreement will bolster an industry beset by challenges that include consumer worries over so-called 'blood diamonds' and overall cautious consumer spending. 'We believe it will provide much-needed confidence to members of our industry, who are currently navigating a particularly challenging market and seeking signs of stability. At WDC, we remain committed to supporting frameworks that ensure the ethical sourcing, transparency and the continued contribution of diamonds to the well-being of producing nations and communities,' she said. Hans Merket, a researcher on diamond mining, says it was imperative for Botswana and De Beers to reach an agreement, considering the global supply chain disruptions caused by sanctions on Russian diamonds. 'This agreement between the world’s largest diamond producer after Russia, will therefore be seen as a welcome development, not only to both parties but by the industry at large. Hopefully, it will enable the sector to continue advancing a more positive narrative with diamonds contributing to development and well-being, offering a clear alternative to sanctioned stones from Russia,' he said. Botswana’s Minister of Minerals, Bogolo Kenewendo, said her government and De Beers will officially sign the agreement before the end of February. At the end of the new agreement in 2035, there is an option for a five-year renewal.	https://www.voanews.com/a/botswana-de-beers-reach-diamond-sales-agreement-after-years-of-negotiations/7961572.html	2025-02-03T13:29:38-08:00	
Pentagon chief travels to Mexico border as Trump cracks down on migration	WASHINGTON — U.S. Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth arrived in Texas on Monday to visit the southern border as President Donald Trump works to implement a hard-right agenda that includes boosting the U.S. military presence to keep out illegal immigrants. In his first trip as Pentagon chief, Hegseth will survey operations and meet with U.S. troops who have been rushed to the region under Trump. 'Looking forward to meeting our great warriors and seeing the hard work they are doing securing our southern border. We will continue to deliver on this vital mission,' Hegseth wrote on X in a post announcing his arrival. Trump ordered 1,500 additional military personnel to the border just days after taking office, and his administration carried out highly publicized immigration raids and arrests. Some migrants have been deported using military aircraft. Border security is a key priority for the president, who declared a national emergency at the U.S. border with Mexico on his first day in office. The additional personnel have increased the total number of active-duty troops deployed there to around 4,000. Ahead of his border visit, Hegseth posted on X that Trump 'wants 100% operational control of the border — and we will deliver.'	https://www.voanews.com/a/pentagon-chief-travels-to-mexico-border-as-trump-cracks-down-on-migration/7961571.html	2025-02-03T13:22:34-08:00	
US markets pare losses after Trump pauses tariff on Mexican import	U.S. stock markets fell sharply in early trading Monday but pared their losses after President Donald Trump paused a planned 25% tariff on Mexican imports. The three major U.S. stock indices — the Dow Jones Industrial Average of 30 blue chip stocks, the broader S&P 500 and the tech-heavy NASDAQ — all dropped nearly 2% or more on fears that Trump’s new tariffs targeting Canada, China and Mexico would threaten the global economy. But the losses were cut in half after Trump paused the levy on Mexican goods for a month, even though his planned 25% tariff on Canadian goods and a 10% levy on Chinese imports were still set to take hold at midnight. Trump was planning further discussions mid-afternoon Monday with Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau. Stock markets in Asia fell Monday amid investor concerns about the tariffs. Japan’s Nikkei index closed down 2.66%, while South Korea’s KOSPI index finished off 2.5%. Hong Kong’s Hang Seng index was down more than 2% in early trading before rallying to close down just .07%. Britain’s FTSE index, Germany’s DAX and France’s CAC40 all dropped more than 1%. Canada and Mexico both announced tariffs on U.S. goods in response to Trump’s move before Mexican President Claudia Sheinbaum told Trump she would send 10,000 National Guard troops to the U.S.-Mexico border to try to curb the flow of the deadly opioid fentanyl into the U.S. and Trump paused his tariff on Mexican imports. China has pledged to file a protest with the World Trade Organization over the Trump tariff increase on its exports to the U.S. Canada, China and Mexico are the top three U.S. trade partners. Some information for this story came from The Associated Press and Reuters.	https://www.voanews.com/a/us-markets-pare-losses-after-trump-pauses-tariff-on-mexican-imports/7961533.html	2025-02-03T12:52:13-08:00	
British environmental journalist denied entry to Cambodia	BANGKOK — A journalist who covers environmental issues from Cambodia has been banned from entering the country where he has been based for the past five years. British reporter Gerry Flynn told VOA that immigration officials denied his re-entry to Cambodia on Jan. 5, when he tried to return after a vacation in Thailand. The journalist went public with the incident Monday. 'It’s not just a professional blow, but very personal, too,' Flynn told VOA by phone. 'We’ve all seen in the last five years, press freedom [has] deteriorated there.' Flynn, 33, is staff writer at Mongabay, a news website that reports on environmental issues worldwide. He has spent five years reporting from Siem Reap in Cambodia’s northwest, covering environmental and governance issues. The first sign of a possible problem came on January 2, when Flynn says he was stopped at the Siem Reap-Angkor International Airport prior to departing Cambodia. Authorities told Flynn that one of the documents in his visa applications was fake. But, the reporter said, he was allowed to embark on his trip to visit Moo Deng, a baby endangered pygmy hippopotamus that has become a worldwide tourist attraction in Thailand. When he returned three days later, Flynn said he was questioned again. 'This time they didn’t mess around. They were just straight away saying that my visa had been acquired fraudulently. They couldn’t tell me which document was supposed to be incorrect or fake,' he said. 'The only thing they would tell me is that I’d been placed on the blacklist on November 25, 2024.' Immigration officials told Flynn he was banned indefinitely and would not be able to return to Cambodia. Denied entry, the journalist traveled back to Thailand. Flynn has a one-year Type E business visa, valid through February 2025, and a valid work permit issued by Cambodia’s labor ministry. His press accreditation expired January 1, but he had applied to renew the pass. His news outlet, Mongabay, has said that it believes the action is retaliatory. Flynn recently featured as a contributor to a France24 documentary, 'Real carbon, false credits? Investigating mass deforestation in Cambodia'. The documentary focuses on carbon-offset projects in the Cardamom Mountains. After it aired on November 22, Cambodia’s government labeled the findings 'fake news.' Two other contributors were detained a day after it aired, but later released, according to Mongabay. Neither Cambodia’s government, Ministry of Foreign Affairs nor its press communications division replied to VOA’s emails requesting comment. Mongabay on Monday said Cambodian authorities have not provided further information to Flynn about his case or his options to appeal. In a statement, Mongabay said that Cambodia claims Flynn had applied for a visa to work as an electrician. But Mongabay said Flynn has 'consistently held a valid government-issued press pass ... in Cambodia.' 'For more than five years, Flynn has reported from Cambodia, and despite the increasing hostility towards journalists, it’s a country that he’s grown to love,' the statement said. 'As such, it’s both a professional and personal blow to be uprooted from the country Flynn has called home in what appears to be direct retaliation for his journalistic work.' International media watchdogs have condemned Cambodia’s action. 'The immigration entry ban on journalist Gerry Flynn shows just how far Cambodian authorities are willing to go to suppress independent reporting on the country’s environmental catastrophe,' Shawn Crispin, the senior Southeast Asia representative for the Committee to Protect Journalist, told VOA by email. Crispin noted that Flynn has reported on deforestation in Cambodia, adding, 'His expose journalism no doubt made people in powerful positions who profit from the illegal trade very uncomfortable.' Phil Robertson, director of Asia Human Rights and Labor Advocates, told VOA, 'Cambodia is working overtime to wipe out what's left of media freedom in the country.' Reporting or campaigning about environmental issues in Cambodia can be risky. Local journalist Chhoeung Chheng died from his injuries after being shot in Siem Reap province in December while investigating deforestation. In July, 10 members of Cambodian environmental activist group Mother Nature were sentenced from six to eight years in prison for conspiring against the state. The group had been investigating waste pollution in Phnom Penh’s Tonle Sap River. Mother Nature had campaigned against the destruction of natural resources throughout Cambodia and corruption. Overall, Cambodia has a poor record for press freedom. It ranks 151 out of 180 on the World Press Freedom Index, where 1 shows the best media scene. Reporters Without Borders, which compiles the index, describes a 'legacy of repression against the independent media.' In November, an investigative journalist who helped expose the existence of massive scam centers in Cambodia announced that he was quitting. The journalist, Mech Dara, was detained for 30 days and charged with incitement, which carries a potential sentence of up to two years in prison. Two other local reporters who investigated mistreatment of workers at a scam center were detained in late January, according to watchdogs. Flynn, who is the president of the Overseas Press Club of Cambodia, said that until recently Cambodia 'refrained from going after foreign journalists.' 'All journalists, whether foreign or Cambodian all face varying levels of harassment in the field. I know some who were arbitrarily detained while working,' he said. According to a quarterly review report from the Cambodian Journalist Alliance, more than a dozen journalists were legally or physically harassed between July and September of 2024. Reflecting on his case, Flynn said, 'I think the biggest annoyance is it has eaten the whole month, when in reality that month should have been spent continuing to report on important issues in Cambodia.' 'For me it’s obviously a setback but it is not going to stop either myself or others from reporting on issues related to the environment,' Flynn added. 'I don’t think silencing journalists is going to prevent people from seeing the problems that are happening.'	https://www.voanews.com/a/british-environmental-journalist-denied-entry-to-cambodia/7961415.html	2025-02-03T12:34:16-08:00	
Trump orders creation of US sovereign wealth fund, says it could buy TikTok	Washington — U.S. President Donald Trump signed an executive order on Monday ordering the U.S. Treasury and Commerce Departments to create a sovereign wealth fund and said it may purchase TikTok. 'We're going to stand this thing up within the next 12 months. We're going to monetize the asset side of the U.S. balance sheet for the American people,' he told reporters. 'There'll be a combination of liquid assets, assets that we have in this country as we work to bring them out for the American people.' Trump had previously floated such a government investment vehicle as a presidential candidate, saying it could fund 'great national endeavors' like infrastructure projects such as highways and airports, manufacturing, and medical research. Details on how exactly the fund would operate and be financed were not immediately available, but Trump previously said it could be funded by 'tariffs and other intelligent things.' Typically such funds rely on a country's budget surplus to make investments, but the U.S. operates at a deficit. There are over 90 such funds across the world managing over $8 trillion in assets, according to the International Forum of Sovereign Wealth Funds. TikTok, which has about 170 million American users, was briefly taken offline just before a law requiring its Chinese owner ByteDance to either sell it on national security grounds or face a ban took effect on Jan. 19. Trump, after taking office on Jan. 20, signed an executive order seeking to delay by 75 days the enforcement of the law. Trump has said that he was in talks with multiple people over TikTok's purchase and would likely have a decision on the popular app's future in February.	https://www.voanews.com/a/trump-orders-creation-of-us-sovereign-wealth-fund-says-it-could-buy-tiktok/7961449.html	2025-02-03T12:12:40-08:00	
Trump talk' takes center stage at African mining conference	CAPE TOWN, SOUTH AFRICA — The 31st Investing in African Mining Indaba is underway in Cape Town, South Africa with over 115 countries represented. At the forefront of many discussions are the plans of U.S. President Donald Trump, and the effect that U.S. tariffs and the freeze on foreign aid might have on Africa’s mining industries. The theme of this year’s conference is 'Future-proofing African Mining, Today.' However, some participants are concerned that tariffs imposed by Trump — most notably the 10% tariff on Chinese goods announced Saturday — will make this mission much harder. Denys Denya, senior executive vice president of Afreximbank, which is involved in funding trade expansion projects, said tariffs are dominating their talks, but answers are few so far. 'Because China sources lots of its minerals from Africa that go into its manufacturing which then gets exported, there’s a potential negative knock-on effect on African mining, if the demand is not there as a result of the tariff,' Denya said. 'But we are waiting to see what the impact will be. At the moment we can speculate, but we don’t really have the evidence.' Trump’s decision to freeze U.S. foreign aid was also a topic of discussion. South Africa’s Minister of Minerals and Petroleum Resources, Gwede Mantashe, told delegates in his opening address that Africa should withhold minerals if funding is withdrawn. But Denya had an opposing view. 'I think every administration has a right to determine how national resources are going to be deployed, so the Trump administration has a right to determine where to use their resources and we cannot impose on the United States to continue to fund certain activities. So, it’s up to the American people to decide,' Denya said. Veteran mining analyst Peter Major said that unlike China, the U.S. has been cautious with its investments in Africa, due to several factors including political instability on the continent. A case in point is the current conflict in the mineral-rich eastern part of the Democratic Republic of Congo, where M23 rebels and the Congolese government are fighting for control. Major urged the U.S. to continue with the Lobito Corridor, a rail project for the transport of minerals from Congo and Zambia to the port of Lobito in Angola on the Atlantic coast. The project was supported by former President Joe Biden’s administration. 'I think it was the U.S. putting a toe in the water and they mustn’t stop now,' Major said. 'They must put the foot in the water, they must get the leg in there, they must maximize the value and leverage of that project and show Africa how keen they are to come here and help under reasonable, logical, beneficially good terms for all players.' Africa is believed to hold 30% of the world’s minerals, some of them traditional sources of wealth like diamonds and gold, others used in products like batteries and electric vehicles, regarded as critical for the transition to cleaner energy sources. Delegates at the conference, which runs until Feb. 6, represent mining companies, investors and governments. There is a delegation from the United States, but all media inquiries are being directed to Washington.	https://www.voanews.com/a/trump-talk-takes-center-stage-at-african-mining-conference/7961424.html	2025-02-03T11:39:27-08:00	
Exclusive: US 'aware' of reports Iran trying to ship missile propellant chemical from China	WASHINGTON — The Trump administration has made its first comment on Western media reports that Iran is trying to ship a missile propellant ingredient from China, telling VOA it is aware of the reports published last month, while declining to confirm their veracity. Responding to a VOA query about the purported Iranian scheme, a State Department spokesperson said in a Jan. 30 statement, 'We are aware of the press reports. However, we do not comment on intelligence matters.' Britain’s Financial Times and The Wall Street Journal in the United States published reports on Jan. 22 and 23 respectively, citing unnamed Western officials as saying Iran-flagged ships Golbon and Jairan were in the process of being loaded with 1,000 metric tons of sodium perchlorate near Ningbo on China’s eastern coast. The Financial Times described its sources as 'security officials' in two Western countries, while The Wall Street Journal attributed the same information to a 'Western official' and other 'people familiar with the matter.' The news outlets said the purported shipment could be transformed into enough ammonium perchlorate — a key solid fuel propellant component — to produce 260 midrange Iranian missiles. Both the Golbon container ship and the Jairan cargo ship are sanctioned by the U.S. Treasury Department. The vessels’ appearance on the Office of Foreign Assets Control’s Specially Designated Nationals List means they are blocked from U.S.-related commerce. In its statement, the State Department said the U.S. 'remains focused on preventing the proliferation of items, equipment, and technology that could benefit Iran’s missile or other weapons programs and continues to hold Iran accountable through sanctions.' A spokesman for Iran’s U.N. Mission in New York did not respond to a VOA request emailed on Friday to confirm whether Iran is using the Golbon and Jairan to ship sodium perchlorate from China, and whether Western media reports have prompted any changes to the alleged scheme. Iran has a decades-old economic and military partnership with China, which was formalized in a 2021 cooperation agreement that called for more joint military exercises and weapon-systems development as both nations seek to counter what they see as U.S. global hegemony. But the two sides have not confirmed any Chinese weapons sales to Iran since the agreement’s signing. Chinese Foreign Ministry spokeswoman Mao Ning responded to the Western media reports in a Jan. 23 press briefing, saying Beijing was unaware of the situation with the Iranian ships. She also asserted that Beijing always abides by its own export controls and international obligations and rejects other countries imposing what it considers to be illegal unilateral sanctions. Ammonium perchlorate, for which sodium perchlorate is a precursor, is subject to export controls under the Missile Technology Control Regime, an informal association of 35 governments sharing common interests in the nonproliferation of missiles. Neither Iran nor China are members of the voluntary export-control organization, which includes mostly Western nations and their Asian allies, as well as Russia. Iran makes its own chemicals for the production of solid fuel missile propellant, according to Behnam Ben Taleblu, a researcher at the Washington-based Foundation for Defense of Democracies. But he told VOA in an interview that after Israel destroyed much of Iran’s missile manufacturing in an aerial attack last October, Iranian military planners have an urgent need for backup supplies. 'It makes sense for Iran to try to obtain more of these precursor chemicals from China because Tehran sees Beijing as a more trusted partner than other nations,' Ben Taleblu said. In another development, a joint review of ship tracking websites by VOA and Dubai-based intelligence analyst Martin Kelly of EOS Risk Group in recent days has uncovered new details of the movements and loading statuses of the Golbon and Jairan since Western media first reported their roles in the alleged Iranian import scheme. The reviews of websites MarineTraffic and Lloyd’s List Intelligence’s Seasearcher show the Golbon had a draught change on Jan. 22 at sea near Zhoushan Island off the coast of Ningbo. The ship was noted sitting two meters deeper in the water, an indication that it was loaded with cargo in a ship-to-ship transfer from another vessel, Kelly said. No cargo ship could be seen adjacent to the Golbon on that date on MarineTraffic. Vessels engaged in illicit ship-to-ship transfers often switch off their Automatic Identification System (AIS) transponders — devices that transmit positional and other data as part of an internationally mandated tracking system — to evade detection, as noted in a 2023 U.S. government advisory highlighting common tactics deployed by malign actors in the maritime industry. After the Jan. 22 draught change, the Golbon headed north toward a stated destination of Taicang port near Shanghai on the same day, but it stopped short and remained stationary at sea for the next three days, according to MarineTraffic. On Jan. 25, the Golbon changed its stated destination and headed south toward southern China’s Zhuhai Gaolan Port. The anonymous sources cited by the Financial Times on Jan. 22 said they expected the Golbon and the Jairan to deliver their purported cargos of sodium perchlorate straight to Iran on a three-week voyage without making any port calls. But the Golbon arrived at Zhuhai Gaolan Port on Jan. 30 and remained there for two days before departing with another draught change, according to MarineTraffic. Upon departure, the Golbon was sitting several meters deeper in the water, indicating a further loading of cargo during the port call. It also reported a new destination of Iran’s Bandar Abbas port and an estimated arrival of Feb. 14. As the Golbon had a draught change near Zhoushan Island on Jan. 22, the Jairan was docked at Liuheng Island, about 30 kilometers to the south. The Financial Times cited its sources as saying the Jairan would depart for Iran with newly loaded cargo early this month. But the ship remained docked at Liuheng on Monday, sitting at the same depth in the water as when it was in the waters off southern China in November and heading north toward the Ningbo coast, according to Seasearcher. It was an indication that the Jairan has not been loaded with any significant cargo since November, Kelly said. There was no word on which Chinese manufacturers may be involved in the purported scheme to supply the sodium perchlorate to Iran. The U.S. has long sanctioned Chinese companies for providing missile components to Iran, but a VOA search of U.S. government websites found no specific references to sanctions on Chinese manufacturers of sodium perchlorate. The Treasury Department did not respond to a VOA inquiry, sent on Friday, regarding whether the U.S. has sanctioned Chinese makers of the chemical. The U.S. sanctioned Iranian government defense company Parchin Chemical Industries in 2008 and its suspected agents in 2022 for procuring ballistic missile propellant-related materials from abroad for use by Iran’s top military force, the Islamic Revolutionary Guards Corps.	https://www.voanews.com/a/exclusive-us-aware-of-reports-iran-is-trying-to-ship-missile-propellant-chemical-from-china/7961368.html	2025-02-03T11:19:17-08:00	
Djibouti drone strike kills at least 8 near Ethiopian border	Djibouti's security forces executed a drone strike near the Ethiopian border, killing eight members of what it calls a terrorist group and harming an unspecified number of civilians, officials said on Sunday. 'A drone attack was carried out against a terrorist group at Addorta, a Djiboutian locality some six kilometers from the border with Ethiopia,' a statement from the Djibouti defense ministry said. The statement said that the defense ministry confirmed that 'eight terrorists were neutralized,' but also noted that 'collateral damage was unfortunately reported among Djiboutian civilians,' without providing further details. In comments to AFP, Alexis Mohamed, an adviser to President Ismael Omar Guelleh, identified the militants as members of the Armed Front for the Restoration of Unity and Democracy, or FRUDA, which Djibouti classifies as a terrorist organization. The government said the group was involved in 'hostile actions' that posed 'a potential threat to our advanced posts.' An Ethiopian newspaper, the Addis Standard, reported that the drone strike occurred on Ethiopian territory — an assertion Djibouti rejected. Mohamed maintained that the attack took place within Djibouti's borders. Djibouti security officials did not respond to requests from VOA Somali to provide further details regarding the incident. In October 2022, an attack on barracks at Garabtisan, in the north of Djibouti, resulted in the deaths of seven soldiers and the kidnapping of six others. Officials in Djibouti blamed the attack on FRUD, the political arm of FRUDA. The abducted soldiers were released several weeks later. In 1991, FRUD, which originated in the Afar community in northern Djibouti, launched an anti-government insurgency, claiming to represent Afar interests against the Issas, the other major ethnic group in the tiny Horn of Africa country. Later, the group broke up, joining a four-party coalition that backs President Guelleh, but its armed wing, called FRUDA, has continued to carry out attacks against government forces. Several countries, including the United States and China, have military installations in Djibouti. The country sits on the west side of the Bab El Mandeb Strait, in East Africa. along one of the world's busiest maritime routes where the Red Sea meets the Gulf of Aden. Djibouti’s news comes two days after U.S. aircraft took aim at the Islamic State affiliate in neighboring Somalia, hitting what officials described as high-ranking operatives in the terror group's mountainous stronghold.

WHO urges US to reconsider withdrawal, warns of budget impact	The World Health Organization (WHO) has renewed its call for the United States to reverse its decision to withdraw from the U.N. health agency, warning of potential global health consequences and budget concerns. In his opening remarks at an executive board meeting on Monday, WHO Director-General Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus told attendees the health agency regrets the U.S. decision and hopes Washington will reconsider. 'We would welcome constructive dialogue to preserve and strengthen the historic relationship between WHO and the USA that helped bring significant impacts like the eradication of smallpox,' Tedros said, according to a WHO transcript of his speech. Two weeks ago, President Donald Trump signed an executive order announcing his intention to withdraw the U.S. from the WHO. According to financing data from the WHO, the U.S. contributed an estimated $988 million between January and November of 2024, marking approximately 14% of the WHO’s $6.9 billion budget. A document presented at a WHO budget meeting last week and obtained by The Associated Press said that U.S. funding 'provides the backbone of many of WHO's large-scale emergency operations.' This funding has been aimed toward combatting disease globally. For example, U.S. funding covers 95% of the WHO’s tuberculosis in Europe, along with 60% of the agency’s TB efforts in Africa, the Western Pacific, and headquarters in Geneva. In addition, as a result of U.S. withdrawal, the WHO’s responses in the Middle East, Ukraine and Sudan were at risk along with its polio-eradication and HIV programs, the document said. President Trump’s executive order cited four key reasons for Washington’s withdrawal. It said the WHO organization mishandled global health projects such as COVID-19 and failed to implement reform programs. It also said the WHO organization failed to 'demonstrate independence from the inappropriate political influence of WHO member states' and 'continues to demand unfairly onerous payments from the United States, far out of proportion with other countries’ assessed payments.' In his call for the U.S. to reconsider its position Tedros said the WHO has implemented its deepest and most wide-ranging reforms over the past seven years. Those reforms, he said in his remarks, have 'touched every part of our work: our strategy, operating model, processes, partnerships, financing, workforce and culture.' In the health agency’s defense, he added that the WHO has implemented reforms focused on addressing financing imbalances, responded appropriately to the COVID-19 crisis and has been impartial existing to serve the needs of all countries and peoples. Some material in this report came from The Associated Press, Reuters and Agence France-Presse.	https://www.voanews.com/a/who-urges-us-to-reconsider-withdrawal-warns-of-budget-impact-/7961350.html	2025-02-03T11:07:36-08:00	
US foreign aid freeze sends shockwaves through Ukraine	The decision by U.S. President Donald Trump to freeze most foreign aid has left Ukrainian organizations that provide humanitarian aid and other services scrambling.

Musk is 'special government employee,' White House confirms	Washington — Elon Musk is working for President Donald Trump as a 'special government employee,' according to a White House official, solidifying his controversial role in the administration but sidestepping some disclosure rules that are typical of federal workers. The official, speaking Monday on the condition of anonymity to discuss personnel matters, said that Musk has a government email address and office space in the White House complex. Musk, the world's richest man, has been granted broad latitude by Trump to reduce the size of the federal government. On Monday morning, the headquarters of the U.S. Agency for International Development was abruptly shut down. Musk's team, known as the Department of Government Efficiency, also has received access to sensitive payment systems at the U.S. Treasury Department. Democrats fear that Musk is consolidating power within the federal government, acting without accountability and potentially against the law. Special government employees are usually appointed to their position for up to 130 days. It's unclear how standard rules on ethics agreements and financial disclosures will apply to Musk, who has billions of dollars in federal contracts with SpaceX, his rocket company. Musk does not receive a paycheck for his work, the White House official said. Under federal guidelines, it's unlikely that he will need to file a public financial disclosure report. The official did not provide additional details apart from saying that Musk is following the law. Trump signaled his approval of Musk's work on Sunday evening after returning to Washington from his weekend in Florida. 'I think Elon is doing a good job. He's a big cost-cutter,' the Republican president said. 'Sometimes we won't agree with it and we'll not go where he wants to go. But I think he's doing a great job.'	https://www.voanews.com/a/musk-is-special-government-employee-white-house-confirms-/7961332.html	2025-02-03T10:40:36-08:00	
Uganda's Supreme Court bans military trials for civilians; government rejects ruling	NAIROBI — Uganda’s Supreme Court recently ruled that trying civilians in military courts is unconstitutional. Human rights groups welcomed the decision as a major step in protecting the right to a fair trial, but the government criticized the move. Human Rights Watch’s senior researcher Oryem Nyeko said the decision is encouraging, as it reflects the values of human rights and the right to a fair trial. The idea that civilians should not be tried in military courts is something that is agreed upon at many levels, including in international law, Nyeko added. Ugandan President Yoweri Museveni criticized the ruling, saying the country is not governed by judges but by the people. Museveni defended the military courts, saying its trials reinforce the civilian judicial system to defend the lives of people against armed criminals. According to rights groups, Ugandan military courts have tried hundreds of civilians, including opposition politicians and government critics. In 2016, former Parliament member Michael Kabaziguruka was charged with security-related offenses and tried in a military court. In successfully petitioning the Supreme Court, he argued that it was against the law for him and other civilians to face a General Court Martial (GCM). Kabaziguruka argued that the GCM was incapable of dispensing justice, so no one who went there expected justice to be served. Instead, he said, the GCM has been used as a tool of repression by the government to fight its political opponents. The court’s ruling has given hope to opposition leader Kizza Besigye, who was abducted in Kenya in November and days later appeared before a military court in Kampala. He faces the death penalty for treason. Despite the high court ruling, his court-martial case is expected to continue. Army spokesperson Chris Magezi said a military court can try any person accused of conspiring to kill the president or accused of committing armed rebellion or terrorism against Uganda. Kabaziguruka said he isn’t interested in the president’s criticisms, as the Supreme Court ruling over the courts-martial issue is final. The president can rant, Kabaziguruka said, but he cannot change the ruling. Kabaziguruka also said that civilian defendants in military courts are treated poorly and tortured by soldiers, leaving an indelible mark. Museveni argued that military courts are beneficial to the country's security and ordered the attorney general to propose constitutional amendments to prevent judges from interfering with their work.	https://www.voanews.com/a/uganda-s-supreme-court-bans-military-trials-for-civilians-government-rejects-ruling/7961182.html	2025-02-03T09:03:32-08:00	
Bird flu pandemic potential in US worries scientists, farmers	The recent outbreak of the H5N1 avian influenza virus in the U.S. and the potential for it to mutate has raised concerns among the scientific community that it could result in human-to-human transmission and a new pandemic. Farmers are also concerned about the potential impacts on their livelihood.

Spanish soccer boss pleads not guilty in ‘kiss’ trial	Madrid — A female Spanish soccer player told a court Monday that her boss kissed her against her will as millions watched on television, then pressured her to say it was consensual, in a case widely seen as putting machismo in sport on trial. Jenni Hermoso testified before Madrid’s High Court as Luis Rubiales, the former president of the Spanish Soccer Federation, went on trial facing charges of sexual assault and coercion. Rubiales entered a plea of not guilty. The 47-year-old prompted outrage in 2023 as he cupped star player Hermoso’s head and gave her an unsolicited kiss on the mouth after Spain beat England to win the Women’s World Cup Final in Australia. In the hours after the incident, Rubiales allegedly tried to pressure Hermoso into saying that the kiss was consensual. The furor partially overshadowed Spain’s triumph and prompted Spain’s own #MeToo moment when women posted #SeAcabo — it’s over — on social media, signaling they would not tolerate macho treatment in sport anymore. In a highly anticipated trial, beamed live on television in Spain, Hermoso told the court she felt disrespected as a woman. 'My boss was kissing me, and this shouldn’t happen in any social or work setting. A kiss on the lips has a connotation that goes beyond a kiss of courtesy and friendship,' she said. 'As a woman I felt disrespected. It was a moment that stained one of the happiest days of my life. For me it is very important to say that at no point did I seek that act, let alone expect it.' After the final in Australia, Hermoso said on the team’s journey back to Spain, she said she came under pressure from Rubiales and other soccer federation officials to agree to a statement which said it was a consensual kiss. 'They had never asked me about it,' she said. 'I said no.' Hermoso said she was also asked to make a video with Rubiales for the media when the team’s plane stopped off in Doha on the way back, to downplay the incident. She said she refused. Hermoso said when she returned to Spain, she received death threats and had to leave Madrid with her family. 'I had cameramen outside my house 24/7 and cars. I received death threats. I had to leave Madrid with my family. It was impossible to be there,' she said. She said she had to see her psychologist more than normal because of the repercussions of the case. 'I didn’t choose this. I never would. Why did this have to happen to me? Until today, it feels like my life has been on standby' because of the case, she said. A recent reform of the Spanish penal code classified a non-consensual kiss as sexual assault. Rubiales, who had been soccer federation chief since 2018, initially dismissed the kiss as a 'peck' but gave in to pressure and resigned in September 2023 after an investigation began into the case. Amid huge international media interest, the trial in Madrid is expected to run for three weeks. Then the judges will retire to consider their verdicts. Prosecutors are seeking two and a half years in prison for Rubiales if he is convicted on the sexual assault charges. Three other former soccer officials are also accused of trying to coerce Hermoso into saying that the kiss was consensual. They are ex-women’s national team coach Jorge Vilda and two other Spanish soccer federation officials Ruben Rivera and Albert Luque. All face prison terms of up to 18 months in prison if convicted but deny coercion. Four teammates from Spain’s soccer team are expected to appear as witnesses for the prosecution. Misa Roriguez, Alexia Putellas, Irene Paredes and Laia Condia, who all play for teams in Spain or Britain, will appear during the trial. Rubiales, who is expected to take the stand on February 12, has denied coercing Hermoso into the kiss. The case has gripped Spain. Before the trial got under way, Equality Minister Ana Redondo posted on social media X: 'Thanks to you [Jenni] and your teammates we added another victory for feminism.' In the days after the scandal blew up, the saga took an unexpected turn when Rubiales’ mother Angeles Bejar started a brief hunger strike in support of her son inside a Catholic Church in the family’s hometown of Motril in southern Spain. In a sign that this was a defining moment not just for Spanish sport but for women’s rights, the country’s World Cup women’s soccer team staged a temporary strike and refused to play under the existing managers of the Spanish federation. Women have made great advances in recent years in Spain. Half of the 22 cabinet posts in the Spanish government are occupied by women, from the treasury to labor ministries. Isabel Díaz Ayuso, the Madrid regional leader who is a star figure of the conservative opposition, is considered a possible future prime minister. With 74.6 out of 100 points, Spain ranks 6th in the European Union on the gender equality index,six points above the EU average.	https://www.voanews.com/a/spanish-soccer-boss-pleads-not-guilty-in-kiss-trial-/7961045.html	2025-02-03T08:36:39-08:00	
Rubio hails US-Panama cooperation as deportation flight returns undocumented Colombians	State Department — U.S. Secretary of State Marco Rubio said cooperation with Panama has sent 'a clear message' the U.S. will act to curb illegal immigration, as he observed a U.S.-funded deportation flight departing from Albrook International Airport in Panama on Monday morning. The flight returned dozens of undocumented Colombians to their home country. According to a Colombian official, 32 men and 11 women were repatriated, including seven individuals with criminal records. On July 1, 2024 — the first day of Panamanian President Jose Raul Mulino’s term — the U.S. and Panama signed a memorandum of understanding (MOU) aimed at jointly reducing the number of migrants illegally crossing through Panama’s Darien region en route to the United States. The program is funded by the U.S. State Department and implemented by the Department of Homeland Security (DHS). Monday’s deportation was carried out under the MOU and following a State Department waiver that lifted a previous pause on U.S. foreign aid. 'This is an effective way to stem the flow of illegal migration, of mass migration, which is destructive and destabilizing,' Rubio told reporters at the Albrook International Airport. 'This flight today was possible due to a waiver that we've issued,' he added. 'We’re going to issue a broader one to continue this cooperation.' Under the 2024 MOU, the United States has provided nearly $2.7 million to fund flights and tickets to repatriate migrants to their countries of origin. Since the first repatriation flight on August 20, 2024, over 40 charter flights have been conducted from Panama to more than 14 countries, returning more than 1,700 undocumented migrants. Destinations have included Colombia, Ecuador, India, and Vietnam. Panama recently reported a 90% decrease in migrants crossing the Darien region compared to the same period last year. Canal controversy On Sunday, Rubio warned Panama that Washington will 'take necessary measures' if Panama does not take immediate steps to end what U.S. President Donald Trump described as China's 'influence and control' over the Panama Canal. 'Secretary Rubio made clear that this status quo is unacceptable,' State Department spokesperson Tammy Bruce said in a statement after Rubio’s talks with Mulino. Mulino also announced that Panama has decided not to renew a 2017 memorandum with China on Beijing’s Belt and Road Initiative and will seek to void agreements with the Chinese government before their official expiration dates. 'We'll study the possibility of terminating it early,' Mulino added on Sunday. The Belt and Road Initiative, or BRI, is a massive infrastructure project launched by China in 2013 under President Xi Jinping, aiming to connect multiple continents through land and maritime routes. The United States has cautioned that the BRI 'is fueled by China's mission to manipulate and undermine the global rules-based trading system for its own benefit.' Rubio will next head to El Salvador where he will meet with Salvadoran President Nayib Bukele and Foreign Minister Alexandra Hill Tinoco.	https://www.voanews.com/a/rubio-hails-us-panama-cooperation-as-deportation-flight-returns-undocumented-colombians/7961094.html	2025-02-03T07:54:41-08:00	
Film director found guilty of sexual assault in France's first big #MeToo trial	Paris — Film director found guilty of sexual assault in France's first big #MeToo trial PARIS (AP) — A Paris court found a filmmaker guilty of sexual assault on French actor Adèle Haenel when she was between 12 and 15 in the early 2000s, in the country's first big #MeToo trial. Filmmaker Christophe Ruggia was sentenced Monday to two years under house arrest with an electronic bracelet plus a two-year suspended sentence. Ruggia had denied any wrongdoing. Haenel, now 35, was the first top actor in France to accuse the film industry of turning a blind eye to sexual abuse after the #MeToo movement broke out. In 2019, she accused Ruggia of having repeatedly touched her inappropriately during and after filming of the movie 'Les Diables,' or 'The Devils,' in the early 2000s. Haenel appeared relieved, breathing deeply, as Monday's verdict was being released. She was applauded by some women's rights activists as she left the courtroom. The court ruled that Ruggia 'took advantage of the dominant position' he had on Haenel at the time. 'During quasi-weekly meetings at your home for over three years you had sexualized gestures and attitudes,' as Haenel was 'gradually isolated' from her loved ones, the court said in a statement. Ruggia's lawyer said her client would appeal. He 'maintains that he has never touched Adèle Haenel,' the lawyer, Fanny Colin, said. 'Sentenced in these conditions and on the sole basis of her words seems to us not only unjustified but dangerous.' Haenel, star of the 2019 Cannes entry 'Portrait of a Lady on Fire,' has in recent years vocally protested what she's called an insufficient response to sexual abuse in French filmmaking. At the César Awards in 2020, she walked out of the ceremony after Roman Polanski won best director. Polanski is still wanted in the United States decades after he was charged with raping a 13-year-old girl in 1977. In 2023, Haenel, announced she was quitting the French film industry that she denounced for 'complacency toward sexual aggressors.' She published an open letter in which she said Cannes and other pillars of the French film industry are 'ready to do anything to defend their rapist chiefs.' While #MeToo initially struggled to find traction in France, some other actors and film industry workers have since spoken out. French renowned actor Judith Godrèche attended Monday's verdict at the Paris courthouse. 'It was a very moving and a very important moment that reminded me of things that, in my case, may go unpunished,' she told reporters with tears in her eyes. Last year, Godrèche accused film director Benoît Jacquot of having raped and physically abused her in a six-year relationship that began when she was 14 years old. Jacquot, who has more than 50 director credits in film and television, was handed preliminary charges of rape, sexual assault and violence in July 2024. Godrèche is also accusing another film director, Jacques Doillon, of sexual abuse while he was directing a film when she was 15. Both Jacquot and Doillon have denied the allegations. In a separate case, French actor Gérard Depardieu is to go on trial in March on charges of sexually assaulting two women on a film set. Depardieu, who has denied any wrongdoing, is accused of using 'violence, coercion, surprise or threat' in the alleged sexual assaults that prosecutors say took place in 2021 on the set of 'Les Volets verts,' or 'The Green Shutters.'	https://www.voanews.com/a/film-director-found-guilty-of-sexual-assault-in-france-s-first-big-metoo-trial-/7960993.html	2025-02-03T06:40:18-08:00	
Crews return to the Potomac River to recover wreckage from DC midair collision	Arlington — Crews were on the scene on the Potomac River on Monday to retrieve the submerged wreckage of an airliner and an Army helicopter that collided midair in the deadliest U.S. air disaster since 2001. Authorities have recovered and identified 55 of the 67 people killed in the crash and Washington, D.C., Fire and EMS Chief John Donnelly has said they are confident all will be found. Crews were expected to begin the work of lifting the wreckage on Monday and at daybreak they could be seen aboard a vessel with a crane. More than 300 responders were taking part in the recovery effort at a given time, officials said. Two Navy barges were also deployed to lift heavy wreckage. Divers and salvage workers are adhering to strict protocols and will stop moving debris if a body is found, Col. Francis B. Pera of the Army Corps of Engineers said Sunday. The 'dignified recovery' of remains takes precedence over all else, he said. Portions of the two aircraft that collided over the river Wednesday night near Reagan Washington National Airport — an American Airlines jet with 64 people aboard and an Army Black Hawk helicopter with 3 aboard — will be loaded onto flatbed trucks and taken to a hangar for investigation. The crash occurred when the jet, en route from Wichita, Kansas, was about to land. The Black Hawk was on a training mission. There were no survivors. On Sunday, family members were taken in buses with a police escort to the Potomac River bank near where the two aircraft came to rest after colliding. The plane's passengers included figure skaters returning from the 2025 U.S. Figure Skating Championships in Wichita and a group of hunters returning from a guided trip. Army Staff Sgt. Ryan Austin O'Hara, 28, of Lilburn, Georgia; Chief Warrant Officer 2 Andrew Loyd Eaves, 39, of Great Mills, Maryland; and Capt. Rebecca M. Lobach, of Durham, North Carolina, were in the helicopter. Federal investigators were working to piece together the events that led to the collision. Full investigations typically take a year or more. Investigators hope to have a preliminary report within 30 days. Wednesday's crash was the deadliest in the U.S. since Nov. 12, 2001, when a jet slammed into a New York City neighborhood just after takeoff, killing all 260 people on board and five on the ground. Experts stress that plane travel is overwhelmingly safe, but the crowded airspace around Reagan Airport can challenge even experienced pilots.	https://www.voanews.com/a/crews-return-to-the-potomac-river-to-recover-wreckage-from-dc-midair-collision-/7960955.html	2025-02-03T06:09:57-08:00	
Pakistan sets deadline for Western nations to relocate Afghan allies	Islamabad — Pakistan has decided to deport thousands of Afghan nationals if Western countries, including the United States, do not relocate them as promised for resettlement abroad by the end of March, officials confirmed Monday. The individuals in question took refuge in Pakistan after the Taliban regained control of Afghanistan in 2021, primarily seeking shelter from potential retribution due to their affiliations with the U.S. and NATO forces. Pakistani foreign ministry spokesman Shafqat Ali Khan recently reported that 'almost 80,000' Afghans have so far been 'taken by various countries for resettlement, and around 40,000 are still in Pakistan.' They reportedly include an estimated 15,000 Afghans to be approved for resettlement in the U.S. Last week, Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif led a meeting in Islamabad to discuss the status of nearly three million Afghan refugees residing in the country, including documented and undocumented refugees, economic migrants, and those who are awaiting resettlement to a third country. A post-meeting document seen by VOA on Monday outlines a multi-stage repatriation plan, requiring authorities to move 'Afghan nationals bound for 3rd country resettlement' out of the Pakistani capital and adjacent garrison city of Rawalpindi by March 31, 2025. It did not elaborate. Sharif directed the foreign ministry 'to ensure coordination with foreign [diplomatic] missions for their relocation, including to their intended destinations, failing which they will also be repatriated to Afghanistan.' The U.S. and allied troops withdrew from Afghanistan just days after the Taliban swept back to power in Kabul three-and-a-half years ago. The withdrawal ended a nearly two-decade-long U.S. involvement in the Afghan war, with coalition forces also evacuating tens of thousands of Afghan allies with a pledge to resettle them abroad. Many of them were airlifted and transported to Pakistan temporarily. Last month, new President Donald Trump’s administration announced the suspension of the U.S. Refugee Admission Program, saying the pause was intended to assess whether reinstating the program serves the interests of Washington. The announcement further complicated the Afghans' already slow and complex relocation process. Under the Pakistani plan, Sharif has also directed authorities to immediately relocate all legal Afghan migrants, including those without residential permits, from Islamabad and Rawalpindi and repatriate them to Afghanistan. Although specific figures were not provided, official estimates indicate that the number of migrants with legal status in Pakistan exceeds 800,000 holding the Afghan Citizen Card, or ACC. The official document outlining the deportation stages emphasized that no public announcement should be made regarding the planned deportations of Afghans, and it 'shall be ensured that they do not return once repatriated.' Pakistani authorities have already forced more than 800,000 undocumented Afghans out of the country since launching an official crackdown on foreign immigrants lacking documents or visas in late 2023. Pakistan is home to more than one million Afghans recognized by the United Nations as lawfully registered refugees, holding a Proof of Registration, or POR, card. The Sharif government has granted POR cardholders permission to remain in Pakistan until June 30, 2025. These families primarily consist of those who escaped decades of war, persecution, and the previous Islamist Taliban regime in Afghanistan from 1996 to 2001. The majority of the lawful refugees are either born or raised in Pakistan and are hesitant to return to a country that feels unfamiliar to them, according to officials from the U.N. refugee agency. Moreover, the U.N. says that years of conflicts, natural disasters, and deepening economic troubles after the Taliban takeover have worsened a long-running humanitarian crisis in poverty-stricken Afghanistan. Aid agencies estimate that more than half of the Afghan population require some assistance, which is a significant factor in discouraging refugees from returning home. The Taliban’s sweeping restrictions on Afghan women’s access to employment, education, and public life at large, in line with their strict interpretation of Islamic law, have also deterred refugee families from leaving Pakistan.	https://www.voanews.com/a/pakistan-sets-deadline-for-western-nations-to-relocate-afghan-allies/7960931.html	2025-02-03T05:54:34-08:00	
South Africa defends itself against Trump and Musk attacks on land policy	JOHANNESBURG — South Africa defended itself on Monday against attacks on its land confiscation policy by Donald Trump and his South African-born billionaire backer Elon Musk after the U.S. president said he would cut off funding to the country over the issue. Trump said on Sunday, without citing evidence, that 'South Africa is confiscating land' and 'certain classes of people' were being treated 'very badly.' 'I will be cutting off all future funding to South Africa until a full investigation of this situation has been completed!' he said. South African President Cyril Ramaphosa said the government had not confiscated any land, and he looked forward to engaging with Trump to foster a better understanding over the matter. The United States committed nearly $440 million in assistance to South Africa in 2023, the most recent U.S. government data showed. The lion's share of the sum, $315 million, was for HIV/AIDS. Ramaphosa said U.S. funding accounted for 17% of South Africa's HIV/AIDS program but it was reliant on 'no other significant funding' from the United States. The president signed into law a bill last month to make it easier for the state to expropriate land in the public interest, despite objections by some parties in his ruling coalition. The law aims to address stark racial disparities in land ownership that persist three decades after the end of apartheid in 1994. 'The recently adopted Expropriation Act is not a confiscation instrument, but a constitutionally mandated legal process that ensures public access to land in an equitable and just manner as guided by the constitution,' the presidency said. The question of land reform is highly politically charged in South Africa due to the legacy of the colonial and apartheid eras, when Black people were dispossessed of their lands and denied property rights. Musk, the world's richest person and a South African-born U.S. citizen who has Trump's ear and more than 200 million followers on the X social media platform that he owns, quickly waded into the dispute. 'Why do you have openly racist ownership laws?' he said in a post on X, responding to Ramaphosa who had posted the presidency statement. He was apparently suggesting white people were the victims of the racism he alleged. Ramaphosa's spokesperson Vincent Magwenya urged Musk to talk constructively with the South African president. 'My brother, you would know that owing to a devastating legacy of centuries of oppressive and brutal colonialism and apartheid, our constitution provides for redressing the ills of the past,' he said. Under the Expropriation Act, special conditions have to be met before expropriating land such as it having longtime informal occupants, being unused and held purely for speculation, or being abandoned. South Africa's rand fell nearly 2% against the dollar early on Monday after Trump's remarks. Stocks and the benchmark government bond also tumbled. Charles Robertson, an emerging markets specialist at FIM Partners, said that African countries were relatively well positioned to withstand an attack by Trump because the United States was a far less important investor than China and Europe. But any U.S. measures against South Africa would represent a serious challenge for Ramaphosa, who has been trying to boost the sluggish economy and attract foreign investors, he said. 'The difficulty with South Africa is, do you want to set up a factory in a country where today, Trump's cutting off all aid. Maybe tomorrow, he's ripping up AGOA (a trade deal with Africa) and maybe on Wednesday, he's adding 25% tariffs because they're too close to China,' he said.	https://www.voanews.com/a/south-africa-defends-itself-against-trump-and-musk-attacks-on-land-policy-/7960909.html	2025-02-03T05:43:55-08:00	
USAID staffers told to stay out of Washington headquarters after Musk said Trump agreed to close it	Washington — Staffers of the U.S. Agency for International Development were instructed to stay out of the agency's Washington headquarters on Monday, according to a notice distributed to them, after billionaire Elon Musk announced President Donald Trump had agreed with him to shut the agency. USAID staffers said they also tracked more than 600 employees who reported being locked out of the agency's computer systems overnight. Those still in the system received emails saying that 'at the direction of Agency leadership' the headquarters building 'will be closed to Agency personnel on Monday, Feb. 3.' The developments come after Musk, who's leading an extraordinary civilian review of the federal government with the Republican president's agreement, said early Monday that he had spoken with Trump about the six-decade U.S. aid and development agency and 'he agreed we should shut it down.' 'It became apparent that its not an apple with a worm it in,' Musk said in a live session on X Spaces early Monday. 'What we have is just a ball of worms. You've got to basically get rid of the whole thing. It's beyond repair.' 'We're shutting it down,' he said. Musk, Trump and some Republican lawmakers have targeted the U.S. aid and development agency, which oversees humanitarian, development and security programs in some 120 countries, in increasingly strident terms, accusing it of promoting liberal causes. Over the weekend, the Trump administration placed two top security chiefs at USAID on leave after they refused to turn over classified material in restricted areas to Musk's government-inspection teams, a current and a former U.S. official told The Associated Press on Sunday. Musk's Department of Government Efficiency, known as DOGE, earlier carried out a similar operation at the Treasury Department, gaining access to sensitive information including the Social Security and Medicare customer payment systems. The Washington Post reported that a senior Treasury official had resigned over Musk's team accessing sensitive information. Democratic lawmakers have protested the moves, saying Trump lacks constitutional authority to shut down USAID without congressional approval and decrying Musk's accessing sensitive government-held information through his Trump-sanctioned inspections of federal government agencies and programs. USAID, whose website vanished Saturday without explanation, has been one of the federal agencies most targeted by the Trump administration in an escalating crackdown on the federal government and many of its programs. 'It's been run by a bunch of radical lunatics. And we're getting them out,' Trump said to reporters about USAID on Sunday night. Musk's and Trump's comments came with Secretary of State Marco Rubio out of the country, in Central America, on his first trip abroad in office. Rubio has not spoken publicly about any plans to shut down USAID. The Trump administration and Rubio have imposed an unprecedented freeze on foreign assistance that has shut down much of USAID's aid programs worldwide — compelling thousands of layoffs by aid organizations — and ordered furloughs and leaves that have gutted the agency's leadership and staff in Washington.. Peter Marocco, a returning political appointee from Trump's first term, was a leader in enforcing the shutdown. USAID staffers say they believe that agency outsiders with visitors' badges asking questions of employees inside the Washington headquarters are members of Musk's DOGE team. Democratic Sen. Elizabeth Warren said in a post on Sunday that Trump was allowing Musk to access people's personal information and shut down government funding. 'We must do everything in our power to push back and protect people from harm,' the Massachusetts senator said, without giving details.	https://www.voanews.com/a/usaid-staffers-told-to-stay-out-of-washington-headquarters-after-musk-said-trump-agreed-to-close-it-/7960837.html	2025-02-03T05:11:48-08:00	
Facing tariff threats, India lowers import duties to signal it is not protectionist	New Delhi — With trade likely to emerge as the most contentious issue between India and the United States, New Delhi has signaled that it is moving to allay concerns of U.S. President Donald Trump, who has named India among countries that impose high tariffs. The government will cut duties on a range of imports that could help increase American imports to India. Those include high end motorcycles and cars potentially benefiting American companies like Harley Davidson. During an address to Republican lawmakers last week, Trump called India, along with China and Brazil, 'tremendous tariff makers.' and pledged to put tariffs on countries that harm U.S. interests. He also had called India a 'very big abuser of tariffs,' during his election campaign. In a phone call between Trump and Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi last Monday, the American president had stressed the importance of India moving toward a 'fair bilateral trading relationship,' according to a White House statement. With the United States being India’s largest trading partner, the threat of tariffs is a huge concern for New Delhi. Bilateral trade between the two countries in 2023 totaled almost $120 billion, with a surplus of $30 billion in India’s favor. 'These latest reductions in tariffs signal a policy shift that could enhance U.S. exports in sectors such as automobiles, technology and some components for the space sector,' according to Ajay Srivastava, founder of Global Trade Research Initiative, a think tank based in Delhi. 'However, U.S. is a small exporter of these items to India so the benefits to American companies may not be huge.' Trade is expected to be one of the top issues that will be discussed between Indian Prime Minister Modi and Trump, who are expected to meet this month. 'We don't want to give anybody any signal that we would like to be protectionist,' Finance Secretary Tuhin Kanta Pandey told Reuters after the cut in duties was announced during India’s annual budget presentation on Saturday. 'Our stance is that we don't want to increase protection.' But analysts say India’s tariff cuts are unlikely to allay the concerns of the Trump administration, which wants New Delhi to open its markets for a range of goods such as farm products, steel and oil. India's average tariffs are much higher compared to countries like Japan and China. The close strategic partnership that India and the U.S. have built in recent years may not stave off friction on trade issues, say analysts. 'Lowering some tariffs is the symbolic approach. We have made some gestures but nowhere near what would satisfy Trump,' according to Manoj Joshi, distinguished fellow at the Observer Research Foundation in New Delhi. 'On tariffs, I think the U.S. will put more pressure — after all, if Trump did not carve out exceptions for allies like Canada, why will he do it with India,' he questioned. In his last week’s phone conversation with Modi, Trump also said that India should be increasing its 'procurement of American-made security equipment.' India has been the world’s largest arms importer in recent years, spending billions of dollars to modernize its military. While Russia was its biggest supplier for decades, Western countries such as France and the United States are now emerging as key suppliers. 'There is scope for India to buy more weapons from the U.S. of which fighter jets could be a component,' according to defense analyst Rahul Bedi. 'That would help lower the trade tensions.' India is in 'wait and watch mode' after Trump imposed tariffs on Canada, Mexico and China, say analysts. 'The global trade environment has been plunged into uncertainty. We will just have to wait and see what actions are taken by Mr. Trump vis a vis India,' pointed out trade expert Srivastava. 'India will adjust where it can, but it is totally uncharted territory and nobody can really plan for it.' Friction on trade also erupted during Trump’s previous term as president when he terminated India’s designation as a developing nation that had allowed businesses to export hundreds of products duty-free to the United States. India had retaliated by raising duties on some American products.	https://www.voanews.com/a/facing-tariff-threats-india-lowers-import-duties-to-signal-it-is-not-protectionist-/7960808.html	2025-02-03T04:50:07-08:00	
Hospitals in eastern Congo are crowded with wounded and exhausting their supplies	GOMA, Congo — Hundreds of wounded people have poured into overcrowded hospitals in Goma, a major city in eastern Congo, as fighting rages on between government forces and the Rwanda-backed rebels who seized the city of around 2 million people. 'They will get infected before we can treat them all,' said Florence Douet, an operating room nurse at Bethesda Hospital, as she attended to patients with varying degrees of injuries. Since the start of the M23 rebels' offensive on Goma on Jan. 26, more than 700 people have been killed and nearly 3,000 have been wounded in the city and its vicinity, officials say. Bethesda Hospital alone said it receives more than 100 new patients each day, overstretching its capacity of 250 beds. Bethesda is one of several hospitals in Goma that The Associated Press visited that has inadequate personnel and supplies. The city hosts many of the close to 6.5 million people displaced by the conflict, which is one of the world’s largest humanitarian crises. As more people arrived at the hospitals with gunshot or shrapnel wounds, many were forced to share beds while others lay on the floor, writhing in pain as they waited for medical attention. 'This is the first time I’m experiencing this,' said Patrick Bagamuhunda, who was wounded in the fighting. 'This war has caused a lot of damage, but at least we are still breathing.' The M23 rebels are backed by some 4,000 troops from neighboring Rwanda, according to U.N. experts, far more than in 2012, when they first captured Goma before withdrawing under international pressure. They are the most potent of the more than 100 armed groups vying for control in Congo’s mineral-rich east, which holds vast deposits critical to much of the world’s technology. Unlike in 2012, the rebels say they now plan to march to Congo’s capital, Kinshasa, 1,600 kilometers away, describing the country as a failed state under President Félix Tshisekedi. The fighting in Congo has connections with a decadeslong ethnic conflict. M23 says it is defending ethnic Tutsis in Congo. Rwanda has claimed the Tutsis are being persecuted by Hutus and former militias responsible for the 1994 genocide of 800,000 Tutsis and others in Rwanda. Many Hutus fled to Congo after the genocide and founded the Democratic Forces for the Liberation of Rwanda (FDLR) militia group. Rwanda said the group is 'fully integrated' into the Congolese military, which denies the charges. Hospitals are running out of supplies Medical workers at Kyeshero Hospital in Goma say they are treating an increasing number of patients with bullet wounds. 'We removed 48 bullets yesterday,' Johnny Kasangati, a surgeon, said Friday as he examined a patient under a tent. Kyeshero is also severely overcrowded, hitting more than 200% of its capacity on some days, according to Joseph Amadomon Sagara, a project coordinator for Doctors Without Borders, which runs the hospital. In the past, hospitals in Goma could transport wounded patients by boat to South Kivu's main city, Bukavu, 180 kilometers to the south, but transport across Lake Kivu was suspended during the rebellion and roads have been mostly cut. The fighting in and around Goma has also disrupted supply chains, leading to shortages in medical supplies that aid groups rely on. Some of it previously entered the city through its international airport, which is now under rebel control. 'Goma was cut off from the world. It was a total blackout,' said Virginie Napolitano, Goma's emergency coordinator for Doctors Without Borders. The aid group's stockpiles, along with those of other groups, have been looted. 'We’re getting by with what we had in the cabinets, but I don’t know for how long,' Napolitano said. How many have died in the conflict? Congo's government has confirmed 773 deaths and 2,880 injured persons at morgues and hospitals. The toll could be higher, it said, citing fears of finding mass graves and more bodies. The Maternité de la Charité Hospital in Goma was among those struggling to find space for the dead. 'We had 66 bodies here. Fifty-six were transferred to the provincial hospital, where the morgue has more space than ours,' said Jules Kafitiye, the hospital's medical director. 'We need to avoid decomposition due to disease,' he added, pointing to a tent where bodies were being stored. Fears of disease spread as morgues overflow Scores of bodies lay on streets and in hospitals in Goma after the city's capture, raising fears of disease outbreaks in the region, which is also facing mpox and cholera outbreaks. The U.N. health body warned last week that repeated mass displacement in Congo has created ideal conditions for the spread of endemic diseases in displacement camps and surrounding communities, including cholera, which saw more than 22,000 infections last year, and measles, which affected close to 12,000 people. The region also battles with chronic child malnutrition. 'There’s a fear for the disease to be spreading widely in communities,' said Dr. Boureima Hama Sambo, the World Health Organization’s representative in Congo. 'But at this point, we cannot say because we have not been able to get there.'	https://www.voanews.com/a/hospitals-in-eastern-congo-are-crowded-with-wounded-and-exhausting-their-supplies-/7960758.html	2025-02-03T03:34:57-08:00	
WHO proposes budget cut after US exit, defends its work	London — World Health Organization member states will discuss cutting part of its budget by $400 million in light of President Trump's move to withdraw the United States, its biggest government funder, from the agency, a document released on Monday showed. Opening the agency's annual executive board meeting, WHO Director General Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus also defended the agency's work and recent reforms and reiterated a call for the U.S. to reconsider its exit and enter into dialog with the WHO about further change. 'We would welcome suggestions from the United States, and all member states, for how we can serve you and the people of the world better,' he said. The budget cut will be discussed at the Feb. 3-11 Geneva meeting, during which member state representatives will discuss the agency's funding and work for the 2026-2027 period. The executive board proposes cutting the base programs section of the budget from a proposed $5.3 billion to $4.9 billion, according to a document released on Monday. That is part of the wider $7.5 billion budget for 2026-2027 that was originally proposed, including money for polio eradication and tackling emergencies. 'With the departure of the biggest financial contributor, the budget could not be 'business as usual,'' the document reads. The U.S. is the WHO's biggest government donor, contributing around 18% of its overall funding. The WHO has already separately taken some cost-cutting steps after the U.S. move. However, some board representatives also wanted to send a message that the WHO would preserve its strategic direction despite the challenges, the document adds. The $4.9 billion is roughly the same as the base program budget for the previous period, 2024-2025. Trump moved to exit the WHO on his first day in office two weeks ago. The process will take one year under U.S. law.	https://www.voanews.com/a/who-proposes-budget-cut-after-us-exit-defends-its-work/7960730.html	2025-02-03T02:58:39-08:00	
Pope Francis decries deaths of children in global conflicts	VATICAN CITY — Pope Francis on Monday decried the deaths of children in global conflicts, telling a Vatican summit that 'nothing is worth the life of a child.' Francis, who has been critical of both Israel's military campaign in Gaza and the ongoing violence of the Russia-Ukraine war, did not specify a conflict in his remarks. 'What we have tragically seen almost every day in recent times, namely children dying beneath bombs ... is unacceptable,' said the pontiff. 'To kill children is to deny the future.' The Vatican, shaken in recent decades by child sexual abuse scandals in countries across the world, invited a range of global leaders on Monday for a one-day conference to discuss children's rights. Queen Rania of Jordan, Italian Foreign Minister Antonio Tajani, and former Indonesian president Megawati Sukarnoputri were among the speakers. Francis ramped up his criticism of Israel's military campaign in Gaza in recent months, before the January ceasefire agreement. A few weeks ago, he called the humanitarian situation in the Palestinian enclave 'very serious and shameful.' In Monday's speech, he also decried the number of children displaced by global conflicts, which the United Nations estimates at some 38 million. 'We are here today to say that we do not want this to become the new normal,' said the pope. 'We refuse to get used to it.' Francis, who has been sharply critical of U.S. President Donald Trump's clampdown on immigration, also mentioned undocumented children at the U.S.-Mexico border. He said they were the 'first victims of that exodus of despair and hope made by the thousands of people coming from the South towards the United States of America.'	https://www.voanews.com/a/pope-francis-decries-deaths-of-children-in-global-conflicts/7960712.html	2025-02-03T02:36:02-08:00	
At least 15 killed in car bomb explosion in northern Syria	DAMASCUS, Syria — At least 15 people were killed and dozens wounded Monday when a car bomb exploded on the outskirts of a northern Syrian city, local civil defense and a war monitor reported. The car on the outskirts of the city of Manbij detonated next to a vehicle carrying agricultural workers, killing 14 women and one man, the local Syrian civil defense reported. Another 15 women were wounded, some of them in critical condition. However, Britain-based war monitor The Syrian Observatory for Human Rights said 18 women were killed as well as one man. It was the seventh car bomb explosion in Manbij in just over a month, said Munir Mustafa, the deputy director of civil defense, known as The White Helmets. He warned that the ongoing attacks in Aleppo province near Syria's second city will halt Syria's progress to bring about post-war security and economic recovery. 'The continued attacks on Syrian civilian areas and targeting civilians while they are trying to recover from the effects of the war of the defunct Assad regime that lasted for about 14 years threatens their lives, deepens their humanitarian tragedy, undermines educational and agricultural activities and livelihoods, and worsens the humanitarian situation in Syria,' Mustafa said. Manbij in northeastern Aleppo province continues to witness violence even after the downfall of President Bashar Assad in December, where Turkish-backed factions known as the Syrian National Army continue to clash with the U.S.-backed Kurdish-led Syrian Democratic Forces. A car bombing in Manbij on Saturday killed four civilians and wounded nine, SANA reported, citing civil defense officials.	https://www.voanews.com/a/at-least-15-killed-in-car-bomb-explosion-in-northern-syria-/7960711.html	2025-02-03T02:34:31-08:00	
Russia says Ukrainian drone attacks targeted energy sites	Russian officials said Monday that Ukrainian drone attacks targeted energy facilities in two regions in southwestern Russia. Volgograd Governor Andrei Bocharov said falling debris from drones destroyed by Russian air defenses sparked fires at an oil refinery. Astrakhan Governor Igor Babushkin said the Ukrainian attacks focused on fuel and energy facilities, starting a fire in his region but causing no casualties. The officials did not give details about the sites involved in the attacks. Russia’s Defense Ministry said Monday it shot down 71 Ukrainian drones overnight, including over the Rostov, Volgograd, Astrakhan, Voronezh, Belgorod and Kursk regions. Belgorod Governor Vyacheslav Gladkov said on Telegram the attacks damaged three houses and an agricultural business. Ukraine’s military said Monday it destroyed 38 of the 71 drones that Russian forces launched in overnight attacks. The intercepts took place over the Cherkasy, Chernihiv, Dnipropetrovsk, Kharkiv, Khmelnytskyi, Kyiv, Poltava, Sumy, Vinnytsia and Zaporizhzhia regions. Cherkasy Governor Ihor Taburets said on Telegram that falling drone debris damaged four residential buildings. Kharkiv Governor Oleh Syniehubov reported the Russian attack damaged a school.

EU leaders to huddle on defense against Russia, economy, and US	BRUSSELS — European Union leaders gather on Monday to discuss how to bolster the continent's defenses against Russia and how to handle U.S. President Donald Trump after his decision to impose tariffs on goods from Canada, Mexico and China. At a royal palace-turned-conference center in Brussels, the leaders of the EU's 27 nations will also lunch with NATO Secretary General Mark Rutte and dine with British Prime Minister Keir Starmer. Antonio Costa, the president of the European Council of EU leaders, has billed the one-day gathering as a 'retreat' devoted to defense policy rather than a formal summit, aiming for an open discussion without any official declaration or decisions. The first session focuses on geopolitics and relations with the United States, meaning Trump's sweeping weekend move on tariffs is certain to come up – particularly as EU officials fear they may soon face similar measures. Trump, who began his second term as president on Jan. 20, will also be a major factor in the talks on defense, as he has demanded that European nations spend much more on their own protection and rely less on the United States via the NATO security alliance. Trump's call for EU member Denmark to cede Greenland to the United States - and his refusal to rule out military action or economic pressure to force Copenhagen's hand - has also added strains to trans-Atlantic ties. The EU leaders are expected to discuss what military capabilities they need in the coming years, how they could be funded and how they might cooperate more through joint projects. 'Europe needs to assume greater responsibility for its own defense,' Costa said in a letter to the leaders. 'It needs to become more resilient, more efficient, more autonomous and a more reliable security and defense actor.' Finding funding The funding discussion will be especially tough, according to diplomats, as many European countries have little room in their public finances for big spending hikes. Some countries, such as the Baltic states and France, advocate joint EU borrowing to spend on defense. But Germany and the Netherlands are staunchly opposed. One compromise could be to borrow to finance loans rather than grants for defense projects, according to some diplomats. European countries have ramped up defense spending in recent years, particularly since Russia's 2022 invasion of Ukraine, which brought war to the EU's borders. But many EU leaders have said they will need to spend even more. Trump has said NATO's European members should spend 5% of GDP on defense - a figure no member of the alliance including the United States currently reaches. Last year, EU countries spent an average of 1.9% of GDP on defense - about $334.48 billion, according to EU estimates. That is a 30% increase from 2021, according to the EU. But it also masks wide divergences among EU countries. Poland and the Baltic states are among the biggest defense spenders in GDP terms, with Warsaw leading the pack at more than 4.1%, according to NATO estimates. But some of the EU's biggest economies such as Italy and Spain spend much less - about 1.5% and 1.3% respectively.	https://www.voanews.com/a/eu-leaders-to-huddle-on-defense-against-russia-economy-and-us/7960644.html	2025-02-02T22:43:36-08:00	
Netanyahu to meet with US Middle East envoy to open US visit	Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu is set to meet Monday with U.S. Middle East envoy Steve Witkoff during a visit to Washington focused on Israel’s ceasefire with Hamas and other regional issues. Netanyahu’s office said he and Witkoff would discuss Israel’s ceasefire positions. The talks come as negotiations are expected to open this week on the second phase of the ceasefire, with the two sides needing to agree on matter such as the release of the remaining hostages held by Hamas and an end to the conflict that began in October 2023. Witkoff is due to follow his Netanyahu talks by speaking with officials from Egypt and Qatar, the other two nations that have led the ceasefire negotiations. Netanyahu is scheduled to meet Tuesday with U.S. President Donald Trump, and said those talks would include the war against Hamas, countering Iranian aggression and expanding diplomatic relations with Arab countries. Trump has been a staunch supporter of Israel but also pledged to end wars in the Middle East and took credit for helping to broker the ceasefire agreement. During the first phase of the ceasefire, which lasts six weeks, Hamas has freed 18 hostages in exchange for hundreds of Palestinian prisoners held by Israel. Hamas, a U.S. designated terror group, has quickly reasserted its control over Gaza since the ceasefire took hold last month, despite Israel saying it would not allow that to occur. The militants have said they will not release more hostages slated to go free in the second phase of the truce without an end to the war and the full withdrawal of Israeli forces from the narrow territory along the shores of the Mediterranean Sea. Netanyahu is under mounting pressure from far-right governing partners to resume the war after the first phase of the truce ends in early March. It's not clear where Trump stands. Netanyahu has said Israel is still committed to a full victory over Hamas and the return of all the hostages captured in the militants' shock Oct. 7, 2023, attack that killed 1,200 people and led to the capture of 250 hostages. Several dozen remain in Hamas hands, both living and dead. Israel’s counteroffensive during 15 months of warfare has killed more than 47,400 Palestinians, more than half of them women and children. Israel’s military says the death toll includes 17,000 militants it has killed. Even with the ceasefire, periodic attacks are still occurring. An Israeli airstrike on a vehicle in central Gaza wounded five people on Sunday, including a child who was in critical condition, according to Al-Awda Hospital, which received the casualties. The Israeli military said it fired upon the vehicle because it was bypassing a checkpoint while heading north in violation of the ceasefire agreement. Trump brokered normalization agreements between Israel and four Arab countries in his first term. He now is seeking a wider agreement in which Israel would forge ties with Saudi Arabia. But Riyadh has said it would only agree to such a deal if the war in Gaza ends and there is a credible pathway to a Palestinian state in Gaza, the West Bank and east Jerusalem, territories Israel captured in the 1967 Middle East war. The U.S. supports Palestinian statehood, but Netanyahu's government is opposed. Even as the Gaza ceasefire has mostly held for two weeks, Israel has ramped up operations in the occupied West Bank. On Sunday, the military said it was expanding an operation focused on the volatile city of Jenin, to the town of Tamun. The West Bank has seen a surge in violence since the start of the war in Gaza, with Israel launching near-daily military arrest raids. There has also been a rise in settler violence against Palestinians and Palestinian attacks on Israelis.

Trump to speak with Canadian, Mexican leaders after imposing new tariffs	U.S. President Donald Trump said he planned to speak Monday with the leaders of Canada and Mexico, days after announcing tariffs on goods from those countries and China that have were met with pledges of retaliatory tariffs and other actions. The new tariffs affect the top three U.S. trading partners, but Trump said the move would be 'worth the price' to bolster U.S. interests. Despite a free-trade pact he negotiated with Canada and Mexico in his first term in office, Trump on Saturday imposed 25% tariffs on the two countries set to take effect Tuesday, and hit China with a new 10% levy in addition to already enacted tariffs. Trump claimed the three countries were not doing enough to halt illegal immigration and the deadly opioid fentanyl from entering the United States. In Truth Social posts early Sunday, Trump acknowledged American consumers could face higher prices because of the tariffs. U.S. companies that pay the tariffs to the federal government to import goods from other countries then often pass on at least part, if not all, of their higher costs to consumers rather than absorb their extra expenses themselves. Trump aimed most of his comments at Canada, targeting one of the closest U.S. allies. The U.S. Census Bureau said the U.S. had a $55 billion trade deficit with Canada last year. 'Why? There is no reason,' Trump contended. 'We don’t need anything they have. We have unlimited Energy, should make our own Cars, and have more Lumber than we can ever use.' 'Without this massive subsidy, Canada ceases to exist as a viable Country. Harsh but true! Therefore, Canada should become our Cherished 51st State. Much lower taxes, and far better military protection for the people of Canada — AND NO TARIFFS!' Trump said. He said, 'Canada, Mexico, China, and too many others to name, continue the decades long RIPOFF OF AMERICA, both with regard to TRADE, CRIME, AND POISONOUS DRUGS that are allowed to so freely flow into AMERICA. THOSE DAYS ARE OVER!' With the new tariffs, Trump said, 'Will there be some pain? Yes, maybe (and maybe not!) But we will Make America Great Again, and it will all be worth the price that must be paid.' Trump aides had previously shied from acknowledging that tariffs could raise U.S. consumer prices. Nationwide polls in the U.S. showed that consumer frustration over rising prices during the last four years were a major factor in his November election victory over Democrat Kamala Harris. Trump has since acknowledged that it will not be easy to curb higher grocery prices. Trump put the new tariff on energy imports from Canada at 10%, apparently seeking to limit an increase in fuel and electricity prices. Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau said Saturday that his country would hit back with 25% percent levies of its own on select American goods worth $106.6 billion, with a first round on Tuesday followed by a second one in three weeks. Leaders of several Canadian provinces have already announced retaliatory actions as well, such as the immediate halt of U.S. liquor purchases, and more specifically, orange juice produced in the U.S. state of Florida, whiskey in Tennessee and peanut butter in Kentucky, three states Trump won in last November’s election and all represented by Republicans, like Trump, in the U.S. Senate. Kirsten Hillman, the Canadian ambassador to the U.S., told ABC’s 'This Week' show, 'We’re really disappointed' and 'perplexed' by Trump’s actions and said she hoped that Trump would back off before Tuesday. But she acknowledged that 'it’s really in the president’s hands' whether that happens. She said that 'less than 1% of illegal immigrants' entering the U.S. travel across its northern border with Canada. She said Canada has invested 'in a lot of equipment' to curb unauthorized border crossings and conducted joint exercises with the U.S. to catch migrants. 'It’s hard to know what more we could do,' she said. 'We’re not at all interested in escalating' a trade war with the U.S., where she said 99% of the trade is currently tariff-free. 'We’re eager to build on that.' Meanwhile, Mexican President Claudia Sheinbaum said she had directed her economy minister to 'implement Plan B,' which includes yet-unspecified 'tariff and non-tariff measures in defense of Mexico's interests,' without specifying what U.S. goods her government will target. U.S. exports to Mexico totaled more than $322 billion in 2023, Census Bureau data showed, while the U.S. imported more than $475 billion worth of Mexican products. Sheinbaum assailed Trump’s contention that her government had joined forces with drug cartels, a claim he made in announcing the tariff increases. 'We categorically reject the White House’s slanderous claim that the Mexico government has alliances with criminal organizations, as well as any attempt to intervene in our territory,' Sheinbaum wrote on X. 'If there is anywhere that such an alliance in fact exists, it is in the United States gun factories that sell high-powered weapons to these criminal groups.' China denounced the new tariffs on its exports, with Beijing saying it would challenge them at the World Trade Organization and take unspecified 'countermeasures.' The U.S. had a $279 billion trade deficit with China in 2023, the largest figure for any of its trading partners. That response stopped short of the immediate escalation that had marked China’s trade showdown with Trump during his first term as president. China’s commerce ministry said in a statement that Trump’s move 'seriously violates' international trade rules, urging the U.S. to 'engage in frank dialogue and strengthen cooperation.' Trump also has often threatened new tariffs against the European Union. A spokesperson for the bloc said Sunday that it would 'respond firmly to any trading partner that unfairly or arbitrarily imposes tariffs.'

Rising floodwaters force evacuations in eastern Australia	SYDNEY — Fast-moving floodwaters rose Monday in northeastern Australia after forcing many to flee, blacking out homes, and sweeping away a chunk of a critical bridge. Storms have already dumped more than a meter of rain in two days in parts of Queensland, engulfing homes, businesses and roads in muddy waters, authorities said. Aerial footage showed rural communities surrounded by the floodwaters, cut off from nearby roads. 'We are going to see widespread rain and storms spread across much of northern Queensland,' the state's premier, David Crisafulli, warned in a news conference. 'We remain prepared for the ongoing prospect of more rain and the likelihood of more flooding, both flash flooding and riverine flooding,' he said. Emergency services carried out 11 'swift water rescues' overnight, the premier said. Areas of flood-hit Townsville, a popular coastal tourist destination that lies near the Great Barrier Reef, had been declared a 'black zone,' he said. 'Our advice to residents in the black zone at the moment is to stay out of that zone and stay safe.' The authorities told 2,100 people in the town to evacuate at the weekend, though about 10% refused, emergency services officials said. 'Bridge torn in two' One woman in her 60s was killed Sunday when the rescue boat she was in flipped over in the flood-hit rural town of Ingham, about 100 kilometers from Townsville, police said. Her body was recovered later. The floods swept away a section of a concrete bridge over a creek, cutting off the state's main coastal road, the Bruce Highway, the state premier said. 'It's not every day you see a bridge torn in two. That's what has happened at Ollera Creek, and it is significant,' Crisafulli said. Almost 11,000 properties remained without power across north Queensland, Ergon Energy said, with no timeframe given for when electricity will be restored. Townsville acting mayor Ann-Maree Greaney said the floods were expected to peak on Tuesday morning. 'The roads at the moment are cut off, so communities are isolated,' she told AFP. The town was pressing for power to be restored and working with major supermarkets to deliver food, the mayor said. As global temperatures rise because of climate change, scientists have warned that heatwaves and other extreme weather events, such as severe flooding, droughts and wildfires will become more frequent and more intense.	https://www.voanews.com/a/rising-floodwaters-force-evacuations-in-eastern-australia-/7960622.html	2025-02-02T20:10:34-08:00	
Chappell Roan wins best new artist at the Grammys	LOS ANGELES — Chappell Roan was named best new artist at the 2025 Grammys. She read a speech from a notebook, beginning by addressing her fellow nominees. 'BRAT was the best night of my life this year,' she said, as her hat fell off her head, referencing Charli xcx. Then her speech changed course. She directed her attention to major labels and the music industry, instructing them to 'offer a living wage and healthcare, especially to developing artists.' Then she described getting signed as a minor, getting dropped and entering the workforce during COVID-19 with no work experience and no health care. She asked them to treat artists like 'valuable employees.' 'Labels, we got you, but do you got us?' she concluded her speech. 'Thank you.' In one of the biggest moments of the evening so far, Taylor Swift presented the award for best country album at the 2025 Grammys to Beyoncé for her groundbreaking 'Cowboy Carter.' 'I really was not expecting this. Wow,' she started her speech. 'Genre is a cold word to keep us in our place as artists ... I'm still in shock. Thank you so much for this honor.' A little bit of the wild west, a little bit of West Hollywood. Chappell Roan brought a rocking version of her 'Pink Pony Club' to the 2025 Grammy stage. Joined by a posse of dancing clown cowboys, she sang from atop a giant pink horse. The Grammys are airing live on CBS and Paramount+. Paramount+ with Showtime subscribers can also watch live and on demand. The first televised award of the 2025 Grammy Awards went to Doechii for best rap album for 'Alligator Bites Never Heal.' The tears were immediate. 'This category was introduced in 1989. Two women have won, Lauryn Hill —' she said, correcting herself. 'Three women have won. Lauryn Hill, Cardi B and Doechii.' It was Doechii's first Grammy. Her heartfelt speech came after the show opened with several references to the Los Angeles-area wildfires that have devastated the city but put the spotlight on the city's resiliency. The Grammys kicked off Sunday at the Crypto.com Arena in high spirits, drawing attention to first responders and the resilience of the music community. Host Trevor Noah's opening speech was dedicated to those affected by the fires, promising a show that not only celebrates them, but one that also celebrates 'the city that brought us so much of that music.' The Grammys have also allotted ad time to be used by local businesses affected by the fires. On a stage set up to look like the mountains of Los Angeles, the LA born-and-raised Billie Eilish and her brother/collaborator Finneas performed her hit 'Birds of a Feather.' It was one of a number of ways the show seeks to salute the city. 'We love you LA,' she told the crowd at the end of the set. The show kicked off with a powerful opening performance of Randy Newman's 'I Love L.A.' by Dawes — whose members were directly affected by the Eaton fire — backed by John Legend, Brad Paisley, Sheryl Crow, Brittany Howard and St. Vincent. Later, Sabrina Carpenter launched into a medley of her biggest singles of the last year — a jazzy rendition of 'Espresso' into 'Please, Please, Please,' with a brief 'Espresso' reprise. Most of the best new artist nominees took part in a medley performance: Khruangbin with 'May Ninth,' Benson Boone with 'Beautiful Things,' Doechii launching 'Catfish' into 'Denial Is a River,' Teddy Swims doing 'Lose Control,' Shaboozey with 'Good News' into 'A Bar Song (Tipsy)' and RAYE with 'Oscar Winning Tears.' The Red Hot Chili Peppers’ Anthony Kiedis and Chad Smith led the crowd in a short singalong of their hit 'Under the Bridge,' reminding the crowd to 'support their friends and neighbors as they rebuild their lives,' said Kiedis. Then they presented the best pop vocal album award to Carpenter for 'Short n' Sweet.' 'I really wasn’t expecting this,' she said. 'This is, woo, my first Grammy so I’m going to cry.' (She’s now won two, but the earlier award was handed out a pre-telecast ceremony that many artists don’t attend.) First time winners were abundant An exciting, early theme of the 67th Grammy Awards? First time winners. During Sunday’s Premiere Ceremony, a pre-telecast show hosted by songwriter Justin Tranter, some of the biggest names in pop like Carpenter and Charli xcx won their first Grammys, as did Música Mexicana star Carin León, French metal band Gojira and country folk artist Sierra Ferrell. They weren’t the only ones: Veterans took home trophies, as did former President Jimmy Carter. He won a posthumous Grammy Award for narrating 'Last Sundays in Plains: A Centennial Celebration,' recordings from his final Sunday School lessons delivered at Maranatha Baptist Church in Georgia. It was his fourth Grammy win. Soon afterward, Charli xcx also won her first two Grammys, in the best pop dance recording category for 'Von Dutch' and best dance/electronic album for 'BRAT.' Amy Allen won the songwriter of the year, non-classical, a Grammy category that has only existed for three years. She is the first woman to ever win. Tobias Jesso Jr. won in 2023 and Theron Thomas won in 2024. 'The child in me ... is screaming and crying and laughing at the absurdity of this moment,' Allen started her speech. 'We are the engine that fuels the entire music industry,' she said of songwriters past and present. Ferrell won her first Grammys for Americana performance, Americana roots song, Americana album, and American roots performance. She pulled an acceptance speech out of scepter. 'Honestly this is kind of hilarious,' she joked after returning to the stage for a third time. 'Yikes!' she started her fourth acceptance speech. Beyoncé, Kendrick Lamar and other music giants recognized Leading nominee Beyoncé won her first award of the day for her song featuring Miley Cyrus, 'II Most Wanted.' It took home the country duo/group performance during the Grammy’s Premiere Ceremony, where a whopping 85 awards will be handed out. It marks Beyoncé’s first win in a country category. Kenrick Lamar’s ubiquitous 'Not Like Us' was an early winner, receiving trophies for music video, rap song and rap performance. It marks his seventh time winning in the latter category. The Beatles’ 'Now and Then,' which used AI technology, took home best rock performance. Sean Lennon accepted the award on behalf of his father John Lennon. 'As far as I’m concerned, it’s the best band of all time,' he said of the Beatles. 'Play the Beatles’ music for your kids. I feel like the world can’t afford to forget.' Who's nominated at the 2025 Grammys Beyoncé leads the Grammy nods with 11 thanks to her acclaimed 'Cowboy Carter' album, bringing her career total to 99 nominations. She's also been the most decorated artist, having earned 32 trophies across her career. Post Malone, Billie Eilish, Kendrick Lamar and Charli xcx follow with seven nominations. Taylor Swift and first-time nominees Carpenter and Roan boast six nominations each.	https://www.voanews.com/a/chappell-roan-wins-best-new-artist-at-the-grammys/7960621.html	2025-02-02T20:04:44-08:00	
Trial of Spain's ex-football chief over forced kiss to begin	MADRID — Spain's former football chief Luis Rubiales goes on trial on Monday over the forced kiss he gave star forward Jenni Hermoso with the player scheduled to take the stand. The 47-year-old provoked worldwide outrage after he cupped Hermoso's head and gave her an unsolicited kiss after Spain beat England to win the 2023 Women's World Cup in Australia. Prosecutors are seeking two and a half years in prison for Rubiales, one year for sexual assault for the forced kiss and 18 months for allegedly coercing Hermoso, 34, to downplay the incident. The kiss was given 'unexpectedly and without the consent or acceptance of the player,' prosecutors wrote in their indictment. 'Constant and repeated pressure was exerted directly on the player Jennifer Hermoso and through her family and friends with the aim of justifying and publicly approving the kiss that Luis Rubiales gave her against her will,' it added. The highly anticipated trial gets underway at the National Court in San Fernando de Henares near Madrid at 10 a.m. and is expected to run until Feb. 19. Rubiales is scheduled to take the stand on Feb. 12. He has called the kiss an innocuous 'peck between friends celebrating' and denied any coercion. Among the accused alongside Rubiales are ex-women's national team coach Jorge Vilda and two former federation officials, Ruben Rivera and Albert Luque. They also stand accused of trying to coerce Hermoso with prosecutors seeking 18 months' jail against them. Historic success overshadowed The scandal that rocked Spanish football and wrecked Rubiales' career broke on Aug. 20, 2023, moments after the women's national team had clinched World Cup glory in Sydney. As Hermoso joined her teammates in collecting their winner's medals, Rubiales clasped her head and kissed her on the lips before letting her go with two slaps on the back. The act unleashed a public outcry at what critics deemed an abuse of power. A recent reform of the Spanish criminal code classifies a non-consensual kiss as sexual assault. Rubiales, who was already under investigation for alleged corruption in his role as federation head, finally gave into pressure and stepped down in September 2023, two days after the start of a probe over the kiss. He had been federation chief since 2018. In a recent Netflix documentary titled 'Se acabo' ('It's over'), which looks back at the players' anger after the scandal overshadowed their historic success, Hermoso revealed she cried following the kiss. Hermoso, the all-time top scorer for the national women's team who now plays in Mexico, said in the documentary that the federation demanded she appear in a video where she would claim Rubiales' kiss 'was nothing, it was... joy, euphoria.'	https://www.voanews.com/a/trial-of-spain-s-ex-football-chief-over-forced-kiss-to-begin-/7960597.html	2025-02-02T18:46:40-08:00	
Georgian police arrest opposition leaders at pro-EU protest	TBILISI, Georgia — Police in Georgia arrested several anti-government protesters on Sunday as thousands of demonstrators demanding new parliamentary elections briefly blocked a motorway on the edge of the capital Tbilisi. A Reuters reporter saw three protesters being arrested, including Nika Melia, a leader of the country's largest opposition party, the Coalition for Change. Interfax news agency reported that Melia has since been released on bail after detention for an administrative offense. 'At the police station, I was sitting on a chair in handcuffs and was kicked by a police officer,' Interfax cited Melia as telling journalists afterwards. Reuters could not independently verify the information. There was no immediate comment from the police. Georgia's Ministry Of Internal Affairs had said in a statement before the protest that the police would ensure the rally took place 'in a peaceful environment, within the limits established by law.' Former Tbilisi Mayor Giorgi Ugulava was also arrested, local media reported. Late Sunday, EU foreign policy chief Kaja Kallas blasted the arrests. 'The brutal crackdown on peaceful protesters, journalists and politicians tonight in Tbilisi is unacceptable,' Kallas wrote on X. 'Georgia falls short of any expectation from a candidate country. The EU stands with the people of Georgia in their fight for freedom and democracy.' Georgians have been rallying nightly since November, when the ruling Georgian Dream party said it was suspending European Union accession talks until 2028, abruptly halting a long-standing national goal. Georgian Dream held onto power in a disputed election in October that opposition parties say was rigged. The government says the vote was fair and free. Protests had dwindled in recent weeks but they resumed with greater force on Sunday when thousands of people gathered outside a shopping complex on the northern edge of Tbilisi and briefly blocked the road leading out of the city. Police presence at the rally was considerable. Earlier on Sunday, the Interior Ministry warned protesters in a statement that blocking the motorway was a criminal offense. One protester was seen by the side of the road, unconscious. Reuters was unable to establish what had happened to him. Unverified video footage posted on social media showed scores of police in balaclavas beating protesters on the streets and others carrying away injured demonstrators into ambulances.	https://www.voanews.com/a/georgian-police-arrest-opposition-leaders-at-pro-eu-protest/7960596.html	2025-02-02T18:45:07-08:00	
FBI staff ordered to reveal their roles in Jan. 6 Capitol riot probes by Monday	Washington — FBI employees were ordered Sunday to answer a detailed list of questions about any work they may have done on criminal cases related to the Jan. 6, 2021, attack on the U.S. Capitol by supporters of President Donald Trump, stoking fear among staff about a fresh round of firings at the law enforcement agency. 'I know myself and others receiving this questionnaire have a lot of questions and concerns, which I am working hard to get answers to,' Chad Yarbrough, the assistant director of the Criminal Investigative Division at FBI headquarters, wrote in a weekend email seen by Reuters. The list of questions in the memo, seen by Reuters, direct employees to give their job title, any role they played in the Jan. 6 investigations and whether they helped supervise such investigations. Yarbrough told employees the answers are due by 3 p.m. ET (2000 GMT) on Monday Acting Deputy Attorney General Emil Bove on Friday fired eight senior FBI officials from agency headquarters as well as the heads of the Miami and Washington, D.C., field offices. Another memo written by Bove on Friday also demanded that the FBI by Tuesday at noon ET (1700 GMT) turn over to him a list of every employee who worked on Jan. 6 cases, as well as a list of those who worked on a criminal case filed last year against leaders of the militant Hamas group in connection with the Gaza war. Bove last week fired more than a dozen career Justice Department prosecutors who worked on the two now-dismissed criminal cases brought by Special Counsel Jack Smith against Trump, one involving actions taken to try to overturn the 2020 election results and the other involving classified government documents. A FBI spokesperson declined to comment on the questionnaire. Democrats and other critics have said Trump's team is carrying out a purge of FBI and Justice Department officials who played roles in the criminal cases against Trump and the Jan. 6 rioters. On Trump's first day back in office on Jan. 20, he commuted the sentences of 14 people in connection with the Capitol attack and pardoned the rest — including those who violently attacked law enforcement officers. Acting FBI Director Brian Driscoll, in an email Friday to staff announcing details about the order from Bove, said the request 'encompasses thousands of employees across the country who have supported these investigative efforts.' 'I am one of those employees, as is acting Deputy Director [Robert] Kissane,' Driscoll noted. Despite reports about other firings throughout the bureau, emails seen by Reuters from both the FBI Agents Association and from James Dennehy, the assistant FBI director in charge of the New York office, made it clear that no one else had been asked to resign. Nevertheless, some employees started to clear out their desks Friday amid concerns they might be next, according to the FBI Agents Association email seen by Reuters. 'Today, we find ourselves in the middle of a battle of our own, as good people are being walked out of the FBI and others are being targeted because they did their jobs in accordance with the law and FBI policy,' Dennehy wrote Friday, saying he gave credit to Driscoll and Kissane for 'fighting for this organization.' Dennehy added that other than the select group of people named in Bove's memo, 'NO ONE has been told they are being removed at this time.'	https://www.voanews.com/a/fbi-staff-ordered-to-reveal-their-roles-in-jan-6-capitol-riot-probes-by-monday/7960564.html	2025-02-02T16:30:42-08:00	
Late President Jimmy Carter wins posthumous Grammy	Los Angeles — Former President Jimmy Carter has won a posthumous Grammy award. Carter, the peanut farmer who won the presidency in the wake of the Watergate scandal and Vietnam War, died in December at age 100. Prior to his passing, Carter was nominated in the audio book, narration, and storytelling recording category at the 2025 Grammys for 'Last Sundays in Plains: A Centennial Celebration,' recordings from his final Sunday School lessons delivered at Maranatha Baptist Church in Georgia. Musicians Darius Rucker, Lee Ann Rimes and Jon Batiste are featured on the record. It’s Carter's fourth Grammy. His posthumous Grammy joins his three previous ones for spoken word album. If the former president won before his death, he would've become the oldest Grammy award winner in history. Jason Carter, Jimmy Carter’s grandson, received the award on his behalf. 'Having his words captured in this way for my family and for the world is truly remarkable,' he said in an acceptance speech. 'Thank you to the academy.' In the category, Jimmy Carter beat out Barbra Streisand, George Clinton, Dolly Parton and producer Guy Oldfield. If Streisand had won instead of Carter, it would have been her first Grammy win in 38 years. Currently, the oldest person to win a Grammy was 97-year-old Pinetop Perkins in 2011.	https://www.voanews.com/a/late-president-jimmy-carter-wins-posthumous-grammy/7960556.html	2025-02-02T16:09:25-08:00	
Amid Los Angeles wildfires clean-up, residents furious over hazardous waste	Duarte, California — Not far from where Ceci Carroll lives, a rock-mining company has polluted the air with dust across the San Gabriel Valley, she said. Now, as crews clean charred remains from the Los Angeles wildfires, she worries about a new potential source of contamination: a site to process hazardous debris from the Eaton Fire. 'I’m concerned about the community and also the school districts here, where we have children,' said Carroll, a Duarte resident of 23 years and former local school board member. 'We’re dealing with the site with the chemicals and hazardous materials,' she said. 'Parents are absolutely concerned.' Carroll is among residents from Duarte, Azusa and nearby cities opposing the Environmental Protection Agency's use of Lario Park in Irwindale as a temporary site to separate, package and transport potentially hazardous materials from the Eaton Fire. In ordinary times, people picnic, bike or ride horses on equestrian trails in the federally owned land. They now worry about dangerous waste that could pollute the air or seep into groundwater. The blazes that began on Jan. 7 charred thousands of buildings, cars and electronics across the Los Angeles area. The EPA has begun the enormous task of removing potentially hundreds of tons of hazardous materials from the Eaton and Palisades fires. That includes paints, pesticides, solvents, compressed gas cylinders, ammunition and lithium-ion batteries from electric cars that could turn toxic when burned. 'The removal of these materials should not come at the cost of creating a toxic environment for communities already disproportionately impacted by pollution,' Los Angeles County Supervisor Hilda Solis said in a statement. The mostly Latino communities adjacent to the site are exposed to higher levels of ozone and particulate matter pollution than other areas, according to data from the California Office of Environmental Health Hazard Assessment. Experts acknowledge residents' concerns, but say hazardous waste is not necessarily harmful as long as safety measures are in place and the waste is not stored on site for years. Residents have questions about waste site At a town hall Wednesday, California Sen. Susan Rubio and local mayors opposing the site grilled state and federal officials: How was the site chosen? Why weren't we consulted or notified? Why truck toxic waste 24 kilometers from the burn zone and risk contaminating our communities? What testing will be done after it's closed? Hundreds of residents crammed into the performing arts center and spilled into the hall. They shouted 'Shut it down!' and chanted 'Leave it in Altadena!' EPA coordinator Tara Fitzgerald told the audience that sites closer to the Eaton burn zone were being used for emergency fire operations, including the Rose Bowl and the Santa Anita Park in Pasadena. They chose the Lario Park site because it suited their needs and was available. She emphasized that the EPA has done this work for years across the state. 'We did the exact same thing' for the Woolsey, Santa Rosa and Napa fires, Fitzgerald said, and 'we did not have any impacts to the community during the entire process.' But the Eaton and Palisades fires are unprecedented. Together, they torched the largest urban area on record in California, according to an Associated Press analysis, and more than double the urban acreage consumed by the 2018 Woolsey Fire. EPA says protective measures being taken The EPA said it would regularly monitor air, sample soil, use water trucks to control dust and transport waste out of the area daily. The agency lines areas with plastic where materials are processed and uses wattles, earthen berms and other items to control spills. The waste will be transported on surface streets, not freeways, so trucks can travel at a slower and safer speed, the EPA’s Celeste McCoy told the county Board of Supervisors. She said the site would likely be used less than six months, and more areas are being considered. With these protective measures, the risks of groundwater contamination, which takes a long time, are low, said Sanjay Mohanty, a UCLA associate professor who has studied wildfire effects on water and soil. 'There’s several feet of soil that the pollutant has to pass through, and that also requires lots of water to leech from the system,' Mohanty said. 'And even if there is leeching, they would not migrate far into the soil in a short time. ' The bigger risks are soil and air pollution from possible dust emissions, he added, but those too can be mitigated. Residents should stay vigilant Duarte resident Laura Jasso did not leave the meeting reassured and remained upset about the lack of transparency from state and federal officials. 'It’s hard to have confidence when they’ve really done this behind our backs,' she said. While crews continue their work, residents should be vigilant to what is happening at the site and ask how materials are being handled, about emergency response plans and truck routes and schedules, said Rachael Jones, professor and director of the UCLA Center for Occupational and Environmental Health. 'The community has the right to know that information from the EPA and the Army Corps,' Jones said. Jasso said her community is committed to holding the EPA accountable for ensuring safety. 'Ultimately, we don’t want it here, and we’re going to continue to fight to not have it here,' she said of the site. 'But the fact is, it’s here right now. And so, we have to just acknowledge the safety of our students, the concerns of our families.'	https://www.voanews.com/a/amid-los-angeles-wildfires-clean-up-residents-furious-over-hazardous-waste/7960319.html	2025-02-02T15:52:16-08:00	
Gerber recalls baby teething sticks over possible choking hazard	Arlington, Virginia — A baby food maker is recalling edible sticks meant to ease teething pain over a possible choking hazard. Gerber announced Friday that it was recalling and discontinuing its brand of 'Sooth N Chew' teething sticks after receiving customer complaints about choking. The company said one emergency room visit had been reported. The teething sticks are edible teethers marketed to parents and guardians of children six months and older. They come in strawberry-apple and banana flavors. Gerber said it was working with the U.S. Food and Drug Administration on the recall. Customers who bought the teething sticks should return them to stores where they were purchased for a refund, the company said. Anyone concerned about an injury or illness should contact a health care provider. For any additional support needed, Gerber is available 24/7 at 1-800-4-GERBER (1-800-443-7237). The company says it is working with the U.S. FDA on this recall and will cooperate with them fully.	https://www.voanews.com/a/gerber-recalls-baby-teething-sticks-over-possible-choking-hazard/7960318.html	2025-02-02T15:41:25-08:00	
Uganda set to begin Ebola vaccine trial after new outbreak kills nurse	Kampala, Uganda — Ugandan officials are preparing to deploy a trial vaccine as part of efforts to stem an outbreak of Ebola in the capital, Kampala, a top health official said Sunday. A range of scientists are developing research protocols relating to the planned deployment of more than 2,000 doses of a candidate vaccine against the Sudan strain of Ebola, said Pontiano Kaleebu, executive director of Uganda Virus Research Institute. 'Protocol is being accelerated' to get all the necessary regulatory approvals, he said. 'This vaccine is not yet licensed.' The World Health Organization said in a statement that its support to Uganda's response to the outbreak includes access to 2,160 doses of trial vaccine. 'Research teams have been deployed to the field to work along with the surveillance teams as approvals are awaited,' the WHO statement said. The candidate vaccine as well as candidate treatments are being made available through clinical trial protocols to further test for efficacy and safety, it said. The vaccine maker wasn't immediately known. There are no approved vaccines for the Sudan strain of Ebola that killed a nurse employed at Kampala's main referral hospital. The man died on Wednesday and authorities declared an outbreak the next day. Officials are still investigating the source of the outbreak, and there has been no other confirmed case. Uganda has had access to candidate vaccine doses since the end of an Ebola outbreak in September 2022 that killed at least 55 people. Ugandan officials ran out of time to begin a vaccine study when that outbreak, in central Uganda, was declared over about four months later, Kaleebu said. A trial vaccine known as rVSV-ZEBOV, used to vaccinate 3,000 people at risk of infection during an outbreak of the Zaire strain of Ebola in eastern Congo between 2018 and 2020, proved effective in containing the spread of the disease there. Uganda has had multiple Ebola outbreaks, including one in 2000 that killed hundreds. The 2014-16 Ebola outbreak in West Africa killed more than 11,000 people, the disease's largest death toll. Tracing contacts is also key to stemming the spread of Ebola, which manifests as a viral hemorrhagic fever. At least 44 contacts of the victim in the current outbreak have been identified, including 30 health workers and patients, according to Uganda's Ministry of Health. Confirmation of Ebola in Uganda is the latest in a series of outbreaks of viral hemorrhagic fevers in the east African region. Tanzania declared an outbreak of the Ebola-like Marburg disease earlier this month, while in December Rwanda announced that its own outbreak of Marburg was over. The ongoing Marburg outbreak in northern Tanzania's Kagera region has killed at least two people, according to local health authorities. Kampala's outbreak could prove difficult to respond to, because the city has a highly mobile population of about 4 million. The nurse who died had sought treatment at a hospital just outside Kampala and later traveled to Mbale, in the country's east, where he was admitted to a public hospital. Health authorities said the man also sought the services of a traditional healer. Ebola is spread by contact with bodily fluids of an infected person or contaminated materials. Symptoms include fever, vomiting, diarrhea, muscle pain and at times internal and external bleeding. Scientists don't know the natural reservoir of Ebola, but they suspect the first person infected in an outbreak acquired the virus through contact with an infected animal or eating its raw meat. Ebola was discovered in 1976 in two simultaneous outbreaks in South Sudan and Congo, where it occurred in a village near the Ebola River, after which the disease is named.	https://www.voanews.com/a/uganda-set-to-begin-ebola-vaccine-trial-after-new-outbreak-kills-nurse/7960315.html	2025-02-02T15:29:33-08:00	
New Orleans Super Bowl gets beefed up security measures	New Orleans, Louisiana — After a New Year's Day attack struck at the heart of the French Quarter, officials in New Orleans say they are confident in the security plans they have in place for the Super Bowl. Upwards of 125,000 visitors are expected to converge on the Big Easy beginning Feb. 5 for parties, concerts and revelry featuring artists including Post Malone and Diplo and capped off by the Feb. 9 clash between the Kansas City Chiefs and the Philadelphia Eagles at the Caesars Superdome stadium to crown this season's NFL champion. Following the truck-ramming attack early on Jan. 1 that killed 14 people and injured dozens more along Bourbon Street, one of the city's most famous thoroughfares, alleged security lapses triggered multiple lawsuits and investigations. But the city, the NFL and law enforcement officials insist that after more than a year of preparations they are ready to play host. 'We’re going above and beyond what we’ve seen in the past when we’ve hosted previously,' Mayor LaToya Cantrell said at a news conference. 'We know we’re safer than we’ve ever been before.' What will the security presence look like? Thousands of state, federal and local law enforcement officers will be on the ground during the Super Bowl, NFL Chief Security Officer Cathy Lanier said. But she and city officials remained tight-lipped about details. Drones will be prohibited around the Superdome and downtown New Orleans throughout the week of the game and there will be flight restrictions up to 18,000 feet (5,486 meters), according to the Federal Aviation Administration. Armed federal air marshals will be stationed around the city's transportation hubs scanning for suspicious people or activities and guarding against drones, said Noel Curtin, supervisory air marshal in charge with the Transportation Security Administration. Super Bowl events will sprawl across neighborhoods far beyond the stadium, said the Homeland Security Department's Eric DeLaune, who is leading federal coordination of Super Bowl security. Federal agencies from the FBI to the Secret Service are bringing in rooftop snipers and BearCat armored SWAT vehicles around the stadium and across the city's historic French Quarter and downtown, DeLaune said. No one will be allowed inside the cordoned-off area surrounding the Superdome without credentials, and the city already has begun shutting down and limiting traffic on roads near the stadium, where the perimeter will include blast barriers requiring trucks to pass through giant X-ray machines typically used at border crossings, DeLaune said. Dozens of technicians and more than 100 bomb-sniffing dogs are engaging in a days-long effort to scour the 37,161 square meters (400,000 square feet) of the Superdome and each of its more than 70,000 seats prior to game day, DeLaune said. 'They’re going to go from top to bottom on that building to make sure it’s clear and it’s safe. They open every door, check under every seat,' DeLaune said. How the New Year's Day attack has changed security plans Multiple lawsuits have claimed city authorities were aware of Bourbon Street's vulnerabilities to the kind of truck-ramming attack that the Islamic State group-inspired Shamsud-Din Jabbar carried out. He drove his F-150 around a police car parked as a makeshift barricade and plowed into pedestrians before he crashed and was killed by police. The bollard system of steel columns installed to block vehicle traffic, which was being replaced at the entrance to Bourbon Street at the time of the attack, remains on track for completion before the Super Bowl, officials said. Authorities say they have brought in more types of physical barriers to protect entry points resulting from concerns that the new bollard system was not strong enough to block vehicle attacks. The NFL and federal and city agencies have 'put a fresh set of eyes' on their plans post-Jan. 1, DeLaune said, noting the New Orleans Police Department hired former New York City Police Commissioner William Bratton and his team from high-profile security firm Teneo. 'No specific or credible threats' have surfaced targeting the Super Bowl, NFL security chief Lanier said Wednesday. Louisiana Gov. Jeff Landry announced the creation of an 'enhanced security zone' along Bourbon Street to bookend Super Bowl weekend and said he would deploy 350 national guardsmen. After authorities found Jabbar had planted ice chests containing undetonated improvised explosive devices around the French Quarter, Landry declared a ban on coolers and ice chests in these areas and ordered mandatory searches of bags for anyone entering Bourbon Street zone during the Super Bowl weekend. But in accordance with state law, firearms including permitless concealed carry guns will be allowed on Bourbon Street, Louisiana State Police Sgt. Katharine Stegall said, noting they remained banned from bars. AI and mobile apps will play security role The Superdome’s owner, ASM Global, has contracted New York-based artificial intelligence firm Dataminr to monitor potential and emerging threats in real time. The company will draw from over 1 million sources of public data across 150 languages, from social media to dark web forums to traffic cameras, Dataminr Chief Security Officer Robert Crowley said. 'It’s stitching together all these little pieces of the puzzle to get a holistic, comprehensive view of what has just happened,' Crowley said. 'The faster you know what is occurring, the quicker you can take better action.'	https://www.voanews.com/a/new-orleans-super-bowl-gets-beefed-up-security-measures/7960311.html	2025-02-02T15:19:23-08:00

55 of 67 victims of air disaster near Washington recovered and identified, officials say	Authorities said Sunday they have recovered the remains of 55 of the 67 people killed in the deadliest U.S. air disaster since 2001. Washington, DC Fire and EMS Chief John Donnelly said at a news conference that divers still need to find the bodies of 12 more victims and are committed to the dignified recovery of remains as they prepare to lift wreckage from the Potomac River as early as Monday morning. 'Reuniting those lost in this tragic incident is really what keeps us all going,' said Colonel Francis B. Pera of the Army Corps of Engineers. Portions of the aircraft will be loaded onto flatbed trucks and taken to a hangar for further investigation. They spoke hours after families of the victims visited the crash site just outside Washington, DC, walking along the banks of the Potomac River near Reagan National Airport to memorialize their loved ones. Dozens of people arrived in buses with a police escort close to where an American Airlines jet and an Army Black Hawk helicopter collided Wednesday, killing all 67 aboard the two aircraft. Federal investigators were working to piece together the events that led to the crash while recovery crews were set to pull more wreckage from the chilly water. Transportation Secretary Sean Duffy on Sunday said he wanted to leave federal aviation investigators space to conduct their inquiry. But he posed a range of questions about the crash while appearing on morning TV news programs. 'What was happening inside the towers? Were they understaffed? … The position of the Black Hawk, the elevation of the Black Hawk, were the pilots of the Black Hawk wearing night vision goggles?' Duffy asked on CNN. The American Airlines flight with 64 people on board was preparing to land from Wichita, Kansas. The Army Black Hawk helicopter was on a training mission and had three soldiers on board. Both aircraft plunged into the Potomac River after colliding. The plane’s passengers included figure skaters returning from the 2025 U.S. Figure Skating Championships in Wichita, Kansas, and a group of hunters returning from a guided trip. Army Staff Sgt. Ryan Austin O’Hara, 28, of Lilburn, Georgia; Chief Warrant Officer 2 Andrew Loyd Eaves, 39, of Great Mills, Maryland; and Cpt. Rebecca M. Lobach, of Durham, North Carolina, were killed in the helicopter. The National Transportation Safety Board said Saturday that preliminary data showed conflicting readings about the altitudes of the airliner and the Army helicopter. Investigators also said that about a second before impact, the jet’s flight recorder showed a change in its pitch. But they did not say whether that change in angle meant that pilots were trying to perform an evasive maneuver to avoid the crash. Data from the jet’s flight recorder showed its altitude as 99 meters, plus or minus 7.6 meters, when the crash happened Wednesday night, NTSB officials told reporters. Data in the control tower, though, showed the Black Hawk 61 meters, the maximum allowed altitude for helicopters in the area. The discrepancy has yet to be explained. Investigators said they hoped to reconcile the difference with data from the helicopter’s black box, which is taking more time to retrieve because it became waterlogged after the Black Hawk plunged into the Potomac. They also said they plan to refine the tower data, which can be less reliable. 'That’s what our job is, to figure that out,' NTSB member Todd Inman said. 'This is a complex investigation,' investigator in charge Brice Banning said. 'There are a lot of pieces here. Our team is working hard to gather this data.' Banning said the jet’s cockpit voice recorder captured sound moments before the crash. 'The crew had a verbal reaction,' Banning said, and the flight data recorder showed 'the airplane beginning to increase its pitch. Sounds of impact were audible about one second later, followed by the end of the recording.' Full NTSB investigations typically take at least a year, though investigators hope to have a preliminary report within 30 days. Inman said he has spent hours meeting with victims’ families since the crash. The families are struggling, Inman said. 'Some wanted to give us hugs. Some are just mad and angry,' Inman said. 'They are just all hurt. And they still want answers, and we want to give them answers.' More than 300 responders were taking part in the recovery effort at a given time, officials said. Two Navy salvage barges were also deployed to lift heavy wreckage. On Fox News Sunday, Duffy said the Federal Aviation Administration was looking into staffing in the Reagan Airport control tower. Investigators said there were five controllers on duty at the time of the crash: a local controller, ground controller, assistant controller, a supervisor and supervisor in training. According to an FAA report obtained by The Associated Press, one controller was responsible for helicopter and plane traffic. Those duties are often divided between two people but the airport typically combines them at 9:30 p.m., once traffic slows down. On Wednesday, the tower supervisor combined them earlier, which the report called 'not normal.' 'Staffing shortages for air traffic control has been a major problem for years and years,' Duffy said, promising that President Donald Trump’s administration would address shortages with 'bright, smart, brilliant people in towers controlling airspace.' With the nation already grieving, an air ambulance crashed in Philadelphia on Friday, killing all six people on board, including a child returning home to Mexico from treatment, and at least one person on the ground. Also Friday, the FAA heavily restricted helicopter traffic around Reagan National, hours after Trump claimed on social media that the Army helicopter had been flying higher than allowed. 'It was far above the 200-foot limit. That’s not really too complicated to understand, is it???' Trump wrote on Truth Social. Wednesday’s crash was the deadliest in the U.S. since Nov. 12, 2001, when a jet slammed into a residential neighborhood in the New York City borough of Queens, just after takeoff from Kennedy Airport. The crash killed all 260 people on board and five people on the ground. Experts regularly highlight that plane travel is overwhelmingly safe, but the crowded airspace around Reagan National can challenge even the most experienced pilots.	https://www.voanews.com/a/of-67-victims-of-air-disaster-near-washington-recovered-and-identified-officials-say/7960299.html	2025-02-02T14:28:04-08:00	
DR Congo: Near Goma, displaced people begin long journey home	GOMA, DRC — Once crowded with white makeshift huts, the huge Kanyaruchinya camp for displaced people on the outskirts of Goma, in the war-torn Democratic Republic of Congo, looked eerily empty Sunday. Since Goma was taken by M23 fighters earlier this week, some 100,000 internally displaced people have left the jam-packed hillside where they had set up several years ago. The ongoing crisis in the eastern DRC continues to escalate, with tensions involving the Congolese government, and the M23 rebel group. The DRC government has officially designated the M23 rebel group as a terrorist organization, while the U.N. and the U.S. classify it as an armed rebel group. The DRC government has repeatedly accused Rwanda of supporting the M23 rebel group, a claim that Rwanda denies. Kigali, in turn, alleges that Kinshasa collaborates with the Democratic Forces for the Liberation of Rwanda (FDLR), a Hutu armed group with ties to the perpetrators of the 1994 Rwandan genocide, an allegation the DRC rejects. Military operations in the region remain fluid, with clashes leading to significant displacement and humanitarian concerns. The M23 offensive in the mineral-rich eastern DRC is the latest to scar a region that has seen relentless conflict involving dozens of armed groups kill an estimated 6 million people over three decades. 'Life in the camp is a life of suffering and hunger,' said Christine Bwiza, one of the last people to leave camp Kanyaruchinya, which sits near the Rwandan border. There, residents had cobbled together makeshift huts from sticks and tarpaulin. Hunger was rampant and poor hygiene regularly caused cholera outbreaks. Many had mixed feelings about finally going home. Some said they were relieved, others stressed they had no choice. All worried about their future. On the side of the road, a convoy of overcrowded trucks picked up some of the last contingents of travelers. 'I was a displaced person who came with nothing. And today I'm going home just as I came,' said Denise Zaninga, seated at the back of a vehicle, adding that she had no idea where she was headed. 'I am leaving but I don't know where I'm going to live,' she said. Others shared her anxiety. 'Our homes are destroyed, our children are lost because of the war, and we are returning home hungry,' said Bwiza. For Aline Irafasha, 'hunger will kill us wherever we go, but it's better to suffer at home.' The driver of the truck they had boarded said the M23 had paid for the vehicle and financed the trip. Since M23 fighters and Rwandan troops have taken control of the city, the nearby front line has disappeared. Surrounding territories are now accessible by road, bordered by abandoned military posts and charred armored vehicles. Under pressure The M23 has vowed to send displaced people back to where they came from, and their violent takeover of Goma meant people in the camp had little choice but to leave. The overall population in Goma, a city of 1 million people, has nearly doubled in the past 30 years, swollen by victims fleeing violence. At the camp, now a deserted, littered field, some said they had been pressured into leaving, but most preferred to go home before being forced to. This sudden exodus sits well with locals whose farmlands were invaded and occupied for years. 'Here we used to have fields,' said Elizabeth Base Sembimbi, pointing to a plot of land in ruins in front of her plank house. 'But we had to stop harvesting because of the robberies,' she said, adding that she was looking forward to farming again. On the side of the road, armed men, apparently from the Rwandan army, patrolled the street on foot. One resident said that at nightfall, armed men had broken into people's homes looking for weapons and forcing young people to carry food and water over long distances without paying them. 'People are starting to feel scared,' he said. 'We can't say anything, we keep our mouths shut and observe.'	https://www.voanews.com/a/dr-congo-near-goma-displaced-people-begin-long-journey-home/7960287.html	2025-02-02T14:03:29-08:00	
Italian who saved children from WWII massacre dies aged 96	Rome — Milena Bernabo, awarded one of Italy's top civilian honors for saving three children from the Nazis during World War II, died Sunday aged 96, local authorities said. Bernabo was awarded the gold medal for civil merit for saving her young neighbors during the August 1944 massacre of Sant'Anna di Stazzema, in Tuscany, in which 560 people died. Then aged 16, Bernabo had been led together with fellow villagers into an outhouse and targeted by German machine gun fire. Bernabo was wounded, according to the citation. But she managed to escape with Mario, five, and 10-year-olds Mauro and Lina, from the building as it was set on fire. The trio she saved were present to see Bernabo receive the valor award at a ceremony in the central city of Lucca in 2005. Officials at the time hailed her bravery as an example of many Italians' 'silent resistance' to Nazi occupation during the latter part of World War II. 'Throughout her life she was an ambassador of peace, reminding the young people she encountered of the Nazi-Fascist massacre of Sant’Anna di Stazzema,' the office of the mayor of Stazzema, Maurizio Verona, told AFP in an emai 'Milena remembered with the hope that those who listened would understand that Fascism and Nazism were absolute evils of the last century and that the institutions and their representatives would work to build a better future.' Two other women from Sant'Anna were awarded the same honor -- Cesira Pardini, who died in 2022, and Genny Bibolotti Marsili, who died the day of the massacre. They were all 'heroines,' Mayor Verona told the ANSA news agency, hailing Bernabo's strength and determination to keep the memory of what happened alive.	https://www.voanews.com/a/italian-who-saved-children-from-wwii-massacre-dies-aged-96/7960281.html	2025-02-02T13:27:46-08:00	
USAID security leaders on leave after trying to keep Musk's inspectors from classified info	Washington — The Trump administration has placed two top security chiefs at the U.S. Agency for International Development on leave after they refused to turn over classified material in restricted areas to Elon Musk's government-inspection teams, a current and a former U.S. official told The Associated Press on Sunday. Members of Musk's Department of Government Efficiency, known as DOGE, eventually did gain access Saturday to the aid agency's classified information, which includes intelligence reports, the former official said. Musk's DOGE crew lacked high-enough security clearance to access that information, so the two USAID security officials — John Vorhees and deputy Brian McGill — were legally obligated to deny access. The current and former U.S. officials had knowledge of the incident and spoke on condition of anonymity because they were not authorized to share the information. Musk on Sunday responded to a post about the news on X by saying, 'USAID is a criminal organization. Time for it to die.' The White House did not immediately respond to a request for comment. It comes a day after DOGE carried out a similar operation at the Treasury Department, gaining access to sensitive information including the Social Security and Medicare customer payment systems. Musk formed DOGE in cooperation with the new Trump administration with the stated goal of finding ways to fire federal workers, cut programs and slash federal regulations. USAID, whose website vanished Saturday without explanation, has been one of the federal agencies most targeted by the Trump administration in an escalating crackdown on the federal government and many of its programs. The Trump administration and Secretary of State Marco Rubio have imposed an unprecedented freeze on foreign assistance that has shut down much of USAID's humanitarian, development and security programs worldwide — compelling thousands of layoffs by aid organizations — and ordered furloughs and leaves that have gutted the agency's leadership and staff in Washington. The U.S. is by far the world's largest donor of humanitarian aid, with USAID administering billions of dollars in humanitarian, development and security assistance in more than 100 countries. Peter Marocco, a returning political appointee from Trump's first term, was a leader in enforcing the shutdown. USAID staffers say they believe that agency outsiders with visitors badges asking questions of employees inside Washington headquarters are members of Musk's DOGE team.	https://www.voanews.com/a/usaid-security-leaders-on-leave-after-trying-to-keep-musk-s-inspectors-from-classified-info/7960260.html	2025-02-02T12:33:36-08:00

Dog Man' bites off $36 million, taking No. 1 at box office	New York — DreamWorks Animation's 'Dog Man' fetched $36 million in ticket sales at the weekend box office, according to studio estimates Sunday, making it the biggest debut yet in 2025. It was a big opening for the Universal Pictures release adapted from the popular graphic novel series by author Dav Pilkey. The big-screen launch for the cartoon canine was produced for a modest $40 million, meaning it will easily coast through a profitable run. Audiences gave it an 'A' CinemaScore. Only one animated film before has had a better January launch: 2016’s 'Kung Fu Panda 3.' 'Dog Man,' though, was soft overseas, collecting $4.2 million from 29 international markets. The voice cast of the Peter Hastings-directed movie is led by Pete Davidson, Lil Rel Howery and Isla Fisher. Family movies last year buoyed the box office, with PG-rated films accounting for $2.9 billion, or 33% of all ticket revenue, according to data firm Comscore. So far, they’re lifting 2025, too. The Walt Disney Co.’s December release 'Mufasa: The Lion King' topped the weekend box office three times in January. In its seventh week of release, 'Mufasa' held in third place with another $6.1 million, bringing its global tally to $653 million. 'The PG animation family film wave that was so prevalent in ’24 continues in ’25,' said Paul Dergarabedian, senior media analyst for Comscore. The horror comedy 'Companion,' from Warner Bros. and New Line, also opened well, with $9.5 million in 3,285 locations. Drew Hancock’s sci-fi tinged film set in the near future is about a group of friends on a weekend lakeside getaway. 'Companion,' starring Sophie Thatcher ('Heretic'), was lightly marketed and made for just $10 million. It will depend on glowing reviews (94% fresh on Rotten Tomatoes) and strong word of mouth (a 'B+' CinemaScore) to keep drawing moviegoers in the coming weeks. Last week’s top film, Mel Gibson’s 'Flight Risk,' dropped steeply in its second weekend. The action thriller starring Mark Wahlberg fell to fifth place with $5.6 million. Domestically, it has collected $20.9 million for Lionsgate. One of the early year’s standout successes has been Sony Pictures’ 'One of Them Days,' the R-rated comedy starring Keke Palmer and SZA. Though comedies have had a hard time in theaters in recent years, 'One of Them Days' has proven the exception. The well-reviewed movie earned $5.6 million over the weekend, bringing its three-week total to $34.5 million – a stellar result for a movie that cost $14 million to make. Final domestic figures will be released Monday. Estimated ticket sales for Friday through Sunday at U.S. and Canadian theaters, according to Comscore: 1. 'Dog Man,' $36 million. 2. 'Companion,' $9.5 million. 3. 'Mufasa,' $6.1 million. 4. 'One of Them Days,' $6 million. 5. 'Flight Risk' $5.6 million. 6. 'Sonic the Hedgehog 3,' $3.2 million. 7. 'Moana 2,' $2.8 million. 8. 'A Complete Unknown,' $2.2 million. 9. 'The Brutalist,' $1.9 million. 10. 'Den of Thieves: Pantera,' $1.6 million.	https://www.voanews.com/a/dog-man-bites-off-36-million-taking-no-1-at-box-office/7960236.html	2025-02-02T11:38:58-08:00	
Mayor says 5 injured in fatal Philadelphia plane crash remain hospitalized, 3 in critical condition	PHILADELPHIA — Three people injured on the ground when a jet crashed in a busy Philadelphia neighborhood, killing seven people, remain in critical condition, Mayor Cherelle Parker said Sunday. Parker said 22 people were injured and five of them remain hospitalized. At least 11 homes were significantly damaged, along with some businesses. 'Our city continues to mourn their loss and they are in our thoughts are prayers,' Parker said of the deceased victims. A Mexico-bound air ambulance plummeted to the ground Friday evening, less than a minute after it had taken off from Northeast Philadelphia Airport with six people on board, including a girl who had spent months being treated at a city hospital. One of the deceased was killed inside a car as debris from the Learjet 55 crash exploded into the neighborhood, damaging nearby homes.	https://www.voanews.com/a/mayor-says-5-injured-in-fatal-philadelphia-plane-crash-remain-hospitalized-3-in-critical-condition-/7960226.html	2025-02-02T11:04:53-08:00	
Trump: Americans could face ‘pain’ with new tariffs on key trading partners	U.S. President Donald Trump said Sunday that Americans may face economic 'pain' because of new tariffs he is imposing on the country’s three biggest trading partners —Canada, China and Mexico — but contended that it would be 'worth the price' to bolster U.S. interests. Despite sharing a free-trade pact he negotiated with Canada and Mexico in his first term in office, Trump on Saturday imposed 25% tariffs on the two countries set to take effect Tuesday, and hit China with a new 10% levy in addition to already enacted tariffs. Trump claimed the three countries were not doing enough to halt illegal immigration and the deadly opioid fentanyl from entering the United States. In Truth Social posts early Sunday, Trump acknowledged American consumers could face higher prices because of the tariffs. U.S. companies that pay the tariffs to the federal government to import goods from other countries then often pass on at least part, if not all, of their higher costs to consumers rather than absorb their extra expenses themselves. But Trump aimed most of his comments at Canada, targeting one of the U.S.’s closest allies. The U.S. Census Bureau said the U.S. had a $55 billion trade deficit with Canada last year. 'Why? There is no reason,' Trump contended. 'We don’t need anything they have. We have unlimited Energy, should make our own Cars, and have more Lumber than we can ever use.' 'Without this massive subsidy, Canada ceases to exist as a viable Country. Harsh but true! Therefore, Canada should become our Cherished 51st State. Much lower taxes, and far better military protection for the people of Canada — AND NO TARIFFS!' Trump said.	https://www.voanews.com/a/trump-americans-could-face-pain-with-new-tariffs-on-key-trading-partners-/7960219.html	2025-02-02T10:48:55-08:00	
Protests against Germany’s Merz who supports migration proposal backed by far-right	Berlin — Tens of thousands took to the streets across Germany during the weekend to protest the center-right leader and front-runner in a Feb. 25 election for sending to parliament proposals for tough new migration rules that received the backing of a far-right party. Angry protesters in Hamburg, Munich, Cologne and Leipzig said that Friedrich Merz and his Christian Democrats broke Germany's unwritten post-Nazi promise by all democratic parties to never pass any rule or resolution in parliament with the support of far-right, nationalist parties such as the Alternative for Germany (AfD). Merz on Wednesday proposed a nonbinding motion in parliament calling for Germany to turn back many more migrants at its borders. The measure squeaked through thanks to AfD's support. Merz was determined to show commitment of his center-right Union bloc, which also includes the Bavaria-only CSU party, to cutting irregular migration after a deadly knife attack last month by a rejected asylum-seeker. However, on Friday, the German parliament narrowly rejected a bill calling for tougher rules on migration that risked becoming the first draft legislation to pass thanks to a far-right party. Nonetheless, it has become a focus of a controversy about the attitude toward the far right of the front-runner in the upcoming election. Merz has been accused by protesters and politicians on the left of breaking a taboo and endangering mainstream parties’ 'firewall' against AfD. He insists his position is unchanged and that he didn’t and won’t work with the party. Hundreds of protesters temporarily blocked offices of the Christian Democrats in different cities, and Sunday afternoon up to 20,000 came together for a big rally in Berlin. In Cologne, people protested on 350 boats on the Rhine, German news agency dpa reported. The boats lined up in front of the city's skyline with its famous cathedral with protesters holding up banners with slogans such as 'No racism' and 'For democracy and diversity.' Polls show the center-right Union, which put forward the migration proposal and bill, leading with around 30% support, while AfD is second with about 20%, and the Social Democrats and Greens further down. Merz appears to hope that he will gain support by making the Union look decisive in forcing a tougher approach to migration, while blunting the appeal of the anti-immigration AfD and making the governing parties — which say they already have done much to tackle the issue — look out of touch with Germans’ concerns. The 12-year-old AfD first entered the national parliament in 2017, benefiting from then-Chancellor Angela Merkel’s decision two years earlier to allow large numbers of migrants into the country. A year ago, hundreds of thousands also protested in weeks-long rallies all over Germany against the rise of the far-right and purported plans to deport millions of immigrants, including some holding German passports.	https://www.voanews.com/a/protests-against-germany-s-merz-who-supports-migration-proposal-backed-by-far-right/7960206.html	2025-02-02T10:29:41-08:00	
Multiple tremors near Greek island of Santorini shut schools and put residents on edge	ATHENS — A series of earthquakes near the Greek island of Santorini has led authorities to shut down schools, dispatch rescue teams with sniffer dogs and send instructions to residents including a request to drain their swimming pools. Even though earthquake experts say the more than 200 tremors that have hit the area since early Friday are not related to the volcano in Santorini, which once produced one of the biggest eruptions in human history, locals are on edge. The strongest earthquake recorded was magnitude 4.6 at 3:55 p.m. Sunday, at a depth of 14 kilometers, the Athens Geodynamic Institute said. A few tremors of over magnitude 4 and dozens of magnitude 3 have followed. There were no reports of damage or casualties. Earthquake experts and officials from the Ministry of Climate Crisis and Civil Protection and the fire service have been meeting daily and decided to close schools Monday on the island of Santorini as well as nearby Amorgos, Anafi and Ios. After Sunday's meeting, they also advised residents and hotel owners in Santorini to drain their swimming pools over concerns that large volumes of water could destabilize buildings in case of a strong quake. Another meeting was scheduled Sunday evening at the prime minister’s office with the chief of Greece’s armed forces and other officials. The fire service sent a contingent of rescuers including a sniffer dog on Saturday, and dispatched more forces Sunday, as a precaution. The rescuers have pitched tents in open fields. Island residents have been advised to avoid large open-air events and to move about the islands mindful of rockfalls. All four islands have steep cliffs and, in the case of Santorini, a large part of the main town is built on a cliffside. Experts said it was impossible to predict whether the seismic activity could lead to a stronger tremor, but added that the area could potentially produce a 6-magnitude quake. Mild earthquakes have also been recorded in Santorini’s volcano caldera, which is mostly undersea, since September. The strongest one with magnitude 3.8 occurred on Jan. 25. Since then, seismic activity inside the volcano has subsided, experts say. The Santorini volcano eruption at about 1600 B.C. devastated the island, buried a town, and caused massive earthquakes and flooding that impacted the island of Crete and as far as Egypt. Experts estimate that up to 41.3 cubic kilometers of rocks were ejected and 9-meter tsunamis hit Crete. In the 1990s, the Santorini volcano was designated one of 16 volcanoes around the world that need to be monitored because of past massive eruptions and proximity to dense population areas.	https://www.voanews.com/a/multiple-tremors-near-greek-island-of-santorini-shut-schools-and-put-residents-on-edge-/7960137.html	2025-02-02T09:02:30-08:00	
Japan launches navigation satellite on new flagship rocket	TOKYO — Japan's space agency said Sunday it successfully launched a navigation satellite on its new flagship H3 rocket as the country seeks to have a more precise location positioning system of its own. The H3 rocket carrying the Michibiki 6 satellite lifted off from the Tanegashima Space Center on a southwestern Japanese island. Everything went smoothly and the satellite successfully separated from the rocket as planned about 29 minutes after the liftoff, said Makoto Arita, H3 project manager for the Japan Aerospace Exploration Agency, or JAXA. Officials said it is expected to reach its targeted geospatial orbit in about two weeks. Japan currently has the quasi-zenith satellite system, or QZSS, with four satellites for a regional navigation system that first went into operation in 2018. The Michibiki 6 will be the fifth of its network. Michibiki’s signals are used to supplement American GPS and will further improve positioning data for smartphones, car and maritime navigation and drones. Japan plans to launch two more navigation satellites to have a seven-satellite system by March 2026 to have a more precise global positioning capability without relying on foreign services, including the U.S., according to the Japan Science and Technology Agency. By the late 2030s, Japan plans to have an 11-satellite network. Sunday's launch, delayed by a day due to the weather, was the fourth consecutive successful flight for the H3 system after a shocking failed debut attempt last year when the rocket had to be destroyed with its payload. Japan sees a stable, commercially competitive space transport capability as key to its space program and national security and has been developing two new flagship rockets as successors to the mainstay H2A series — the larger H3 and a much smaller Epsilon system. It hopes to cater to diverse customer needs and improve its position in the growing satellite launch market.	https://www.voanews.com/a/japan-launches-navigation-satellite-on-new-flagship-rocket-/7960090.html	2025-02-02T08:25:29-08:00	
UK's Starmer, Germany’s Scholz meet as EU 'reset' looms	British Prime Minister Keir Starmer welcomed German Chancellor Olaf Scholz to his country estate Sunday on the eve of seeking to improve relations with the European Union. Starmer hosted Scholz at Chequers, the prime minister's country residence in Buckinghamshire 30 miles (50 kilometers) northwest of London, before the two go to Belgium to meet with EU chiefs Monday, where the U.K. leader is aiming for a relationship 'reset.' While ruling out rejoining the EU trade bloc five years after Brexit, Starmer said he wants to forge a closer relationship on defense, energy and trade. 'I think that is certainly in the U.K.’s best interest, I do believe it’s in the EU’s best interest, and already I hope that in the last seven months there’s been a manifest difference in approach, tone and relationship,' he said. Starmer and Scholz discussed Ukraine and the Middle East, according to a Starmer spokesperson. The prime minister spoke of their common approach to 'key issues and challenges,' including their shared commitment to Kyiv as the war with Russia enters its fourth year this month. 'When I started as prime minister seven months ago now, I was determined to strengthen the relationship between our two countries — already very good, but I thought it could be stronger on a number of fronts,' said Starmer, leader of the center-left Labour Party. 'And thanks to your leadership, I think we’ve made real progress.' Scholz said the visit that included a walk around the grounds of the estate and a lunch was a 'good sign of the very good relations between our two countries, and indeed between the two of us.' Scholz is up for reelection Feb. 23, where his center-left Social Democrats are lagging in the polls behind the center-right Christian Democratic Union and the far-right Alternative for Germany, or AfD.	https://www.voanews.com/a/uk-s-starmer-germany-s-scholz-meet-as-eu-reset-looms/7960082.html	2025-02-02T08:05:54-08:00	
Trump, Netanyahu to discuss war in Gaza, along with Iran, Arab relations	Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said Sunday he will discuss his country’s self-declared 'victory over Hamas,' countering Iranian aggression and expanding diplomatic relations with Arab countries as he meets this week with U.S. President Donald Trump at the White House. Trump Tuesday is set to greet Netanyahu, the first foreign head of state he is meeting with since taking office for a second four-year term two weeks ago. Trump has been a long-time ally of Netanyahu and dispatched his Middle East envoy, Steve Witkoff, to help broker the current six-week ceasefire in Israel’s war against Hamas and hostage-for-prisoner exchange. But even as the militants have freed 18 hostages in exchange for hundreds of Palestinian prisoners held by Israel, difficult negotiations lie ahead on the second phase of the truce. Hamas, a U.S. designated terror group, has quickly reasserted its control over Gaza since the ceasefire took hold last month, despite Israel saying it would not allow that to occur. The militants have said they will not release more hostages slated to go free in the second phase of the truce without an end to the war and the full withdrawal of Israeli forces from the narrow territory along the shores of the Mediterranean Sea. Netanyahu is under mounting pressure from far-right governing partners to resume the war after the first phase of the truce ends in early March. It's not clear where Trump stands. Trump has been a staunch supporter of Israel but also pledged to end wars in the Middle East and took credit for helping to broker the ceasefire agreement. Netanyahu has said Israel is still committed to a full victory over Hamas and the return of all the hostages captured in the militants' shock October 7, 2023, attack that killed 1,200 people and led to the capture of 250 hostages. Several dozen remain in Hamas hands, both living and dead. Israel’s counteroffensive during 15 months of warfare has killed more than 47,000 Palestinians, more than half of them women and children. Israel’s military says the death toll includes 17,000 militants it has killed. Even with the ceasefire, periodic attacks are still occurring. An Israeli airstrike on a vehicle in central Gaza wounded five people on Sunday, including a child who was in critical condition, according to Al-Awda Hospital, which received the casualties. The Israeli military said it fired upon the vehicle because it was bypassing a checkpoint while heading north in violation of the ceasefire agreement. The military said it remains committed to the deal. In a statement released ahead of his departure for Washington on Sunday, Netanyahu said he and Trump would discuss 'victory over Hamas, achieving the release of all our hostages and dealing with the Iranian terror axis in all its components,' referring to Iran's alliance of militant groups across the region, including Hamas. He said that by working together, the U.S. and Israel could 'strengthen security, broaden the circle of peace and achieve a remarkable era of peace through strength.' Under the first phase of the ceasefire, Hamas is to release a total of 33 hostages, eight of whom Hamas says are dead, in exchange for nearly 2,000 Palestinian prisoners. Israeli forces have pulled back from most areas and allowed hundreds of thousands of Palestinians to return to devastated northern Gaza. Negotiations on the second phase, in which the war would end and the remaining 60 or so hostages would be returned, are set to begin Monday. If the United States, Qatar and Egypt are unable to broker an agreement between Israel and Hamas, the war could resume in early March. Witkoff, Trump's Middle East envoy, joined the yearlong ceasefire negotiations in their final weeks last month and helped push the agreement over the finish line. He met with Netanyahu in Israel last week and the two were expected to formally begin talks on the second phase in Washington on Monday. Trump brokered normalization agreements between Israel and four Arab countries in his first term. He now is seeking a wider agreement in which Israel would forge ties with Saudi Arabia. But Riyadh has said it would only agree to such a deal if the war in Gaza ends and there is a credible pathway to a Palestinian state in Gaza, the West Bank and east Jerusalem, territories Israel captured in the 1967 Middle East war. The U.S. supports Palestinian statehood, but Netanyahu's government is opposed. Even as the Gaza ceasefire has mostly held for two weeks, Israel has ramped up operations in the occupied West Bank. On Sunday, the military said it was expanding an operation focused on the volatile city of Jenin to the town of Tamun. The Palestinian health ministry said a 73-year-old man was shot dead by Israeli troops in Jenin early Sunday. There was no immediate comment from the military. The ministry had earlier reported five killed, including a 16-year-old, in Israeli airstrikes overnight. The military said it killed two militants — one of whom had been freed as part of the weeklong Gaza ceasefire in November 2023 — in an airstrike on a village near Jenin. It said the two were planning an imminent attack, and that additional strikes targeted two other militant cells. The West Bank has seen a surge in violence since the start of the war in Gaza, with Israel launching near-daily military arrest raids. There has also been a rise in settler violence against Palestinians and Palestinian attacks on Israelis. Some material in this report came from The Associated Press.	https://www.voanews.com/a/trump-netanyahu-to-discuss-war-in-gaza-along-with-iran-arab-relations-/7960068.html	2025-02-02T07:58:31-08:00	
Trump tariff met with mixed reactions from China	Taipei, Taiwan — U.S. President Donald Trump’s decision to impose 10% tariffs on Chinese goods has been met with mixed reactions from Beijing, with the Chinese government threatening to roll out countermeasures and some Chinese businesses expressing concerns about potential disruption to their exports to the U.S. market. While the Chinese Ministry of Commerce vowed to challenge the Trump administration’s move at the World Trade Organization, the Chinese foreign ministry emphasized that the trade and tariff wars 'cannot solve the U.S. problems at home and more importantly, does not benefit either side.' Trump previously said the additional tariffs on Chinese goods were Washington’s response to China’s role in manufacturing precursor chemicals essential to fentanyl production in Mexico. 'Additional tariffs are not constructive and bound to affect and harm the counternarcotics cooperation between the two sides in the future,' a Chinese foreign ministry spokesperson said in a statement released Sunday afternoon. Meanwhile, on the Chinese social media platform Weibo, some internet users said the Trump administration’s move would only backfire and harm American consumers’ interests while others said Washington’s response 'lacks creativity.' 'In the end, he only dares to add 10% tariffs [on Chinese goods] while imposing an additional 25% tariffs on goods from other countries,' wrote Chinese internet user 'Jixiang Wang-bao' on Weibo. Compared to the defiance expressed by some Chinese internet users, some Chinese exporters say they think the additional tariffs would still harm their businesses. 'The additional tariffs will essentially force my company to give up the U.S. market and shift the focus to other countries,' a Chinese consumer electronics exporter surnamed Lin, who asked to only be identified by his last name due to the sensitivity of the issue, told VOA in a written response. Hu Xijin, the former editor-in-chief of China’s state-run tabloid Global Times, said that while Chinese companies focusing on exporting to the U.S. would experience varying degrees of challenges, the Chinese economy is capable of dealing with the impact of these additional tariffs. 'All parties in China have long anticipated this round of tariff hikes imposed by Trump and relevant businesses in China have made a lot of preparations,' he wrote in a post on Weibo, adding that the Trump administration’s tariff war against China would ultimately harm American consumers and suppliers. Leave room for negotiations While there are differing views about how the additional tariffs might affect the Chinese economy, analysts say the Trump administration’s decision to start with a 10% tariff against Chinese goods shows Washington’s willingness to negotiate with Beijing. 'The Trump administration may use the 10% tariff as a way to push Beijing to reach deals on some issues that are important to the U.S., such as the fentanyl crisis, and show the Chinese government that it could further increase the tariffs to 60% if China is unwilling to engage in negotiation,' said Wu Se-chih, an expert on Chinese politics at Taipei University of Marine Technology. Since the Chinese economy remains sluggish, Wu said Beijing is trying to respond to the additional tariffs imposed by the Trump administration with less confrontational measures such as filing a claim with the WTO. 'China is hoping to show Washington that it is willing to come to the negotiating table and use negotiations to prevent the Trump administration from further enhancing the tariffs on Chinese goods,' he told VOA by phone. Other experts say that the lower tariffs that the Trump administration has imposed on China, compared to the 25% tariffs on goods from Mexico and Canada, suggest Beijing may have already begun negotiations with Washington. 'China could announce a massive order of Boeing or China could announce a massive increase in imports of shale gas, which could be very useful for Trump,' Alicia Garcia-Herrero, chief economist for Asia Pacific at French investment bank Natixis, told VOA by phone. While China may be more prepared to cope with the impact of tariffs imposed by the U.S. due to experiences from Trump’s first term in office, some Chinese economists said the additional tariffs could still seriously affect China’s economic growth. 'The Chinese economy will still be hit hard by the additional tariffs imposed by the Trump administration because China has been relying on export to drive economic growth in recent years,' He Jiangbing, an independent Chinese economic commentator, told VOA by phone. Garcia-Herrero said while Trump begins his second term by imposing additional tariffs on Chinese goods, the trade imbalance won’t be the main source of tension between China and the U.S. over the next four years. 'Escalation of tension between China and the U.S. will come from important national security issues such as Taiwan and the U.S. military deployment in the Philippines,' she told VOA.	https://www.voanews.com/a/trump-tariff-met-with-mixed-reactions-from-china-/7960026.html	2025-02-02T07:03:39-08:00	
In US, Punxsutawney Phil sees his shadow, predicting 6 more weeks of wintry weather	PUNXSUTAWNEY, Pa. — U.S. groundhog Punxsutawney Phil saw his shadow Sunday and predicted six more weeks of wintry weather, his top-hatted handlers announced to a raucous, record-sized crowd at Gobbler's Knob in Pennsylvania. Phil was welcomed with chants of 'Phil, Phil, Phil,' and pulled from a hatch on his tree stump shortly after sunrise before a member of the Punxsutawney Groundhog Club read from a scroll in which he boasted: 'Only I know — you can't trust A.I.' The woodchuck's weather forecast is an annual ritual that goes back more than a century in western Pennsylvania, with far older roots in European folklore, but it took Bill Murray's 1993 'Groundhog Day' movie to transform the event into what it is today, with tens of thousands of revelers at the scene and imitators scattered around the United States and beyond. When Phil is deemed to have not seen his shadow, that is said to usher in an early spring. When he does see it, there will be six more weeks of winter. The crowd was treated to a fireworks show, confetti and live music that ranged from the Ramones to 'Pennsylvania Polka' as they awaited sunrise and Phil's emergence. Gov. Josh Shapiro, local and state elected officials and a pair of pageant winners were among the dignitaries at the scene. Self-employed New York gingerbread artist Jon Lovitch has attended the event for 33 years. 'I like the cold, you know, and this is probably the best and biggest midwinter party in the entire world,' Lovitch said in Punxsutawney. 'And it's just a really good time.' Phil has predicted a longer winter far more often than an early spring, and one effort to track his accuracy concluded he was right less than half the time. What six more weeks of winter means is subjective. Tom Dunkel, president of the Punxsutawney Groundhog Club, says there are two types of people who make the trek to Gobbler's Knob: the faithful seeking to validate their beliefs and the doubters who want to confirm their skepticism. Phil communicated his forecast to Dunkel through 'Groundhog-ese' with the help of a special cane that Dunkel has inherited as the club's leader. It's not as if he speaks in English words. 'He'll like wink, he'll purr, he'll chatter, he'll — you know — nod,' Dunkel said. Attendance is free but it cost $5 to take a bus and avoid a 1.6 kilometer trek from the middle of town to the stage where the prediction was made, some 123 kilometers northeast of Pittsburgh. The need for so many buses is why the local schools, where the sports mascot is the Chucks, close when Groundhog Day falls on a weekday. Keith Post, his wife and a friend have watched the 'Groundhog Day' movie in each of the past five years and decided this was the time to make the trip from Ohio to witness the event. 'We booked rooms almost a year in advance and we're here,' Post said. 'We're doing it.' A new welcome center opened four years ago and the club is working on an elaborate second living space for Phil and family so they can split time between Gobbler's Knob and Phil's longtime home at the town library. The club also put up large video screens and more powerful speakers this year to help attendees in the back of the crowd follow the proceedings. 'It's a holiday where you don't really owe anyone anything,' said A.J. Dereume, who among the club's 15-member inner circle serves as Phil's handler and held him up to loud cheers on Sunday. 'You're grasping onto the belief, you know, in something that's just fun to believe in.' Jackie Handley agreed a year ago to visit Punxsutawney for the first time to help a friend check off an item on their bucket list. They were ready for the subfreezing temperatures. 'It's once in a lifetime — we're probably not going to come back. And we have tons of warm clothes,' said Handley, who lives in Falls Church, Virginia. After the forecast was made, club members and Phil posed for photos with people from the crowd. Phil has a wife, Punxsutawney Phyllis, and two pups born this spring, Shadow and Sunny, although his family did not join him on stage for the big event. The groundhog family eats fruits and vegetables, get daily visits from Dereume and sees a veterinarian at least once a year. The club's lore is that Phil is the same woodchuck who has been issuing weather forecasts for the past century, thanks to an 'elixir of life' that keeps him immortal. 'There's only one Phil, and it's not something that can be handed down,' Dunkel said. 'Just like Santa Claus and the Easter Bunny, there's only one.' Groundhog Day celebrations, formal and informal, were being held in many Pennsylvania towns and elsewhere on Sunday. There have been Groundhog Day events in at least 28 U.S. states and Canadian provinces.	https://www.voanews.com/a/in-us-punxsutawney-phil-sees-his-shadow-predicting-6-more-weeks-of-wintry-weather-/7959985.html	2025-02-02T05:59:59-08:00	
Turkey says it will join with neighbors to fight Islamic State group in Syria	ISTANBUL — Turkey, Syria, Iraq and Jordan will come together to fight the remnants of the Islamic State group, a move the Turkish foreign minister says would allow the United States to cut ties with Kurdish militants in Syria. Washington's decadelong relationship with Kurdish-led forces in Syria is opposed by Turkey. Ankara says the People's Defense Units, or YPG, are tied to another Kurdish group listed as a terrorist organization by Turkey, the U.S. and the European Union. The YPG, which spearheads the U.S.-backed Syrian Democratic Forces, has played a central role in fighting IS alongside American special forces and now guards thousands of IS prisoners in northeast Syria. 'The basic problem is that the YPG has been guarding Daesh inmates and keeping them in prison … they're not doing anything else,' Turkish Foreign Minister Hakan Fidan said Sunday, using the Arabic term for IS. 'So Turkey, Iraq, Syria and Jordan need to come together to fight Daesh. We are capable of doing that and God willing this is the step we will be taking as four countries in the near future. We have already done the preliminary talks for that process.' Fidan, who was speaking at a news conference in Doha, Qatar, alongside Qatari Prime Minister Mohammed bin Abdulrahman Al Thani, said that the new Syrian government had indicated it will take responsibility for IS prisoners. Turkey wants U.S. President Donald Trump to step back from supporting the Kurdish fighters, who Ankara regards as terrorists due to their links to the Kurdistan Workers' Party, or PKK, which has waged war against Turkey since 1984. 'We hope that President Trump will make the right decision and right this wrong … it is an open wound that needs to be closed as soon as possible,' Fidan added. Since Syrian rebels launched an offensive to take the country in November, Turkish-backed fighters have targeted Kurdish forces, taking a number of towns. Meanwhile, the Turkish military has maintained pressure on Kurdish fighters in both Syria and northern Iraq. On Sunday, the Defense Ministry said Turkish troops killed 23 'PKK/YPG terrorists' in northern Syria without providing further details. Ankara has called for the Syrian Democratic Forces to be purged of elements linked to the PKK and be absorbed into a future Syrian military. The U.S. currently has around 2,000 troops in northeast Syria. During his first term in office, Trump said he would withdraw all American forces from Syria, which triggered a Turkish offensive against the YPG in 2019. His seemingly warm relationship with Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan has led to speculation that Trump will again seek to remove the U.S. military presence.	https://www.voanews.com/a/turkey-says-it-will-join-with-neighbors-to-fight-islamic-state-group-in-syria-/7959979.html	2025-02-02T05:47:54-08:00	
Beyonce competes for the big prize - again - at Sunday's Grammys	LOS ANGELES — The Grammy Awards take center stage in Los Angeles on Sunday at a celebration that will honor the best of music while acknowledging the deadly wildfires that scarred a hub of the industry. Beyonce will compete for the top Grammy prize of album of the year with her country record 'Cowboy Carter.' The superstar singer has never won the album trophy despite winning 32 career Grammys, more than any other musician. Also in the running for album of the year are megastar Taylor Swift for 'The Tortured Poets Department' and Billie Eilish for 'Hit Me Hard and Soft.' The ceremony will be broadcast live on CBS starting at 8 p.m. ET (0100 GMT on Monday) from the Crypto.com Arena in downtown Los Angeles. Comedian Trevor Noah returns to host the telecast, which will be part awards show, part fundraiser for musicians and others impacted by the recent fires. Hundreds of people in the music business were among those who lost homes in the disaster. 'It will be a little tricky to pull off, but I'm starting to think they're going to be able to do it,' said Paul Grein, awards editor at music publication Billboard. With the fires under control, 'people can take a breather and express gratitude and relief that we made it through that.' Eilish and best new artist nominees Chappell Roan, Sabrina Carpenter, Benson Boone and Teddy Swims are among the night's scheduled performers. The show will feature a tribute to Quincy Jones, the prolific music producer who died in November. At last year's Grammys, Beyonce's husband and rapper Jay-Z argued that voters had not given proper recognition to Black artists including his wife. Grammy winners are chosen by the 13,000 singers, songwriters, producers, engineers and others who make up the Recording Academy. 'I don't want to embarrass this young lady, but she has more Grammys than anyone and never won album of the year. So even by your own metrics, that doesn't work,' Jay-Z said on stage. 'Cowboy Carter' was viewed by experts and fans as a reclamation and homage to an overlooked legacy of Black Americans within country music and culture. It became the first album by a Black woman to land at No. 1 on the Billboard Top Country Albums chart when it was released last spring. The Beyonce album was snubbed, however, by voters for the Country Music Awards in their nominations in September. The 'Cowboy Carter' nomination is Beyonce's fifth entry in the album of the year category. Swift has won the honor a record four times, including last year for 'Midnights.' Beyonce leads all Grammy nominees this year with 11 nods, followed by Eilish, Charli XCX, Kendrick Lamar and Post Malone with seven nominations each. Swift landed six nominations and will present one of the night's awards. Beyonce's other Grammy nods include record and song of the year for single 'Texas Hold 'Em.' Competitors for song of the year, an award for songwriters, are Eilish for 'Birds of a Feather,' Carpenter for 'Please Please Please' and Roan for 'Good Luck, Babe!' In record of the year, nominees include Carpenter's 'Espresso' and Swift's duet with Post Malone, 'Fortnight.'	https://www.voanews.com/a/beyonce-competes-for-the-big-prize---again---at-sunday-s-grammys-/7959937.html	2025-02-02T04:47:11-08:00	
Russia and Ukraine trade blame over attack on boarding school in Russia's Kursk region	KYIV — Competing claims emerged over a deadly attack on a boarding school in Sudzha, a city in Russia's Kursk region that has been under Ukrainian control for five months, with Ukraine and Russia accusing each other of carrying out the strike. The General Staff of Ukraine's Armed Forces said Saturday night that four people were killed and a further four seriously wounded in the strike, with 84 people rescued by Ukrainian servicemen from the rubble of the building. Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy said that Moscow had bombed the boarding school where civilians were sheltering and preparing to evacuate. The General Staff said those in need of additional medical assistance were evacuated to medical facilities in Ukraine. The Russian Ministry of Defense claimed in the early hours of Sunday that it was Ukrainian forces that had launched a missile strike on the school, saying that the missiles were launched from Ukraine's Sumy region. Meanwhile, the death toll from a Russian missile strike on an apartment block in the Ukrainian city of Poltava on Saturday rose to 14, including two children, local officials said Sunday. Seventeen people were injured in the attack on the five-story building, Ukraine's State Emergency Service said. Moscow sent 55 drones into Ukraine overnight into Sunday, Ukrainian officials said. According to Ukraine's Air Force, 40 drones were destroyed during the overnight attacks. A further 13 drones were 'lost', likely having been electronically jammed. Two people were wounded in a drone attack in the Kharkiv region, regional Gov. Oleh Syniehubov said Sunday. In Russia, the Defense Ministry said that five Ukrainian drones were shot down overnight in five regions of western Russia: three over the Kursk region, and one each over the Belgorod and Bryansk regions. A man was killed in a drone strike in the Belgorod region, regional Gov. Vyacheslav Gladkov said.	https://www.voanews.com/a/russia-and-ukraine-trade-blame-over-attack-on-boarding-school-in-russia-s-kursk-region-/7959921.html	2025-02-02T04:41:39-08:00	
Putin says ignoring Soviet role in liberation of Nazi death camps is shameful	MOSCOW — Russian President Vladimir Putin said that ignoring the Soviet Union's role in liberating Nazi German death camps such as Auschwitz and not inviting surviving family members of Soviet troops to liberation anniversaries was a shameful act. A commemoration to mark 80 years since the liberation of the Auschwitz camp in Poland by Soviet troops was attended by German Chancellor Olaf Scholz, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy, Britain's King Charles, French President Emmanuel Macron, Polish President Andrzej Duda and many other leaders. Russia, the successor to the Soviet Union, was not invited due to the war in Ukraine. 'This is such a strange, shameful thing to do,' Putin told Russian state television in an interview released on Sunday. 'You can treat the head of the Russian state, me, in any way you want - no one is asking for any invitation. But if you had thought about it, you could have been a lot more subtle.' Putin said that if the Soviet soldiers who took part in the liberation of the camps could not be invited due to health or age, then at least their families could have been invited to the events marking the anniversary of the liberation. As Soviet forces pushed back Nazi troops in Europe in 1944 and 1945, they liberated a number of death camps including Majdanek, Auschwitz, Stutthof, Sachsenhausen and Ravensbrück. U.S. troops liberated Buchenwald and other camps while British troops liberated Bergen-Belsen and other camps. More than 1.1 million people, mostly Jews, perished at Auschwitz in gas chambers or from starvation, cold and disease. Poles, Roma and Sinti, and Soviet prisoners of war were also killed there, according to the Auschwitz museum. In all, between 1941 and 1945, Nazi Germany and its collaborators systematically murdered 6 million Jews across German-occupied Europe. The second largest group of victims of Nazi racial policy after the Jews were Soviet prisoners of war, according to the U.S. Holocaust Memorial Museum. Other major groups killed included Soviet citizens, Poles, gypsies, sexual minorities, disabled people and others who offended Nazi ideas of racial superiority. The International Criminal Court has ordered a warrant for Putin's arrest for war crimes in Ukraine. Russia denies the accusations which Moscow says were made up to smear its image.	https://www.voanews.com/a/putin-says-ignoring-soviet-role-in-liberation-of-nazi-death-camps-is-shameful-/7959933.html	2025-02-02T04:39:59-08:00	
Syria's interim president lands in Saudi Arabia on first trip abroad	DUBAI, UNITED ARAB EMIRATES — Syria's interim president made his first trip abroad Sunday, traveling to Saudi Arabia in a move likely trying to signal Damascus' shift away from Iran as its main regional ally. Ahmad al-Sharaa, who was once aligned with al-Qaida, landed in Riyadh alongside his government's foreign minister, Asaad al-Shaibani. The two men traveled on a Saudi jet, with a Saudi flag visible on the table behind them. Saudi state television trumpeted the fact that the first trip by al-Sharaa, first known internationally by the nom de guerre Abu Mohammed al-Golani, made Riyadh his first destination. Syria's new three-star, tricolor flag flew next to Saudi Arabia's own at the airport as al-Sharaa in a suit and tie walked off the plane. He was scheduled to meet with Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman, the kingdom's de facto ruler, on the trip. Saudi Arabia had been among the Arab nations that poured money into insurgent groups that tried to topple former President Bashar Assad after Syria's 2011 Arab Spring protests turned into a bloody crackdown. However, its groups found themselves beaten back as Assad, supported by Iran and Russia, fought the war into a stalemate in Syria. That changed with the December lightning offensive led by al-Sharaa's Hayat Tahrir al-Sham. The group was once affiliated with al-Qaida but has since denounced its former ties. Al-Sharaa and HTS have carefully managed their public image in the time since, with the interim president favoring an olive-colored military look similar to Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy, appointing women to roles and trying to maintain ties to Syria's Christian and Shiite Alawite populations. That also includes keeping both Iran and Russia largely at arms' length as well. Iran has yet to reopen its embassy in Damascus, which had been a key node in running operations through its self-described 'Axis of Resistance,' including Assad's Syria, Lebanon's Hezbollah militia and other partners. Russia meanwhile would like to maintain access to air and sea bases it has in Syria, but took in Assad when he fled Syria during the advance. Those moves appear aimed at reassuring the West and trying to get crippling sanctions lifted on Syria. Rebuilding the country after over a decade of war will likely cost hundreds of billions of dollars, not to mention covering the needs of Syria's people, millions of whom remain impoverished. Saudi Foreign Minister Prince Faisal bin Farhan visited Damascus in January and said Riyadh has been 'actively engaging in dialogue' to lift sanctions on Syria. Saudi Arabia, unlike Al-Sharaa’s key allies in Turkey and Qatar, restored ties with Assad in 2023 alongside most of the Arab world. Getting sanctions lifted could go a long way in cementing their relationship. Meanwhile, Syria's interim government still faces challenges from the Islamic State group and other militants in the country. On Saturday, a car bomb exploded in Manbij, a city in Syria's Aleppo governorate, killing four civilians and wounding nine, SANA reported, citing civil defense officials. Turkish-backed Syrian rebels had seized Manbij in December, part of a push by Ankara to secure Syrian territory close to its border for a buffer zone.	https://www.voanews.com/a/syria-s-interim-president-lands-in-saudi-arabia-on-first-trip-abroad-/7959905.html	2025-02-02T02:45:40-08:00

Farmers' lawsuit targets ban on sharing seeds in Kenya	KIKUYU, Kenya — Tucked away in a lush, forested area of central Kenya's Kikuyu town, the National Seed Bank stands as a crucial safeguard for the future of the country's agriculture. Inside two chilly rooms of a government building, more than 50,000 seed varieties are cataloged and stored. The bank was established in 1988 after the realization that some traditional varieties of seeds were being lost, an occurrence that is becoming more common with climate change. It aims to conserve seeds for research and reintroduction to farms. 'We realize that some of the traditional varieties that we had abandoned then are actually more resilient to climate change, so when you introduce them, especially in marginal areas, those varieties outperform the improved varieties,' said Desterio Nyamongo, director of the Genetic Resources Research Institute that operates the bank, referring to hybrid seeds that must be bought every planting season. He said the some of bank's seeds also were found to be more resistant to diseases and pests and were high-yielding. This gives hope to a country that relies heavily on rain-fed agriculture instead of irrigation, leaving it more vulnerable to climate shocks like drought. The sector contributes a third of Kenya's GDP. Kenya is not alone facing food security pressures. According to a U.N Food and Agriculture and Organization report in 2023, over a billion people across Africa are unable to afford healthful diets, and the number of hungry people is increasing. But in Kenya, another complication has emerged. Farmers in recent months suffered losses in the millions of shillings (tens of thousands of dollars) after planting counterfeit seeds bought from private sellers. Kenyan officials have acknowledged that the seed sector is critical. During the country's first international seed quality conference in August, the agriculture ministry's permanent secretary, Paul Rono, said Africa has limited capacity to produce high-quality certified seeds that are subjected to quality standards. The head of the Eastern Africa Farmers Federation, Stephen Muchiri, said the vigor of crops in Kenya has become low, and he believes that the main reason is a flawed seed breeding and propagation program. But some farmers say efforts to improve the seed system in Kenya have been limited by a 2012 law banning seed sharing, which is what millions of farmers did every planting season to cut their production cost. The government has said the law is meant to prevent the circulation of uncertified seeds and protects farmers, but it faces a court challenge from more than a dozen farmers across Kenya who say it's expensive having to buy new seeds every planting season. The next hearing in the case is in March. Francis Ngiri is one of the farmers who filed the case. He runs an indigenous seed bank for the local community on his five-acre farm in the semi-arid Gilgil area located 120 kilometers from the capital, Nairobi. His work has become a learning ground for farmers who have experienced disappointing yields from hybrid seeds. 'We have seen that indigenous seeds are more resilient and perform better in our area even when there is reduced rainfall,' he told The Associated Press. He passionately shares his knowledge on conserving the seeds using traditional methods such as covering them with wood ash — believed to repel weevils — or keeping them in earthen pots. He emphasized the use of locally available materials at no cost. Farmer Maximilla Onyura, who farms sorghum in the western county of Busia, said indigenous crops offer a food security solution. She isn't part of the legal challenge but collaborates with Ngiri through a Kenyan organization called the Seed Savers Network. However, 'instead of our government encouraging those offering solutions through indigenous crops, they are now cracking down on those sharing seeds at community level,' she said. Seed sharing in Kenya can bring two years in prison, a fine of up to 1 million Kenyan shillings ($7,700), or both. No farmer has been charged. The National Seed Bank occasionally distributes some of its collection to farmers at no cost in the hope that the varieties that had long adopted to local conditions will be more resilient. The director, Nyamongo, said farmers who cannot afford farm inputs like fertilizers required for hybrid seeds are better off planting the traditional varieties. 'It would be wrong for farmers, especially farmers in marginal areas, to start thinking that using the indigenous seed is backwardness,' he said. 'Far from it, because some of the indigenous varieties have adopted over time to the local conditions, and therefore they are more resilient.' Nyamongo did not comment on the farmers' court challenge to the seed-sharing ban. The president of the Dutch-based climate change adaptation nonprofit Global Center on Adaptation, Patrick V. Verkooijen, said governments can invest in community-based seed programs to preserve a diversity of indigenous varieties. 'Indigenous crop varieties offer many benefits, particularly their genetic diversity, which helps farmers adapt to climate change, combat pests and diseases, and manage poor soil fertility. However, they also come with challenges, such as potentially lower yields or susceptibility to new pests and diseases,' he said. Kenyan proponents of indigenous seeds like Ngiri said lower yields and susceptibility to new pests and diseases only happen when a seed variety is taken from its native location. 'The reason why they are indigenous is because they have adapted to the climatic conditions and the diseases found in the area they originally came from,' Ngiri said.	https://www.voanews.com/a/farmers-lawsuit-targets-ban-on-sharing-seeds-in-kenya/7959208.html	2025-02-01T23:40:29-08:00	
Artists help fellow creators who lost works, archives in L.A. fires	LOS ANGELES — Anthony Obi never imagined the night of Jan. 7 would be the last time he'd step inside his safe haven. The Houston rapper, known professionally as Fat Tony, has lived in the Altadena neighborhood for a year and says he and his neighbors were prepared for heavy winds and perhaps a few days of power outages. 'I totally expected, you know, maybe my windows are going to get damaged, and I'll come back in, like, a day or two and just clean it up,' said the rapper. But residents like Obi woke up the following morning to news that thousands of homes and entire neighborhoods had been burned to ash, destroyed by flames that wiped out large areas of Pacific Palisades and Altadena. Although the neighborhoods are on opposite ends of the county, they are known hubs for many of the city's creative community, housing filmmakers, actors, musicians and artists of various mediums. 'L.A. is not just rich, famous people who have giant mansions that were destroyed,' said visual artist Andrea Bowers, who is helping artists recover. 'So many members of our community lost everything. They lost all their artworks and their archives - that's irreplaceable, a lifetime of labor and a lifetime of research.' 'A lot of my collectors lost their homes,' said figurative and conceptual artist Salomon Huerta, who lost his Altadena home of three years to the Eaton fire and worries the art scene in L.A. will downsize as a result of the wildfire. 'Before the fire, I was in talks with certain collectors. And then, after the fire, they're not in a good place to talk. I'm hoping that there's support so that the art scene can still thrive. But it's going to be tough.' Obi and Huerta lost not only personal treasures, business opportunities and homes but also vital equipment and professional archives, adding to their emotional burden. Huerta left behind slides and transparencies of past work that he had planned to digitize for an upcoming book. 'Everything's gone,' Obi said. 'All of my stuff that is related to Fat Tony music that was in that house is gone, and it was the motherlode of it.' Grief and Hope Kathryn Andrews never imagined she'd experience another wildfire in her lifetime. The conceptual artist was forced to flee her Pacific Palisades neighborhood as smoke drew near, the second time in four years she's had to escape a wildfire. She lost her Juniper Hills property to the 2020 Bobcat fire, which burned a large section of rural Los Angeles County. 'I've already experienced one home being burned. I think you have a different focus after that. Maybe we become a little bit less attached to material things. And we began looking at a bigger long-term picture, thinking about, you know, how we live together in community, how we live in relation to the land and how we can work together to solve this,' she said. Andrews is the co-founder of relief effort Grief and Hope, which aims to support creatives financially as they enter the long road ahead and was founded alongside a group of gallery directors, art professionals and artists like Bowers, Ariel Pittman, Olivia Gauthier and Julia V. Hendrickson. 'Our primary goal is getting people triage money for just whatever the most emergent need is,' said Pittman. The fundraising effort began shortly after the fires broke out with a Go Fund Me seeking $500,000. They have now raised over $940,000 of their new $1 million goal via The Brick, a nonprofit art space. As of Tuesday, Grief and Hope had received more than 450 inquiries, and Pittman said the funds would be evenly distributed to applicants. The deadline for artists to submit a needs survey has concluded, but the relief effort will continue fundraising until mid-March. Grief and Hope also has five different groups of volunteers providing peer-to-peer support, helping with medical needs, safety issues and renter's issues, and collecting survey data to better serve their creative community. 'These are people who already have made very long-term commitments in their work, including the five of us, towards building community and building sustainability around artists and art workers in our city and beyond,' said Pittman. For Grief and Hope, creating a more sustainable future for artists throughout the city begins with affordable studio spaces and housing. Long road ahead For photographer Joy Wong, losing her home of eight years meant losing the beauty of Altadena. She described the overall area as 'a pocket of heaven.' 'I didn't want to leave,' said Wong, who safely evacuated with her husband and 2-year-old daughter. 'We were just so in love with this house, and it wasn't just my house. It was also my studio space.' Many, like Obi, Wong and Huerta, have started GoFundMe accounts. Meanwhile, initiatives and relief efforts have popped up around Southern California, ready to assist with clothing donations, art supplies, professional equipment for creatives and more. 'I'm applying to everything,' said Obi, who needs to replace his instruments and recording equipment. Wong said she's received much support from family, friends and colleagues. 'I think I just have to kind of lean on the community and get back into shooting,' she said. 'I got to get all my gear back, too. It's going to be a long road, but it'll be OK.' Arts scene rebirth Superchief Gallery co-founder and director Bill Dunleavy said he believes that this is an opportunity to rebuild long-needed infrastructure for the arts throughout Los Angeles. 'Quite a lot was lost in the areas affected by the fire. And it's going to affect rent prices and studio prices and art markets and everything else,' said Dunleavy. 'I've been so impressed with the amount of compassion that people feel and the sense of duty people have felt to help with this. ... I hope that continues into the coming years.' Creative director Celina Rodriguez said she hopes freelance artists and creatives continue to work and shoot production or projects throughout the city, rather than leaving because of the wildfires. 'Having lost so many locations that we would shoot, typically in Malibu, Topanga, the Palisades, all throughout, we will have to absolutely come together and figure out how we can continue working in Los Angeles ... and urge people to shoot productions here,' she said. Rodriguez and Dunleavy began collecting donations at the Downtown Los Angeles gallery and within 48 hours transformed it into a bustling donation center with over 150 volunteers. The duo are now working with displaced families to make sure their daily needs are being met. Dunleavy said the relief effort has only encouraged him to take this work beyond just the donation center and explore the possibilities of nonprofit work for the community. 'All of our wheels are turning now that we've seen the power that just self-organizing can have.'	https://www.voanews.com/a/artists-help-fellow-creators-who-lost-works-archives-in-l-a-fires/7957921.html	2025-02-01T23:39:51-08:00	
Couple challenges Vatican bank's ban on workplace marriages	ROME — Pope Francis has long urged couples to marry and have babies rather than dogs. And he has long championed the rights of workers and held up labor itself as the foundation of human dignity. So it has come as something of a surprise to many in the Holy See that the Vatican bank fired a newlywed couple, with three young children between them, after a new internal bank regulation went into effect barring workplace marriages. The apparent contradiction between what the pope preaches and what his Vatican practices isn't lost on Silvia Carlucci and Domenico Fabiani, who on Thursday challenged the ban in a wrongful termination lawsuit before the Vatican tribunal. During the hearing, presiding Judge Venerando Marano asked if the two sides would consider a settlement. The couple is open to a deal but the bank refused, said the couple's attorney Laura Sgro. A new hearing was scheduled for March 14. Ahead of Thursday's hearing, the couple told The Associated Press this week that they never once considered calling off their Aug. 31, 2024, nuptials after learning of the new regulation. And they said they couldn't contemplate the bank's suggestion that one of them quit to avoid running afoul of the new rule, because of financial obligations to their children, former spouses and new mortgage. 'I thought for sure there might have been an intervention by the Holy Father, who rightly gives so much emphasis and value to the role of the family,' Fabiani said in the office of his lawyer, with Carlucci by his side. 'And yet here we find a family that works there and now finds itself on the street.' Grasping for her husband's hand, Carlucci was more blunt: 'There's a great contrast between what truly happens (in the Vatican) and what is promoted.' A tipping point in employee discontent The plight of the 41-year-olds, who between them worked for 25 years at the Institute for Religious Works, as the bank is known, has captured the attention of many in the Vatican, where employment has long been a coveted mark of status in overwhelmingly Catholic Italy. A Vatican job comes with real benefits: tax-free income, access to a duty-free gas station, supermarket, pharmacy and department store and if lucky, access to below-market rents in some of the Holy See's palazzi in Rome. But for the past several years, amid a financial crisis that has resulted in hiring freezes, cuts to overtime, seniority bonuses and other benefits, employee discontent seems to be on the rise, with the Carlucci-Fabiani case something of a tipping point in a system where truly independent legal recourse doesn't exist. The Association of Lay Vatican Employees, the closest thing the Vatican has to a labor union, has taken up the couple's cause, issuing an online solidarity appeal on their behalf. It has asserted that the new rule violates basic human rights as well as the Vatican's fundamental laws and the church's canon law, which in the Vatican take legal precedence over internal regulations. 'While we are confident that God will provide for them and their children, we cannot silence the voice of our conscience that recognizes the traits of injustice and lack of charity in the measure that affected these two former colleagues,' the online appeal reads. 'The application of a regulation, while necessary in the governance of any institution, cannot fail to take into account the fact that any institution is made up of people and stands by virtue of the activity and professionalism of these same people.' The unusual role of the Vatican bank The Institute for Religious Works, or IOR as it is known, is a peculiar institution, created in 1942 to help the church carry out its charitable mission while enabling Vatican embassies and religious orders in far-flung parts of the world to send and receive money when commercial banking might be problematic. Located in a tower just steps inside Vatican City, the bank was long mired in scandal but spent over a decade cleaning up its books and ridding itself of its reputation as an offshore tax haven. The reforms slimmed down its client base to around 12,300 customers among Vatican offices, employees, religious orders and embassies, who are served by a staff of around 100 at its lone Vatican branch. According to the couple, the bank management announced a new personnel policy on May 2, laying out criteria for employment that said marriage between an IOR employee and another bank employee, or anyone else who works in the Vatican City State, was cause for termination. The change shocked them: Three months earlier, they had told bank management of their plans to wed after securing the Catholic decrees of nullity for their previous marriages. Carlucci got an advance on her yearly bonus to help secure their mortgage. They had formally publicized their pending nuptials in Rome city hall and their respective parishes. 'They congratulated us, 'A wedding, how wonderful this marriage. Great job, you made it,'' Carlucci recalls her superiors telling her. But now, the couple doesn't even have access to Italian unemployment benefits because of the nature of their termination, she said. Couple's employment terminated The bank has strongly defended its policy as being consistent with best bank practices to promote transparency and impartiality and avoid conflicts of interest. It says it actually delayed implementing the policy until the last of five married couples in its workforce had retired in March. With such a small staff and one branch, 'this rule is in fact essential to prevent both inevitable professional conflicts of interest between the aspiring spouses concerned, as well as the emergence of possible familistic management doubts among its customers or the general public,' it said in a statement. And yet anyone familiar with the Vatican knows plenty of married partners who work in the city state, not necessarily in the same department but among the 4,500 people employed by the Holy See. While expressing 'deep regret,' the bank said it had 'reached the difficult decision' to terminate the couple's employment on Oct. 1, a month after their church wedding. It is unclear why the bank didn't just terminate one of the two. A transfer to an unrelated Vatican office wasn't possible under the terms of the new regulation. The pope seems aware morale is low The couple had written to Francis personally, hoping he might intervene, but received no reply. Francis though seems keenly aware that employee morale is low and that times are tough for families. He recently approved the opening of the Vatican's first day-care center, as well as a 'baby bonus' of an extra 300 euros a month for Vatican employees with three or more children. During his annual Christmas greetings to Vatican personnel last month, dedicated to the theme of family and work, Francis urged employees to talk to their managers if they have problems. 'If anyone has any special difficulties, please speak up, tell the people in charge, because we want to solve all difficulties,' Francis told the Dec. 21 audience, attended by far fewer people than in past years. 'And this is done by dialogue and not by shouting or being silent.' Carlucci would like her job back but says her new marriage and blended family matter more. 'For us, family is at the basis of our entire lives, so no matter what happens and despite everything, we have won,' she said.	https://www.voanews.com/a/couple-challenges-vatican-bank-s-ban-on-workplace-marriages/7957913.html	2025-02-01T23:39:10-08:00	
1 dead, thousands urged to evacuate as Australia's northeast battles floods	SYDNEY — One person died on Sunday in Australia's north Queensland state in heavy flooding, authorities said, urging thousands of people to move to higher ground because of torrential rains. Queensland authorities said major flooding was underway in coastal Hinchinbrook Shire, a locality of about 11,000 people about 500 kilometers north of state capital, Brisbane. Several suburbs in the nearby city of Townsville were also affected, authorities said. North Queensland has large zinc reserves as well as major deposits of silver, lead, copper and iron ore. Townsville is a major processing center for the region's base metals. In 2019, severe floods in the area disrupted lead and zinc concentrate rail shipments and damaged thousands of properties. 'Residents in low-lying areas should collect their evacuation kit and move to a safe place on higher ground. This situation may pose a threat to life and property,' regional emergency management authorities said on Sunday morning. The flooding was triggered by heavy rain from a low-pressure system rich in tropical moisture, Australia's weather forecaster said on its website, adding that 24-hour rainfall totals were likely up to 30 centimeters. 'The potential for heavy, locally intense rainfall and damaging winds may continue into early next week subject to the strength and position of the trough and low,' it said. Frequent flooding has hit Australia's east in recent years including 'once in a century' floods that inundated the neighboring Northern Territory in January 2023 during a multiyear La Nina weather event.	https://www.voanews.com/a/dead-thousands-urged-to-evacuate-as-australia-s-northeast-battles-floods/7959859.html	2025-02-01T19:02:59-08:00	
UK to become 1st country to criminalize AI child abuse tools	LONDON — Britain will become the first country to introduce laws against AI tools used to generate sexual abuse images, the government announced Saturday. The government will make it illegal to possess, create or distribute AI tools designed to generate sexualized images of children, punishable by up to five years in prison, interior minister Yvette Cooper revealed. It will also be illegal to possess AI 'pedophile manuals' which teach people how to use AI to sexually abuse children, punishable by up to three years in prison. 'We know that sick predators' activities online often lead to them carrying out the most horrific abuse in person,' said Cooper. The new laws are 'designed to keep our children safe online as technologies evolve. It is vital that we tackle child sexual abuse online as well as offline,' she added. 'Children will be protected from the growing threat of predators generating AI images and from online sexual abuse as the U.K. becomes the first country in the world to create new AI sexual abuse offences,' said a government statement. AI tools are being used to generate child sexual abuse images by 'nudeifying' real life images of children or by 'stitching the faces of other children onto existing images,' said the government. The new laws will also criminalize 'predators who run websites designed for other pedophiles to share vile child sexual abuse content or advice on how to groom children,' punishable by up to ten years in prison, said the government. The measures will be introduced as part of the Crime and Policing Bill when it comes to parliament. The Internet Watch Foundation (IWF) has warned of the growing number of sexual abuse AI images of children being produced. Over a 30-day period in 2024, IWF analysts identified 3,512 AI child abuse images on a single dark web site. The number of the most serious category of images also rose by 10% in a year, it found.	https://www.voanews.com/a/uk-to-become-1st-country-to-criminalize-ai-child-abuse-tools/7959851.html	2025-02-01T17:54:41-08:00	
US says life-saving HIV treatment can continue during aid pause	WASHINGTON — The U.S. State Department said Saturday that the President's Emergency Plan for AIDS Relief (PEPFAR) -- the world's leading HIV initiative -- was covered by a waiver for life-saving humanitarian assistance during a 90-day pause in foreign aid. Just hours after taking office on Jan. 20, President Donald Trump ordered the pause so foreign aid contributions could be reviewed to see if they align with his 'America First' foreign policy. The U.S. is the world's largest aid donor. Secretary of State Marco Rubio initially issued a waiver for emergency food aid and then Tuesday for life-saving medicine, medical services, food, shelter and subsistence help. However, the lack of detail in Trump's order and the ensuing waivers has left aid groups confused as to whether their work can continue. So, Saturday the State Department's Bureau of Global Health Security and Diplomacy issued a memo, seen by Reuters, clarifying that PEPFAR was covered by the Jan. 28 memo and spelling out what activities were allowed. These include life-saving HIV care and treatment services, including testing and counseling, prevention and treatment of infections including tuberculosis (TB), laboratory services, and procurement and supply chain for commodities/medicines. It also allows prevention of mother-to-child transmission services. 'Any other activities not specifically mentioned in this guidance may not be resumed without express approval,' it said. More than 20 million people living with HIV, who represent two-thirds of all people living with the disease receiving treatment globally, are directly supported by PEPFAR. Under Trump's foreign aid pause, all payments by U.S. Agency for International Development (USAID) stopped Tuesday — for the first time since the fiscal year began on Oct. 1 — and have not resumed, according to U.S. Treasury data. On Monday USAID paid out $8 million and last week a total of $545 million. The Trump administration is also moving to strip a slimmed-down USAID of its independence and put it under State Department control, two sources familiar with the discussions said Friday, in what would be a significant overhaul of how Washington allocates U.S. foreign aid.	https://www.voanews.com/a/us-says-life-saving-hiv-treatment-can-continue-during-aid-pause/7959846.html	2025-02-01T17:36:25-08:00	
Anti-graft protesters march, block bridges in Serbia	NOVI SAD, SERBIA — Hundreds of students protesting graft they blame for 15 deaths in a building collapse marched Friday through Serbia to the northern city of Novi Sad where they planned to block three Danube River bridges this weekend. They received a hero's welcome from fellow students and thousands of residents in Novi Said after arriving on foot in their two-day, 80-kilometer (50-mile) journey from the Serbian capital of Belgrade. A small red carpet had been placed on one of the bridges across the Danube that the students crossed as they entered the city. Saturday's bridge blockade marks three months since a huge concrete construction at the railway station collapsed in Novi Sad on November 1, leaving 15 people dead. Carrying wreaths with the names of the 15 victims, the students from Novi Sad and Belgrade on Friday evening together headed toward the station building to honor the people who died in the accident. Many people cried when the students from Belgrade arrived, reflecting high emotions over the accident and the continuing struggle for justice. What started as a protest of suspected corruption in construction contracts has developed into the most serious challenge in years to the country's powerful populist leader, President Aleksandar Vucic. Meanwhile in Belgrade, a driver rammed a car into a silent protest Friday, injuring two women who work as doctors at a nearby psychiatric institution. Media reports say both hit their heads on the pavement and are being examined. The incident, the third of its kind in weeks, happened in downtown Belgrade during 15 minutes of silence observed daily throughout Serbia, at the same time as the canopy collapsed in Novi Sad. A witness, Dr. Elena Matkovic, told N1 television that the driver first reversed his car for a short distance, and the protesters thought he would turn around, away from the blockade, but instead he accelerated forward, slamming into people. 'We really did not expect that he would drive through a crowd of people,' she told N1. 'If you are asking me whether we will stop (the blockades,) we most certainly will not. This is not the moment to stop.' Protesters have repeatedly faced attacks, including on students, with drivers ramming cars into demonstrations on two previous occasions. Two people were seriously injured. Along the way to Novi Sad on Friday, the students were greeted by cheering citizens who honked their car horns or came out of their homes to offer food and drinks. Hundreds more people on bicycles headed separately toward Novi Sad on Friday while Belgrade's taxi drivers said they would come too and give the marchers a lift home Sunday. When the students reached the town of Indija on Thursday, roughly halfway along their 80-kilometer (50-mile) route, they were welcomed with fireworks and cheers from residents. Although most of them spent the night out in the open in a soccer field, the freezing temperatures did not dampen their desire for major change in the corruption-ridden Balkan state. Nevena Vecerinac, a student, said she hoped the protesters' demands that include the punishment of all those responsible for the rail station tragedy will be fulfilled. 'We need support from all people. With this energy and mood, I hope we can do it, otherwise there will be no brighter future,' said Luka Arsenovic, another student marcher. Many in Serbia believe that the collapse of the overhang at the train station was essentially caused by government corruption in a large infrastructure project with Chinese state companies. Critics believe graft led to a sloppy job during the reconstruction of the Novi Sad train station, poor oversight and disrespect of existing safety regulations. Monthslong demonstrations have already forced the resignation of Serbia's Prime Minister Milos Vucevic this week, along with various concessions from authorities that were ignored by the protesters who say that is not enough. Vucic and other officials have shifted from accusing the students of working with foreign powers to oust him from power, to offering concessions to the students while issuing veiled threats against them saying that his supporters' 'patience is running out.' He said Friday that 'it is clear that the country is under attack both from the outside and from the inside.' 'We will know how to fight, we will be flexible, we will seek conversation and dialogue (with the protesters), but we will know how to save the country,' he said. The strength and determination of the protesters have caught many by surprise in a country where hundreds of thousands of young people have emigrated, looking for opportunities elsewhere.	https://www.voanews.com/a/anti-graft-protesters-march-block-bridges-in-serbia/7959835.html	2025-02-01T16:47:07-08:00	
Pope stumbles, but avoids falling when cane snaps	VATICAN CITY — Pope Francis tripped while entering the Vatican auditorium for an audience Saturday after the handle of his walking stick snapped, but he avoided falling. The 88-year-old pope often must use a wheelchair or a cane because of bad knees and has fallen twice in the past two months. After Saturday's slight stumble, two aides helped him to his chair on the stage and the audience proceeded without incident. After he recovered someone in the audience shouted 'Viva il Papa' and the audience applauded. Earlier in January, Francis fell and hurt his right arm. It wasn't broken, but a sling was put on as a precaution. On December 7, the pope whacked his chin on his nightstand in an apparent fall that resulted in a bad bruise. The pontiff has long battled health problems including bouts of bronchitis. He uses a walker or cane when moving around his apartment in the Vatican's Santa Marta hotel. Speculation about Francis' health is a constant in Vatican circles, especially after Pope Benedict XVI broke 600 years of tradition and resigned from the papacy in 2013. Benedict's aides have attributed the decision to a nighttime fall that he suffered during a 2012 trip to Mexico, after which he determined he couldn't keep up with the globe-trotting demands of the papacy. Francis has said that he has no plans to resign anytime soon, even if Benedict 'opened the door' to the possibility. In his autobiography 'Hope' released this month, Francis said that he hadn't considered resigning even when he had major intestinal surgery.	https://www.voanews.com/a/pope-stumbles-but-avoids-falling-when-cane-snaps-/7959665.html	2025-02-01T16:03:37-08:00

US strikes stronghold of Islamic State affiliate in Somalia	WASHINGTON — U.S. warplanes took aim at the Islamic State affiliate in Somalia, hitting what officials described as high-ranking operatives in the terror group's mountainous stronghold. U.S. President Donald Trump announced the precision strike Saturday on social media, describing the main target as a 'Senior ISIS Attack Planner and other terrorists he recruited and led.' 'These killers, who we found hiding in caves, threatened the United States and our Allies,' Trump said. 'The strikes destroyed the caves they live in, and killed many terrorists without, in any way, harming civilians.' A separate statement from U.S. Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth said the strikes targeted an area in Somalia's Golis mountains, and 'further degrades ISIS's ability to plot and conduct terrorist attacks threatening US citizens, our partners, and innocent civilians.' Neither Trump nor Hegseth named the IS planner, though U.S. officials said the strikes were carried out in coordination with the Federal Government of Somalia. General Adan Abdi Hashi, commander of the Puntland Devish Forces said the airstrikes targeted at least 10 locations of the Islamic State militants in the Cal-Miskaad area, which is part of the Golis mountains. 'The strikes targeted about 10 locations in the Cal-Miskaad areas, most of them caves, and we believe that many of the militants were killed,' said the general. Residents in Qandala, a small town in Bari region of Puntland told VOA on the condition of anonymity because they feared for their lives, that they could see from the distance plumes of smoke and flames, and that they could hear at least seven huge explosions. Officials from Somalia's semi-autonomous Puntland region thanked the U.S. on social media, calling the operation a success. 'The latest airstrike, carried out today, resulted in the elimination of several high-ranking #ISIS members,' according to the statement. U.S. Africa Command, which oversees U.S, military efforts on the continent, said it, too, assessed multiple terror operatives had been killed. The Islamic State, also known as IS or Daesh, has increasingly played a key role in the terror group's operations in Africa and beyond. Since 2022, Somalia has been home to al-Karrar, one of nine regional Islamic State offices established to help sustain the terror group's capabilities. As a result, IS-Somalia has become both a key cog in the IS financial network, funneling money to affiliates in Afghanistan and elsewhere in Africa. IS-Somalia has, at the same time, become more influential under the leadership of Abdulkadir Mumin, a former militant with the al-Qaida-linked al-Shabab, who is thought to now head IS' directorate of provinces, overseeing the terror group's affiliates in Africa. Some U.S. officials worry Mumin has risen even higher, perhaps acting as the Islamic State's top emir. Others disagree but there is consensus that Mumin is nonetheless a pivotal figure. The U.S. previously targeted Mumin in May of last year. Recent intelligence assessments have further warned IS-Somalia has more than doubled in size over the past year and may now boast up to as many as 1,600 fighters, bolstered by an influx of fighters from Ethiopia, Morocco, Sudan, Syria, Tanzania and Yemen. Most of IS-Somalia's manpower has been concentrated in Puntland, especially in the Golis Mountains, also known as the Cal-Miskaad mountains. Saturday's airstrike, the first against IS in Somalia so far this year, was carried out by fighter jets launched from the USS Harry S. Truman, currently in the Red Sea, according to defense officials who spoke to VOA on the condition of anonymity in order to discuss details of the operation. It comes as Somali forces in Puntland continue a military offensive against ISIS militants hiding in Cal-Miskaad mountains. Puntland also thanked the United Arab Emirates which they say provided air support to the ongoing offensive. The operations, which started in late December 31, drove militants from vast areas in the northeastern highlands of Somalia. The militants, many of them foreigners, have claimed carrying out IED attacks against Puntland forces. The fiercest clashes occurred late last week when the regional forces dislodged the militants from Turmasaale, a strategic location about 150 kilometers southeast of Bosaso. The Somali government called Saturday's airstrikes by the U.S. 'a critical step in our shared fight against terrorism.' 'The Federal Government of Somalia welcomes the firm and decisive counterterrorism efforts led by the United States,' it said in a statement. 'Together, we will continue to dismantle extremist networks ... and build a future free from the scourge of terrorism.'	https://www.voanews.com/a/us-strikes-stronghold-of-islamic-state-affiliate-in-somalia/7959636.html	2025-02-01T14:52:03-08:00	
Trump enacts tariffs on Canada, Mexico, China	WHITE HOUSE — U.S. President Donald Trump signed an order Saturday that places 25% tariffs on imports from Canada and Mexico and 10% tariffs on goods from China, the White House said. 'Both Canada and Mexico have allowed an unprecedented invasion of illegal fentanyl that is killing American citizens, and also illegal immigrants into our country,' White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt said during her briefing Friday. Leavitt did not say whether there would be any exemptions to the measures. 'These are promises made and promises kept by the president,' she said. Asked by reporters Friday, Trump said there was nothing the three countries could do to reverse his decision and that the tariffs were 'not a negotiating tool.' 'It's a pure economic — we have big deficits with, as you know, with all three of them,' Trump said. 'We're not looking for a concession, and we'll just see what happens.' Trump had said he would tariff Canadian crude oil imports at 10% beginning Saturday. Other Canadian goods would be hit with a 25% tariff. The president vowed to impose sweeping tariffs on semiconductors, pharmaceuticals, steel and aluminum, and oil and gas. 'All forms of medicine and pharmaceuticals,' Trump said. 'And we'll be doing, very importantly, steel, and we'll also be doing chips and things associated with chips.' The tentative plan is for the tariffs to take effect on Tuesday. Trump warned he would 'absolutely' place tariffs on goods from the European Union. 'They're treating us so badly,' he said. Outgoing Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau said his country would respond. 'We're working hard to prevent these tariffs, but if the United States moves ahead, Canada's ready with a forceful and immediate response,' he posted on social media. Meanwhile, Mexico had a more muted response. Its economic ministry posted a message on social media saying that Mexico and the United States were 'partners, not competitors.' Tariffs could backfire China, Mexico and Canada account for more than one-third of the goods and services imported into or bought from the United States. Some economists warn that the tariffs could backfire. Imports from Mexico and Canada make up around 3% of U.S. GDP, while exports make up around 2.5% percent of U.S. GDP, said Brad Setser, a senior fellow at the Council on Foreign Relations A 25% tariff on Mexico and Canada amounts to a 'tax hike on imports from those countries' and will 'have an immediate and negative impact on the U.S. economy,' he told VOA. 'It's a strategy for shrinking the U.S. economy.' Trump has long threatened to impose tariffs to pressure countries to help his administration stop illegal immigration and the smuggling of chemicals used for fentanyl. He has pledged to use tariffs to boost domestic manufacturing and has praised its use as an effective economic policy. Trump believes that 'tariffs are a great source of leverage,' and that he will 'convince Canada and Mexico to make big concessions under the threat of tariffs,' Setser said. 'But these measures are going to be pretty costly to the U.S.' Trump acknowledged that the tariffs might cause a 'short-term disruption' for consumers but said it would lead to a long-term benefit for U.S. manufacturing. 'Tariffs don't cause inflation. Tariffs cause success,' he said. During his first administration in 2018, Trump negotiated and signed the United States-Mexico-Canada free trade agreement, in part to narrow the United States' big trade deficit — the gap between what it sells and what it buys — with its neighbors. He once called the deal 'the fairest, most balanced and beneficial trade agreement we have ever signed into law.' However, the U.S. deficit in the trade of goods with Mexico has widened from $106 billion in 2019 to $161 billion in 2023, according to government data. The trade gap in goods with Canada has also increased, from $31 billion in 2019 to $72 billion in 2023. 'He's now acting like his deal caused a disaster needing an emergency fix,' said Derek Scissors, a senior fellow at the American Enterprise Institute. There's no justification for high tariffs on Canada, a market economy that's not in the top five of U.S. trade deficits, Scissors said. 'Fentanyl shipments across the Canadian border are tiny,' he added. Fentanyl and illegal migration are justifications for border restrictions on Mexico, Scissors said. However, tariffs 'don't stop illegal immigration and probably encourage it by threatening jobs in Mexico.' The stock market erased early gains and closed lower Friday after the White House announcement on tariffs.

Naval arm of Iran's Revolutionary Guards unveil underground missile facility	TEHRAN, IRAN — The naval arm of Iran's Revolutionary Guards unveiled a new underground missile facility on the south coast in footage aired by state television Saturday, two weeks after unveiling an underground naval base. 'Hundreds of cruise missiles capable of countering enemy destroyers' electronic warfare are stationed in these underground cities,' the televised report said. 'The systems are being kept hundreds of meters underground and can be operational in a very short time,' it said without giving an exact location of the base. 'These systems and missiles can be armed and fired from hundreds of kilometers away and can hit targets far out at sea.' Guards chief General Hossein Salami toured the base with naval arm commander Rear Admiral Alireza Tangsiri. The report also unveiled a new model of cruise missile dubbed Ghadr-380 which Tangsiri said had 'anti-jamming capabilities' and a range of more than 1,000 kilometers (more than 600 miles). He said the new missiles could 'create hell for enemy vessels.' Last month, the Guards unveiled an underground naval base for assault boats operating in Iran's southern waters, which include the Gulf and the strategic Strait of Hormuz. In early January, Iran's armed forces began a series of exercises, dubbed Eqtedar ('Mighty' in Farsi), which are set to continue until mid-March. The drills have included naval maneuvers that saw the unveiling of an advanced reconnaissance ship as well as exercises on safeguarding Iran's nuclear facilities from attack by Israel or the United States. The military exercises come as Iran waits to see what policy U.S. President Donald Trump will follow in his second term. During his first term that ended in 2021, Trump pursued a policy of 'maximum pressure' against Iran, withdrawing the United States from a landmark nuclear deal between Iran and major powers, and reimposing biting sanctions.	https://www.voanews.com/a/naval-arm-of-iran-s-revolutionary-guards-unveil-underground-missile-facility/7959608.html	2025-02-01T13:38:10-08:00	
4 media organizations 'rotated' out of Pentagon press corps offices	WASHINGTON — U.S. President Donald Trump's administration, in an unprecedented move, announced late Friday it would remove four media organizations including The New York Times from their dedicated office spaces in the Pentagon, citing a desire to make room for others. The memo on a 'New Annual Media Rotation Program' said it would also remove National Public Radio, NBC News and Politico, which must vacate their spaces by February 14. In their place, it would give dedicated office space to the New York Post, One America News Network, Breitbart News Network and HuffPost News. Each year going forward, one outlet from print, online, television and radio will rotate out of the Pentagon 'to allow a new outlet from the same medium that has not had the unique opportunity to report as a resident member of the Pentagon Press Corps,' the memo said. 'We're disappointed by the decision to deny us access to a broadcasting booth at the Pentagon that we've used for many decades,' an NBC News spokesperson said by email. 'Despite the significant obstacles this presents to our ability to gather and report news in the national public interest, we will continue to report with the same integrity and rigor NBC News always has.' The New York Times said it remained committed to covering the Pentagon 'fully and fairly' despite the move. 'Steps designed to impede access are clearly not in the public interest,' The Times said in a statement. NPR called on the Defense Department to expand office space available so all media outlets covering the Pentagon receive equal access. 'This decision interferes with the ability of millions of Americans to directly hear from Pentagon leadership, and with NPR's public interest mission to serve Americans who turn to our network of local public media stations in all 50 states,' it said. Politico did not immediately respond to a request for comment outside regular business hours. More than two dozen news organizations operate out of the Pentagon, including Reuters, reporting on the daily activities of the U.S. military. 'To be clear, the outlets that vacate the spaces loaned them by the secretary (of defense) will remain full members of the Pentagon Press Corps,' said John Ullyot, acting assistant to the secretary of defense for public affairs. 'The only change will be giving up their physical workspaces in the building to allow new outlets to have their turn to become resident members of the Pentagon Press Corps.' The Pentagon Press Association, which represents journalists who cover the Defense Department, said it was 'greatly troubled by this unprecedented move by DOD to single out highly professional media.' Reuters correspondent Phil Stewart is a member of the association's four-member board of directors.	https://www.voanews.com/a/media-organizations-rotated-out-of-pentagon-press-corps-offices-/7959594.html	2025-02-01T13:00:49-08:00	
Taliban decry US claims about frozen Afghan assets	ISLAMABAD — Taliban officials denounced Saturday claims that the United States could regain custody of Afghanistan's frozen central bank funds, warning that any such action would be 'unacceptable.' The Taliban-led Ministry of Economy issued the warning in response to the latest quarterly report released to the U.S. Congress on Friday stating that the government in Kabul is not recognized by Washington and has been subjected to economic sanctions. In August 2021, when Taliban insurgents retook control of the country just days before the withdrawal of all American and NATO troops, then-President Joe Biden froze about $7 billion in assets that were held in the U.S. by the Afghan central bank. Additionally, European countries froze around $2 billion. Washington subsequently transferred half of the frozen funds, amounting to $3.5 billion, to a newly established 'Afghan Fund' in Switzerland. That fund is intended to support humanitarian assistance in impoverished Afghanistan while ensuring that the Taliban cannot access the money, but no payments have since been released. The remaining $3.5 billion was retained in the U.S. to fund potential compensation for ongoing court cases against the Taliban, brought by families of the September 11, 2001, attack victims. 'With accrued interest, the fund has now grown to nearly $4 billion,' said the Special Inspector General for Afghanistan Reconstruction (SIGAR) in its report to Congress on Friday. 'As part of the current review of foreign assistance, the administration and the Congress may want to examine returning these funds to the custody and control of the U.S. government,' it added. 'The Taliban want these funds even though they have no legal right to them since they are not recognized by the United States as the government of Afghanistan, are on the U.S. Specially Designated Global Terrorist list, and are under U.S. and U.N. sanctions,' the SIGAR stressed. The agency referred to President Donald Trump's order issued after his inauguration last month, which suspended almost all foreign aid for three months pending a review to determine what aligns with his 'America First' policy. The de facto Afghan ministry dismissed the objections, saying freezing central bank assets has undermined their national economy. It renewed Kabul's call for the international community to return the more than $9 billion to the central bank, saying it belongs to the Afghan nation and can play a critical role in ensuring monetary and economic stability. 'Any action by the United States regarding the allocation, use, or transfer of these reserves is unacceptable,' the Taliban statement warned. The SIGAR report argued that Washington has spent more than $3.7 billion in Afghanistan since withdrawing its troops from the country, saying most of that money went to U.N. and partner agencies delivering humanitarian assistance in Afghanistan. It noted that another $1.2 billion remains available in the pipeline for possible disbursement. However, the Taliban disputed the assertions and claimed that U.S. spending had no significant impact on the Afghan economy. SIGAR said that the United States remains the largest donor to Afghanistan, where millions of people need humanitarian aid, according to U.N. assessments. 'While this assistance may have staved off famine in the face of economic collapse, it has not dissuaded the Taliban from taking U.S. citizens hostage, dismantling the rights of women and girls, censoring the media, allowing the country to become a terrorist safe haven, and targeting former Afghan government officials,' the U.S. agency wrote in the report. Since retaking power three-and-a-half years ago, the hard-line Taliban have banned girls from attending school beyond the sixth grade and suspended female university education across Afghanistan. Women are prohibited from visiting public places, such as gyms and parks. They must wear face coverings in public and have a chaperone for road or air travel. The Taliban defend their policies, saying they are aligned with Islamic law, or Sharia, and Afghan culture, dismissing international criticism as an interference in the country's internal affairs. The sweeping restrictions on Afghan women and other human rights concerns, as well as the Taliban's alleged ties with terrorist groups, have deterred the international community from granting legitimacy to the de facto Afghan government.	https://www.voanews.com/a/taliban-decry-us-claims-about-frozen-afghan-assets/7959576.html	2025-02-01T12:11:59-08:00	
Third expulsion attempt fails as migrants in Albania returned to Italy	SHENGJIN, ALBANIA — An Italian navy ship on Saturday took migrants to Italy from asylum processing centers in Albania following a court decision in Rome. It was the third failed attempt by Giorgia Meloni’s far-right government to process migrants in the non-EU country. A coast guard ship took 43 migrants from the port of Shengjin, 66 kilometers northwest of the capital, Tirana. They were among the 49 men who were transferred to Albania on an Italian naval ship Tuesday. Six were returned the same day for being minors or deemed vulnerable. Italian media reported the men were from Bangladesh, Egypt, Ivory Coast and Gambia. An Italian appeals court in Rome on Friday refused to approve the speedy expulsion of 43 asylum-seekers detained in Albania since Tuesday under a controversial migration deal to move the proceedings beyond European Union borders. The court referred the case to the European Court of Justice, in Luxembourg, which is expected to issue a ruling on Feb. 25 related to the previous cases, in which the series of lower court rulings have opened a fissure between the Meloni government and the Italian judicial system. In October and November, judges similarly refused to approve the expulsion of much smaller groups of migrants, seeking clarity from the European court on which countries were safe for repatriation of people whose asylum claims are rejected. Italy last year signed a five-year agreement to process up to 3,000 migrants a month beyond EU borders as part of Meloni’s program to combat illegal migration to Italy, which is the first landfall for tens of thousands of migrants who make the perilous journey across the central Mediterranean Sea. While the agreement has raised concerns among human rights activists, European partners have expressed interest in the project. In the first four weeks of this year, 3,704 migrants arrived in Italy, almost three times as many as in the same period last year. In the whole of last year, 66,317 migrants arrived in Italy, a drop of 58% from the previous year. The largest nationality was Bangladeshis, followed by Syrians, Tunisians and Egyptians, according to the Italian Interior Ministry.	https://www.voanews.com/a/third-expulsion-attempt-fails-as-migrants-in-albania-returned-to-italy/7959550.html	2025-02-01T10:52:01-08:00	
Trump says Venezuela agrees to receive undocumented migrants captured in US	WASHINGTON — U.S. President Donald Trump said on Saturday that Venezuela has agreed to receive all Venezuelan undocumented migrants captured in the United States and pay for their transport. 'Venezuela has agreed to receive, back into their country, all Venezuela illegal aliens who were encamped in the U.S., including gang members of Tren de Aragua,' Trump said in a post on Truth Social. He said Venezuela has also agreed to provide transportation. The Venezuelan government did not immediately reply to a request for comment. U.S. envoy Richard Grenell met with Venezuelan President Nicolas Maduro in the South American country on Friday. Hours after their meeting, six American hostages were released and returned to the United States from Venezuela. The announcement of Venezuela's decision to accept the return of its citizens who were illegally in the United States comes one week after Trump threatened to impose tariffs and sanctions after Colombia refused to accept military flights carrying deportees. Colombia reversed its course and agreed to accept migrants following the threats. 'We are in the process of removing record numbers of illegal aliens from all countries,' said Trump, who vowed to crack down on illegal immigration in his 2024 presidential campaign. Trump, a Republican, issued an array of executive orders to crack down on illegal immigration after taking office on Jan. 20, including actions aimed at deporting record numbers of migrants in the U.S. without legal status.	https://www.voanews.com/a/trump-says-venezuela-agrees-to-receive-undocumented-migrants-captured-in-us/7959511.html	2025-02-01T10:01:10-08:00	
Several government web pages have gone dark complying with Trump orders	Several U.S. government web pages changed or went dark Friday as agencies scrambled to comply with President Donald Trump's executive orders declaring his administration would recognize only two genders and ordering an end to diversity, equity and inclusion initiatives. In a letter sent Wednesday, the Office of Personnel Management directed agency heads to terminate grants and contracts related to 'gender ideology,' ask staff to remove pronouns from their government emails and disband resource groups on the issue, too. The directive, which ordered agencies to institute changes by 5 p.m. Friday, also asked agencies to remove the term 'gender' from government forms and swap it out with 'sex.' Here is a list of changes and missing pages seen so far. Several pages have popped up since being taken down, some with changes: National Park Service pages for historic sites related to the internment of Japanese Americans, the Tuskegee Airmen and the Stonewall Uprising for gay rights were inaccessible. The Tuskegee site was back online a short time later, but the others remained down Friday evening. The State Department removed the 'X' gender marker and replaced 'gender' with 'sex' on online consular forms. A page with tips for lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender, queer and intersex travelers was altered. It's now titled 'LGB Travelers' instead of 'LGBTQIA+ Travelers.' The Census Bureau's homepage was down. Links to reports and topic pages outlining details about the gender identity, sexual orientation and characteristics of the nation’s population returned errors. A message Friday afternoon for one topic page titled 'Sexual Orientation & Gender Identity' read, 'The area of census.gov that you are trying to access is currently unavailable due to maintenance.' Another page titled 'Mental Health Struggles Higher Among LGBT Adults Than Non-LGBT Adults in All Age Groups' also was unavailable. Archives of both pages show they were accessible within the past week. The bureau’s homepage was up Saturday morning. Intelligence Community Inspector General reports were scrubbed from the website of the Office of the Director of National Intelligence. Trump previously fired around 17 inspectors general — known as independent government watchdogs — at multiple federal agencies. A Bureau of Prisons web page originally titled 'Inmate Gender' was relabeled 'Inmate Sex' on Friday. A breakdown of transgender inmates in federal prisons was no longer included. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention website took down much public health information: contraception guidance; a fact sheet about HIV and transgender people; lessons on building supportive school environments for transgender and nonbinary kids; details about National Transgender HIV Testing Day; a set of government surveys showing transgender students suffering higher rates of depression, drug use, bullying and other problems. The agency also removed its data repository, data.cdc.gov. A message said 'the website will resume operations once in compliance' with Trump's executive order. In addition, Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth ordered the military to immediately stop recognizing identity months, including Black History Month, Women’s History Month, Asian American and Pacific Islander Heritage Month, National Hispanic Heritage Month, National Disability Employment Awareness Month and National American Indian Heritage Month.	https://www.voanews.com/a/several-government-web-pages-have-gone-dark-complying-with-trump-orders/7959501.html	2025-02-01T09:45:20-08:00	
UN decries sexual violence as weapon of war in DRC	GENEVA — As fighting between M23 rebels and Congolese armed troops escalate in the eastern Democratic Republic of Congo, the Office of the High Commissioner for Human Rights warns that the warring parties increasingly are using rape and sexual violence as a weapon of war. 'Conflict-related sexual violence has been an appalling feature of armed conflict in eastern DRC for decades,' said Jeremy Laurence, spokesperson for U.N. human rights chief Volker Türk. Laurence emphasized that the high commissioner 'is particularly concerned this latest escalation risks deepening' the 'conflict-related sexual violence much further.' The ongoing crisis in the eastern Democratic Republic of Congo, or the DRC, continues to escalate, with tensions involving the Congolese government and the M23 rebel group. The DRC government has officially designated the M23 rebel group as a terrorist organization, while the United Nations and the United States classify it as an armed rebel group. The DRC government has repeatedly accused Rwanda of supporting the M23 rebel group, a claim that Rwanda denies. Kigali, in turn, alleges that Kinshasa collaborates with the Democratic Forces for the Liberation of Rwanda, a Hutu armed group with ties to the perpetrators of the 1994 Rwandan genocide, an allegation the DRC rejects. Military operations in the region remain fluid, with clashes leading to significant displacement and humanitarian concerns. Analysts warn that continued instability risks deepening the regional conflict, and several peacekeepers from the Southern African Development Community already have been killed since the recent rebel offensive. The key parties involved in the crisis include the DRC government, the M23 rebels and Rwanda. And all are pointing fingers at each other and claiming advances in one form or another. Laurence told journalists at a briefing in Geneva Friday there has been a marked increase in the incidence of rape and sexual violence, as fighting between the hostile armed forces has expanded toward South Kivu, following M23’s takeover nearly a week ago of Goma — North Kivu’s mineral-rich capital. Since the crisis started, the United Nations has received reports of more than 200 cases of rape and sexual violence. 'The numbers, sadly, will likely be higher,' Laurence said. 'As we know, in past conflicts, often for reasons of stigmatization, could be for social, cultural or personal reasons, many women may not report instances of this. The grim story is, the figure is, dare I say, higher, considerably.' Tarik Jasarevic, spokesperson for the World Health Organization, warned that 'with the higher risk of violence, including rape, there is a risk for pregnant women, and we know that there is a high maternal death rate that we observed even before this violence. 'Also, in this part of the Democratic Republic of Congo, we have had a crisis of malaria, measles, cholera and the new, more severe strain of mpox. So, with this violence, the increased spread of these viruses is even bigger,' he said. The United Nations reports at least 700 people have been killed and more than 2,800 injured since M23 rebels seized Goma on Sunday. DRC Foreign Minister Therese Kayikwamba Wagner has accused Rwanda of illegally occupying part of her country by using what she alleges are a proxy, the M23 rebels, whom the DRC designates as terrorists. Kayikwamba said Friday that Rwanda was trying to orchestrate a regime change. Yolande Makolo, Rwanda’s government spokesperson, denied these charges, maintaining that Rwandan troops were being deployed only to prevent the conflict from spilling over into its territory. Meanwhile, Laurence noted the U.N. human rights office has received reports of conflict-related sexual violence committed by divergent groups, such as 'the army and allied Wazalendo fighters in Kalehe territory.' 'We are verifying reports that 52 women were raped by Congolese troops in South Kivu, including alleged reports of gang rape,' he said. 'Additionally, DRC officials report that at least 165 women were raped by male inmates during the prison break by more than 4,000 inmates from Goma’s Muzenze prison on 27 January, as M23 began its assault on the town.' The rights agency reported bombs struck at least two sites for internally displaced persons, causing civilian casualties. The agency documented summary executions of at least 12 people by M23 between Sunday and Tuesday. The International Organization for Migration, or IOM, reports that several displacement sites in Goma and on the outskirts, where over 300,000 displaced persons have sought refuge, 'have been partially or completely emptied as families fled the fighting.' 'Millions of people were already displaced by years of conflict in eastern DRC, and humanitarian needs were massive,' Amy Pope, IOM director general said Friday. 'With the current alarming upsurge in fighting, an already dire situation is rapidly becoming very much worse.' Reports indicate that M23 has progressed farther south toward Bukavu, the capital of South Kivu. In other areas under M23 control in South Kivu, such as Minova, M23 reportedly has occupied schools and hospitals, forced displaced people out of camps and subjected the civilian population to forced conscription and forced labor. Türk warned that the current widespread proliferation of weapons in Goma 'is exacerbating the already significant risks of serious violations and abuses.' 'We continue to receive urgent requests from civilians for protection and are working with U.N. colleagues and other partners to ensure their safety,' he said. Türk called for investigations into the commission of violations, stressing the importance of holding perpetrators to account.	https://www.voanews.com/a/un-decries-sexual-violence-as-weapon-of-war-in-drc/7959490.html	2025-02-01T09:30:25-08:00	
Trump marks Black History Month while Pentagon declares 'identity months dead'	WASHINGTON — The Trump White House issued a proclamation Friday recognizing February as Black History Month around the same time the U.S. Defense Department issued guidance declaring 'identity months dead.' The conflicting messages came as President Donald Trump has been targeting diversity, equity and inclusion programs for removal in the first weeks of his administration. He has referred to DEI initiatives as 'discrimination' and insisted that the country must instead move toward a merit-based society. The White House proclamation calls for 'public officials, educators, librarians and all the people of the United States to observe this month with appropriate programs, ceremonies and activities,' though there is no elaboration on what constitutes 'appropriate.' A news release from the Defense Department titled 'Identity Months Dead at DOD' says official resources, including working hours, will no longer be used to mark cultural awareness months. Black History Month, Women's History Month and National Disability Employment Awareness Month were among the events listed as now barred. 'We are proud of our warriors and their history, but we will focus on the character of their service instead of their immutable characteristics,' the Defense Department release read. In his first two weeks in office, Trump has moved to end affirmative action in federal contracting and directed that all federal DEI workers be put on paid leave before eventually being laid off. On Thursday, hours after a midair collision between a military helicopter and an American Airlines plane killed 67 people just miles from the White House, Trump baselessly blamed diversity initiatives for undermining air safety, despite no evidence of that. Gerald Ford in 1976 became the first president to issue a message recognizing February as Black History Month. Since then, presidents have made annual proclamations marking the month as a celebration of Black history, culture and education. Trump's proclamation Friday specifically noted the contributions of abolitionists Frederick Douglass and Harriet Tubman, conservative economist Thomas Sowell and Supreme Court Justice Clarence Thomas. It said their achievements 'have monumentally advanced the tradition of equality under the law in our great country' and are a continued inspiration. The declaration also listed golfer Tiger Woods as an American great, saying he was among those who have 'pushed the boundaries of excellence in their respective fields, paving the way for others to follow.' 'This National Black History Month, as America prepares to enter a historic Golden Age,' the proclamation said, 'I want to extend my tremendous gratitude to black Americans for all they have done to bring us to this moment, and for the many future contributions they will make as we advance into a future of limitless possibility under my administration.'	https://www.voanews.com/a/trump-marks-black-history-month-while-pentagon-declares-identity-months-dead-/7959465.html	2025-02-01T08:48:19-08:00	
Paramilitary group attacks open market in Sudan, killing 54	CAIRO — An attack on an open market in the Sudanese city of Omdurman by a paramilitary group fighting the country's military killed 54 people and wounded many more, health authorities said Saturday. The attack by the Rapid Support Forces on the Sabrein Market also wounded at least 158 others, the Health Ministry said in a statement. It was the latest in a series of deadly attacks in the escalated civil war that has wrecked the northeastern African country. There was no immediate comment from the RSF. Khalid al-Aleisir, minister of culture and government spokesperson, condemned the attack, saying that the casualties included many women and children. He also said the attack caused 'widespread destruction to private and public properties.' 'This criminal act adds to the bloody record of this militia,' he said in a statement. 'It constitutes a blatant violation of international humanitarian law.' Sudan’s Doctors Syndicate condemned the RSF’s attack. It said one shell hit meters from al-Naw hospital, which received most of the market casualties. It said most of the bodies taken to the hospital were of women and children, adding that the hospital has a significant shortage of medical teams, especially surgeons and nurses. The conflict in Sudan started in April 2023 when simmering tensions between the leaders of the military and the RSF exploded into open fighting in the capital, Khartoum, and other cities across the sprawling northeastern African country. Saturday's attack was the latest tragedy in the country’s brutal civil war. Last week, about 70 people were killed in a RSF attack on the only functional hospital in the besieged city of El Fasher in the western region of Darfur. The conflict has killed more than 28,000 people, has forced millions to flee their homes and has left some families eating grass in a desperate attempt to survive as famine sweeps parts of the country. It has been marked by gross atrocities, including ethnically motivated killing and rape, according to the United Nations and rights groups. The International Criminal Court said it was investigating alleged war crimes and crimes against humanity. And the Biden administration had accused the RSF and its proxies of committing genocide in the war. In recent months the RSF has suffered multiple battlefield blows, giving the military the upper hand in the war. It has lost control of many areas in Khartoum, the capital’s sister city of Omdurman, and the eastern and central provinces. The military also regained control of the city of Wad Medani, the capital of Gezira province, and the country's largest oil refinery.	https://www.voanews.com/a/paramilitary-group-attacks-open-market-in-sudan-killing-54/7959426.html	2025-02-01T07:52:57-08:00	
Insurgent attack kills 18 soldiers in southwestern Pakistan	ISLAMABAD — Authorities in Pakistan said Saturday that at least 18 soldiers were killed in an overnight insurgent attack in southwestern Balochistan province, marking one of the deadliest days for security forces in recent months. A military statement said that the casualties occurred in the Kalat district Friday night, when 'terrorists attempted to establish roadblocks' in the area, and that security forces promptly responded to what was labeled 'a cowardly act of terrorism.' The military said at least 12 assailants were killed in the ensuing gun battles. Pakistani Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif’s office in Islamabad said in a statement that he strongly condemned the attack on security forces. A series of security operations has been launched throughout Balochistan since the overnight attack, which killed at least 11 'terrorists' and destroyed their hideouts on Saturday, according to an army declaration. 'The sanitization operations will continue until perpetrators and facilitators of the heinous and cowardly act are brought to justice,' it said. The outlawed Baloch Liberation Army, or BLA, reportedly claimed responsibility for the attack. The BLA and several smaller separatist organizations operating in Balochistan claim they are fighting for the province’s independence and routinely target security forces as well as their installations in the natural resources-rich Pakistani region. Balochistan and northwestern Khyber Pakhtunkhwa province have experienced a dramatic surge in militant attacks over the past couple of years, killing thousands of Pakistani security forces and civilians. In 2024 alone, military and law enforcement agencies collectively lost nearly 700 personnel in nationwide militant attacks, making it the deadliest year for government forces in a decade, according to official data and independent research reports. Pakistan’s Balochistan and Khyber Pakhtunkhwa provinces, both bordering Afghanistan, have experienced much of the bloodshed. The outlawed Tehrik-i-Taliban Pakistan, or TTP, is mainly blamed or claims credit for attacks in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa. Pakistani officials allege that TTP and Baloch insurgents use sanctuaries on Afghan soil to orchestrate cross-border terrorist raids with the support of that country’s Islamist Taliban leaders. Taliban officials reject the allegations, saying they do not allow anyone to use Afghanistan to threaten neighboring countries.	https://www.voanews.com/a/insurgent-attack-kills-18-soldiers-in-southwestern-pakistan/7959378.html	2025-02-01T06:53:39-08:00	
Russia says it is advancing toward flashpoint Ukrainian city	KYIV, UKRAINE — Russia said on Saturday it had captured a village flanking the eastern flashpoint city of Toretsk in Ukraine as Kyiv said four people had died in overnight Russian strikes. The Russian Defense Ministry said its troops seized the village of Krymske in the northeastern suburbs of Toretsk, located in the eastern Donetsk region and the scene of intense fighting in recent months. The Russian army is slowly but steadily advancing in Donetsk, despite heavy human and material losses. On Tuesday, Ukrainian troops in the region said there was intense fighting in urban areas of Toretsk and Chasiv Yar, a strategically important military hub on the front line. DeepState, a group of Ukrainian military analysts, says Russian forces have been in the center of the two contested cities for months. 4 killed in Russian strikes Overnight, at least four people died in Russian strikes on the central Ukrainian city of Poltava and the northeastern city of Kharkiv. Ukrainian authorities had issued air raid alerts for the entire country just before 7 a.m. Saturday, warning of missile and drone threats in several regions. Ukrainian emergency services said on Telegram a 'missile strike on a residential building' in Poltava had killed at least three people and wounded at least 13, three of them seriously. They published images showing firefighters searching through the smoldering ruins of a building. 'Russian terror' In Kharkiv, a Russian drone shot down by air defense fell on a residential area, killing a woman and injuring four other people, regional Governor Oleg Synegubov said on Telegram. The Russian Defense Ministry said its overnight strikes had hit gas and energy infrastructure that supply Ukraine's 'military-industrial complexes.' Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy said the attacks showed his country needed more defense systems to protect itself from 'Russian terror.' He said, 'Last night, Russia attacked our cities using various types of weapons: missiles, attack drones, air bombs. 'Every air defense system, every anti-missile is a lifesaver. It is very important that our partners act ... and increase pressure on Russia, ' Zelenskyy said, adding that damage had been reported in six regions — Kharkiv, Khmelnytskyi, Kyiv, Odesa, Sumy and Zaporizhzhia. 2 killed in Ukrainian attack Earlier this week, Ukraine launched a major drone attack on western Russia, killing a child and his mother and setting a refinery on fire. The full Russian invasion of its neighbor enters its fourth year this month. U.S. President Donald Trump said during his election campaign he could end the conflict within 24 hours of taking office on Jan. 20. He has been critical of the amount Washington has spent arming Ukraine and has also threatened to impose additional sanctions on Russia.	https://www.voanews.com/a/russia-says-it-is-advancing-toward-flashpoint-ukrainian-city/7959302.html	2025-02-01T04:24:52-08:00	
Myanmar scam operations move south along Thai border	BANGKOK — Myanmar’s scam operations are expanding south along Thailand’s border, authorities have told VOA in recent days, and will continue operating as long as their access to SIM cards, Starlink satellites, electricity and the key human resources — scammers — continues. The Myawaddy area in Myanmar, opposite the Thai border town of Mae Sot, is the 'global capital' of scams, opposition People’s Party lawmaker Rangsiman Rome told VOA on Wednesday. 'We are talking about an empire,' he said, estimating the number of scammers in at least 40 major compounds there at around 300,000. 'They have scammed more than the entire gross domestic product of some countries, and there is no end to their operations in sight,' said Rangsiman, who is chair of the House of Representatives Committee on National Security and Border Affairs. Powered by billions of dollars of illicit money from their scams, the crime bosses are already moving to new sites further south from Myawaddy along the Thai border, police, politicians and former scammers have told VOA. New scam bases have already been set up hundreds of kilometers south of Mae Sot, in border areas of Myanmar held by ethnic rebels across from Thailand’s Sangkhlaburi district, a security attaché at a Southeast Asian embassy in Bangkok who deals directly with scam victims told VOA, requesting anonymity. 'The scam compounds are expanding far south of Myawaddy,' the source said. A toxic mix of cross-border criminal interests, the protection of ethnic armed groups and Myanmar’s junta, has enabled the scam gangs to flourish, virtually in the open. 'What I’m most concerned with is about how Thai ‘grey money’ has operated as the wings for Chinese ‘grey money’ which makes enforcing the law even more impossible,' Rangsiman said, without elaborating on who he believes is backing the scam gangs. Billions in losses estimated A United Nations Office of Drugs and Crime report last year estimated losses of between $18 billion and $37 billion from scams across East and Southeast Asia in 2023 alone. The scam networks are mainly operated by Chinese criminals in China or elsewhere, using foreign nationals from around the world to carry out elaborate romance or investment scams, hunting for victims online or through cold calls. Many of them have been tricked into traveling to Thailand for well-paying jobs but are trafficked into Myanmar instead to work as scammers against their will. Last year Chinese authorities crossed into Myanmar and arrested over 50,000 of their nationals operating in scam factories along the eastern border with Yunnan province. New scam rooms are cropping up to the south, including along Myanmar’s border with Thailand’s Kachanburi province — Rangsiman pointed to the border along Thailand’s Phop Phra district, 35 kilometers south of Mae Sot, and Payathonzu, in Myanmar’s Karen state and across from Sangkhlaburi, 300 kilometers from Mae Sot. China’s deputy minister of public security, Liu Zhongyi, visited Mae Sot on Wednesday, a trip signaling Beijing’s prioritization of the scam issue in Myawaddy, according to Thai Police General Thatchai Pitanilabut, who is head of the Combat Call Center Crimes and Human Trafficking Task Force. 'Beijing is taking this matter very seriously,' he told reporters after the visit. As 'a transit route' to the scam rooms, Thailand needs to tackle the problem, as it is 'giving us a bad image as someone who is an accomplice to human trafficking for the call center gangs,' he said. Thai law enforcement authorities, which are working with the UNODC and other entities on the issue, have said they are committed to assisting and protecting victims of human trafficking as well as investigating and prosecuting perpetrators of call center crimes and human trafficking. The scrutiny comes after a flurry of high-profile rescues of Chinese citizens tricked into scamming in Myawaddy. They include actor Wang Xing, who was rescued in early January after his case went viral on social media. Thatchai said there are immediate measures Thailand can take to rein in the scam gangs. 'First and foremost, we must intercept and block all the supplies, including receivers, antennas, SIM boxes, and Starlink satellite internet dishes from leaving our borders,' he said, referring to the portable kits providing access to high-speed internet from Starlink, which have become essential tools for the scammers. Rangsiman confirmed the movement of scam centers further south and added that the Thai Interior Ministry, acting through its Provincial Electricity Authority, could cut the power into Myawaddy, which is under consideration, but is yet to do so. Questions are also being asked by foreign embassies about how vast numbers of foreigners from such disparate countries as Kenya and Japan have been able to cross a remote Thai border into Myanmar, seemingly without the knowledge of Thai authorities. It should be noted, though, that the Thai-Myanmar border is marked by the Moei River, which at some points can be as narrow as 10 meters. Three police chiefs in charge of three Mae Sot police stations were transferred from their roles this week pending a probe into failing to stop human trafficking into Myanmar. China holds the key to shutting down the Myawaddy scam base, said Thaksin Shinawatra, Thailand’s former premier and a powerful tycoon whose daughter, Paetongtarn, is prime minister. 'China has major clout over Myanmar. We can’t speak to the Myanmar government directly … so we need China to help us,' he told reporters Thursday, referring to Myanmar’s post-coup junta. Trafficking victims or not With a crackdown seemingly imminent, human rights groups are urging Thailand to ensure foreigners tricked into working in the scam rooms are freed and treated as human trafficking victims. Others who have recently left Myawaddy scam rooms paint a more complex picture of the motives of some of the rank-and-file scammers. 'It’s in the news everywhere, social media, it’s impossible for them not to be aware,' a Filipino woman who voluntarily went into one of the most notorious scam rooms told VOA, requesting that her name not be used. 'It’s sad but true … money is the only reason, and it is luring people into work,' she said. The fear of a major Chinese-led crackdown has meant the scam bosses are now recruiting people who know what they are getting into rather than trafficking unsuspecting people, the woman said. 'The new ‘policy’ is that people need to be aware of what type of job they are taking on,' she said.	https://www.voanews.com/a/myanmar-scam-operations-move-south-along-thai-border/7959295.html	2025-02-01T04:07:19-08:00	
Democrats to elect leader as party struggles to regroup	OXON HILL, MARYLAND — Democrats, seeking a new message and messengers to push back against the Trump administration, will elect a new leader Saturday in a low-profile Democratic National Committee election that could have big implications for the party's future. More than 400 DNC members from every state and U.S. territory have gathered in suburban Washington for the election, which features a slate of candidates dominated by party insiders. Outgoing Chair Jaime Harrison is not seeking reelection. Most of the candidates acknowledge that the Democratic brand is badly damaged, but few are promising fundamental changes. Indeed, nearly three months after Donald Trump won the popular vote and gained ground among key Democratic constituencies, there is little agreement on what exactly went wrong. Facing an emboldened Trump presidency, however, the leading candidates are talking tough. 'As we reel with shock at the horror that Trump is visiting on communities across this country, we need a DNC and a DNC chair who’s ready to bring the intensity, the focus and the fury to fight back,' said Ben Wikler, the Wisconsin Democratic chair and a top candidate for DNC chair. The election comes less than two weeks after Trump's inauguration and as Democratic leaders struggle to confront the sheer volume of executive orders, pardons, personnel changes and controversial relationships taking shape in the new administration. The next DNC chair would serve as a face of the Democratic response, while helping to coordinate political strategy and repair the party's brand. Just 31% of voters have a favorable opinion of the Democratic Party, according to a Quinnipiac University poll released this week that offers a dramatic contrast with Trump's GOP. Forty-three percent of voters have a favorable opinion of the Republican Party. The leading candidates for DNC chair, Wisconsin's Wikler and Minnesota’s Ken Martin, are low-profile state party chairs. They're promising to refocus the Democratic message on working-class voters, strengthen Democratic infrastructure across the country and improve the party's anti-Trump rapid response system. They have promised not to shy away from the party's dedication to diversity and minority groups, a pillar of the modern-day Democratic Party. But if Martin, 51, or Wikler, 43, is elected, as expected, either would be the first white man to lead the DNC since 2011. Also in the race: Marianne Williamson, the activist and author; former Maryland governor and Biden administration official Martin O’Malley; and Faiz Shakir, who managed Bernie Sanders’ last presidential campaign. Shakir has called for sweeping changes within the party, such as more coordination with labor unions and less focus on minority groups sorted by race and gender. The only Muslim seeking the chairmanship, Shakir was alone during a candidate forum this week in opposing the creation of a Muslim caucus at the DNC. But he has struggled to gain traction. Shakir declined to raise money for the contest, decorating his modest booth at this week's gathering with pictures drawn by his young children with crayons. By contrast, Martin and Wikler hosted would-be supporters in large hotel suites adorned with dozens of professionally printed signs and offered T-shirts, sunglasses and food. Wikler has faced questions about his relationship with Democratic donor Reid Hoffman, the billionaire cofounder of LinkedIn. But he cast his fundraising connections as an asset. Indeed, the DNC chair is expected to raise tens of millions of dollars to help Democrats win elections. Some Democratic leaders remain concerned about the direction of their party. 'As positive as I am and as hopeful as I am, I’m watching this in real time, thinking to myself, ‘We’re in real trouble because I don’t see a desire to change,’' said Kansas Democratic Chair Jeanna Repass, a candidate for DNC vice chair.	https://www.voanews.com/a/democrats-to-elect-leader-as-party-struggles-to-regroup/7959286.html	2025-02-01T03:34:39-08:00	
Trump administration fires prosecutors involved in Jan. 6 cases	WASHINGTON — The Trump administration on Friday fired a group of prosecutors involved in the Jan. 6 criminal cases and demanded the names of FBI agents involved in those same probes so they can possibly be ousted, moves that reflect a White House determination to exert control over federal law enforcement and purge agencies of career employees seen as insufficiently loyal. Acting Deputy Attorney General Emil Bove ordered the firings of the Jan. 6 prosecutors days after President Donald Trump’s sweeping clemency action benefiting the more than 1,500 people charged in the U.S. Capitol attack, according to a memo obtained by The Associated Press. About two dozen employees at the U.S. attorney’s office in Washington were terminated, said a person familiar with the matter who spoke on the condition of anonymity because they were not authorized to discuss personnel issues. A separate memo by Bove identified more than a half-dozen FBI senior executives who were ordered to retire or be fired by Monday, and also asked for the names, titles and offices of all FBI employees who worked on investigations into the Jan. 6, 2021, U.S. Capitol riot — a list the bureau’s acting director said could number in the thousands. Bove, who has defended Trump in his criminal cases before joining the administration, said Justice Department officials would then carry out a 'review process to determine whether any additional personnel actions are necessary.' 'As we’ve said since the moment we agreed to take on these roles, we are going to follow the law, follow FBI policy, and do what’s in the best interest of the workforce and the American people — always,' acting FBI Director Brian Driscoll wrote in a letter to the workforce. The prosecutors fired in the D.C. U.S. attorney’s office had been hired for temporary assignments to support the Jan. 6 cases but were moved into permanent roles after Trump’s presidential win in November, according to the memo obtained by the AP. Bove, the acting deputy attorney general, said he would not 'tolerate subversive personnel actions by the previous administration.' Any mass firings at the FBI would be a major blow to the historic independence from the White House of the nation’s premier federal law enforcement agency but would be in keeping with Trump’s persistent resolve to bend the law enforcement and intelligence community to his will. It would be part of a startling pattern of retribution waged on federal government employees, following the forced ousters of a group of senior FBI executives earlier this week as well as a broad termination by the Justice Department of prosecutors on special counsel Jack Smith’s team who investigated Trump. The FBI Agents Association said the reported efforts to oust agents represented 'outrageous actions by acting officials' that were 'fundamentally at odds with the law enforcement objectives outlined by President Trump and his support for FBI Agents.' 'Dismissing potentially hundreds of Agents would severely weaken the Bureau’s ability to protect the country from national security and criminal threats and will ultimately risk setting up the Bureau and its new leadership for failure,' the association said in a statement. It was not immediately clear what recourse any fired agent might take, but the bureau has a well-defined process for terminations and any abrupt action that bypasses that protocol could presumably open the door to a legal challenge. When pressed during his confirmation hearing Thursday, Trump’s pick for FBI director, Kash Patel, said he was not aware of any plans to terminate or otherwise punish FBI employees who were involved in the Trump investigations. Patel said if he was confirmed he would follow the FBI’s internal review processes for taking action against employees. Asked by Democratic Senator Cory Booker whether he would reverse any decisions before his confirmation that don’t follow that standard process, Patel said, 'I don’t know what’s going on right now over there, but I’m committed to you, senator, and your colleagues, that I will honor the due process of the FBI.' Before he was nominated for the director’s position, Patel had remarked on at least one podcast appearance about what he called anti-Trump 'conspirators' in the government and news media who he said needed to be rooted out. Trump has for years expressed fury at the FBI and Justice Department over investigations that shadowed his presidency, including an inquiry into ties between Russia and his 2016 campaign, and continued over the last four years. He fired one FBI director, James Comey, amid the Russia investigation and then replaced his second, Christopher Wray, just weeks after his win in November. Asked at the White House on Friday if he had anything to do with the scrutiny of the agents, he said: 'No, but we have some very bad people over there. It was weaponized at a level that nobody’s never seen before. They came after a lot of people — like me — but they came after a lot of people.' He added, 'If they fired some people over there, that’s a good thing, because they were very bad.' The FBI and Smith’s team investigated Trump over his efforts to overturn the 2020 presidential election and his hoarding of classified documents at his Mar-a-Lago estate in Florida. Both of those cases resulted in indictments that were withdrawn after Trump’s November presidential win because of longstanding Justice Department policy prohibiting the federal prosecution of a sitting president. The Justice Department also charged more than 1,500 Trump supporters in connection with the Capitol riot, although Trump on his first day in office granted clemency to all of them — including the ones convicted of violent crimes — through pardons, sentence commutations and dismissals of indictments. This week, the Justice Department fired more than a dozen prosecutors who worked on Smith investigations, and a group of senior FBI executives — including several executive assistant directors and agents in charge of big-city field offices — have been told to either resign or retire or be fired Monday.	https://www.voanews.com/a/trump-administration-fires-prosecutors-involved-in-jan-6-cases/7959279.html	2025-02-01T03:11:02-08:00	
Trump moves to cancel recent union agreements with federal workers	Donald Trump said Friday that any collective bargaining agreements reached with federal workers within 30 days of his inauguration will not be approved, the latest salvo in the U.S. president's bid to remake the federal workforce. In a memo addressed to the heads of all executive departments and agencies, Trump said former U.S. President Joe Biden's administration purposefully finalized collective bargaining agreements with federal employees in its final days 'in an effort to harm my administration by extending its wasteful and failing policies beyond its time in office.' It was not immediately clear how many agreements would be affected by the new policy, which refers to them as 'lame-duck collective bargaining agreements.' Collective bargaining agreements are deals between unions and their employees that outline working conditions, pay and other policies. The move comes as President Donald Trump embarks on a massive makeover of the U.S. government, firing and sidelining hundreds of civil servants in his first steps toward downsizing the bureaucracy and installing more loyalists. The memo cites a U.S. Department of Education collective bargaining agreement reached three days before Trump took office that 'generally prohibits the agency from returning remote employees to their offices.' Trump has signed an executive order that would require federal employees to work in-office five days a week, reversing a remote working trend that took off in the early stages of the COVID-19 pandemic.	https://www.voanews.com/a/trump-moves-to-cancel-recent-union-agreements-with-federal-workers/7959271.html	2025-02-01T02:40:44-08:00	
Hamas frees 3 hostages in latest ceasefire exchange with Israel	Hamas handed over three Israeli hostages Saturday, the latest in a series of exchanges agreed to in a deal aimed at ending the conflict between Israel and the Palestinian militant group. French-Israeli Ofer Kalderon, 54, and Yarden Bibas, 35, were handed over to the Red Cross in the southern Gaza city of Khan Younis before being returned to Israel. Israeli-American Keith Siegel, 65, was released hours later at the Gaza City seaport. Bibas was taken from Kibbutz Nir Oz during the Oct. 7, 2023, Hamas terror attack on Israel along with his wife, Shiri, and their two young boys, Ariel, 5, and Kfir, 2. The fate of his family is uncertain. Siegel, originally from Chapel Hill, North Carolina, was taken hostage from Kibbutz Kfar Aza along with his wife, Aviva Siegel. Aviva Siegel was released during a brief ceasefire in November 2023. Kalderon was captured by the militants from Kibbutz Nir Oz along with his two children. His ex-wife, Hadas Kalderon, was also taken captive but was released with their children during the 2023 hostage exchange. Israel had agreed to release 90 prisoners on Saturday, the fourth such exchange. But a Palestinian advocacy group said that number had been updated to 183, expected to be freed later in the day. Hamas released eight hostages, including three Israelis and five Thai nationals, on Thursday. Later in the day, Israel released 110 Palestinian prisoners, including 32 serving life sentences for deadly attacks on Israelis. With the ceasefire deal in place, more than 423,000 Palestinians have returned to northern Gaza. The Israeli military ordered them out of the territory in the earliest stages of the Israel-Hamas war in October 2023. At a news conference Friday in Geneva, the U.N.’s World Food Program provided an update on efforts to deliver humanitarian aid to Gaza. Country Director Antoine Renard told reporters the agency has delivered more than 32,000 metric tons of food into Gaza since the ceasefire agreement began on Jan. 19. He said that amount was more than twice what was delivered in December and three times what was delivered in October. Renard said the WFP has reached 300,000 people so far. Meanwhile, during a visit to Lebanon on Friday, Egyptian Foreign Minister Badr Abdelatty, called for a full withdrawal of Israeli troops from southern Lebanon. Following talks with Lebanese President Joseph Aoun, Abdelatty told reporters, 'Egypt is very keen on confirming the need for a full and complete Israeli withdrawal from southern Lebanon, without taking away a single inch of Lebanese sovereignty and territory.' Under a U.S.-brokered ceasefire deal announced Nov. 27, Israeli forces were to withdraw from southern Lebanon, and the militant group Hezbollah was to move north of the Litani River by January 26. Like Hamas, Hezbollah is a U.S.-designated terrorist organization. Israeli forces have remained in more than a dozen villages past the deadline. The United States and Lebanon announced Sunday the deadline to meet the ceasefire terms had been extended to Feb. 18. Since the ceasefire began, Israel has conducted near-daily operations in southern Lebanon, including airstrikes and shelling. They accuse Hezbollah of violating ceasefire terms by attempting to move weapons. In statements posted to its social media accounts, the Israel Defense Forces reported overnight Thursday its fighter jets launched several attacks against what it said were Hezbollah targets in Lebanon’s Bekaa region, which it said 'posed a threat to the Israeli home front and IDF forces.' The IDF statement said the targets included a military site 'with underground infrastructure for the development and production of weapons and transit infrastructure on the Syrian-Lebanon border' through which, the IDF said, Hezbollah was trying to transfer weapons. The IDF also reported Friday that its elite Sayeret Haruv fighting unit has, for the past nine days, been conducting an operation to 'thwart terrorism' in the Jenin refugee camp in the West Bank. In a report on its website, the IDF said the fighters 'eliminated terrorists in clashes and made numerous arrests. They located weapons, exposed and destroyed more than five bomb laboratories.' The Sayeret Haruv unit specializes in operations in the West Bank as well as Gaza. Some information for this story came from The Associated Press, Agence France-Presse and Reuters.	https://www.voanews.com/a/hamas-frees-3-hostages-in-latest-ceasefire-exchange-with-israel/7959265.html	2025-02-01T02:09:06-08:00	
Mushers, dogs braved Alaska winter to deliver lifesaving serum 100 years ago	ANCHORAGE, ALASKA — The Alaska Gold Rush town of Nome faced a bleak winter. It was hundreds of miles from anywhere, cut off by the frozen sea and unrelenting blizzards, and under siege from a contagious disease known as the 'strangling angel' for the way it suffocated children. Now, 100 years later, Nome is remembering its saviors — the sled dogs and mushers who raced for more than five days through hypothermia, frostbite, gale-force winds and blinding whiteouts to deliver lifesaving serum and free the community from the grip of diphtheria. Among the events celebrating the centennial of the 1925 'Great Race of Mercy' are lectures, a dog-food drive and a reenactment of the final leg of the relay, all organized by the Nome Kennel Club. Alaskans honor 'heroic effort' 'There's a lot of fluff around celebrations like this, but we wanted to remember the mushers and their dogs who have been at the center of this heroic effort and ... spotlight mushing as a still-viable thing for the state of Alaska,' said Diana Haecker, a kennel club board member and co-owner of Alaska's oldest newspaper, The Nome Nugget. 'People just dropped whatever they were doing,' she said. 'These mushers got their teams ready and went, even though it was really cold and challenging conditions on the trail.' Other communities are also marking the anniversary — including the village of Nenana, where the relay began, and Cleveland, Ohio, where the serum run's most famous participant, a husky mix named Balto, is stuffed and displayed at a museum. Jonathan Hayes, a Maine resident who has been working to preserve the genetic line of sled dogs driven on the run by famed musher Leonhard Seppala, is recreating the trip. Hayes left Nenana on Monday with 16 Seppala Siberian sled dogs, registered descendants of Seppala's team. A race to save lives Diphtheria is an airborne disease that causes a thick, suffocating film on the back of the throat; it was once a leading cause of death for children. The antitoxin used to treat it was developed in 1890, and a vaccine in 1923; it is now exceedingly rare in the U.S. Nome, western Alaska's largest community, had about 1,400 residents a century ago. Its most recent supply ship had arrived the previous fall, before the Bering Sea froze, without any doses of the antitoxin. Those the local doctor, Curtis Welch, had were outdated, but he wasn't worried. He hadn't seen a case of diphtheria in the 18 years he had practiced in the area. Within months, that changed. In a telegram, Welch pleaded with the U.S. Public Health Service to send serum: 'An epidemic of diphtheria is almost inevitable here.' The first death was a 3-year-old boy on January 20, 1925, followed the next day by a 7-year-old girl. By the end of the month, there were more than 20 confirmed cases. The city was placed under quarantine. West Coast hospitals had antitoxin doses, but it would take time to get them to Seattle, Washington, and then onto a ship for Seward, Alaska, an ice-free port south of Anchorage, Alaska. In the meantime, enough for 30 people was found at an Anchorage hospital. It still had to get to Nome. Airplanes with open-air cockpits were ruled out as unsuited for the weather. There were no roads or trains that reached Nome. Instead, officials shipped the serum by rail to Nenana in interior Alaska, some 1,086 kilometers (675 miles) from Nome via the frozen Yukon River and mail trails. Thanks to Alaska's new telegraph lines and the spread of radio, the nation followed along, captivated, as 20 mushers — many of them Alaska Natives — with more than 150 dogs relayed the serum to Nome. They battled deep snow, whiteouts so severe they couldn't see the dogs in front of them, and life-threatening temperatures that plunged at times to minus minus 51 degrees Celsius (60 degrees Fahrenheit). The antitoxin was transported in glass vials covered with padded quilts. Not a single vial broke. Seppala, a Norwegian settler, left from Nome to meet the supply near the halfway point and begin the journey back. His team, led by his dog Togo, traveled more than 320 kilometers (250 miles) of the relay, including a treacherous stretch across frozen Norton Sound. After about 5 1/2 days, the serum reached its destination on February 2, 1925. A banner front-page headline in the San Francisco Chronicle proclaimed 'Dogs victors over blizzard in battle to succor stricken Nome.' The official record listed five deaths and 29 illnesses. It's likely the toll was higher; Alaska Natives were not accurately tracked. Balto gains fame Seppala and Togo missed the limelight that went to his assistant, Gunnar Kaasen, who drove the dog team led by Balto into Nome. Balto was another of Seppala's dogs, but was used to only haul freight after he was deemed too slow to be on a competitive team. Balto was immortalized in movies and with statues in New York's Central Park and one in Anchorage intended as a tribute to all sled dogs. He received a bone-shaped key to the city of Los Angeles, where legendary movie actress Mary Pickford placed a wreath around his neck. But he and several team members were eventually sold and kept in squalid conditions at a dime museum in Los Angeles. After learning of their plight, an Ohio businessman spearheaded an effort to raise money to bring them to Cleveland, a city in Ohio. After dying in 1933, Balto was mounted and placed on display at the Cleveland Museum of Natural History. Iditarod pays homage to run Today, the most famous mushing event in the world is the Iditarod Trail Sled Dog Race, which is not based on the serum run but on the Iditarod Trail, a supply route from Seward to Nome. Iditarod organizers are nevertheless marking the serum run's centennial with a series of articles on its website and by selling replicas of the medallions each serum run musher received a century ago, race spokesperson Shannon Noonan said in an email. This year's Iditarod starts March 1.

What to know about the NTSB, the agency investigating the DC plane crash	WASHINGTON — A collision between an American Airlines passenger jet and an Army helicopter near Washington, D.C., that killed 67 people brought renewed focus on the federal agency charged with investigating aviation disasters. National Transportation Safety Board Chairwoman Jennifer Hommendy has described the investigation into the crash as an 'all-hands-on-deck event' for the agency. Here are some things to know about the NTSB: What does the agency do? The NTSB is an independent federal agency responsible for investigating all civil aviation accidents as well as serious incidents in the U.S. involving other modes of transportation, such as railroad disasters and major accidents involving motor vehicles, marine vessels, pipelines and even commercial space operators. 'We're here to ensure the American people that we are going to leave no stone unturned in this investigation,' Homendy said, noting the probe is in the very early stages. 'We are going to conduct a thorough investigation of this entire tragedy, looking at the facts.' The agency has five board members who serve five-year terms and are nominated by the president and confirmed by the U.S. Senate. How will the investigation work? For the investigation into Wednesday's crash, the NTSB will establish several different working groups, each responsible for investigating different areas connected to the accident, board member Todd Inman said. Inman said those groups include operations, which will examine flight history and crewmember duties; structures, which will document airframe wreckage and the accident scene; power plants, which will focus on aircraft engines and engine accessories; systems, which will study the electrical, hydraulic and pneumatic components of the two aircraft; air traffic control, which will review flight track surveillance information, including radar, and controller-pilot communications; survival factors, which will analyze the injuries to the crew and passengers and crash and rescue efforts; and a helicopter group. The investigation also will include a human-performance group that will be a part of the operations, air traffic control and helicopter groups and will study the crew performance and any factors that could be involved such as human error, including fatigue, medications, medical histories, training and workload, Inman said. How long will the investigation take? NTSB officials did not say Thursday how long the investigation would take, but accident investigations often take between one to two years to complete. The agency typically releases a preliminary report within a few weeks of the accident that includes a synopsis of information collected at the scene. What is the NTSB's history? The NTSB history dates to 1926, when Congress passed a law charging the U.S. Department of Commerce with investigating aircraft accidents. It was established as an independent agency within the U.S. Department of Transportation in 1967 and then separated by Congress in 1974 as a stand-alone organization, fully independent from any other federal agencies. Since its creation in 1967, the agency reports it has investigated more than 153,000 aviation accidents and incidents.	https://www.voanews.com/a/what-to-know-about-the-ntsb-the-agency-investigating-the-dc-plane-crash/7959187.html	2025-01-31T23:02:33-08:00	
South African woman has rescued more than 2,500 pugs	JOHANNESBURG, SOUTH AFRICA — Lots of hair shedding, tons of fun, and a constant invasion of your personal space. That's what you're going to get with a pug, according to Cheryl Gaw, who has seen more than a few of the squashed-nosed pups in her time. Gaw has rescued more than 2,500 pugs in South Africa over the years after she and her husband sold their house, lived in a trailer home for a while and generally reset their lives to help as many dogs in need as they could. They eventually established their Pug Rescue South Africa in Johannesburg in 2010 because of an overflowing number of dogs in their house. It was 'never part of the plan' when they looked ahead to their retirement, said Gaw, who is 63. 'Of course, the pugs won,' she added. The center is currently home to nearly 200 pugs, the latest batch who have hit hard times and need a helping paw. Some of them were abandoned, some sick, and many were given up by owners who couldn't look after them anymore. Gaw's pug life started in 2008 when her husband, Malcolm, gave her one as a gift. At a pug club, someone asked if they'd be interested in providing a foster home for 'a couple' of pugs. In the first year, the Gaws provided a temporary home to 60 pugs and had 19 in their home at one point — too much fur for one small house. 'They are known as the clowns of the dog world, and they can make you laugh,' said Gaw, giving her own breed guide. 'Always in your space. They're just an amazing, lovable breed. And you always have hair on you.' The rescue center's staff do their best to keep order. The routine is: 5:15 a.m., the dogs wake up and come out of the cottages where they sleep in groups according to their 'age and personality,' said Gaw. Then there's breakfast, medication for those who need it, bathtime, playtime, grooming time, midday snacks, afternoon rest, more playtime, evening meal, more medication, and all pugs back in their rooms between 6-7 p.m. Fights occasionally break out. The veterinary bill for the center is nearly $40,000 a year, and it's a constant process of rescue, rehabilitation, and trying to rehome them, with more pugs arriving all the time. 'The operation doesn't stop,' said Gaw. There is a reason why so many pugs need a new home. Their short muzzles, a mark of the breed, give rise to breathing problems and other health issues such as eye and ear infections, she said. A pug's vet costs are not to be sniffed at and Gaw warns prospective owners to do their homework and get a good pet insurance policy: 'You're going to need it.' Many of the pugs have come to the Gaws because their owners can't afford those vet bills. Be prepared for their problems, she said, and also the hair, which she can't stress enough. 'They shed an enormous amount of hair,' she said. 'You can brush them all day long, they still shed.'	https://www.voanews.com/a/hold-for-wknd---south-african-woman-has-rescued-more-than-2-500-pugs-/7957914.html	2025-01-31T23:01:54-08:00	
New Zealand mountain is granted personhood, recognizing it as sacred for Maori	WELLINGTON, NEW ZEALAND — A mountain in New Zealand considered an ancestor by Indigenous people was recognized as a legal person on Thursday after a new law granted it all the rights and responsibilities of a human being. Mount Taranaki — now known as Taranaki Maunga, its Maori name — is the latest natural feature to be granted personhood in New Zealand, which has ruled that a river and a stretch of sacred land are people before. The pristine, snow-capped dormant volcano is the second highest on New Zealand's North Island at 2,518 meters and a popular spot for tourism, hiking and snow sports. The legal recognition acknowledges the mountain's theft from the Māori of the Taranaki region after New Zealand was colonized. It fulfills an agreement of redress from the country's government to Indigenous people for harms perpetrated against the land since. How can a mountain be a person? The law passed Thursday gives Taranaki Maunga all the rights, powers, duties, responsibilities and liabilities of a person. Its legal personality has a name: Te Kahui Tupua, which the law views as 'a living and indivisible whole.' It includes Taranaki and its surrounding peaks and land, 'incorporating all their physical and metaphysical elements.' A newly created entity will be 'the face and voice' of the mountain, the law says, with four members from local Maori iwi, or tribes, and four members appointed by the country's conservation minister. Why is this mountain special? 'The mountain has long been an honored ancestor, a source of physical, cultural and spiritual sustenance and a final resting place,' Paul Goldsmith, the lawmaker responsible for the settlements between the government and Maori tribes, told Parliament in a speech on Thursday. But colonizers of New Zealand in the 18th and 19th centuries took first the name of Taranaki and then the mountain itself. In 1770, the British explorer Captain James Cook spotted the peak from his ship and named it Mount Egmont. In 1840, Maori tribes and representatives of the British crown signed the Treaty of Waitangi — New Zealand's founding document — in which the Crown promised Maori would retain rights to their land and resources. But the Maori and English versions of the treaty differed — and Crown breaches of both began immediately. In 1865, a vast swathe of Taranaki land, including the mountain, was confiscated to punish Maori for rebelling against the Crown. Over the next century hunting and sports groups had a say in the mountain's management — but Maori did not. 'Traditional Maori practices associated with the mountain were banned while tourism was promoted,' Goldsmith said. But a Maori protest movement of the 1970s and '80s has led to a surge of recognition for the Maori language, culture and rights in New Zealand law. Redress has included billions of dollars in Treaty of Waitangi settlements — such as the agreement with the eight tribes of Taranaki, signed in 2023. How will the mountain use its rights? 'Today, Taranaki, our maunga, our maunga tupuna, is released from the shackles, the shackles of injustice, of ignorance, of hate,' said Debbie Ngarewa-Packer, a co-leader of the political party Te Pati Maori and a descendant of the Taranaki tribes, using a phrase that means ancestral mountain. 'We grew up knowing there was nothing anyone could do to make us any less connected,' she added. The mountain's legal rights are intended to uphold its health and wellbeing. They will be employed to stop forced sales, restore its traditional uses and allow conservation work to protect the native wildlife that flourishes there. Public access will remain. Do other parts of New Zealand have personhood? New Zealand was the first country in the world to recognize natural features as people when a law passed in 2014 granted personhood to Te Urewera, a vast native forest on the North Island. Government ownership ceased and the tribe Tuhoe became its guardian. 'Te Urewera is ancient and enduring, a fortress of nature, alive with history; its scenery is abundant with mystery, adventure, and remote beauty,' the law begins, before describing its spiritual significance to Maori. In 2017, New Zealand recognized the Whanganui River as human, as part of a settlement with its local iwi. How much support did the law receive? The bill recognizing the mountain's personhood was affirmed unanimously by Parliament's 123 lawmakers. The vote was greeted by a ringing waiata — a Maori song — from the public gallery, packed with dozens who had traveled to the capital, Wellington, from Taranaki. The unity provided brief respite in a tense period for race relations in New Zealand. In November, tens of thousands of people marched to Parliament to protest a law that would reshape the Treaty of Waitangi by setting rigid legal definitions for each clause. Detractors say the law — which is not expected to pass — would strip Maori of legal rights and dramatically reverse progress from the past five decades.	https://www.voanews.com/a/new-zealand-mountain-is-granted-personhood-recognizing-it-as-sacred-for-m%c4%81ori/7957903.html	2025-01-31T23:01:11-08:00

Over the past three years, despite accusations that China has provided covert support to Russia in the Ukraine war, Beijing has repeatedly emphasized its 'neutrality' in public and called for peace talks. However, with newly elected U.S. President Donald Trump joining the call for a ceasefire, Beijing's carefully crafted role as a 'peacemaker' may face the risk of marginalization.

Trump’s funding freeze hits program for Burmese students, scholars	WASHINGTON — President Donald Trump’s decision to freeze $45 million in U.S. federal funding for over 400 Burmese students has left many in shock and dismay as their scholarships were abruptly canceled. The move has also raised concerns about the broader impact it could have on Burmese in Myanmar, a country already grappling with political turmoil and a collapsing education system under military rule. Students in limbo One Burmese student who studies at Chiang Mai University in Thailand told VOA that she feels completely lost after learning that her scholarship was being suspended. 'To be honest, I am lost because of this sudden loss of my scholarship. I had been studying with the goal of earning a degree, and now I don’t know what to do,' she said. The student spoke with VOA on condition of anonymity because she fears for her safety if she returns to Burma, which remains under military control. She said students like her and others at different academic levels are now left without financial support. 'There are students doing four-year master’s degrees, others in four-year bachelor's programs, and even PhD students. I don’t know whether I should continue my studies, go home, or what my next step should be,' she said. 'I am saddened that President Trump only cares about the United States and has cut off my studies.' An email sent to recipients of the program that was shared with VOA’s Burmese Service, said the Diversity and Inclusion Scholarship Program, or DISP, is currently suspended, and officials 'will review whether to continue the scholarship for the students who have been awarded it.' DISP was created to support Burmese students from marginalized and underprivileged backgrounds, giving them opportunities to study at universities across Asia, including the Philippines, Cambodia, Indonesia, and Thailand. The program also provided funding for online education through the University of Arizona. For many, the initiative was their only chance to pursue higher education outside of Burma, where the junta-controlled education system has systematically restricted access for those opposing the military regime. For some students, the immediate impact has been less severe. Hlwan Paing Thi Ha, who has been studying at Chiang Mai University for a year, told VOA: 'My education has already been paid for through the scholarship program, so it hasn’t impacted me yet.' Future leaders impacted One source who has in-depth understanding of the program, said the impact goes beyond just access to education and opportunities. The source spoke with VOA on condition of anonymity because they are not authorized to speak with the media. More than a quarter of the Burmese students in the program have fled Myanmar due to the military coup, ongoing fighting and forced conscription, which has targeted youth. 'The impact is huge,' the source said, adding that currently, more than 400 Burmese students are attending universities in four countries—the Philippines, Cambodia, Indonesia, and Thailand through the USAID-funded program. 'Of these, 110 were directly recruited from Myanmar, while the rest are students who fled to border regions and Southeast Asian countries due to the military coup or boycotted Myanmar’s junta-controlled education system,' the source said. The program, which was launched in February 2024, was designed as a five-year initiative, with plans to recruit three batches of students over that period. 'The goal was to ensure that at least 1,000 Burmese students, the 'current and future leaders of the country,' could continue their studies in universities across the region. The second batch, which would include hundreds of students, is now in the final stage of the screening process,' the source explained. Debate continues In Washington a debate over the freeze and review continues. On Tuesday, the State Department issued a waiver that exempts some humanitarian aid from the freeze. U.S. lawmakers have also voiced concerns, warning that the freeze will impact American soft power and give China an advantage. On Wednesday, President Trump defended the funding freeze, specifically calling out the $45 million allocated for diversity scholarships for Burmese students. 'We also blocked $45 million for diversity scholarships in Burma. Forty-five—that’s a lot of money for diversity scholarships in Burma. You can imagine where that money went,' Trump said. 'These were the types of payments and many others. I could stand here all day and tell you about things that we found, and we have to find them quickly because we want the money to flow to proper places.' Name threatens its demise? Some note that in addition to the freeze, the name of the program may also leave it in a difficult position, with some worrying that the mention of diversity in its title could impact a substantive review of its impact. The source with direct knowledge of the initiative for Burmese students told VOA that the program was swiftly terminated when the Trump administration began reducing foreign aid, and that its name 'Diversity and Inclusion' likely played a major role in its elimination. 'This program was one of the first to be cut as soon as the administration began making budget reductions in this area,' the source said. While all USAID-funded programs have been temporarily frozen, DISP appears to have been specifically blocked without any review, the source noted. 'USAID officials have not been able to explain why this program was halted so suddenly.' VOA reached out to the State Department to verify whether the program was permanently blocked or still under review and whether its name played a role in its swift termination. However, as of the time of publication, VOA had not received a response from the State Department. The source also voiced concern the administration may not understand that the program has no connection to Myanmar’s military junta and was created solely to support young people who lost their education due to military oppression. Lifeline for ethnic and religious minorities The Diversity and Inclusion Scholarship Program was set up to reflect Burma’s ethnic and religious diversity, giving equal opportunities to students from all backgrounds who have historically faced discrimination under the Burman-dominated and military-controlled education policies. Burman is the name of the main ethnic group in Myanmar. Many recipients of the scholarship program belong to ethnic minority groups such as the Karen, Kachin, Shan, Chin, and Rohingya, who have historically faced systemic discrimination in Burma’s education system.	https://www.voanews.com/a/trump-s-funding-freeze-hits-program-for-burmese-students-scholars/7959215.html	2025-01-31T19:34:23-08:00	
Health data, pages wiped from federal websites as Trump officials target 'gender ideology'	Public health data disappeared from websites, entire webpages went blank and employees erased pronouns from email signatures Friday as federal agencies scrambled to comply with a directive tied to President Donald Trump's order rolling back protections for transgender people. The Office of Personnel Management directed agency heads to strip 'gender ideology' from websites, contracts and emails in a memo sent Wednesday, with changes ordered to be instituted by 5 p.m. Friday. It also directed agencies to disband employee resource groups, terminate grants and contracts related to the issue, and replace the term 'gender' with 'sex' on government forms. Some parts of government websites appeared with the message: 'The page you’re looking for was not found.' Some pages disappeared and came back intermittently. Asked by reporters Friday about reports that government websites were being shut down to eliminate mentions of diversity, equity and inclusion, Trump said he didn’t know anything about it but that he’d endorse such a move. 'I don’t know. That doesn’t sound like a bad idea to me,' Trump said, adding that he campaigned promising to stamp out such initiatives. Much public health information was taken down from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention's website: contraception guidance; a fact sheet about HIV and transgender people; lessons on building supportive school environments for transgender and nonbinary kids; details about National Transgender HIV Testing Day; a set of government surveys showing transgender students suffering higher rates of depression, drug use, bullying and other problems. Eliminating health resources creates dangerous gaps in scientific information, disease experts said. The Infectious Diseases Society of America, a medical association, issued a statement decrying the removal of information about HIV and people who are transgender. Access is 'critical to efforts to end the HIV epidemic,' the organization’s leaders said. A Bureau of Prisons web page originally titled 'Inmate Gender' was relabeled 'Inmate Sex' on Friday. A breakdown of transgender inmates in federal prisons was no longer included. The State Department on Friday removed the option to select 'X' as a gender on passport applications for nonbinary applicants. It also replaced the word 'gender' from the descriptor with the word 'sex.' All State Department employees were ordered to remove gender-specific pronouns from their email signatures. The directive, from the acting head of the Bureau of Management, said this was required to comply with Trump’s executive orders and that the department was also removing all references to 'gender ideology' from websites and internal documents. 'All employees are required to remove any gender identifying pronouns from email signature blocks by 5:00 PM today,' said the order from Tibor Nagy. 'Your cooperation is essential as we navigate these changes together.' An official from the U.S. Agency for International Development said staffers were directed to flag the use of the word 'gender' in each of thousands of award contracts. Warnings against gender discrimination are standard language in every such contract. The official spoke on condition of anonymity for fear of reprisal, under a Trump administration gag order prohibiting USAID staffers from speaking with people outside their agency. The official said staffers fear that programs and jobs related to inclusion efforts, gender issues and issues specific to women are being singled out and possibly targeted under two Trump executive orders. Some Census Bureau and National Park Service pages were also inaccessible or giving error messages. Trump's executive order, signed on his first day back in office, calls for the federal government to define sex as only male or female and for that to be reflected on official documents such as passports and policies such as federal prison assignments. Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth ordered the military to immediately stop recognizing identity a day before the start of February's Black History Month, saying they 'erode camaraderie and threaten mission execution.'	https://www.voanews.com/a/health-data-pages-wiped-from-federal-websites-as-trump-officials-target-gender-ideology-/7959210.html	2025-01-31T19:09:02-08:00

High-ranking member of Assad’s regime arrested in Syria	Syria’s new authorities have announced the arrest of Atif Najib, a former senior security officer and cousin of ousted President Bashar al-Assad. Najib is seen by many as being responsible for suppressing the initial protest which triggered Syria’s 2011 uprising. Najib was arrested in western Syria in the Latakia countryside, where the Syrian Observatory for Human Rights reported he 'was hiding in a farm.' He is the highest-ranking member of Assad’s government to be arrested since Assad was ousted from office in December. 'The criminal Atif Najib has been referred to the competent authorities to be tried and held accountable for the crimes he committed against the Syrian people,' the official SANA news agency reported, citing a senior security official. Najib was the head of political security in Daraa in southern Syria, under Assad’s regime. Syria’s nationwide uprising was sparked by the arrest and torture of children in Daraa, whom, the Observatory said had been arrested for 'writing sentences criticizing the regime on their school walls.' The protests in Daraa that followed the children’s arrests evolved into the 2011 uprising that Assad’s government responded to with a brutal crackdown. Ahmed al-Sharaa is Syria’s newly appointed transitional president. Before being appointed to his current role, Sharaa was the leader of Hayat Tahrir al-Sham, a U.S.-designated terrorist group, that spearheaded the campaign in December to wrest control of the country from Assad. Assad fled to Russia, ending more than half a century of oppressive rule by him and his late father, Hafez al-Assad. Some information in this article was provided by Reuters and Agence France-Presse.	https://www.voanews.com/a/high-ranking-member-of-assad-s-regime-arrested-in-syria/7959179.html	2025-01-31T17:51:47-08:00	
Small plane crashes in Pennsylvania, governor says	PHILADELPHIA, PENNSYLVANIA — A small plane crashed in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, 30 seconds after it took off as crews responded to a fiery scene, Pennsylvania's governor said Friday. Pennsylvania Governor Josh Shapiro said he is offering all 'Commonwealth resources as they respond to the small private plane crash in Northeast Philly.' The crash happened less than 4.8 kilometers (3 miles) from Northeast Philadelphia Airport, which primarily serves business jets and charter flights. Photos taken at the crash site appear to show residential homes on fire. Philadelphia's emergency management office said there was a 'major incident' at the location of the crash site and that roads are closed in the area. Flight data showed a small jet taking off from the airport at 6:06 p.m. and disappearing from radar about 30 seconds later after climbing to an altitude of 487 meters (1,600 feet). A photo posted on the social platform X by the Philadelphia Office of Emergency Management showed a thick cloud of smoke in the sky near the Roosevelt Mall, where first responders were blocking traffic and onlookers crowded onto a street corner. The plane crashed in a busy intersection near Roosevelt Mall, an outdoor shopping center with dozens of stores and restaurants in the residential neighborhood of Rhawnhurst. The Federal Aviation Administration said two people were aboard the plane, which was a Learjet 55. The plane, a small, business-type jet, was en route to Springfield, Missouri. The plane appeared to be a medical transport jet. The plane that took off and quickly disappeared from radar was registered to a company operating as Med Jets. The FAA said the National Transportation Safety Board will lead the investigation. The NTSB, which investigates air crashes, said it was gathering information about the crash.	https://www.voanews.com/a/small-plane-crashes-in-pennsylvania-governor-says-/7959165.html	2025-01-31T17:49:11-08:00	
‘Black box' recovered from helicopter involved in Washington midair collision	U.S. investigators say the 'black box' recorder from an Army Black Hawk helicopter was recovered Friday, as teams continue to search for clues into the midair collision that killed 67 people near Washington. The Army helicopter and a commercial passenger jet collided late Wednesday as the jet was attempting to land at Ronald Reagan Washington National Airport. Investigators said Friday evening that they are reviewing the flight data recorder along with two from the plane that they found Thursday as they try to understand what caused the crash over the Potomac River. National Transportation Safety Board member J. Todd Inman told reporters Friday the helicopter’s recorder appeared to be intact. 'We saw no exterior damage that would indicate it was compromised at this time, so we have a high level of confidence we’ll have a full extraction,' he said. The NTSB is the federal agency leading the investigation into the accident. The commercial jet, a Bombardier CRJ700 regional craft operated by American Airlines subsidiary PSA Airlines, carried 64 passengers and crew, while the U.S. Army UH-60 Black Hawk helicopter carried a crew of three. Officials say there were no survivors. Fire and emergency service officials in Washington said Friday that 41 bodies have been recovered from the wreckage. Authorities said that they would likely be unable to extricate more victims from the plane without heavier equipment. Inman said that barges from Virginia Beach will arrive Saturday to begin more extensive salvage operations. He said rescue workers will also make sure that the victims are recovered. U.S. Transportation Secretary Sean P. Duffy announced Friday that most helicopters would not be allowed to travel through and near Reagan National Airport for the time being. He wrote on social media platform X, 'Today’s decision will immediately help secure the airspace near Reagan Airport, ensuring the safety of airplane and helicopter traffic.' Speaking Friday before the helicopter’s black box was found, U.S. Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth said the recorder would likely determine who was piloting the helicopter at the time of the crash. He said Thursday that the helicopter crew, which was conducting a night-flight training evaluation, included a staff sergeant, a captain-in-training, and a chief warrant officer, who was an instructor. The crew had been issued night vision goggles for the flight, but Hegseth said it was unclear if they were using them. The defense secretary said the black box also could determine who was in communication with the airport’s air traffic control tower and if there was any confusion regarding the instructions they received. Hegseth also said Thursday that the helicopter’s altitude at the time of the accident was under investigation. President Donald Trump said Friday that the Army helicopter was flying too high at the time of the crash. 'It was far above the 200 foot limit. That’s not really too complicated to understand, is it???' Trump said in a Friday morning post on his Truth Social platform. Citing a government report, The Washington Post reported Thursday that the control tower was understaffed Wednesday night. The report said two people were handling the jobs of four inside the tower at the time of the collision. A similar report from U.S. broadcaster NBC News, citing a source familiar with the investigation, said a supervisor in the tower let an air traffic controller leave their shift early before the collision. That decision, the report said, left one controller to handle both airplane traffic and helicopter traffic in the area, whereas typically there is one controller looking at each type of aircraft. The NBC report said it is allowable under Federal Aviation Administration standards for one person to do both jobs, although it is not considered optimal. At a news conference Thursday, both Virginia U.S. Senators Tim Kaine and Mark Warner said they had expressed concerns over the years regarding the high volume of air traffic in the Washington area, but that they would await results from the accident probe before revisiting that specific concern. During a White House news conference Thursday, Trump suggested previous presidential administrations, led by Democratic Presidents Barack Obama and Joe Biden, lowered standards for the hiring of air traffic controllers and blamed diversity, equity and inclusion, DEI, initiatives in the federal government for that. He said he reversed those initiatives with executive orders last week. The U.S. Figure Skating organization said several members of its community, including athletes, coaches and family members, were among the passengers on the plane. 'We are devastated by this unspeakable tragedy and hold the victims' families closely in our hearts,' the organization said. The Kremlin and Russian media said Russian figure skaters, including world champion couple Evgenia Shishkova and Vadim Naumov, also were on the plane. Trump said his administration would facilitate the return of their remains to Russia.

Venezuela frees 6 Americans after meeting between Maduro, Trump envoy	CARACAS, VENEZUELA — Six Americans who had been detained in Venezuela in recent months were freed by the government of President Nicolas Maduro after he met Friday with a senior Trump administration official. U.S. President Donald Trump and his envoy for special missions, Richard Grenell, announced the release of the six men on social media. Grenell posted on X a photo showing him and the men aboard an aircraft. Grenell's trip to Venezuela, according to the White House, was focused on Trump's efforts to deport Venezuelans back to their home country, which currently does not accept them, and on the release of the detained Americans. 'We are wheels up and headed home with these 6 American citizens,' Grenell wrote on X. 'They just spoke to @realDonaldTrump and they couldn't stop thanking him.' The visit by Grenell came as a shock to many Venezuelans who hoped that Trump would continue the 'maximum pressure' campaign he pursued against the authoritarian Venezuelan leader during his first term. Mauricio Claver-Carone, Trump's special envoy to Latin America, previewed Grenell's visit to Caracas in a conference call with journalists on Friday. He said Grenell, who served as U.S. ambassador to Germany and acting director of national intelligence during Trump's first term, was in Venezuela on a 'very specific mission' that in no way detracts from the Trump administration's goal of restoring democracy in the South American nation. 'I would urge the Maduro government, the Maduro regime in Venezuela, to heed special envoy Ric Grenell's message,' said Claver-Carone, himself a former top national security aide to Trump during his first administration. 'Ultimately there will be consequences otherwise.' The visit comes less than a month after Maduro was sworn in for a third six-year term despite credible evidence that he lost last year's election by a more than 2-to-1 margin. The U.S. government, along with several other Western nations, does not recognize Maduro's claim to victory. Venezuelan state television aired footage of Grenell and Maduro speaking in the Miraflores Palace in Caracas, the capital, and said the meeting had been requested by the U.S. government. Signing an executive order in the Oval Office on Friday, Trump was asked if Grenell being filmed meeting with Maduro lent legitimacy to an administration that the Trump White House hasn't official recognized. 'No. We want to do something with Venezuela. I've been a very big opponent of Venezuela and Maduro,' Trump responded. 'They've treated us not so good, but they've treated, more importantly, the Venezuelan people, very badly.' Some Republicans criticized the visit. 'This is terrible timing,' said Elliott Abrams, who served as special envoy to Venezuela and Iran during the first Trump administration. 'A meeting with Maduro will be used by him to legitimize his rule and show that the Americans recognize him as president. If the purpose is to deliver a tough message about migration issues, the president could've done that himself. There was no need to send someone to Caracas.' Among those detained are as many as 10 Americans. Neither the White House nor Maduro's government immediately released the names of the six who were freed Friday.	https://www.voanews.com/a/venezuela-frees-6-americans-after-meeting-between-maduro-trump-envoy/7959164.html	2025-01-31T17:23:03-08:00	
Mozambique urges refugees in Malawi to return home	BLANTYRE, MALAWI — Mozambican authorities have assured thousands of refugees who fled to Malawi following the recent post-election unrest that peace has been restored in their country and that they are welcome to return home. Officials from Mozambique's Institute of Disaster Management Affairs made the comment Friday during a visit to the Nyamithuthu refugee camp in Nsanje district, which hosts asylum seekers from Mozambique. Luisa Celma Meque, the head of the Institute of Disaster Management Affairs in Mozambique, thanked the Malawi government for taking care of asylum-seekers from her country. 'On behalf of our President Daniel Francisco Chapo, we are sending our message of thanks from the government of Mozambique, and we recognize all the effort of the government of Malawi,' said Meque. 'The second message is for our brothers here. We are doing all efforts necessary for them to return home as soon as possible' Thousands of Mozambicans have fled to Malawi to escape violence triggered by the disputed October presidential election. Hilda Katema Kausiwa, the senior administrative and operations manager for the Department of Refugees in Malawi, said the screening and registration of refugees continues. 'Today, as the Department of Refugees, we have registered a total of 3,640 households, representing 7,456 people,' said Kausiwa. 'As of yesterday, we had finished registration in Mwanza, Neno as well as Mulanje [districts] which were additional sites that we had not gone to screen and register together with immigration [officers].' Kausiwa said her department has received no new asylum-seekers from Mozambique so far. Meque of the Institute of Disaster Management Affairs in Mozambique said peace has returned to the country. Malawian authorities said they are struggling to provide for refugees because the situation comes at a time when more than a quarter of Malawi's 20 million people face food shortages due to an El Nino-induced drought. However, during the visit, the Mozambican delegation donated food to the refugees. Kausiwa of the Department of Refugees in Malawi, appreciated the donation. 'And in the package, there is some rice, maize flour, salt and some beans,' said Kausiwa. 'These are critical foods that can be provided to the community noting that food has been a challenge since these people started coming.' But Mozambican traditional leader Reymond Commando of the Mulili area said the refugees would only return if there was concrete proof of their safety. He said they fled to Malawi to escape being killed and chased from their homes 'like animals.' Plataforma Decide, a monitoring group in Mozambique, said in December that more than 200 people have been killed since post-election protests started in October.	https://www.voanews.com/a/mozambique-urges-refugees-in-malawi-to-return-home/7959157.html	2025-01-31T17:18:57-08:00	
UN: After taking Goma, M23 rebels head to Congo's Bukavu	UNITED NATIONS — The United Nations' peacekeeping chief said Friday that M23 rebels are advancing south toward the provincial capital of Bukavu after seizing control of Goma in the mineral-rich eastern Congo earlier this week. 'The information I have is that M23/RDF are about 60 kilometers north of Bukavu. They seem to be moving quite fast,' Jean Pierre Lacroix told reporters of the rebels who are backed by the Rwandan Defense Forces. 'There is an airport in the vicinity of where they are, I think a few kilometers south, which is Kavumu.' He said if they succeed in taking over the airport as they did in Goma, it would be another 'significant step.' Congolese military bases in Bukavu were being emptied on Thursday to reinforce positions along the route to the provincial capital, residents told The Associated Press. Reuters reports that officials in Bukavu have also been recruiting civilians to help protect the city. Rwanda did not immediately respond to a Reuters request for comment on the latest military movements. Rebels take over schools, hospitals Earlier this month, M23 rebels broke a ceasefire agreement, launching a large-scale offensive in along the eastern edge of the Democratic Republic of the Congo with the support of the Rwandan army. Rwanda has denied accusations that it supports the rebels, whom the Congolese government has designated as a terrorist group. Until June, the United Nations had peacekeepers deployed in Bukavu, the capital of South Kivu province. The U.N. made an agreement with the government to gradually begin drawing down its mission, known as MONUSCO, and closed its Bukavu office. In areas under M23 control in South Kivu, including the key trading town of Minova, the rebels have occupied schools and hospitals, expelled displaced persons from camps, and forced the local population to fight for them and perform forced labor, the U.N. office of human rights said Friday. The U.N. peacekeeping chief, echoing the secretary-general and the Security Council, urged diplomatic engagement to halt the fighting and lead to a political solution. Goma still 'tense,' some services restored Meanwhile, in the North Kivu provincial capital of Goma, which fell to the rebels earlier this week, the situation is 'tense and volatile,' Lacroix said, but calm is gradually being restored, along with some basic services. U.N. peacekeepers have also been able to resupply some of their positions, he said. The airport, however, remains out of commission after sustaining heavy damage to its runways. The World Health Organization and the Congolese government assessed that 700 people had been killed between Sunday and Thursday, U.N. spokesperson Stephane Dujarric told reporters. Another 2,800 wounded are receiving treatment in health facilities. 'These numbers are expected to rise as more information becomes available,' Dujarric said. The International Organization for Migration said 300,000 people had been sheltering in displacement sites, including on the outskirts of Goma. Those sites are now mostly empty as people fled the fighting. The agency says the displaced urgently need food, shelter, clean water, medical care and protection. Before the latest round of violence, eastern Congo was mired in one of the largest and most protracted humanitarian crises in the world, with nearly 6.5 million people displaced due to efforts by armed groups to seize control of the country's valuable mineral deposits.	https://www.voanews.com/a/un-after-taking-goma-m23-rebels-head-toward-bukavu-congo/7958949.html	2025-01-31T16:37:07-08:00	
Why the Arctic matters in the 21st century	The Arctic is one of the coldest and least populated regions on Earth, much of it covered by ice. But in recent years it has become one of the most important sites of geopolitical tensions — and a key focus of American policy. Despite its inhospitability, land north of the Arctic Circle has long been inhabited by Indigenous people like the Inuit, Sami and Yukaghir and today includes territories belonging to eight countries: Canada, Russia, Iceland, Finland, Norway, Sweden, Denmark and the United States. In 1996, these countries formed the Arctic Council — a forum that includes all eight countries as member states along with representatives from Indigenous groups. But while the Arctic was once envisioned as a neutral zone where research and conservation could promote deeper international cooperation, multiple developments since then have turned it into a site of competition. The number one issue facing the Arctic is climate change. Since the 1990s, Arctic sea ice has declined by 7.6 trillion metric tons, with the rate of loss increasing by 57%. Besides contributing to rising sea levels, the loss of ice also reduces global solar reflection. This creates a feedback loop as the darker ocean water absorbs more heat, causing more ice to melt, adversely affecting global weather patterns. The melting of Arctic ice also directly affects local wildlife, with polar bear populations projected to decline by two-thirds in the next quarter-century as they lose their hunting grounds. But where some see environmental disaster, others see opportunity. The melting ice is making Arctic trade routes more navigable, providing shorter distances for transoceanic shipping than current lanes using the Suez and Panama canals. Furthermore, increased navigability is expanding potential for exploration and extraction of natural resources. The Arctic region is estimated to hold over 20% of the world’s remaining fossil fuel reserves, with over 400 oil and gas fields already discovered. Both the seabed and offshore areas also hold vast quantities of minerals ranging from staple commodities like iron, gold, nickel and zinc to rare earth metals such as neodymium and dysprosium, which are used in electronics and battery technology. Even traditional subsistence activity may be greatly altered and expanded as global warming leads fish stocks to migrate north and more coastal land becomes available for agriculture. Yet economic opportunities in the Arctic are emerging at a time of increased geopolitical tensions, as countries scramble to secure resources, stake territorial claims and develop facilities. With 53% of the Arctic coastline under its control, Russia has the largest presence in the region in terms of civilian ports like Murmansk and Arkhangelsk as well as multiple airfields and military bases along its northern border. More recently, Russia has moved to expand its claims to the Arctic seabed at the same time that its invasion of Ukraine in 2022 has led other members of the Arctic Council to suspend cooperation with Moscow. While land jurisdiction in the Arctic is largely settled aside from a few small disputes, maritime claims are much more complex. Control over Arctic waters is generally governed by the United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea (UNCLOS), which defines multiple types of territorial waters where a nation may have the right to restrict the activity of foreign vessels. These range from internal waters that are considered part of a nation’s sovereign territory to exclusive economic zones where foreign ships may travel freely but cannot extract resources. Although the United States played a formative role in negotiating the treaty and abides by most of its provisions, it remains one of the few countries that has not formally acceded to it because of concerns about limitations it places on seabed mining. Even among UNCLOS signatories, however, boundary definitions can vary. While Canada considers parts of the Northwest Passage to lie within its territorial waters, for example, most other nations including the United States consider it to be an international strait where foreign ships may transit. Similarly, Russia has claimed parts of the Northeast Passage along its northern coastline as internal waters, moving to restrict the right of passage in areas where it was previously allowed. Given these disputes, the Transpolar Sea Route through the center of the Arctic Ocean, which lies fully in international waters, will become more attractive as polar ice continues to thaw. The increasing importance of the Arctic has attracted the attention of other powers without Arctic territory. Several of these states have been admitted as observers in the Arctic Council, including Germany, the United Kingdom, Japan and South Korea. China, which is also an observer, has unilaterally declared itself as a 'near-Arctic state' and has expanded both research and commercial activity in the region by partnering with Russia as well as investing in infrastructure in Norway, Iceland and Greenland. China’s increased presence in the Arctic alongside Russia’s more aggressive posture have been among the reasons cited for U.S. President Donald Trump’s insistence on annexing or buying Greenland, a territory of NATO ally Denmark. While Greenland already contains a U.S. military base on its northwest coast, the discussion is likely to result in a further militarization of the territory, even under Denmark. Satellites are also expected to play a major role in exerting control within the Arctic, given the importance of observation and monitoring in remote areas with poor communications infrastructure. What was once considered a frozen frontier with little to offer is quickly becoming one of the most contested regions on Earth. And as the planet heats up, competition in the Arctic will as well.	https://www.voanews.com/a/why-the-arctic-matters-in-the-21st-century-/7958931.html	2025-01-31T15:47:38-08:00	
Trump administration moving to fire FBI agents involved in investigations of Trump, AP sources say	WASHINGTON — Trump administration officials are moving to fire at least some of the FBI agents engaged in investigations involving President Donald Trump, two people familiar with the plans said Friday. It was not clear how many agents might be affected, though scores of investigators were involved in various inquiries touching Trump. Officials acting at the direction of the administration have been working to identify individual employees who participated in politically sensitive investigations for possible termination, said the people who insisted on anonymity to discuss private conversations. A third person familiar with the situation said U.S. attorneys were instructed on a call this week to provide the names of prosecutors and agents who had any involvement in the hundreds of cases against the rioters at the Capitol on Jan. 6, 2021. It was not made clear on the call why the names were needed, said the person, who also spoke on the condition of anonymity to discuss internal matters. Any mass firings would be a major blow to the historic independence from the White House of the nation's premier federal law enforcement agency and would reflect Trump's persistent resolve to bend the law enforcement and intelligence community to his will. It would be part of a startling pattern of retribution waged on federal government employees, following the forced ousters of a group of senior FBI executives earlier this week as well as a mass firing by the Justice Department of prosecutors on special counsel Jack Smith's team who investigated Trump. The FBI Agents Association said the planned firings are 'outrageous actions' that 'are fundamentally at odds with the law enforcement objectives outlined by President Trump and his support for FBI agents.' 'Dismissing potentially hundreds of agents would severely weaken the bureau's ability to protect the country from national security and criminal threats and will ultimately risk setting up the bureau and its new leadership for failure,' the association said in a statement. It was not immediately clear what recourse any fired agent might take, but the bureau has a well-defined process for terminations and any abrupt action that bypasses the protocol could presumably open the door to a legal challenge. When pressed during his confirmation hearing Thursday, Trump's pick for FBI director, Kash Patel, said he was not aware of any plans to terminate or otherwise punish FBI employees who were involved in the Trump investigations. Patel said if he was confirmed he would follow the FBI's internal review processes for taking action against employees. Asked by Democratic Senator Cory Booker whether he would reverse any decisions before his confirmation that didn't follow that standard process, Patel said, 'I don't know what's going on right now over there, but I'm committed to you, Senator, and your colleagues, that I will honor the due process of the FBI.' Before he was nominated for the director's position, Patel had remarked on at least one podcast appearance about the existence of what he called anti-Trump 'conspirators' in the government and news media. Trump has for years expressed fury at the FBI and Justice Department over investigations that shadowed his presidency, including an inquiry into ties between Russia and his 2016 campaign, and continued over the last four years. He fired one FBI director, James Comey, amid the Russia investigation and then said he would fire his second, Christopher Wray. Wray later resigned before Trump took office Jan. 20. Asked at the White House on Friday if he had anything to do with the scrutiny of the agents, he said: 'No, but we have some very bad people over there. It was weaponized at a level that nobody's never seen before. They came after a lot of people — like me — but they came after a lot of people.' He added, 'If they fired some people over there, that's a good thing, because they were very bad.' The FBI and Smith's team investigated Trump over his efforts to overturn the 2020 presidential election and his hoarding of classified documents at his Mar-a-Lago estate in Florida. Both of those cases resulted in indictments that were withdrawn after Trump's November presidential win because of long-standing Justice Department policy prohibiting the federal prosecution of a sitting president. The Justice Department also brought charges against more than 1,500 Trump supporters in connection with the Capitol riot, though Trump on his first day in office granted clemency to all of them — including the ones convicted of violent crimes — through pardons, sentence commutations and dismissals of indictments. This week, the Justice Department fired more than a dozen prosecutors who worked on Smith investigations, and a group of senior FBI executives — including several executive assistant directors and leaders of big-city field offices — were told to either resign or retire or be fired Monday. Spokespeople for the FBI and the Justice Department declined to comment. The firings would be done over the will of acting FBI Director Brian Driscoll, who has indicated that he objects to the idea, the people said.	https://www.voanews.com/a/trump-administration-moving-to-fire-fbi-agents-involved-in-investigations-of-trump-ap-sources-say/7958928.html	2025-01-31T15:40:15-08:00	
Southern African leaders seek meeting with East African leaders over DRC crisis	MOUNT HAMPDEN, ZIMBABWE — Leaders from the Southern African Development Community met Friday in Zimbabwe to discuss the conflict in eastern Democratic Republic of Congo between the government and M23 rebels. The 16-nation bloc, which includes DRC, resolved to meet with its East African counterpart — the East Africa Community — about the matter. Elias Magosi, executive secretary of the 16-nation SADC, would engage with 'state and nonstate parties to the conflict on a ceasefire process to protect lives and facilitate a smooth flow of humanitarian support.' Magosi said the M23 rebels fighting the DRC army were backed by the Rwanda Defense Force — an allegation that Kigali has repeatedly denied. The United Nations and the United States classify M23 as armed rebels, while Kinshasa designates it as a terrorist group. DRC is a member of the SADC and the East Africa Community, or EAC, while Rwanda is an EAC member. Zimbabwean President Emmerson Mnangagwa, who is the chairman of the SADC, said, 'I am confident that the concrete decisions adopted today will further propel forward the joint ongoing efforts to finding lasting solutions to restore peace and normalcy in the eastern Democratic Republic of the Congo.' ‘Dire humanitarian crisis’ Dr. Francis Akili, a health project manager of Action Sante, a humanitarian nongovernmental organization operating in eastern DRC, told VOA of a 'dire humanitarian' crisis in areas around Goma, the capital and the largest city of the region's North Kivu province. He said the region faces a severe lack of food, water and electricity, exacerbating an already critical situation. 'We call on SADC, the EAC and the international community to take concrete and decisive actions to restore stability,' he said. 'The people of eastern Congo have suffered for too long.' In a video posted Friday on a U.N. website, U.N. Human Rights spokesperson Jeremy Laurence warned that the crisis continues to deepen following M23’s takeover of Goma. 'Since the start of the crisis, bombs have struck at least two IDP [internally displaced person] sites, causing civilian casualties,' he said. 'We have also documented summary executions of at least 12 people by M23 between the 26th and the 28th of January. Our office has also documented cases of conflict-related sexual violence by the army and the allied Wazalendo fighters in Kalehe territory. We are verifying reports that 52 women were raped by Congolese troops in South Kivu, including alleged reports of gang rape,' Laurence said. DRC President Felix Tshisekedi did not attend an EAC meeting earlier in the week. He did not attend Friday's SADC meeting, either, but was said to be following it online.	https://www.voanews.com/a/southern-african-leaders-seek-meeting-with-east-african-leaders-over-drc-crisis/7959359.html	2025-01-31T15:30:52-08:00	
Consumers brace for impact of China tariffs	washington — White House press secretary Karoline Levitt announced Friday that President Donald Trump would be implementing 25% tariffs on Mexican and Canadian goods and a 10% tariff on all Chinese imports on Saturday. Consumers told VOA they were bracing for the possible impact of increased costs. 'I’m concerned about rising prices,' Yon Bui, a student of music and computer science at Middlebury College in Vermont, said in an interview Thursday. Bui said that while it might still be too early to tell what the impact could be, she has been considering purchasing costly items, such as expensive cosmetics that she buys sometimes, from China. She also said she needed a new phone. Bui said she would 'buy products now before they go up in price to a point where they’d become unaffordable.' Sean Liu, who lives in Virginia, told VOA that he was glad he'd recently decided to buy a new phone and car. 'With things that are already really expensive, if you add another 10% to their price – it's not like, say, buying a thermos and adding another 10% – this kind of price hike is truly big,' he said. He did add, though, that it might be a little easier to deal with if the tariffs came alongside lower prices for more basic necessities like groceries and gas. ‘One very big power’ On the campaign trail, Trump threatened tariffs as high as 60% on China. Since taking office, those threats have expanded and include everything from a universal tariff to threats against trade partners and rivals such as China and Russia. Last week, Trump threatened Colombia with tariffs of 25% to 50% to get Bogota to accept deportation flights. On China, Trump recently told Fox News’ Sean Hannity that tariffs were the 'one very big power' the U.S. has over China. 'They don't want them, and I'd rather not have to use it,' Trump said. The 10% tariff on all Chinese imports is part of what Trump says is a punitive response to China’s role in manufacturing precursor chemicals essential to fentanyl production in Mexico. Currently, the United States targets China with a 100% tariff on electric vehicles, a 50% tariff on solar cells and semiconductors, a 25% tariff on critical minerals needed to make certain advanced batteries and a 25% tariff on steel and aluminum. New tariffs would build on more than $300 billion worth of taxes on Chinese imports that Trump imposed during his first term. Those tariffs were upheld and, in some cases, advanced under former President Joe Biden. Who will feel impact? Some analysts question who will be hurt if these tariffs are implemented. Some say the deep economic ties between China and the United States could mean that American consumers will be the ones bearing the brunt of Trump’s punishment on Beijing. Supporters, however, see the move as a fulfillment of Trump’s promise to put American lives and livelihoods first — particularly when it comes to stopping the flow of fentanyl into the country. According to William Reinsch, senior adviser of the economics program and Scholl Chair in International Business at the Center for Strategic and International Studies, the tariff likely would raise prices of goods in America. 'The prices on a lot of things that people buy at retail — apparel, footwear, household goods – things like that will be affected. Ten percent is not huge, but it's not zero either,' Reinsch said. Costs and benefits Trump has pushed back against the argument that tariffs drive inflation higher and said instead that tariffs would make America rich. Liu Longzhu, a California lawyer and delegate at the 2024 Republican National Convention, sees tariffs as the key to recovering America’s economic strength. 'The main purpose of increasing tariffs is to assure that America is truly ‘America First’ and protect American jobs. If you are looking for a job, they are beneficial to you. If the tariffs are increased, Chinese products will lose their competitiveness, and American products will become more competitive. This will make it easier for Americans to find jobs,' Liu said. James Galbraith, an economist at the University of Texas at Austin, doesn’t see tariffs as inherently inflationary, and he agrees that tariffs would bring back jobs that were lost to overseas companies. 'A tariff strategy can be implemented in such a way that the cost largely falls outside of the country,' Galbraith told VOA. But Stephen Lamar, president and CEO at the American Apparel & Footwear Association, said that tariffs, especially those levied on China, will ultimately raise the cost of both domestic and foreign goods given the interconnectivity of global economies. 'The theory on paper is that you're giving domestic producers an advantage. The reality in practice is that more people are paying higher prices for products, regardless of their source,' Lamar told VOA. Reinsch also cast doubt on the ability of tariffs to bring manufacturing jobs back to America, particularly in labor-intensive sectors like apparel or footwear. 'I would be surprised if you see a renaissance in the American apparel industry as a result of a 10% tariff. It would take a lot more than that,' Reinsch said, adding that tariffs don’t guarantee a move away from imports and toward domestic manufacturing. Importers looking for cheap products can still source from countries in Southeast Asia or Africa that provide competitive, low-cost alternatives to Chinese products.	https://www.voanews.com/a/consumers-brace-for-impact-of-china-tariffs/7958898.html	2025-01-31T15:03:45-08:00	
Venezuela calls Rubio 'enemy' over US recognition of Guyana's territorial integrity	The territory in question has been under Guyana’s control for more than a century, and it is Venezuela that has failed to maintain its own obligations to law and peace.	https://www.voanews.com/a/venezuela-calls-rubio-enemy-over-us-recognition-of-guyana-s-territorial-integrity/7958873.html	2025-01-31T14:11:58-08:00	
US deportations to China continue amid shifts in immigration crackdown	The Trump administration has confirmed that the deportation of Chinese nationals is still underway as part of a broader effort to enforce U.S. immigration laws. In an emailed response to VOA this week, a U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement official wrote that the agency is removing from the United States any immigrant who is here unlawfully. 'ICE continues to conduct removals to the People’s Republic of China. Due to operational security, ICE does not confirm future removal operations until deportees have been returned to their country of origin,' the ICE official said Tuesday, speaking on background, a method often used by U.S. officials to remain anonymous. VOA requested the most recent removal numbers for China and an update on deportation flights, but as of Friday, ICE had yet to respond. Deportations have increased as China signals a greater willingness to repatriate its citizens, a departure from its historically restrictive stance. Large repatriation flights resumed last June, the first since 2018. On Jan. 6, the U.S. Department of Homeland Security, through ICE, conducted the Biden administration’s fifth removal flight to China in less than seven months. 'These [Biden administration] flights were the product of sustained cooperation between the Department and PRC counterparts to repatriate individuals who have not established a legal basis to remain in the United States,' DHS said in a statement on Jan. 10. Fast-track deportations Under the Trump administration, the approach is shifting toward making deportations faster and bypassing judicial review. The Trump administration issued an executive order on Jan. 21 to expand expedited removal, also known as fast-track deportations, to include immigrants who cannot prove they have been continuously living in the United States for more than two years. 'The effect of this change will be to enhance national security and public safety — while reducing government costs — by facilitating prompt immigration determinations,' the notice read. Expedited removal allows the U.S. government to quickly deport people who are undocumented. Under the process of expedited removal, some noncitizens can be deported in a single day without an immigration court hearing or other appearance before a judge. ICE data from November showed 37,908 Chinese nationals who were believed to be removable from the United States but had not yet been detained. December and January numbers are not yet available. On Jan. 22, the American Civil Liberties Union sued the Trump administration over the expansion of expedited removal. The ACLU argued in court documents that the new rule violates federal law and the Fifth Amendment's due process clause by effectively eliminating full court hearings that immigrants are entitled to receive. The organization also cited studies indicating that expedited removals are prone to errors, often leading to the mistaken deportation of immigrants. Joanna Derman, a program director at Asian Americans Advancing Justice, told VOA that advocates are worried the Trump administration will use 'extreme options' to specifically target Chinese nationals for deportation, 'especially in the event of a significant escalation between the United States and China.' 'But on the other hand,' she said, 'we're also rapidly mobilizing right now. … We are uplifting resources for people who are the most likely to be impacted. The most vulnerable folks need to know what to do if [or] when ICE shows up at their school, their work or their place of worship.' US-China repatriation cooperation For years, China has been among the countries that refused or delayed accepting deportees, complicating U.S. efforts to remove individuals with final orders. Countries that do not negotiate or refuse to accept their nationals back are deemed 'recalcitrant' or 'uncooperative.' Recalcitrant countries do not accept their nationals back. Uncooperative countries will accept some of their nationals back. According to an ICE official and a DHS removal operations document, 15 countries were deemed to be uncooperative: Bhutan, Burma, Cuba, Democratic Republic of the Congo, Eritrea, Ethiopia, Hong Kong, India, Iran, Laos, Pakistan, the People’s Republic of China, Russia, Somalia and Venezuela. ICE considers these to be at risk of recalcitrant: Bosnia-Herzegovina, Burkina Faso, Cambodia, Gabon, Gambia, Iraq, Jamaica, Nicaragua, South Sudan, St. Lucia and Vietnam. During a Monday press conference, Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesperson Mao Ning was asked if Beijing intended to accept all Chinese nationals in the U.S. illegally. 'I’d refer you to competent authorities for anything specific,' she said. 'Let me say more broadly that the Chinese government firmly opposes any form of illegal migration. We have conducted practical cooperation with the migration and law enforcement departments of the U.S. and other countries, which has been productive. As far as repatriation is concerned, China’s principle is to receive the repatriates who are confirmed as Chinese nationals from the Chinese mainland after verification.' ICE’s deportation numbers reflect U.S. diplomatic efforts with China, with DHS reporting the removal of 109 Chinese nationals on the latest charter flight as of November, following 131 deportations in October and 116 in June. According to DHS, the Biden administration’s increase in deportations matches China’s work to decrease illegal immigration, which has led to a 62% decline in Chinese migrant apprehensions at the U.S.-Mexico border. Apprehensions of Chinese dropped from 2,198 encounters in June 2024 to 873 in December 2024. January numbers are not yet available. Deportation logistics, cost An ICE official confirmed to VOA by email in late December that the U.S. government buys the commercial airline tickets for deportees, working closely with a travel service provider to book the most cost-effective flights. ICE determines whether to use charter or commercial flights based on operational needs. ICE did not share cost per person for either type of flight. But the American Immigration Council estimates that removing 1 million people a year would cost U.S. taxpayers about $88 billion, with the total over a decade approaching $1 trillion. Despite Beijing’s increased cooperation, China remains one of several nations that usually refuse to take back their citizens or delay repatriations. During the 2024 fiscal year, ICE removed 517 Chinese nationals from the United States. Deportation process In immigration court, deportation orders are usually issued after a foreign national violates the terms of a visa, is found to be undocumented or is convicted of a crime. When the United States seeks to deport an immigrant, it generally follows a framework negotiated with the other nation; these frameworks are often detailed in writing, through a memorandum of understanding. Before the United States can deport someone, the other country must agree to receive the deportee. There must also be an administratively final order of removal, or deportation order, and the individual must have a travel document issued by a foreign government.	https://www.voanews.com/a/us-deportations-to-china-continue-amid-shifts-in-immigration-crackdown/7958862.html	2025-01-31T14:06:33-08:00	
RFK Jr. vows to stop collecting from vaccine lawsuit if confirmed to Cabinet	WASHINGTON — Facing intense scrutiny from U.S. senators over his potential profit from vaccine lawsuits while serving as the nation's health secretary, Robert F. Kennedy Jr. said that if he is confirmed he will not collect fees from litigation against the drugmakers of a cervical cancer vaccine. Kennedy, who's President Donald Trump's pick to lead the U.S. Health and Human Services agency, told the Senate finance committee that he would amend his ethics disclosure after several senators, including Democrat Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts, and his cousin Caroline Kennedy raised concerns about his financial arrangement with the law firm representing patients who are claiming injuries from the vaccines. 'An amendment to my Ethics Agreement is in process, and it provides that I will divest my interest in this litigation,' Kennedy said in a written response to the committee. Initially, Kennedy had told the committee that he would continue to accept referral fees in legal cases that don't involve the U.S. government. That included an arrangement with a law firm that's sued Merck over Gardasil, its human papillomavirus vaccine that prevents cervical cancer. The deal earned Kennedy $850,000 last year, and he told senators he had referred hundreds of clients to the firm. During Wednesday's hearing, Warren outlined several ways in which Kennedy could make it easier to sue vaccine manufacturers. 'Kennedy can kill off access to vaccines and make millions of dollars while he does it,' Warren said. 'Kids might die, but Robert Kennedy can keep cashing in.' The issue also may have been a concern for Senator Bill Cassidy, a Louisiana Republican who is also a physician and is conflicted over his vote on Kennedy's confirmation because of Kennedy's anti-vaccine views. The Republican president's nominee is 'financially vested in finding fault with vaccines,' Cassidy, the chair of the health committee, noted as he ended Thursday's confirmation hearing. Kennedy also stopped short of making other commitments, refusing to promise that he would not engage in lobbying Health and Human Services after his term ends. Kennedy and his supporters have railed against that sort of activity, saying the 'revolving door' of Washington — where federal officials trade public service jobs to influence government agencies while in the private sector — has undermined the U.S. public health system. He has criticized the practice at least a half-dozen times in social media posts over recent years. Kennedy, who ran for president last year before dropping his bid and endorsing Trump, vowed in one post on social media platform X to 'rein in lobbyists and slam shut the revolving door,' if elected president. He first challenged President Joe Biden for the 2024 Democratic presidential nomination but then ran as an independent before striking a deal to endorse Trump in exchange for a promise to serve in a health policy role during a second Trump administration. Now, after two days of hearings, his shot at that job is on the line with concerns about his anti-vaccine advocacy prompting nearly all Democrats to reject his nomination and a handful of Republicans who are at least considering doing the same. If Democrats unanimously oppose Kennedy, he'll need support from all but three Republicans. The Senate finance committee is expected to decide if he makes it to the Senate floor for a vote next week. Kennedy's response to the Senate committee was first reported by The New York Times.	https://www.voanews.com/a/rfk-jr-vows-to-stop-collecting-from-vaccine-lawsuit-if-confirmed-to-cabinet/7958807.html	2025-01-31T13:24:43-08:00	
Uganda health officials warn of Ebola outbreak	KAMPALA, UGANDA — A day after Uganda's Ministry of Health announced a new Ebola outbreak in the capital, Kampala, most Ugandans appeared unaware or unconcerned about the outbreak and went about their business normally. But health authorities are warning Ugandans not to take Ebola lightly. For weeks, Uganda has battled an outbreak of mpox, also known as monkeypox, that has affected more than 2,000 people and caused 13 deaths, according to the World Health Organization. But Dr. Julius Lutwama, deputy director of the Uganda Virus Research Institute, said Ugandans need to worry more about Ebola than mpox. 'Ebola is more highly infectious even than monkeypox,' Lutwama said. 'And it is even a more severe infection than monkeypox. The percentage of people that end up dead from Ebola is up to 80% while for monkeypox it is below 5%.' Ebola killed more than 50 people in Uganda during the 2022 outbreak. Nurse dies of Ebola On Thursday, Dr. Diana Atwine, Uganda's permanent secretary in the Ministry of Health, announced the new outbreak after a 32-year-old nurse died from the disease. Atwine said the nurse sought treatment at multiple health facilities including Mulago National Referral Hospital and from a traditional healer. The patient suffered with high fever, chest pain and difficulty breathing since Jan. 20, then unexplained bleeding and multiple organ failure before dying Wednesday. Atwine said the nurse died from the Sudan strain of Ebola. 'We will leave it to God' While the Ministry of Health is cautioning the public with reminders of the symptoms of Ebola, several Kampala residents who spoke to VOA said they had not heard about or were not worried about the outbreak. Kampala resident Ntale Steven said he is not going to shut down his business. 'We will leave it to God, so the disease doesn't spread,' he said. 'And if there's an outbreak, we should get treatment and be helped. Health workers should also care for whoever gets infected. Because we have nothing to do, we must move.' Health authorities have moved to quarantine those who had contact with the deceased Ebola victim. Out of the 44 people in isolation, 30 are health workers from the National Referral Hospital. The rest are family members and health workers from other private facilities. Lutwama said because it takes days before symptoms start to show, this is when most infected persons transmit the disease to others, placing health workers at a higher risk. 'Many people then can transmit it during that period, before they come to that stage of bleeding,' said Lutwama. 'But still the health workers are supposed to be on the lookout. And they are also supposed to be protected, but as you know, sometimes our hospitals are missing a few things like gloves, they don't have hypochlorite like Jik [bleach] to be able to wash their hands thoroughly and things like that.' Even with warnings from Lutwama and the Ministry of Health, Ogwang John, a security guard, said he will take precautions only if he gets an order from his boss. 'Me, I'm not worried,' he said. 'I always go with the decision of my boss. When he says that we do this, the disease is there, yes, we can take. But if he has not talked with me, I'm also a carefree man.' The Ministry of Health said it will continue tracing contacts and monitoring those under isolation as they await more support from the World Health Organization's contingency fund for emergencies.	https://www.voanews.com/a/uganda-health-officials-warn-of-ebola-outbreak/7958749.html	2025-01-31T12:30:17-08:00	
Lake Chad governors pledge stronger security, economic cooperation	ABUJA, NIGERIA — Leaders in Africa’s conflict-hit Lake Chad region have promised to fight illegal gun and drug trafficking, which were part of the discussions during their three-day gathering focused on stabilization, sustainability and development. The governors of Nigeria, Cameroon, Niger and Chad have concluded an annual Lake Chad Basin Governors' Forum summit in Nigeria’s northeastern Borno State with local officials, traditional leaders, civil society groups and humanitarian partners also in attendance. This year's summit, the fifth since its inception in 2018, was hosted by Nigeria’s Yobe State. During the meeting, authorities praised ongoing joint efforts against terror groups, including Boko Haram and its offshoot ISWAP, in the region and pledged to intensify efforts to eliminate the remnants. ISWAP stands for the Islamic State in West Africa Province. The governors also resolved to combat illicit arms trade and drug trafficking while enhancing resilience initiatives to mitigate climate change and rehabilitate displaced populations. Ambassador Mamman Nuhu, executive secretary of the Lake Chad Basin Commission (LCBC), said discussions over the three days were 'fruitful and robust.' 'This gathering has reaffirmed our shared commitment to sustainable peace, regional stability and the prosperity of the community we serve,' Nuhu said. The Lake Chad governors also pledged to establish free-trade zones to foster economic recovery and integrate more women and youth into stabilization and resilience programs. But officials raised concerns over the suspension of support for Niger’s National Window of the Regional Stabilization Facility (RSF), warning it could hinder regional progress. Lake Chad, a vast but shallow body of water surrounded by Nigeria, Chad, Cameroon and Niger, provides livelihoods for millions through agriculture. However, decades of climate change and poor water management have caused the lake’s surface area to shrink by an alarming 90%, increasing competition for scarce resources. In recent years, Islamist militant groups have exploited the instability, using the region as a recruitment ground. Matthias Naab, director of the Regional Service Center for Africa at the United Nations Development Program, said participants at the community level added a great deal to the forum. 'The richness of the engagements in the pre-forums with civil society organizations and traditional leaders has been a highlight of this forum,' Naab said. 'Their perspectives grounded in community realities and have strengthened our dialogue and reinforced the principle that stabilize, resilience and recovery must be shaped by the voices of those most affected.' The governors' forum also emphasized the need to rehabilitate and reintegrate former fighters and called for member state support and collaboration with traditional leaders. The forum elected Nigeria’s Yobe State governor, Mai Mala Buni, as its new chair.	https://www.voanews.com/a/lake-chad-governors-pledge-stronger-security-economic-cooperation/7958773.html	2025-01-31T12:24:57-08:00	
War in Ukraine through the eyes of an artist	After Russia’s full-scale invasion of Ukraine, artist and illustrator George Butler traveled to the war-torn country to paint scenes of modern wartime life.

Tariffs on goods from Canada, Mexico, China start Saturday	WASHINGTON — U.S. President Donald Trump will put in place 25% tariffs on imports from Canada and Mexico and 10% tariffs on goods from China effective on Saturday, the White House said on Friday, but it provided no word on whether there would be any exemptions to the measures that could result in swift price increases to U.S. consumers. Trump, a Republican, had been threatening the tariffs to ensure greater cooperation from the countries on stopping illegal immigration and the smuggling of chemicals used for fentanyl, but he also has pledged to use tariffs to boost domestic manufacturing. 'Starting tomorrow, those tariffs will be in place,' White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt told reporters. 'These are promises made and promises kept by the president.' Trump had said he was weighing issuing an exemption for Canadian and Mexican oil imports, but Leavitt said she had no information to share on the president's decision on any potential carveouts. The United States imported almost 4.6 million barrels of oil daily from Canada in October and 563,000 barrels from Mexico, according to the Energy Information Administration. U.S. daily production during that month averaged nearly 13.5 million barrels a day. He has previously stated that a 10% tariff on Chinese imports would be on top of other import taxes charged on products from the country.	https://www.voanews.com/a/tariffs-on-goods-from-canada-mexico-china-start-saturday-/7958695.html	2025-01-31T11:39:00-08:00	
More than 40 bodies recovered from Washington midair collision	Fire and emergency service officials in Washington said Friday that more than 40 bodies have been recovered from the wreckage of a commercial passenger jet and military helicopter that collided and crashed into the Potomac River late Wednesday. Operations to recover the bodies of 67 people killed in the collision resumed at dawn Friday. The National Transportation Safety Board — or NTSB, the federal agency leading the investigation into the accident — reportedly is at the scene along with local and regional EMS crews. The commercial jet, a Bombardier CRJ700 regional craft operated by American Airlines subsidiary PSA Airlines, carried 64 passengers and crew, while the U.S. Army UH-60 Black Hawk helicopter carried a crew of three. Officials said there were no survivors. The NTSB reported late Thursday the cockpit voice recorder and flight-data recorder from the airliner, devices often referred to as black boxes, have been recovered and are at the agency’s labs for evaluation. In an interview Friday with U.S.-based Fox News network, U.S. Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth said that the 'black box' for the helicopter had not yet been recovered, but that its data will likely determine who was piloting the helicopter at the time of the crash. Hegseth on Thursday said the crew, which was conducting a night-flight training evaluation, included a staff sergeant, a captain-in-training and a chief warrant officer, who was an instructor. The crew had been issued night vision goggles for the flight, but Hegseth said it was unclear if they were using them. The defense secretary also said Thursday that the helicopter’s altitude at the time of the accident was under investigation. The two aircraft collided as the passenger jet was attempting to land at Reagan National Airport. Hegseth said the flight voice and flight data recorders also could determine who was in communication with the airport’s air traffic control tower and if there was any confusion regarding the instructions they received. Citing a government report, The Washington Post said Thursday that the control tower was understaffed Wednesday night. The report said two people were handling the jobs of four inside the tower at the time of the collision. A similar report from U.S. broadcaster NBC News, citing a source familiar with the investigation, said a supervisor in the tower let an air traffic controller leave their shift early before the collision. That decision, the report said, left one controller to handle airplane traffic and helicopter traffic in the area, whereas typically there is one controller looking at each type of aircraft. The NBC report said it is allowable under Federal Aviation Administration standards for one person to do both jobs, although it is not considered optimal. The agency on Friday significantly restricted helicopter traffic in the immediate vicinity of Washington Reagan National Airport until further notice. At a news conference Thursday, both U.S. Senators Tim Kaine and Mark Warner from Virginian said they had expressed concerns over the years regarding the high volume of air traffic in the Washington area, but they would await results from the accident probe before revisiting that specific concern. During a White House news conference Thursday, President Donald Trump suggested previous presidential administrations, led by Democratic Presidents Barack Obama and Joe Biden, lowered standards for the hiring of air traffic controllers and blamed diversity, equity and inclusion, or DEI, initiatives in the federal government for that. He said he reversed those initiatives with executive orders last week. The U.S. Figure Skating organization said several members of its community, including athletes, coaches and family members, were among the passengers on the plane. 'We are devastated by this unspeakable tragedy and hold the victims' families closely in our hearts,' the organization said. The Kremlin and Russian media said Russian figure skaters, including world champion couple Evgenia Shishkova and Vadim Naumov, also were on the plane. Trump said his administration would facilitate the return of their remains to Russia. Wednesday’s crash was the deadliest aviation incident on U.S. soil since 2001, when an American Airlines flight crashed in Belle Harbor, New York, killing 260 people. Some information for this report was provided by The Associated Press, Agence France-Presse and Reuters.	https://www.voanews.com/a/more-than-40-bodies-recovered-from-washington-mid-air-collision/7958629.html	2025-01-31T11:03:21-08:00	
Anger in Greece over rail disaster prompts opposition plan to challenge government	ATHENS — Three Greek opposition parties vowed Friday to challenge the country’s center-right government with a censure motion over its handling of a deadly rail disaster nearly two years ago. The pledge was prompted by mounting public anger over delays in the inquiry and allegations of a cover-up that the government strongly denies. Fifty-seven people were killed — including college students returning from a holiday — when a passenger train collided head-on with a freight train on Feb. 28, 2023, near Tempe in northern Greece. On Sunday, relatives of those killed led protests in dozens of cities, directed at the conservative government of Prime Minister Kyriakos Mitsotakis. Apart from rallies held in Athens, Thessaloniki and other Greek cities, protests were also organized by Greek communities in Amsterdam, Berlin, Brussels and other European cities. Sokratis Famellos, leader of the left-wing Syriza party, said outside parliament that he sided with two other opposition parties, Pasok and the New Left, to seek a no-confidence vote. 'A joint initiative by progressive parties for a censure motion is necessary today. The evidence is there, and society demands accountability,' Famellos said Friday. Although a censure motion is unlikely to pose a direct threat to the government, it could help forge bonds in Greece’s fractured opposition. Lawmakers from the three parties confirmed they were involved in discussions to agree on the timing of the motion. Investigations have faced delays, with critics accusing authorities of obstructing justice. While some railway officials have been charged, no senior political figures have been held accountable, further intensifying public scrutiny. Speaking to ministers at a Cabinet meeting, Mitsotakis vowed to overcome the 'turbulence' facing the government. 'This difficult week comes to a close under the shadow of the Tempe tragedy,' he said in a televised address. 'We are now entering the final stage of investigations into this deeply painful national trauma.' The controversy overshadowed an ongoing parliamentary process to elect a new president. A government-backed candidate, Constantine Tassoulas, failed to win the cross-party support needed to secure the presidency in a second round of voting in parliament Friday. The 65-year-old former speaker of the assembly is expected to win in later rounds scheduled next month when the threshold is lowered.	https://www.voanews.com/a/anger-in-greece-over-rail-disaster-prompts-opposition-plan-to-challenge-government-/7958537.html	2025-01-31T09:53:21-08:00	
US aid freeze spells uncertain future for international media	WASHINGTON — On the front lines of the war in Ukraine, local newspapers are vital lifelines in areas where Russia has destroyed cell towers and internet infrastructure. Journalists provide information about evacuation routes, document alleged Russian war crimes and troop movements, and counter Moscow’s propaganda. Even a temporary freeze of U.S. foreign aid can mean financial difficulties for small media organizations that rely on outside donors to keep working. 'Many Ukrainian media may now face the threat of closure or significant reduction in operations in the coming weeks,' Sergiy Tomilenko, president of the National Union of Journalists of Ukraine, told VOA. Ukraine is not alone. News outlets on the front lines of war and authoritarianism from Ukraine and Belarus to Myanmar are among the organizations affected by a freeze on U.S. foreign aid. President Donald Trump signed an executive order on Jan. 20 mandating all federal government agencies pause all foreign development assistance for 90 days. The directive took effect on Jan. 24 and includes foreign funding from the State Department and the U.S. Agency for International Development, or USAID. A federal judge on Tuesday temporarily blocked a White House directive that ordered a freeze on federal aid programs, but that does not apply to the foreign aid pause. 'Every dollar we spend, every program we fund, and every policy we pursue must be justified with the answer to three simple questions,' Secretary of State Marco Rubio said in a Jan. 26 statement. 'Does it make America safer? Does it make America stronger? Does it make America more prosperous?' Worldwide impact Many independent news outlets around the world rely on State Department and USAID funding because they report in repressive environments, according to the JX Fund, a Berlin-based group that supports exiled media. With the current freeze, news outlets around the world are scrambling to find alternative sources of funding in an attempt to continue delivering the news to their audiences and avoid shutting down, multiple analysts told VOA. 'The general feeling is panic. Panic is the only way to describe the situation,' Karol Luczka, who works in Eastern Europe at the International Press Institute in Vienna, told VOA. JX Fund managing director Penelope Winterhager agreed. These outlets 'are thrown back to emergency mode,' she said. The measure is estimated to be affecting dozens of independent news outlets in more than 30 countries, according to the Brussels-based European Federation of Journalists, or EFJ. Maja Sever, EFJ president, called on potential donors to fill the gap. 'The European Union and other donors cannot abandon to their fate journalists who are the best bulwark for defending the rule of law and democracy in countries where they are under threat,' Sever said in a statement Tuesday. During the 90-day pause, relevant U.S. departments and agencies are required to review their foreign funding and determine whether the aid will continue, be modified or cease altogether, according to the executive order. Neither the State Department nor USAID replied to VOA’s requests for comment. In Ukraine Tomilenko said the aid freeze is creating a dire situation for Ukrainian news outlets on the front line of the war. 'In many areas close to the battle lines, local newspapers are often the only reliable source of information,' said Tomilenko, who is based in Kyiv. Since its full-scale invasion of Ukraine in 2022, Moscow has ramped up global propaganda efforts while further restricting independent media inside Russia. The war has also limited the advertising market in Ukraine, which would ideally be a primary source of financial independence for Ukrainian news outlets, said Tomilenko. The USAID website says it supports programs that 'promote free and independent media' in more than 30 countries. VOA could not determine how much U.S. aid goes to support media outlets in these countries. In the case of Ukraine, Luczka said, 'The previous administration in the U.S. saw the importance of supporting civil society in Ukraine in order to make sure that this country keeps standing.' The United States has been the strongest player when it came to supporting independent media outlets, according to the JX Fund’s Winterhager. But even though these outlets receive foreign funding, Winterhager emphasized that 'their reporting is independent.' In Myanmar Several Myanmar news outlets that rely on financial support from USAID and Internews also find themselves in a precarious situation. Internews is a USAID-affiliated nonprofit that supports independent media. After launching a coup in 2021, Myanmar’s military arrested journalists and banned news outlets. The crackdown forced entire outlets to flee into exile. Some outlets now report from the Thai-Myanmar border, while others manage to operate from rebel-controlled regions of Myanmar. Funding has been among the biggest problems for Myanmar media since the coup. 'It is difficult — or even impossible — for many of them to make commercial revenue in this environment,' Ben Dunant, editor-in-chief of the magazine Frontier Myanmar, told VOA last year. 'This underlines the vulnerability of these media organizations whose operations are dependent on the whims of donors in faraway countries.' Mizzima, one of the most prominent of the country’s news outlets and an affiliate of VOA, is among those affected by the aid freeze, according to local media reports. Founded in exile in 1998, the media outlet covers news on the resistance against the junta and China’s growing influence in the region. Another outlet, Western News, has already cut staff, according to its chief editor, Wunna Khwar Nyo. 'We are struggling to survive,' Wunna Khwar Nyo told VOA. 'Ultimately, this will also hurt the Burmese people.' If the funding freeze forces news outlets to shutter, the IPI’s Luczka warned that state-backed propaganda from countries such as Russia could fill the gap. 'When media outlets disappear, they create a void,' Luczka said. 'And that void needs to be filled by something.' VOA’s Burmese Service contributed to this report.	https://www.voanews.com/a/us-aid-freeze-spells-uncertain-future-for-international-media/7958494.html	2025-01-31T09:51:07-08:00	
Trump envoy Grenell expected to meet Venezuela's Maduro	WASHINGTON — U.S. President Donald Trump's envoy Richard Grenell is expected to meet with Venezuelan President Nicolas Maduro on Friday in Venezuela, according to U.S. Special Envoy for Latin America Mauricio Claver-Carone. Trump said last week his administration likely would stop buying oil from Venezuela and was looking 'very strongly' at the South American country. Grenell, Trump's envoy for special missions, had earlier said he spoke with multiple officials in Venezuela and would begin meetings, days after the outgoing Biden administration imposed new sanctions on the government of Maduro. 'Diplomacy is back,' Grenell said in a post on social media platform X disclosing his initial calls. 'Talking is a tactic.' During his campaign, Trump called Maduro a dictator after he pursued a 'maximum pressure' campaign against him during his first term, from 2017 to 2021, including imposing harsh sanctions on the South American country and its oil industry. Former President Joe Biden briefly rolled back some of the Trump-era restrictions following electoral promises from Maduro but then reinstated them, saying the Venezuelan leader had reneged on pledges for a fair democratic vote. The Financial Times reported Friday that Chevron is trying to protect the special U.S. license allowing it to operate in Venezuela. The oil giant's chief executive, Mike Wirth, told the newspaper the company would engage with the White House after U.S. Secretary of State Marco Rubio said the license should be reconsidered. If Chevron is forced out, China and Russia will gain influence in the OPEC nation, Wirth said. Venezuela's oil exports to the U.S. soared 64% to some 222,000 barrels per day last year, making the United States its second-largest export market behind China, which took 351,000 bpd, down 18% compared with the previous year.	https://www.voanews.com/a/trump-envoy-grenell-expected-to-meet-venezuela-s-maduro/7958410.html	2025-01-31T08:38:16-08:00	
EU: Human rights progress needed to preserve Pakistan's trade privileges	ISLAMABAD — The European Union is linking Pakistan’s access to European trading markets as a duty-free exporter to progress on the country’s 'most pressing' human rights issues. Olof Skoog, the EU’s special human rights envoy, issued a warning Friday following a weeklong visit to the South Asian nation, where authorities have faced increasing accusations of suppressing civil liberties, political dissent, and free speech. 'The trade benefits under [the human rights development plan known as] GSP+ depend on the progress made on addressing a list of issues, including on human rights, and tangible reforms remain essential,' a post-visit EU statement quoted Skoog as saying. He referred to the Generalized Scheme of Preferences Plus, commonly known as GSP+, which grants developing countries, including Pakistan, tariff-free access to the EU market in exchange for its adherence to specific human and labor rights obligations. The EU statement noted that its envoy highlighted areas of concern during meetings with Pakistani leaders, including blasphemy laws, enforced disappearances, freedom of expression, media independence, impunity for rights violations, due process, fair trials, civic space, and the death penalty. 'As we approach the midterm of the current monitoring cycle, we encourage Pakistan to continue on its reform path as it prepares for reapplication under the upcoming new GSP+ regulation,' Skoog stated. The declaration noted that 'Pakistan has become the largest beneficiary of GSP+' since the implementation of the trading plan in 2014, with Pakistani businesses increasing their exports to the EU market by 108%. The EU envoy’s visit coincided with the swift passage of controversial amendments by Pakistan's parliament this week to cybercrime laws that critics warned would curtail freedom of speech, not only for the conventional media but also for social media users. The legislation criminalizes the 'intentional' spread of 'false news' with prison terms of up to three years, a fine of up to $7,100, or both. Pakistani Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif’s coalition government, accused of growing censorship, has defended the law, saying it is necessary to limit the spread of disinformation. Pakistani and international free media advocacy groups, along with human rights activists, have condemned the amended law and are calling for its immediate repeal. The Committee to Protect Journalists said in a statement that the law 'threatens the fundamental rights of Pakistani citizens and journalists while granting the government and security agencies sweeping powers to impose complete control over internet freedom in the country.'	https://www.voanews.com/a/eu-human-rights-progress-needed-to-preserve-pakistan-s-trade-privileges/7958399.html	2025-01-31T08:08:50-08:00	
Many across Africa shocked by 90-day freeze on US aid	NAIROBI, KENYA — Many people across Africa are shocked and worried about the 90-day pause on U.S.-funded foreign aid and a stop-work order on existing grants and contracts worldwide. While the orders have been modified to allow waivers for 'life-saving humanitarian assistance,' many are struggling to assess the implications of U.S. President Donald Trump’s decision. The Trump administration says that the United States spends about $40 billion every year in aid, and that it’s time to review and prioritize America’s core national interest one dollar at a time. Most development and humanitarian assistance is channeled through the U.S. Agency for International Development through various programs, working with individuals, communities, organizations and countries across the globe. In Kenya, while many organizations directly affected are keeping quiet, one employee who spoke on the condition of anonymity said he’s grateful for what American aid has accomplished over the years. 'We've been having success stories,' he said. The employee is among the hundreds who received a stop-work order. He said he is most concerned for the beneficiaries of programs he’s been associated with over the years. 'These are families who were anticipating they could get support. … This will stop. … There are children who are HIV-positive, and we always collaborate with their facilities to ensure that they are viral-suppressed. Now they’ll be of high viral load,' the man said. On Tuesday, the administration issued waivers on 'existing life-saving humanitarian' assistance programs, including 'core life-saving medicine,' which may apply to health programs such as PEPFAR, the U.S. President’s Emergency Plan for AIDS Relief, which works with partners in 55 countries worldwide. One of them is South Africa, where 7.8 million people have HIV/AIDS. Asanda Ngoasheng, an independent political analyst from South Africa, said the nation 'is the biggest beneficiary of the PEPFAR program, and has been for many years. … It will have dire consequences for people in the region because there are some people who come to South Africa to receive some medication. … So, it’s a medical disaster in waiting, effectively, and a humanitarian disaster in waiting.' Addressing a press conference broadcast live on SABC on Wednesday, South African Health Minister Dr. Pakishe Motsoaledi said he hopes withdrawn aid will not affect antiretroviral treatments. 'One thing we want to ascertain is that nobody must stop taking ARVs,' Motsoaledi said. 'That will be devastating. ... When you are on ARVs and you stop, there will be serious trouble.' Through PEPFAR, the U.S. has invested over $110 billion in the global HIV/AIDS response, saving over 25 million lives and preventing millions of HIV infections since it was established more than two decades ago by President George W. Bush, according to U.S. State Department data. There are other programs that can’t afford a funding break, said Dr. Akila Udoji, manager of Karu Primary Healthcare Center, a Nigerian facility sponsored by USAID. 'Tuberculosis diagnosis treatment, if that funding is cut off, it will greatly affect the program because there won’t be any diagnosis of such cases and then the medicines, people can’t afford them,' Udoji said. 'And if they can’t afford it, it will lead to serious outbreaks of these diseases.' The U.S. Global Leadership Coalition, an advocacy group, welcomed the administration’s review of foreign assistance programs in a statement but expressed some concerns. Former commander of U.S. Central Command Anthony Zinni, who is co-chair of the council of nearly 270 retired admirals and generals, warned that the freeze 'takes the U.S. off the playing field' and could directly affect U.S. military operations overseas. VOA requested interviews with the USAID offices in Kenya, Nigeria and the U.S. but did not receive replies. Meanwhile, the 90-day freeze is already paying dividends, a statement released by the U.S. State Department said this week. It said the review has already prevented over $1 billion in spending not aligned with the administration’s 'America First' agenda, including programs providing certain contraceptive, climate justice, clean energy and abortion programs and services. VOA’s Kate Bartlett in South Africa and Timothy Obiezu in Nigeria contributed to this report.	https://www.voanews.com/a/many-across-africa-shocked-by-90-day-freeze-on-us-aid/7958378.html	2025-01-31T08:07:46-08:00

Hamas announces names of hostages to be released Saturday	The militant group Hamas has announced — and Israel has confirmed — the identity of the next three hostages to be released Saturday in the fourth such exchange between the sides under a ceasefire agreement to halt more than 15 months of fighting in Gaza. The hostages include Yarden Bibas, 35, who was taken from Kibbutz Nir Oz during the Oct. 7, 2023, Hamas terror attack on Israel along with his wife, Shiri, and two young boys, Ariel and Kfir. The fate of his family is uncertain. Also to be released is U.S.-Israeli citizen Keith Siegel, 65, originally from Chapel Hill, North Carolina, who was taken hostage from Kibbutz Kfar Aza along with his wife, Aviva Siegel. Aviva Siegel was released during a brief ceasefire in November 2023. The third hostage was identified as Ofer Kalderon, 54, a French-Israeli hostage, who was captured by the militants from Kibbutz Nir Oz along with his two children. His ex-wife, Hadas, also was taken captive. The two children and Hadas Kalderon were released during the 2023 hostage exchange. Hamas has been designated as a terror group by the U.S., Britain and other Western nations. Hamas released eight hostages, including three Israelis and five Thai nationals, on Thursday. Later in the day, Israel released 110 Palestinian prisoners, including 32 serving life sentences for deadly attacks on Israelis. Under the ceasefire deal, more than 423,000 Palestinians have returned to northern Gaza. The Israeli military ordered them out of the territory in the earliest stages of the Israel-Hamas war in October 2023. At a news conference Friday in Geneva, the U.N.’s World Food Program, WFP, provided an update on efforts to deliver humanitarian aid to Gaza. Country Director Antoine Renard told reporters the agency has delivered more than 32,000 metric tons of food into Gaza since the ceasefire agreement began on Jan. 19. He said that amount was more than twice what was delivered in December and three times what was delivered in October. Renard said the WFP has already reached 300,000 people. Meanwhile, during a visit to Lebanon Friday, Egypt’s foreign affairs minister, Badr Abdelatty, called for a full withdrawal of Israeli troops from southern Lebanon. Following talks with Lebanese President Joseph Aoun, Abdelatty told reporters, 'Egypt is very keen on confirming the need for a full and complete Israeli withdrawal from southern Lebanon, without taking away a single inch of Lebanese sovereignty and territory.' Under a U.S.-brokered ceasefire deal announced Nov. 27, Israeli forces were to withdraw from southern Lebanon, and the militant group Hezbollah was to move north of the Litani River by Jan. 26. Israeli forces have remained in more than a dozen villages past the deadline. The United States and Lebanon announced Sunday the deadline to meet the ceasefire terms had been extended to Feb. 18. Since the ceasefire began, Israel has conducted near-daily operations in southern Lebanon, including airstrikes and shelling. They accuse Hezbollah of violating ceasefire terms by attempting to move weapons. In statements posted to its social media accounts, the Israel Defense Forces, or IDF, reported overnight Thursday its fighter jets launched several attacks against what it said were Hezbollah terrorist organization targets in Lebanon’s Bekaa region, which it said 'posed a threat to the Israeli home front and IDF forces.' The IDF statement said the targets included a military site 'with underground infrastructure for the development and production of weapons and transit infrastructure on the Syrian-Lebanon border' through which, the IDF said, Hezbollah was trying to transfer weapons. The IDF also reported the Israeli air force intercepted a Hezbollah reconnaissance drone over Israeli territory Thursday, which it said violates the ceasefire agreement. 'The IDF continues to be committed to the understandings reached regarding the ceasefire in Lebanon,' its statement said, 'and will not allow the execution of terrorist plots of this type.' Some information for this story was provided by The Associated Press, Agence France-Presse and Reuters.	https://www.voanews.com/a/hamas-announces-names-of-hostages-to-be-released-saturday-/7958346.html	2025-01-31T07:32:20-08:00	
Rubio warns of China’s potential to block Panama Canal in conflict	WASHINGTON — U.S. Secretary of State Marco Rubio is set to embark on his first official trip as the nation’s top diplomat on Saturday, with planned visits to Panama, El Salvador, Costa Rica, Guatemala and the Dominican Republic from Saturday to Thursday. Officials and experts say the visit is partly aimed at countering China’s growing influence in the region. The trip comes as President Donald Trump pushes to regain control of the Panama Canal, and as Washington intensifies efforts to curb illegal migration. 'Secretary Rubio’s engagements with senior officials and business leaders will promote regional cooperation on our core, shared interests: Stopping illegal and large-scale migration, fighting the scourge of transnational criminal organizations and drug traffickers, countering China, and deepening economic partnerships to enhance prosperity in our hemisphere,' State Department spokesperson Tammy Bruce said in a statement on Friday. Trump has asserted that China controls the Panama Canal, a crucial trade route linking the Atlantic and Pacific. But Panama has denied the claim, insisting that it manages the canal impartially for all maritime traffic. On Thursday, Rubio warned that China could potentially block access to the canal in the event of a conflict. 'If the government in China in a conflict tells them to shut down the Panama Canal, they will have to. And in fact, I have zero doubt that they have contingency planning to do so. That is a direct threat,' Rubio said during an interview with SiriusXM Radio. In Panama City, Panamanian President Jose Raul Mulino ruled out any discussion of control over the canal with Rubio. 'I cannot negotiate and much less open a process of negotiation on the canal,' he told reporters on Thursday. 'That is sealed. The canal belongs to Panama.' Some analysts caution that China has been employing economic and noneconomic tactics across the Western Hemisphere to expand its influence, prompting national security concerns. 'You might think that you are just getting more Chinese investment in your country, but pretty soon you are kind of being coerced or coaxed into signing at the Belt and Road Initiative, or you're being coaxed into signing another deal that gives elements of your telecoms,' said Ryan Berg, director of the Americas Program at the Center for Strategic and International Studies, during an online discussion Thursday. The Belt and Road Initiative, or BRI, is a massive infrastructure project launched by China in 2013 under President Xi Jinping, aiming to connect multiple continents through land and maritime routes. The United States has cautioned that the BRI 'is fueled by China's mission to manipulate and undermine the global rules-based trading system for its own benefit.' China’s foreign direct investment, or FDI, in Latin America and the Caribbean has grown significantly, Berg said, citing approximately $160 billion in Chinese FDI over the past 15 years. 'From the lens of national security, a lot of China's commercial endeavors are fundamentally military ambitions that they're prepositioning into Latin America,' said Joseph Humire, executive director of the Center for a Secure Free Society, or SFS, a national security think tank. 'China's been in Panama for more than 20 years, but China really got politically active in Panama after 2017,' when Panama signed the BRI and shifted its diplomatic recognition from Taiwan to the People’s Republic of China, said Humire on Thursday. He said that Panama's economy has declined in recent years. All the nations on Rubio’s itinerary maintain diplomatic ties with Cuba and Venezuela. Given the strained U.S. relations with these countries and their restrictions on accepting deportees, Rubio may use his trip to advocate for 'third-country' agreements, allowing other nations to receive people deported by the U.S. Additionally, he could work on facilitating increased repatriation flights for migrants.	https://www.voanews.com/a/rubio-warns-of-china-s-potential-to-block-panama-canal-in-conflict/7958272.html	2025-01-31T06:46:15-08:00	
Serbian student protesters march ahead of bridge blockade as driver rams Belgrade demonstration	INDJIJA, Serbia — Hundreds of striking students marched through the Serbian countryside Friday as they took their anti-graft protest toward the northern city of Novi Sad, where they plan to blockade three bridges over the River Danube this weekend. The bridge blockade planned for Saturday will mark three months since a huge concrete construction at the railway station collapsed in Novi said on Nov. 1, leaving 15 people dead. What started two months ago as a protest against suspected corruption in construction contracts has developed into the most serious challenge in years to the country’s powerful populist leader, President Aleksandar Vucic. Meanwhile in Belgrade, a driver rammed a car into a silent protest Friday, injuring two women who work as doctors at a nearby psychiatric institution. Media reports say both hit the pavement with their heads and are being examined. The incident, the third of its kind in weeks, happened in downtown Belgrade during 15 minutes of silence observed daily throughout Serbia at around noon when the canopy collapsed at the railway station in Novi Sad. Pro-government thugs have repeatedly attacked the protesters, many of them students, twice ramming cars into demonstrations. Two people were seriously injured in the previous attacks. Along the way to Novi Sad on Friday, the students were greeted by cheering citizens who honked their car horns or came out of their homes to offer food and drinks. When they reached the town of Indjija on Thursday, roughly halfway along their 80-kilometer route, the students were welcomed with fireworks and cheers from residents. Although most of them spent the night out in the open in a soccer field, the freezing temperatures did not dampen their desire for major changes in the corruption-ridden Balkan state. Nevena Vecerinac, a student, said she hoped the protesters' demands that include the punishment of all those responsible for the rail station tragedy will be fulfilled. 'We will make it to Novi Sad,' she said. 'Yesterday’s walk was easy. It’s cold now, but we can make it. We all have the same goal.' 'We need support from all people. With this energy and mood, I hope we can do it, otherwise there will be no brighter future,' said Luka Arsenovic, another student marcher. Many in Serbia believe that the collapse of the overhang at the train station was essentially caused by government corruption in a large infrastructure project with Chinese state companies. Critics believe graft led to a sloppy job during the reconstruction of the Novi Sad train station, poor oversight and disrespect of existing safety regulations. Monthslong demonstrations have already forced the resignation of Serbia’s prime minister Milos Vucevic this week, along with various concessions from authorities which were ignored by the protesters who say that is not enough. Vucic and other officials have shifted from accusing the students of working with foreign powers to oust him, to offering concessions or issuing veiled threats. The strength and determination of the protesters have caught many by surprise in a country where hundreds of thousands of young people have emigrated, looking for opportunities elsewhere.	https://www.voanews.com/a/serbian-student-protesters-march-ahead-of-bridge-blockade-as-driver-rams-belgrade-demonstration-/7958279.html	2025-01-31T06:36:55-08:00	
Chad officials say French troops have finally left after 70 years’ presence	YAOUNDE — Chadian President Mahamat Idriss Deby said Chad's military is ready to protect the country from any destabilization attempt as a January 31 deadline loomed for France to withdraw its troops. The last French troops left the N'djamena military base they occupied for about 70 years this week, continuing France’s reduced military presence in West Africa. Chad's President Field Marshal Mahamat Idriss Deby says this week’s departure of the last French troops from the central African state signals a new dawn for Chad. Deby spoke at the Sergeant Adji Kossei Military Base in Chad's capital, N'djamena, Friday, during a ceremony to mark the complete withdrawal of French troops before the January 31 deadline he gave Paris to pull out its troops. The event, broadcast on state radio and TV, was attended by top military officials, government ministers, traditional rulers, diplomats and huge crowds of onlookers. Twenty-six-year-old teacher Balkange Jean spoke to VOA via a messaging app from N'djamena Friday. He said he was delighted to see French troops leaving. He said he does not understand why it took a long time for Chad’s government officials to order French troops out. He says French troops were only useful in Chad from June 1983 to December 1984, when France sent close to 4,000 troops to stop an invasion by Libyan military and Chad rebels. French troops officially arrived in N'djamena to train the country’s young military during independence in 1960. Deby said the forces remained, claiming France wanted to support Chad's air force against rebels. It stationed troops in N'djamena claiming it was helping Mali, Burkina Faso and Niger to fight militant groups and terrorists operating within Sahel states. State TV reports that the last French military planes and fighter aircraft left Chad Friday after handing over France's last military base in a military ceremony in N'Djamena Thursday. Chad announced an end to military cooperation with France November 28. On December 10, several hundred of the more than 1,000 French troops began leaving, but on December 31, Deby ordered the troops to leave his country by January 31. General Pascal Ianni, the commander of French forces in Africa, speaking on Chad state TV on Friday, said the withdrawal of French troops from several African countries, including Chad, enables France to adapt itself to a revolution that Africa and the world is facing. He said France has to reinvent its military ties in Africa, where dynamic and younger leaders are affecting several changes and bringing hope to their citizens. French troops were also ordered out of the West African nations of Niger, Burkina Faso and Mali following coups in the countries. Last year, Senegal said it was negotiating the withdrawal of French forces before December of this year. Djelassem Maïbé Adolphe is a former member of Chad’s Movement for Peace, Reconstruction and Development, a former rebel group. He was granted amnesty and freed from prison by Deby in August. He said many leaders in French-speaking African states with young leaders tend to turn to Russia for military assistance because of growing anti-French sentiments. He said African countries should make sure they individually and collectively have strong militaries to protect their territories instead of thinking that they can always count on external support. Chad, Mali, Burkina Faso and Niger have shifted toward Russia by signing military deals and inviting Russian troops to train Africa militaries. Chad says it is within its sovereign powers to negotiate military cooperation with any country of its choice, and that its troops are well trained to protect Chadians and their territory.	https://www.voanews.com/a/chad-officials-say-french-troops-have-finally-left-after-70-years-presence-/7958190.html	2025-01-31T06:02:52-08:00	
Myanmar’s rebels closing in around junta into fifth year of civil war	Bangkok — Myanmar’s rebel groups made historic gains last year, the fourth of a civil war set off by a military coup in February 2021, seizing wide swathes of the country’s west and northeast and overrunning two of the regime’s regional command bases for the first time. As the war enters its fifth bloody year Saturday, experts tell VOA the rebels are positioned to keep gaining ground in 2025, closing in on more cities and weapons factories vital to the military despite mounting efforts by China, which has billions of dollars invested in the country, to keep the junta afloat. 'The military has lost significant control, and in 2025, based on that trajectory over late 2023 and 2024 … it will still continue to lose control,' said Matthew Arnold, an independent analyst tracking the war. A BBC World Service study found the junta in full control of only 21% of Myanmar as of mid-November, a patchwork of rebel groups holding 42% and both sides contesting the rest. With the ground they gained over the past year, Arnold says the rebels have transformed the war by linking up what were mostly pockets of armed resistance into long stretches across the country which the military can no longer penetrate overland. 'The military does not face rebels in this valley or that valley, or this mountaintop or that mountaintop. They say these rebels can now attack us across hundreds and hundreds of miles of contiguous territory where they have absolutely full control,' he said. 'It just fundamentally shifted the nature of warfare in the country.' The rebels’ latest gains have not been even across the country. In northeast Myanmar’s Shan state, China pressured one of the largest rebel groups in the area, the Myanmar National Democratic Alliance Army (MNDAA), into a ceasefire with the military in mid-January after the group had made major advances. Experts tell VOA that China has also started leaning on Myanmar’s largest rebel group, the United Wa State Army (UWSA), to cut back on weapons sales to other groups. Both the MNDAA and UWSA keep close ties with Beijing, and while the latter are not fighting the Myanmar military themselves, they have been a major source of arms and ammunition for rebel groups that are. Without their help, other groups have been forced to scale back their push toward Myanmar’s second largest city, Mandalay, which remains in junta control, says Min Zaw Oo, a fellow at the Center for Strategic and International Studies, a Washington think tank. He said the squeeze on munitions has even helped the junta reverse gains another group, the Karenni National Defense Force, had been making in Kayah state, just south of Shan. 'They had to stop the offensive and they had to abandon, and now they are losing ground. One of the key factors was they … acquired less ammunition and weapons from UWSA,' said Min Zaw Oo. Elsewhere, though, rebel groups have continued to press ahead, even defying Beijing’s interests. In Myanmar’s far north, the capture of rare earth mines that supply China by the Kachin Independence Army in November compelled China to resume some of the border trade it had cut off to try and slow down the KIA’s march south, said Min Zaw Oo. In the west, the Arakan Army (AA) has nearly completed its sweep across Rakhine state and surrounded an oil and gas terminal on the shores of the Bay of Bengal central to China’s energy projects in Myanmar. Arnold and Min Zaw Oo say the AA is now pushing farther east with other allied groups into Ayeyarwady, Bago and Magwe regions in Myanmar’s center. Magwe, they add, with its many factories churning out weapons for the military, would be an especially big prize for the rebels and a painful loss for the junta if it were to fall next. The military’s recent losses to the AA also highlight one of the military’s main problems, says Morgan Michaels of the U.K.’s International Institute for Strategic Studies — a lack of manpower. Under pressure by rebel groups on nearly all sides, he said, the military could muster few reinforcements late last year as the AA bore down on its regional command base for western Myanmar, which it took, dealing the junta another heavy blow. The junta began enforcing a dormant conscription law in April to bolster troop numbers being worn down by desertions, defections and battlefield losses, and toughened the rules earlier this month to try and cut down on draft dodgers. 'Basically, the military cannot respond to protect or … wage counter attacks at these very sensitive and important strategic areas because of the manpower issue,' said Michaels. 'Opposition forces have their own limitations,' he added. 'But if the military can’t respond, then it’s going to bit by bit lose these areas.' The rebels’ own problems, the experts say, include an ever-short supply of ammunition and limited strategic coordination between the groups — many fighting for territory for any one of the country’s myriad ethnic minorities — across the whole of the country. Even so, they say they still expect most of the rebel groups in the fight to keep advancing on the junta into the year ahead. Conflict data crunched by Michaels and his team at the International Institute for Strategic Studies show no letup in the overall level of violence. Estimates of civilians and soldiers killed in the fighting stretch into the tens of thousands. Over 3 million people have been displaced, and half the country now lives in poverty. Bolstered by a steady stream of weapons and diplomatic cover from China and Russia, the experts also say the junta remains resilient but add that the collapse of a military battle-hardened by decades of counterinsurgency and once seen as all but invincible now looks plausible. Much will depend on how much longer Beijing in particular believes the junta has a useful role to play in protecting China’s economic and strategic interests in the country, says Arnold. 'China’s very straightforward, they’re very logical in what they see,' he said. 'And at some point, if the military doesn’t really stabilize the situation, China will have to make hard decisions about how much is it willing to support a military that is still losing control. And I think that will be the question for 2025.'	https://www.voanews.com/a/myanmar-s-rebels-closing-in-around-junta-into-fifth-year-of-civil-war-/7958145.html	2025-01-31T05:23:58-08:00	
DeepSeek vs. ChatGPT fuels debate over AI building blocks	SEOUL, SOUTH KOREA — When Chinese startup DeepSeek released its AI model this month, it was hailed as a breakthrough, a sign that China’s artificial intelligence companies could compete with their Silicon Valley counterparts using fewer resources. The narrative was clear: DeepSeek had done more with less, finding clever workarounds to U.S. chip restrictions. However, that storyline has begun to shift. OpenAI, the U.S.-based company behind ChatGPT, now claims DeepSeek may have improperly used its proprietary data to train its model, raising questions about whether DeepSeek’s success was truly an engineering marvel. In statements to several media outlets this week, OpenAI said it is reviewing indications that DeepSeek may have trained its AI by mimicking responses from OpenAI’s models. The process, known as distillation, is common among AI developers but is prohibited by OpenAI’s terms of service, which forbid using its model outputs to train competing systems. Some U.S. officials appear to support OpenAI’s concerns. At his confirmation hearing this week, Commerce secretary nominee Howard Lutnick accused DeepSeek of misusing U.S. technology to create a 'dirt cheap' AI model. 'They stole things. They broke in. They’ve taken our IP,' Lutnick said of China. David Sacks, the White House czar for AI and cryptocurrency, was more measured, saying only that it is 'possible' that DeepSeek had stolen U.S. intellectual property. In an interview with the cable news network Fox News, Sacks added that there is 'substantial evidence' that DeepSeek 'distilled the knowledge out of OpenAI’s models,' adding that stronger efforts are needed to curb the rise of 'copycat' AI systems. At the center of the dispute is a key question about AI’s future: how much control should companies have over their own AI models, when those programs were themselves built using data taken from others? AI data fight The question is especially relevant for OpenAI, which faces its own legal challenges. The company has been sued by several media companies and authors who accuse it of illegally using copyrighted material to train its AI models. Justin Hughes, a Loyola Law School professor specializing in intellectual property, AI, and data rights, said OpenAI’s accusations against DeepSeek are 'deeply ironic,' given the company’s own legal troubles. 'OpenAI has had no problem taking everyone else’s content and claiming it’s 'fair,'' Hughes told VOA in an email. 'If the reports are accurate that OpenAI violated other platforms’ terms of service to get the training data it has wanted, that would just add an extra layer of irony – dare we say hypocrisy – to OpenAI complaining about DeepSeek.' DeepSeek has not responded to OpenAI’s accusations. In a technical paper released with its new chatbot, DeepSeek acknowledged that some of its models were trained alongside other open-source models – such as Qwen, developed by China’s Alibaba, and Llama, released by Meta – according to Johnny Zou, a Hong Kong-based AI investment specialist. However, OpenAI appears to be alleging that DeepSeek improperly used its closed-source models – which cannot be freely accessed or used to train other AI systems. 'It’s quite a serious statement,' said Zou, who noted that OpenAI has not yet presented evidence of wrongdoing by DeepSeek. Proving improper distillation may be difficult without disclosing details on how its own models were trained, Zou added. Even if OpenAI presents concrete proof, its legal options may be limited. Although Zou noted that the company could pursue a case against DeepSeek for violating its terms of service, not all experts believe such a claim would hold up in court. 'Even assuming DeepSeek trained on OpenAI's data, I don't think OpenAI has much of a case,' said Mark Lemley, a professor at Stanford Law School who specializes in intellectual property and technology. Even though AI models often have restrictive terms of service, 'no model creator has actually tried to enforce these terms with monetary penalties or injunctive relief,' Lemley wrote in a recent paper with co-author Peter Henderson. The paper argues that these restrictions may be unenforceable, since the materials they aim to protect are 'largely not copyrightable.' 'There are compelling reasons for many of these provisions to be unenforceable: they chill good faith research, constrain competition, and create quasi-copyright ownership where none should exist,' the paper noted. OpenAI’s main legal argument would likely be breach of contract, said Hughes. Even if that were the case, though, he added, 'good luck enforcing that against a Chinese company without meaningful assets in the United States.' Possible options The financial stakes are adding urgency to the debate. U.S. tech stocks dipped Monday after following news of DeepSeek’s advances, though they later regained some ground. Commerce nominee Lutnick suggested that further government action, including tariffs, could be used to deter China from copying advanced AI models. But speaking the same day, U.S. President Donald Trump appeared to take a different view, surprising some industry insiders with an optimistic take on DeepSeek’s breakthrough. The Chinese company’s low-cost model, Trump said, was 'very much a positive development' for AI, because 'instead of spending billions and billions, you’ll spend less, and you’ll come up with hopefully the same solution.' If DeepSeek has succeeded in building a relatively cheap and competitive AI model, that may be bad for those with investment – or stock options – in current generative AI companies, Hughes said. 'But it might be good for the rest of us,' he added, noting that until recently it appeared that only the existing tech giants 'had the resources to play in the generative AI sandbox.' 'If DeepSeek disproved that, we should hope that what can be done by a team of engineers in China can be done by a similarly resourced team of engineers in Detroit or Denver or Boston,' he said.	https://www.voanews.com/a/deepseek-vs-chatgpt-fuels-debate-over-ai-building-blocks/7958031.html	2025-01-31T02:52:21-08:00	
Russian drones injure 4 in Ukraine's south, Ukrainian officials say	KYIV, UKRAINE — Russia launched a barrage of drones on Ukraine in an overnight attack on Friday, injuring four people and damaging a hospital and a grain warehouse in the southern Odesa region, officials said. Ukraine's air defenses shot down 59 of 102 Russian drones, the air force said. It said that 37 drones were 'lost,' referring to the use of electronic warfare to redirect them. Russian drones caused damage in the northeastern Sumy region, the Odesa region in the south and the central Cherkasy Region. Oleh Kiper, the Odesa regional governor, said that four civilians, including a doctor, were injured in drone attacks targeting the city of Chornomorsk. The strikes also partially disrupted electricity supplies in the city and damaged the city's hospital, an administrative building, a grain warehouse, a residential house, and several trucks, he said on the Telegram app. Regional officials in the central Cherkasy region said that drone debris damaged an apartment building in the region. Meanwhile, an oil refinery in Russia's southern Volgograd region caught fire after an overnight Ukrainian drone attack, but the blaze has now been put out, the regional governor said on Friday. Andrei Bocharov, the governor, said in a statement on the Telegram messaging app that Russian air defenses had repelled an attack on his region by eight drones. 'As a result of falling debris from one of the drones, a fire broke out on the territory of an oil refinery, which was promptly extinguished. One injured refinery worker was hospitalized,' he said. Andriy Kovalenko, the head of Ukraine's Centre for Countering Disinformation, said on Telegram that the Volgograd oil refinery, which he described as one of Russia's largest, had been struck. SHOT, a Russian news outlet with contacts in the security services, said four Ukrainian drones had been destroyed over a second refinery in Yaroslavl, northeast of Moscow. Ukraine has carried out frequent air attacks on Russian refineries, oil depots and industrial sites to cripple key infrastructure underpinning Russia's war effort. This week it claimed to have struck and set on fire a Lukoil refinery, Russia's fourth largest, in the Nizhny Novgorod region, east of Moscow. Sources at Lukoil denied that the NORSI refinery was hit, and said production was not affected. Petrochemical company Sibur said there had been a drone strike and fire at its nearby plant. Russia is currently feeding more crude oil through its refineries in the hope of boosting fuel exports after new U.S. sanctions on Russian tankers and traders made exports of unprocessed crude more difficult, sources told Reuters this week. A Ukrainian drone attack last week forced a refinery in Ryazan, southeast of Moscow, to suspend operations. Russia's Defense Ministry said in a statement on Friday that 49 Ukrainian drones had been downed over the country overnight, including 25 in the southern Rostov region and eight in the Volgograd region. Drones had also been detected and destroyed in the Kursk, Yaroslavl, Belgorod, Voronezh, and Krasnodar regions, it said.	https://www.voanews.com/a/russian-drones-injure-4-in-ukraine-s-south-ukrainian-officials-say/7958004.html	2025-01-31T01:16:21-08:00	
Israel targets Hezbollah sites in Lebanon, accuses group of ceasefire breach	DUBAI, UAE — The Israeli military said on Friday it struck several Hezbollah targets overnight in the Bekaa Valley and along the Syrian-Lebanese border. The army said the targets include a facility used for underground weapons development and another associated with the smuggling of arms into Lebanon. On Thursday, Israel said it intercepted a surveillance drone launched by Hezbollah calling it 'a breach of the ceasefire agreement' between Israel and Lebanon. Hezbollah and Israel reached a ceasefire in late November, ending a deadly conflict that began with the Gaza war in 2023. The U.S. confirmed on Sunday that the agreement, which includes a 60-day period for Israeli troop withdrawal, will remain in effect until Feb. 18, extending the original Jan. 26 deadline. Israel has carried out multiple strikes on Lebanese territory since the ceasefire extension killing and injuring more than 100 people. The most recent attack is a drone strike that injured at least five people in southern Lebanese town of Majdal Selm.	https://www.voanews.com/a/israel-targets-hezbollah-sites-in-lebanon-accuses-group-of-ceasefire-breach/7957990.html	2025-01-31T00:34:59-08:00	
Trump support for denuclearization talks with Russia, China raises hopes	white house — Arms control advocates are hoping U.S. President Donald Trump’s fresh words of support for denuclearization will lead to talks with Russia and China on arms reduction. U.S. negotiations with the Russians and Chinese on denuclearization and eventual agreements are 'very possible,' according to Trump, who addressed the World Economic Forum a week ago in Davos, Switzerland. 'Tremendous amounts of money are being spent on nuclear [weapons], and the destructive capability is something that we don’t even want to talk about because you don’t want to hear,' he said. 'It’s too depressing.' Trump noted that in his first term, he discussed the topic with Russian President Vladimir Putin. 'We were talking about denuclearization of our two countries, and China would have come along,' according to Trump. 'President Putin really liked the idea of cutting back on nuclear [armaments], and I think the rest of the world — we would have gotten them to follow.' Just months before leaving office, former U.S. President Joe Biden met with Chinese President Xi Jinping at the APEC summit in Peru where both agreed that decisions regarding the use of nuclear weapons should remain under human control. That consensus was seen as a positive step after the Chinese, four months previously, suspended nuclear arms control talks with Washington to protest American arms sales to Taiwan. The horror of nuclear attacks first became evident to many in the world through magazines in the West, which printed photographs of the radiation-burned survivors of the U.S. atomic attack on two Japanese cities in 1945 to end World War II. In subsequent years during the Cold War, U.S. government films captured the destructive force of test detonations in the Nevada desert, eventually prompting public demonstrations to 'ban the bomb' and diplomacy to reduce or eliminate all nuclear weapons. A major breakthrough occurred in 1987 with the Intermediate-Range Nuclear Forces Treaty (INF) between the United States and the Soviet Union. It entered into full force the following year. By 1991, nearly 2,700 missiles had been dismantled. That was the first time the two nuclear superpowers achieved a reduction of such weapons rather than just limiting their growth. Over the years, the Americans and the Russians lost their monopoly on nuclear weapons. Nine countries presently have nuclear arsenals, although Israel has never acknowledged possession of such weaponry. The United States and Russia each have more than 5,000 nuclear warheads — 90% of the world’s total. The combined global force of all countries’ nuclear weapons could destroy the world many times over, according to arms control advocates. The current New Strategic Arms Reduction Treaty (START), signed in 2010 by U.S. President Barack Obama and Russian President Dmitry Medvedev, set limits on the number of deployed strategic nuclear warheads and delivery systems, while including on-site inspection and exchanges of data for verification. The treaty expires in early February 2026, which adds urgency to Trump’s call for talks with Russia and China, according to Xiaodon Liang, senior analyst for nuclear weapons policy and disarmament at the Arms Control Association. 'And because of that, this issue has to be at the top of the agenda, and having a signal that the president is concerned about this issue and thinking about it is very positive,' Liang told VOA. Since a formal, comprehensive agreement could take years to negotiate — possibly spanning beyond the four years of the second Trump presidency — Liang suggests the U.S. president consider an 'executive agreement' with Putin, an informal consensus or a series of unilateral steps to continue adhering to the numbers in New START for an indefinite period. 'That would be a stabilizing factor in this important bilateral relationship,' Liang added. There are analysts who advocate a more aggressive tactic. Trump should consider ordering a resumption of nuclear testing to demonstrate to America’s adversaries that the U.S. arsenal of weapons of mass destruction remains viable and as an act of resolve, writes Robert Peters, a research fellow at the Heritage Foundation, a conservative think tank seen as having a dominant influence on Trump administration policies. Peters also suggests that Trump might want to withdraw from the 1963 Test Ban Treaty made with Moscow and 'conduct an above-ground test either at the Nevada National Security Site or in the Pacific Ocean over open water, where nuclear fallout can be minimized' to stave escalatory moves by an adversary to the United States. The Heritage Foundation did not respond to multiple requests from VOA to interview Peters. Moscow is not known to have conducted any sort of test causing a nuclear chain reaction, known as criticality, since 1990. Two years later, the United States announced it would no longer test nuclear weapons, although subcritical simulations continue. The other nuclear nations have followed suit except North Korea, which last triggered a nuclear test explosion in 2017. The Bulletin of the Atomic Scientists on Tuesday moved up the hands of its 'Doomsday Clock' by one second to 89 seconds to midnight, meant to signify the peril from weapons of mass destruction and other existential threats. 'We set the clock closer to midnight because we do not see positive progress on the global challenges we face, including nuclear risk, climate change, biological threats and advances in disruptive technology,' said Daniel Holz, a physics professor at the University of Chicago, just after the hands of this year’s clock were unveiled at the U.S. Institute of Peace. While the Doomsday Clock is merely symbolic, Liang at the Arms Control Association sees it as an annual important ritual highlighting the risks to Americans and everyone else posed by the world’s nuclear arsenals. 'It is a good tool for bringing this to more people’s attention, and you can’t blame Americans for having so many other issues on their plate. And having this [clock] as a reminder, I think, is an effective communications tool,' Liang said. At the Doomsday Clock ceremony, VOA asked former Colombian President and Nobel laureate Juan Manuel Santos what he viewed as the biggest hurdle to Trump, Putin and Xi making progress on denuclearization. 'The biggest challenge, in my view, is for them to understand that they should sit down and talk about how the three of them can take decisions to save their own countries and the whole world,' he said. Liang compared the situation to U.S. President John F. Kennedy's call to Soviet leader Nikita Khrushchev during the 1962 Cuban missile crisis, which led Washington and Moscow to pull back from the brink of nuclear war. That resolution turned the hands of the Doomsday Clock the following year back to 12 minutes to midnight in recognition of the Americans, Soviets and British banning nuclear testing in the atmosphere, in space and under water. It has been several years since the United States engaged in any denuclearization negotiations. Those working-level talks in 2019 in Sweden between the first Trump administration and North Korean officials did not yield any agreement, with Pyongyang’s chief negotiator, Kim Myong Gil, telling reporters that the Americans had raised expectations with promises of flexibility but would not 'give up their old viewpoint and attitude.' The State Department spokesperson at the time, Morgan Ortagus, said in a statement the two countries could not be expected to 'overcome a legacy of 70 years of war and hostility on the Korean Peninsula in the course of a single Saturday,' but such weighty issues 'require a strong commitment by both countries. The United States has that commitment.'	https://www.voanews.com/a/trump-support-for-denuclearization-talks-with-russia-china-raises-hopes-/7957584.html	2025-01-30T23:06:25-08:00	
Trump's support for denuclearization talks with Russia, China raises hopes	Arms control advocates are hoping U.S. President Donald Trump's fresh words of support for denuclearization will lead to talks with Russia and China about nuclear arms reduction. VOA's chief national correspondent, Steve Herman, reports from the White House in Washington.	https://www.voanews.com/a/trump-support-for-denuclearization-talks-with-russia-china-raises-hopes/7957586.html	2025-01-30T23:05:36-08:00	
Spain well short of NATO defense target, as Trump demands huge additional spending	As U.S. President Donald Trump demands a large increase in defense spending by NATO allies, the spotlight has fallen on Spain, which spends the least on defense of all member states relative to the size of its economy. Spain is the eurozone’s fourth-biggest economy. The country spent an estimated $21.3 billion on defense last year, equating to 1.28% of its gross domestic product (GDP), putting it at the bottom of the league among the 32-nation Atlantic alliance. That’s despite a pledge made by all NATO members in 2014 to spend at least 2% of GDP on defense, according to the bloc. NATO Secretary-General Mark Rutte visited Madrid and Lisbon earlier this week and warned all members of the need to boost spending beyond existing targets. 'The goal of 2%, now set a decade ago, will not be enough to meet the challenges of tomorrow. The threat from Russia may seem distant, but let me assure you, it is not,' Rutte said at a press conference in Lisbon on Jan. 27. 'NATO is strong today. To keep NATO strong we must, however, continue to adapt. And to guarantee our security in the future, we also need to ramp up our efforts now. It also means we need to spend more in our defense,' he said. Only 23 of the 32 NATO member states were expected to meet the 2% target by 2024, according to the alliance. Spanish Prime Minister Pedro Sanchez has rejected criticism that his government has been too slow to boost defense spending. In a statement, the prime minister’s office said Monday that Spain was a 'serious, responsible and committed ally of NATO,' noting that the government had increased defense spending by 70% in the last decade. 'Spain's commitment to reach 2% of defense spending by 2029 is firm,' the statement said. Spanish troops are also helping to train Ukrainian forces as Kyiv battles Russia’s invasion. Trump criticism That’s unlikely to be enough to satisfy NATO’s biggest spender, the United States, which spent 3.38% of its GDP on defense in 2024. Earlier in January, Trump described Spain’s contribution to NATO as 'very low' and has demanded a much higher spending target from European allies. 'I'm also going to ask all NATO nations to increase defense spending to 5% of GDP, which is what it should have been years ago,' Trump told delegates by video link at the World Economic Forum in Davos on Jan. 23. Trump has long complained that European allies are taking advantage of the United States, insisting that they should share the burden of defense spending. However, the 5% target is unrealistic for Spain, according to analyst Pere Ortega of the Delas Center for Peace Studies in Madrid. 'Reaching 5% is impossible. That would mean that Spain would have to spend almost 65 billion euros [$67.7 billion]. That is impossible, because we do not have that economic capacity,' Ortega told VOA. 'No political program would ask for an increase in military spending to reach 3, 4 or 5% ... because that would be in some way making sacrifices in the social security sphere. And the Spanish population would penalize that with their vote at the polls,' Ortega added. Lithuania boost Trump does have some support in Europe. Lithuania plans to raise defense spending to 5% or 6% of GDP by 2026. Announcing the increase on January 17, Lithuanian Minister of Defense Dovile Sakaliene said the policy was a response to regional threats. 'We are fitting in with NATO defense plans, which are vital to our region,' he said. Poland and Estonia have also indicated their intention to boost defense spending toward Trump’s target of 5%. France has also urged allies to invest more, although Paris only met the 2% target itself in 2023. 'What will we do in Europe tomorrow if our American ally withdraws its warships from the Mediterranean? If they send their fighter jets from the Atlantic to the Pacific?' French President Emmanuel Macron said Jan. 20 in an address to members of the French military. 'These are scenarios that we need to prepare for. These are the scenarios that we are preparing for.' At his first NATO summit as U.S. president in 2017, Trump berated other members for failing to spend enough on defense. European allies, including Spain, are braced for further robust diplomacy ahead of the next summit, scheduled to be held in The Hague in June.	https://www.voanews.com/a/spain-well-short-of-nato-defense-target-as-trump-demands-huge-additional-spending-/7957334.html	2025-01-30T23:05:05-08:00	
Teen skaters, group of hunters and students among victims of air crash	WICHITA, KANSAS — The victims of a crash between an American Airlines jet and an Army helicopter included teen figure skaters returning from a national meet with their mothers and coaches, an Ohio college student coming from her grandfather's funeral, two Chinese nationals and a group of hunters headed back from a guided trip in Kansas. They were among 60 travelers and four crew members on board the commercial flight late Wednesday when it collided with the Black Hawk helicopter, which was carrying three soldiers. Officials say there were no survivors. As the search for remains continued Thursday, communities grieved. Faith leaders held a vigil Thursday in the city council chambers. 'The only way we will get through this is together,' said the Rev. Pamela Hughes Mason of Wichita's St. Paul AME Church. American Airlines set up a hotline as well as centers in Washington and Wichita for people searching for information about family members who may have been aboard the downed flight. Here's what we know about some of the people killed in Wednesday night's crash: From the Skating Club of Boston Skaters Jinna Han and Spencer Lane were among those killed, according to Doug Zeghibe, CEO of the Skating Club of Boston. Their mothers, Jin Han and Christine Lane, as well as their coaches Evgenia Shishkova and Vadim Naumov also died. Han and Lane, who was about 16, were returning from the U.S. Figure Skating Championships. 'We watched Jinna just grow up here from just a tiny little tyke into this amazingly mature 13-year-old,' he said. 'A great performer, a great competitor, and off the ice, a great kid.' Spencer Lane, who was from Barrington, Rhode Island, took part in his first professional show in December with Elin Schran's company, Joy Skate Productions. 'He started to discover this connection with the audience and that joy that he was giving to other people through his gift,' Schran said. In a statement, the Lane family recalled Christine Lane for both her singular talents and her dedication to parenting. 'Christine exuded creativity throughout her life, using her formal graphic design training as a jumping-off point for seemingly endless creative pursuits across areas such as photography, quilting, knitting, and more. She brought even greater passion to her role as a mother to Spencer and his brother Milo,' the family said. Their coaches, Shishkova and Naumov, won the pairs title at the 1994 world championships in Chiba, Japan. The Russia-born pair also competed twice in the Olympics. More young athletes and coaches Skating organizations in Philadelphia and the Washington area also said some of their young athletes had been aboard the plane. Several athletes on the flight had attended a development camp held after the U.S. Figure Skating Championships ended Sunday in Wichita, Kansas. Wichita Skating Center manager Sean O'Reilly said the championships brought a 'groundswell of positivity,' drawing enthusiastic parents and young athletes from across the U.S. He was 'gutted' to learn some of those skaters had been killed. In Virginia's Loudoun County, a coach at a skating club was also identified as among the passengers, Virginia Rep. Suhas Subramanyam confirmed. The club, Ashburn Ice House, said that its 'figure skating community has been directly affected,' but did not give further details. Students Students and parents at Cedarville University in Ohio said one of the passengers on the plane was Grace Maxwell, a junior majoring in mechanical engineering. Maxwell's father, Dean Maxwell, said she was returning to campus from her home in Wichita, Kansas, after attending her grandfather's funeral, The Wichita Eagle reported. Grace Maxwell had been working on a project this semester to create a hand-stabilizing device to help a boy in the area feed himself instead of relying on others, the university said in a statement. 'Grace was a quiet person with a keen interest in helping others through engineering,' said Tim Norman, who served as her secondary adviser. Three other students from schools in Fairfax County, Virginia, and six parents from the district were also on board the plane, superintendent Michelle Reid said in a letter to families. She did not identify them, but she said the students were from different schools and that two of the parents were current or former district staffers. Chinese citizens, Philippines police officer Chinese citizens and a cop from the Philippines Philippine Police Col. Pergentino Malabed Jr., who headed the supply management division of the national police, was among the dead. He had traveled to the U.S. to inspect equipment the Philippines was planning to purchase for its 232,000-member force, according to the Philippine police. 'His untimely passing is a profound loss to the Philippine National Police, where he served with honor, with integrity and dedication throughout his career,' Philippine police said in a statement. The Chinese Embassy in the U.S. said two Chinese nationals were also among the victims. It did not offer further details. The country's Ministry of Foreign Affairs offered its condolences for the crash victims and requested the U.S. to 'promptly report any progress with the search and rescue and find out the cause of the accident as soon as possible.' Hunters headed home from a trip Seven people returning from a guided hunting trip in Kansas were killed, according to a Facebook post by Fowl Plains, the guide service. The Fowl Plains team said they had grown close to the hunters on board the flight over the years and considered them to be family members. The post doesn't identify the hunters by name, but it says they had spent the past week on a guided hunt, 'laughing, talking about our families and sharing memories.' 'Heartbroken is an understatement,' the company said. Members of a Maryland union Those killed also included four steamfitters, all members of a United Association union local in suburban Maryland, union leaders said in a social media post Thursday. 'Our focus now is on providing support and care to the families of our brothers as we continue to gather more information in the coming days,' said the post by UA General President Mark McManus and Chris Madello, the business manager of Local 602. From the military The victims also include three soldiers who were aboard the helicopter. Officials said their remains will be at Air Force Mortuary Affairs Operations at Dover Air Force Base in Delaware. That office coordinates the dignified transfer of fallen service members. The officials spoke on condition of anonymity to discuss details not yet announced. No identities of the crew have been released. But the wife of one of the helicopter pilots said on Facebook that her husband, Andrew Eaves of Noxubee County, Mississippi, was killed. In a phone call, Carrie Eaves confirmed the post was hers. 'We ask that you pray for our family and friends and for all the other families that are suffering today. We ask for peace while we grieve,' her post read. The three soldiers were doing an annual night proficiency training flight, Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth said, adding they were a 'fairly experienced crew.' Officials were notifying relatives, he said.	https://www.voanews.com/a/teen-skaters-group-of-hunters-and-students-among-victims-of-air-crash/7957971.html	2025-01-30T22:47:18-08:00	
Senate confirms North Dakota's Burgum as Trump interior secretary	The U.S. Senate on Thursday confirmed Doug Burgum, the former governor of North Dakota, as President Donald Trump's interior secretary. The vote was 79-18. Burgum, 68, will lead an agency that guides the use of 202 million hectares of federal and tribal land, a fifth of the nation's surface area. He is expected to pursue Trump's goal of maximizing energy and mineral production on public lands, likely by ratcheting up new leasing in oil-producing states like Wyoming and New Mexico and in the Gulf of Mexico, which Trump has said is now officially called the Gulf of America. A wealthy former software executive, Burgum has portrayed himself as a traditional, business-minded conservative. During his nomination hearing, Burgum said he would expand oil and gas drilling rights auctions and support permitting reforms that could speed development of energy projects like transmission lines and pipelines. His comments signaled a sharp turn in federal policy after former President Joe Biden's administration sought to limit oil and gas drilling on federal lands and promote renewable energy sources like wind and solar as part of its climate change agenda. Burgum ran against Trump for the Republican presidential nomination before quitting and becoming a Trump supporter. He is also being considered to head a new national council to coordinate policies to boost U.S. energy output.	https://www.voanews.com/a/senate-confirms-north-dakota-s-burgum-as-trump-interior-secretary/7957967.html	2025-01-30T22:19:20-08:00	
Rwanda-backed rebels in eastern Congo say they plan to take their fight to the capital	GOMA, CONGO — Rwanda-backed rebels who captured eastern Congo's largest city said Thursday they want to take their fight to the far-off capital, Kinshasa, while Congo’s president called for a massive military mobilization to resist the rebellion and his defense minister rejected calls for talks. In a video message, Congo's Defense Minister Guy Kabombo Muadiamvita said he has directed plans for any dialogue with the rebels to 'be completely burned immediately.' 'We will stay here in Congo and fight. If we do not stay alive here, let’s stay dead here,' said Muadiamvita, a close ally of Congo's president. At a briefing where they sought to assert their control over the eastern city of Goma and surrounding territory in the neighboring South Kivu province, the M23 rebels said they would be open to dialogue with the government, also proposed by the east African regional bloc of which Rwanda is a member. Their motive, however, is to gain political power, Corneille Nangaa, one of the political leaders of M23, said during the briefing. 'We want to go to Kinshasa, take power and lead the country,' Nangaa said. He did not indicate how the rebels planned to advance on the capital, more than 1,500 kilometers away. Rwanda's leader, Paul Kagame, said he spoke with Angola's President Joao Lourenco — a mediator in the conflict who also met with Congo's leader a day earlier — and both leaders committed to working with other African countries to resolve the hostilities. U.S. President Donald Trump described the conflict as a 'very serious problem' when asked about it Thursday but declined to comment further, and a U.N. spokesman said the agency is 'disturbed' by reports that neighboring Rwandan forces have crossed the border in the direction where the rebels are said to be advancing. The M23 rebels are backed by some 4,000 troops from neighboring Rwanda, according to U.N. experts, far more than in 2012 when they first captured Goma. They are one of more than 100 armed groups vying for control in Congo’s mineral-rich east, which holds vast deposits estimated to be worth $24 trillion that are critical to much of the world’s technology. Congolese President Felix Tshisekedi, meanwhile, called on young people to enlist massively in the military, as a crucial meeting of neighbors asked the Congolese government to talk with the rebels. Rwanda's leader also threatened to 'deal' with any confrontation with South Africa, which has complained that fighting in eastern Congo has left South African peacekeepers dead. In his first public remarks since the M23 rebels advanced into Goma on Monday, Tshisekedi vowed 'a vigorous and coordinated response' from his forces to push back the rebels while reaffirming his commitment to a peaceful resolution. On Thursday, he met with French Foreign Minister Jean-Noel Barrot in Kinshasa, the Congolese presidency said on X, noting that France has provided significant support to Congo in recent U.N. meetings on the issue. '(Congo) expects a little more action in the face of this crisis,' it added. Dead bodies, looting in Goma Goma remained largely without electricity and water on Thursday, as the bodies of several alleged government soldiers lay in the streets, horrifying residents, including children. M23 rebels escorted some 2,000 government soldiers and police officers — who they said surrendered — to an undisclosed location, some of them singing anti-Tshisekedi songs. The U.N. Humanitarian Coordinator in Congo said basic services are largely paralyzed in Goma, a humanitarian hub critical for more than 6 million people displaced by the conflict. 'After several days of intense clashes, the city is now (faced) with massive humanitarian needs and severely impacted response capacities,' said Bruno Lemarquis, the humanitarian coordinator. Footage from Goma showed residents carrying food items and goods looted from stores and warehouses in the city. 'This is something that is going to exacerbate a dangerous cycle of violence as desperate times call for desperate measures,' the U.N. World Food Program emergency coordinator in eastern Congo, Cynthia Jones, said Thursday. South Kivu gripped by fear After capturing much of Goma, the rebels were advancing toward South Kivu’s provincial capital, Bukavu, causing fear and panic among residents, witnesses said Thursday. Nana Bintou, a civil society leader, said gunshots and explosions were heard in Mukwinja, a captured town 135 kilometers from Bukavu. The Congolese military has been weakened after hundreds of foreign military contractors withdrew and handed over their arms to the rebels. Residents of Goma described seeing soldiers changing into civilian clothing and dropping their guns as they crossed over the border to Rwanda or took shelter in foreign peacekeeping bases. 'The (Congolese) military bases in Bukavu have been emptied to reinforce those in Nyabibwe, Bushushu, and Nyamukubi' along the way to the capital, one youth leader said, speaking on the condition of anonymity because he was worried about his safety. Neighbors urge talks with M23 as tensions grow A summit of the regional East African bloc called for an immediate and unconditional ceasefire in eastern Congo and 'strongly urged' Tshisekedi’s government to hold talks with the rebels. Tshisekedi was conspicuously absent from the virtual summit attended by Rwanda, also a member. While African countries as well as the U.N. and U.S. have called for an immediate ceasefire, the risk of a regional war has increased, analysts say, exacerbated by the rebels' advance into South Kivu and diatribes between Rwandan and South African officials. Congo is a member of the southern Africa regional bloc and also that of east Africa, whose peacekeeping force it expelled last year after deeming it ineffective. South African President Cyril Ramaphosa blamed the 'Rwanda Defense Force militia' for the fighting that has resulted in the deaths of 13 South African peacekeepers in eastern Congo. He also said his government will ensure the peacekeepers are 'sufficiently supported during this critical mission.' His comment drew an angry response from Kagame, who called the South African peacekeepers a 'belligerent force' working alongside armed groups that target Rwanda. 'If South Africa prefers confrontation, Rwanda will deal with the matter in that context any day,' the Rwandan leader said on the social media platform X. Who are the M23 and what do they want? The chaotic situation with the M23 has its roots in ethnic conflict, stretching back to the 1994 genocide in Rwanda, when 800,000 Tutsis and others were killed by Hutus and former militias. M23 says it is defending ethnic Tutsis in Congo. Rwanda has claimed the Tutsis are being persecuted by Hutus and others involved in the genocide. Many Hutus fled into Congo after 1994. Unlike in 2012 when the rebels seized Congo for days, observers say their withdrawal could be more difficult now. The rebels have been emboldened by Rwanda, which feels Congo is ignoring its interests in the region and failed to meet demands of previous peace agreements, according to Murithi Mutiga, program director for Africa at the Crisis Group, a think tank. 'Ultimately, this is a failure of African mediation (because) the warning signs were always there. Kigali was adopting very bellicose rhetoric and the Congolese government was also adopting very, very aggressive rhetoric,' Mutiga said.	https://www.voanews.com/a/rwanda-backed-rebels-in-eastern-congo-say-they-plan-to-take-their-fight-to-the-capital/7957962.html	2025-01-30T22:07:17-08:00	
Judge extends court-monitoring agreement for children in Customs and Border Protection custody	McALLEN, TEXAS — A federal judge extended a court agreement on Thursday ensuring safe and sanitary conditions for migrant children in federal custody a day after U.S. Customs and Border Protection was set to begin self-monitoring. The agreement originally ended Wednesday, but District Judge Dolly M. Gee in California decided to extend it by 18 months. 'CBP is not yet capable of wholly fulfilling its responsibilities under the 2022 Settlement and the FSA (Flores Settlement Agreement) without the additional support provided by the JCM (Juvenile Care Monitor) and the Court,' the judge wrote in her order. Customs and Border Protection did not immediately respond to a request for comment. A court-appointed monitor will continue to visit and report on conditions for children in custody at U.S. Customs and Border Protection facilities in the Rio Grande Valley and El Paso, Texas. Concerns were initially raised during the first Trump administration when reports surfaced of children separated from family for weeks and held in poor sanitary conditions. In 2019, a Guatemalan teenager died in custody as a result of a flu outbreak and a lack of proper medical care in a federal facility in Weslaco, Texas. The parties reached an agreement that was implemented in July 2022 for 2½ years. It allowed a court monitor to keep track of progress made by Customs and Border Protection. In the last report filed in December, the monitor noted positive changes while also mentioning a continued practice of separating some parents from their children during their time in custody. The monitor later told the court of discrepancies with Customs and Border Protection data suggesting the agency underreported the number of children who had exceeded the recommended time in custody of three days. Customs and Border Protection was scheduled to begin self-monitoring its facilities on Wednesday. The agency said in December it was ready for the task after issuing new guidance on family unity and increased training on detention policies, guidelines and regulations that rolled back court oversight under the Biden administration. Plaintiffs argued the agency was not ready, citing testimony from minors held in Customs and Border Protection facilities, and they requested the renewal of the court agreement. 'No child should be forced to spend weeks inside a windowless pod in dirty clothes with no access to the outdoors. We are relieved the Court ruled to force CBP to meet its obligations under the settlement,' Mishan Wroe, senior attorney for the National Youth Law Center, said in a statement. Trump officials have said they plan to end 'catch-and-release' policies and stop the release of migrants into the U.S. while they wait for immigration court hearings. The changes could result in longer detention times exceeding the court-recommended 72 hours for families.	https://www.voanews.com/a/judge-extends-court-monitoring-agreement-for-children-in-customs-and-border-protection-custody/7957950.html	2025-01-30T21:00:10-08:00	
Dick Button, Olympic great and voice of skating, dies at 95	NEW YORK — Dick Button was more than the most accomplished men's figure skater in history. He was one of his sport's greatest innovators and promoters. Button, winner of two Olympic gold medals and five consecutive world championships, died Thursday, said his son, Edward, who did not provide a cause. He was 95. As an entrepreneur and broadcaster, Button promoted skating and its athletes, transforming a niche sport into the showpiece of every Winter Olympics. 'Dick was one of the most important figures in our sport,' Scott Hamilton said. 'There wasn't a skater after Dick who wasn't helped by him in some way.' Button's impact began after World War II. He was the first U.S. men's champion — and his country's youngest at age 16 — when that competition returned in 1946. Two years later, he took the title at the St. Moritz Olympics, competing outdoors. He performed the first double axel in any competition and became the first American to win the men's event. 'By the way, that jump had a cheat on it,' Button told the U.S. Olympic Committee website. 'But listen, I did it and that was what counted.' That began his dominance of international skating, and U.S. amateur sports. He was the first figure skater to win the prestigious Sullivan Award in 1949 — no other figure skater won it until Michelle Kwan in 2001. In 1952, while a Harvard student, he won a second gold at the Oslo Games, making more history with the first triple jump (a loop) in competition. Soon after, he won a fifth world title, then gave up his eligibility as an amateur. All Olympic sports were subject to an amateur/professional division at the time. 'I had achieved everything I could have dreamed of doing as a skater,' said Button, who earned a law degree from Harvard in 1956. 'I was able to enjoy the Ice Capades (show) and keep my hand in skating, and that was very important to me.' With the Emmy Award-winning Button as the TV analyst, viewers got to learn not only the basics but the nuances of a sport foreign to many as he frankly broke down the performances. He became as much a fixture on ABC's Wide World of Sports as Jim McKay and the hapless ski jumper tumbling down the slope. 'Dick Button is the custodian of the history of figure skating and its quintessential voice,' 1988 Olympic champion Brian Boitano said in Button's autobiography. 'He made the words 'lutz' and 'salchow' part of our everyday vocabulary.' After a 1961 plane crash killed the entire U.S. figure skating team on the way to the world championships, which then were canceled, Button persuaded ABC Sports executive Roone Arledge to televise the 1962 event on Wide World. That's when he joined the network as a commentator. Button's death coincided with another tragedy in the skating world, Wednesday night's crash of an American Airlines flight that collided with an Army helicopter and plummeted into the Potomac River outside Washington, D.C., killing everyone on board. Two teenage figure skaters, their mothers, and two former world champions who were coaching at the Skating Club of Boston were among the 14 people killed from the skating community. Button skated for the Boston club and remained close to it for the rest of his life. The trophy room at the club is named in his honor. He also provided opportunities for skaters to make money after their competitive careers. He ran professional events he created for TV for years, attracting many top names in the sport — Hamilton, Torvill and Dean, Kristi Yamaguchi, Kurt Browning and Katarina Witt. Button's Candid Productions, formed 1959, also produced such made-for-TV programs as Battle of the Network Stars. He also dabbled in acting, but the rink was his realm. 'Dick Button created an open and honest space in figure skating broadcasting where no topic or moment was off-limits,' said Johnny Weir, the three-time U.S. champion and current NBC Sports figure skating analyst.

US economy grows solid 2.3% in October-December on eve of Trump return to White House	WASHINGTON — A humming American economy ended 2024 on a solid note with consumer spending continuing to drive growth, and ahead of what could be a significant change in direction under a Trump administration. The Commerce Department reported Thursday that gross domestic product — the economy's output of goods and services — expanded at a 2.3% annual rate from October through December. For the full year, the economy grew a healthy 2.8%, compared with 2.9% in 2023. The fourth-quarter growth was a tick below the 2.4% economists had expected, according to a survey of forecasters by the data firm FactSet. Consumer spending grew at a 4.2% pace, fastest since January-March 2023 and up from 3.7% in July-September last year. But business investment tumbled as investment in equipment plunged after two straight strong quarters. Wednesday's report also showed persistent inflationary pressure at the end of 2024. The Federal Reserve's favored inflation gauge — called the personal consumption expenditures index, or PCE — rose at a 2.3% annual pace last quarter, up from 1.5% in the third quarter and above the Fed's 2% target. Excluding volatile food and energy prices, so-called core PCE inflation was 2.5%, up from 2.2% in the July-September quarter. A drop in business inventories shaved 0.93 percentage points off fourth-quarter growth. But a category within the GDP data that measures the economy's underlying strength rose at a healthy 3.2% annual rate from July through September, slipping from 3.4% in the third quarter. This category includes consumer spending and private investment but excludes volatile items like exports, inventories and government spending. Paul Ashworth, chief North America economist at Capital Economics, said that figure 'suggests the economy remains strong, particularly given the fourth-quarter disruptions,'' including a strike at Boeing and the aftermath of two hurricanes. President Donald Trump has inherited a healthy economy. Growth has been steady and unemployment low — 4.1% in December. The economy has proven remarkably resilient after the Fed's inflation fighters raised rates 11 times in 2022 and 2023 to combat the biggest surge in consumer prices since the 1980s. Instead of sliding into a recession, as most economists predicted, GDP kept expanding. Growth has now topped 2% in nine of the last 10 quarters. On Wednesday, the Fed left its benchmark interest rate unchanged after making three cuts since September. With the economy rolling along, Fed Chair Jerome Powell told reporters, 'we do not need to be in a hurry'' to make more cuts. The Fed is also cautious because progress against inflation has stalled in recent months after falling from four-decade highs hit in mid-2022. The European Central Bank cut its benchmark rate by a quarter point Thursday, underlining the contrast between more robust growth in the U.S. economy and stagnation in Europe, which recorded zero growth at the end of last year. The U.S. economic outlook has become more cloudy, however. Trump has promised to cut taxes and ease regulations on business, which could speed GDP growth. But his plan to impose big taxes on imports and to deport millions of immigrants working in the United States illegally could mean slower growth and higher prices. Trump said last week that he would lower oil prices and then 'demand'' lower interest rates – a topic he said he'd take up with Powell. But the Fed chair deflected questions about Trump's comments Wednesday and said he'd had no contact with the president. Trump has also tried to reshape the federal government, offering buyouts to workers and issuing a memo Monday night freezing federal grants, then rescinding the memo Wednesday after a public outcry. Citing the 'squeeze'' on the federal government, Ashworth wrote in a commentary, 'we wouldn't be surprised to see a reversal in the first quarter. As a starting point, we expect first-quarter GDP growth to slow marginally below 2%.'' Thursday's GDP release was the first of three Commerce Department estimates of October-December growth.	https://www.voanews.com/a/us-economy-grows-solid-2-3-in-october-december-on-eve-of-trump-return-to-white-house/7957945.html	2025-01-30T20:40:59-08:00

Ugandan nurse dies of Ebola	A male nurse in Uganda has died of Ebola, the first recorded death by the disease in the East African country since an outbreak ended in 2023, health officials said. The 32-year-old nurse worked at Mulago National Specialised Hospital in Kampala, Diana Atwine, permanent secretary of Uganda’s health ministry, said Thursday. The nurse died Wednesday of the Sudan strain of Ebola, Atwine said. He sought treatment at several hospitals and had also consulted with a traditional healer before tests confirmed an Ebola diagnosis, health officials said. World Health Organization Director-General Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus posted on X that his organization was supporting Uganda’s efforts to contain an Ebola outbreak in Uganda with a $1 million allocation from WHO’s Contingency Fund for Emergencies. Atwine said on her X social media account that 'rapid response teams are fully deployed, contact tracing is underway, and all necessary measures are in place to contain the situation. We assure the public that we are in full control.' Contact tracing, however, could be challenging in Kampala, with its population of 4 million people. The health ministry, however, reported that it had identified 44 contacts of the late nurse, which included 30 other health care workers. The symptoms of Ebola, an often fatal disease, include fever, vomiting, diarrhea, muscle pain, and at times internal and external bleeding. According to the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, health care workers and family members caring for someone with Ebola are at high risk for contracting the disease. WHO said Ebola 'is transmitted to people from wild animals (such as fruit bats, porcupines and non-human primates) and then spreads in the human population through direct contact with the blood, secretions, organs or other bodily fluids of infected people, and with surfaces and materials (e.g., bedding, clothing) contaminated with these fluids.' Ebola’s fatality rate is around 50%, WHO said on its website, but it also said that fatality rates have varied from 25% to 90% in some outbreaks.	https://www.voanews.com/a/ugandan-nurse-dies-of-ebola/7957916.html	2025-01-30T18:18:08-08:00

Washington crash mars long record of US aviation safety	A collision between a passenger jet and U.S. Army helicopter near Ronald Reagan Washington National Airport late Wednesday marked the first time in more than 15 years that there had been a mass fatality event in U.S. airspace related to commercial aviation. The accident, which killed a reported 67 people, took place while American Airlines Flight 5342 was making its final approach to the runway. The Bombardier CRJ700 regional jet and the Sikorsky H-60, commonly known as a Black Hawk, collided only a few hundred meters above the ground, officials said. The plane was carrying 60 passengers and four crew members. There were three service members aboard the military helicopter, including the pilot. Both aircraft crashed into the icy waters of the Potomac River, and authorities said Thursday that they didn't believe there were any survivors. The accident took place in darkness at 8:47 p.m., and no significant weather problems were reported. As of Thursday, authorities had not identified the cause of the accident. However, The New York Times on Thursday, citing an 'internal preliminary Federal Aviation Administration safety report' it reviewed, reported that staffing at the airport's air traffic control tower was 'not normal' Wednesday night. The newspaper said a single air traffic controller was directing incoming and outgoing plane traffic as well as helicopter traffic in the area. Those jobs are usually split between two controllers. Experts consider crash an anomaly Aviation experts said as tragic as the accident was, it should be considered an anomaly in an air traffic system that has been notably free of major disasters for many years. 'Some of it was luck. Some of it is technology. And mostly it was the tremendous job that the pilots and air traffic controllers do,' former United Airlines pilot Captain Ross 'Rusty' Aimer told VOA. 'They literally perform miracles every day because our system is extremely congested everywhere you go. ... And Washington National Airport is, perhaps in my 60 years in aviation, one of the most demanding and busiest airports in the world.' It is necessary to look back to 2009 to find a comparable commercial disaster in U.S. airspace. At that time, a Colgan Air jet en route from New Jersey to Buffalo, New York, stalled during its approach and crashed into a house, killing 49 passengers and crew, as well as one individual in the house. In 2013, an Asiana Airlines jet crashed while landing in San Francisco, California. Two passengers who were not wearing seat belts were killed when they were thrown from the plane, and another person died after being struck by an emergency response vehicle on the tarmac. There were 187 other people who suffered injuries, many serious, but no other fatalities. While there have been a number of other high-profile incidents involving U.S. airlines recently, none involved mass casualties. Last year, for example, a door plug blew out of an Alaska Airlines Boeing 737 Max in midflight, but the plane landed safely, though some passengers suffered minor injuries. Experts stressed that such events occur in only a tiny fraction of the millions of flights that take place in the U.S. every year. Robert W. Mann Jr., an airline industry analyst and former senior airline executive, told VOA that the U.S. commercial aviation industry experiences an extremely low level of safety incidents and 'an even lower level of fatality accidents.' 'That's not luck, that's effort,' he said. 'We're thankful to have so many professionals in the operating environment. In the oversight environment, focus on safety is the number one priority.' Crash occurs in crowded airspace The accident took place in one of the most crowded — and highly regulated — sectors of airspace in the United States. The Washington region has three major airports, 11 regional airports and dozens of heliports — not counting the multiple military installations in the region with aviation operations. Keith M. Cianfrani, a retired U.S. Army lieutenant colonel who served as a flight instructor and an accident investigator, told VOA he flew helicopters in the area where the accident took place while on active duty and later as a commercial pilot. 'It's congested,' said Cianfrani, who now works as an aviation safety consultant and adjunct professor at Embry‑Riddle Aeronautical University. 'So, it's not unusual to cross the path of an incoming [plane] as long as there is traffic separation.' Traffic separation refers to the distance, in time and space, between aircraft in the same area. But because of the congestion, there are very clear rules about where aircraft are allowed to be and when they can be there, Cianfrani said. Helicopters are required to follow specific routes when passing through the region, he said, calling it 'very uncommon' to see something like Wednesday's crash take place. 'As a whole, the general aviation industry in the United States is outstanding,' he said. 'They all have to adhere to what we call SMS — safety management systems. On a regular basis, they get audited. They have an internal audit program, and they're constantly being looked at by people like myself going in and auditing their safety program. So, it's outstanding.' Turnover in federal aviation oversight Wednesday's accident took place at a time when leadership of the federal agencies in charge of flight safety is being overhauled by the new administration of President Donald Trump. The day after his inauguration, Trump dismissed Transportation Security Administration Administrator David Pekoske and disbanded the Aviation Security Advisory Committee, which provides the federal government with recommendations for aviation safety. He also initiated a hiring freeze, preventing the hiring of new air traffic controllers. Secretary of Transportation Sean Duffy, who oversees the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA), was sworn in the day before the crash. Michael Whitaker, who served as administrator of the FAA in former President Joe Biden's administration, announced in December that he would resign his post on January 20, the day Trump took office. The new president has not yet nominated a permanent replacement for Whitaker, but on Thursday he named Chris Rocheleau, a former Air Force officer who has spent more than 20 years at the FAA, as interim administrator. Trump spreads blame With recovery teams still searching for bodies in the Potomac River on Thursday, Trump held a press conference and attempted to pin blame for the accident on the previous presidential administration. He asserted, with no proof or evidence, that the Biden administration had lowered hiring standards for air traffic controllers as part of its 'diversity, equity, and inclusion' efforts. Trump took particular aim at former Transportation Secretary Pete Buttigieg, saying he had driven the agency 'right into the ground with his diversity.' Buttigieg responded with a post on the social media platform X. 'Despicable,' Buttigieg wrote. 'As families grieve, Trump should be leading, not lying. We put safety first, drove down close calls, grew Air Traffic Control, and had zero commercial airline crash fatalities out of millions of flights on our watch. 'President Trump now oversees the military and the FAA,' he added. 'One of his first acts was to fire and suspend some of the key personnel who helped keep our skies safe. Time for the President to show actual leadership and explain what he will do to prevent this from happening again.'

Experts: Trump faces tough task to denuclearize North Korea	washington — The White House says President Donald Trump is going to pursue the denuclearization of North Korea, although analysts say that is easier said than done. White House National Security Council spokesperson Brian Hughes told VOA Korean via email this week that 'President Trump had a good relationship with [North Korean leader] Kim Jong Un,' and that Trump’s 'mix of toughness and diplomacy led to the first-ever leader-level commitment to complete denuclearization.' Trump and Kim met three times in 2018-19, in Singapore, Hanoi and over the inter-Korean border at Panmunjom. Trump, who has recently called North Korea 'a nuclear power,' said in an interview with Fox News last week that he would reach out to Kim again, adding, 'He liked me, and I got along with him.' Commitment to denuclearization Former U.S. government officials say there is no doubt that Trump is serious about resuming talks with Kim. Susan Thornton, a former senior U.S. diplomat for Asian affairs, told VOA Korean on Wednesday via email it 'seems clear that President Trump plans to pick up where he left off with Kim Jong Un in his first administration.' Thornton, who was acting assistant secretary of state for East Asian and Pacific affairs during the first Trump administration, said Trump would 'like to hold Kim and North Korea to the 2018 Singapore joint statement that included Kim’s commitment to the complete denuclearization of the Korean Peninsula.' However, 'much has changed since then, and Kim’s hand is stronger, so it won’t be easy,' Thornton said, referring to Pyongyang’s development of more advanced weapons. The state-run Korean Central News Agency, or KCNA, reported Wednesday that Kim said it was 'indispensable' to bolster nuclear forces, as North Korea continues to face 'confrontations with the most vicious, hostile countries.' Last Saturday, the North test-fired what it said were sea-to-surface strategic cruise-guided missiles. Kim, who inspected the test launch, said the country’s war deterrence means are 'being perfected more thoroughly,' according to KCNA. Evans Revere, former acting secretary for East Asia and Pacific affairs during the George W. Bush administration, told VOA Korean on the phone Wednesday that Kim would agree to come back to the table if he believed reengaging with Washington 'could help him attain any of his own goals with respect to his nuclear and missile programs and relations with the United States.' Revere is skeptical that any of Kim’s goals would include his regime’s denuclearization. 'The North Koreans might dangle the possibility of a discussion about denuclearization to attract the United States into a dialogue, but it would not be a serious proposal,' he said. 'Quite frankly, they are determined to keep their weapons, keep their capabilities, which they regard as essential to their own existence.' Daunting task Frank Aum, a senior expert on North Korea at the U.S. Institute of Peace who worked at the Department of Defense from 2010 to 2017, said denuclearization is not a realistic goal to achieve in the near or medium term. 'The best thing Trump can do to increase the odds of North Korea’s engagement is to resolve Russia’s war in Ukraine, which would decrease North Korea’s leverage and signal that a U.S. offer better than the one in Hanoi might be on the table,' Aum said in an email to VOA Korean. North Korea has sent about 10,000 troops to Russia to help Moscow in its war against Ukraine. In return, North Korea has received military or financial assistance, according to U.S. and South Korean officials. The February 2019 talks, in which Trump and Kim met for the second time, collapsed after Kim asked for full lifting of sanctions in exchange for the dismantling of the country’s main nuclear complex in Yongbyon, about 100 kilometers north of Pyongyang. Trump demanded more should be done on Kim’s end. Aum said Kim would likely not have budged from his position then. 'Trump may probe to see if he can get Kim to accept partial sanctions relief instead, like he tried at Hanoi, or offer more for Yongbyon,' Aum said. 'It seems clear that Kim will not offer any more security concessions than Yongbyon.' Sydney Seiler, a senior adviser at the Center for Strategic and International Studies, told VOA Korean via email on Wednesday that 'for now, it is unlikely any meeting, if it takes place, will reasonably be related to denuclearization.' 'Trump will likely seek to keep the ultimate goal of denuclearization alive while exploring ways in which to reduce the threat,' Seiler said. Referring to recent comments by U.S. Secretary of State Marco Rubio on the failure of sanctions to halt the North Korean nuclear program, Seiler speculated that sanctions relief may be offered for significant steps in the new talks between Washington and Pyongyang. Seiler added that military exercises and extended deterrence may also be reduced in terms of their frequency, volume and scale, in exchange for a halt or slowing of Kim's long-range missile launches and nuclear tests. In June 2018, Trump decided to suspend major military exercises with South Korea in an apparent gesture of good faith, right after his first meeting with Kim in Singapore. It raised some fears among South Koreans that such a move could weaken defense against the North.	https://www.voanews.com/a/experts-trump-faces-tough-task-to-denuclearize-north-korea-/7957893.html	2025-01-30T17:24:50-08:00	
Foreign officials begin meeting Syria's interim president	Foreign dignitaries and officials are beginning to travel to Syria to meet with Ahmed al-Sharaa, the country's newly appointed transitional president. Qatar's Emir Sheikh Tamim bin Hamad Al Thani became the first head of state to visit Damascus, Syria's capital, and meet with Sharaa. The Qatari royal court said the emir discussed with Sharaa 'the urgent need to form a government that represents all segments of the Syrian people.' Before being appointed to his current role, Sharaa was the leader of Hayat Tahrir al-Sham, a U.S.-designated terrorist group, that spearheaded the campaign in December to wrest control of the country from President Bashar al-Assad. Assad fled to Russia, ending more than half a century of oppressive rule by Bashar and his late father, Hafez. Qatar has been a longtime supporter of Syria's opposition. The foreign ministers of both countries held a press conference Thursday. 'The Syrian people won't forget Qatar's committed position while we open a new chapter in a new Syria,' Syrian Foreign Minister Asaad Hassan al-Shibani said. Qatar is looking forward to providing Syria with additional aid in the electrical and infrastructure arenas, Qatari Minister of State for Foreign Affairs Mohammed al-Khulaifi said. Promise of inclusive government On Wednesday, the commanders of the military factions that toppled the former regime named Sharaa, who has served as the de facto head of government since the fall of Assad, as president during the formation of a new government. Sharaa, who was once aligned with al-Qaida, is facing the daunting task of forming a temporary legislative council for the transitional period, as the previous parliament has been dissolved. Syria's constitution has also been annulled, and a new charter will be adopted. No timeline for the creation of a new parliament and constitution has been announced. Sharaa has promised to create an inclusive government and eventually elections. The elections could take as long as four years to arrange, Sharaa said, according to Reuters. Russians, Palestinians visit On Tuesday, delegations from Russia and the Palestinian Authority arrived in Syria. The Russian delegation included Deputy Foreign Minister Mikhail Bogdanov and Alexander Lavrentiev, Russia's special envoy for Syria, according to RIA Novosti. There was no official government comment on the itinerary of the Russian officials. However, the Russians were expected to meet with Sharaa and Syria's foreign minister, according to the semiofficial Al Watan newspaper. Syria has not cut all ties with Russia, where Assad is living in exile. Russian troops and assets remain in Syria, but they have all been relocated to Hmeimim Air Base, The Associated Press reported. A Palestinian Authority delegation that included Palestinian Prime Minister Mohammad Mustafa was in Syria on Tuesday to meet with Sharaa, but no details have been released. At one point, the U.S. placed a $10 million bounty on Sharaa, according to the AP. The bounty was removed recently after a U.S. delegation met him in Damascus. In a video released after the meeting with the Syrian factions, Sharaa said one of his top priorities would be filling 'in a legitimate and legal way' Syria's government. Another priority, he said, will be 'maintaining civil peace by seeking transitional justice and preventing revenge attacks' due to Assad's reign. Some information for this report came from Reuters and The Associated Press.	https://www.voanews.com/a/foreign-officials-begin-meeting-syria-s-interim-president/7957853.html	2025-01-30T17:08:21-08:00	
Analysts consider ramifications of ECOWAS members’ exit	ABUJA, NIGERIA — The departure of Burkina Faso, Mali and Niger from West Africa’s most influential bloc, the Economic Community of West African States (ECOWAS), raises concerns, especially in the areas of security and economics, according to regional analysts who spoke with VOA. Some say the split — the first time nations have quit the regional body since its creation a half-century ago — could weaken joint military operations and further destabilize the Sahel, a region already struggling with jihadist insurgencies. But on Wednesday, the day the decision was formally recognized by the bloc, ECOWAS Commission President Omar Alieu Touray told reporters in Abuja that the bloc was willing to continue security cooperation despite the split. ECOWAS also announced that its 'doors remain open' to the departing nations and urged the remaining 12 member states to continue to support them. 'I think that ECOWAS has taken a pragmatic approach about the unfolding situation,' said Rotimi Olawale, a political affairs analyst. 'I expect also that there would be continued cooperation around security issues. Issues of peace and security pose a big challenge.' Junta-led Mali, Niger and Burkina Faso officially quit the regional body on Wednesday after a yearlong notice. Relations between ECOWAS and the departing trio of member states soured after a July 2023 coup in Niger, which led ECOWAS to threaten military intervention. In 2023, the three states formed their own bloc, the Alliance of Sahel States, seeking closer ties with Russia. Touray said ECOWAS plans to hold a technical session with the three countries to discuss the way forward. Chris Kwaja, the Nigerian director at the United States Institute of Peace, said 'there are so many issues, so I think a technical session of that nature is important to allow each party to weigh where it stands on the issue of separation.' Trade is one of them. Analysts say economic challenges may loom large for the three departing nations, especially regarding access to maritime ports to the south. 'The countries will get to a point where they will seek at the very least greater cooperation with ECOWAS countries, as they would require access to the port,' said Olawale. 'The three countries are landlocked, so they'll continue to depend on the subregion for trade partnership to ensure that they continue to have a booming economy. My predictions are that the three countries are coming back to ECOWAS, perhaps not in the short term.' In recent years, ECOWAS, which was founded to promote economic integration, has faced increasing challenges in maintaining stability across the region. Kwaja said public sentiment toward ECOWAS is shifting because some citizens view the bloc as an entity that primarily protects the interests of regional leaders rather than the masses. 'ECOWAS was a bit detached from its citizens,' said Kwaja. 'Now a big lesson for ECOWAS should be to invest heavily in the people, back to the point about the ECOWAS agenda of moving away from an ECOWAS [of] state to an ECOWAS of the people, because the people constitute the pillar upon which ECOWAS is [sitting].' The Sahel region has become the world’s deadliest terrorism hot spot, accounting for the highest number of terror-related deaths last year. The outcome of the looming technical session remains uncertain, and many will be watching to see how ECOWAS moves past its most significant political crisis in decades.	https://www.voanews.com/a/analysts-consider-ramifications-of-ecowas-members-exit/7957552.html	2025-01-30T17:00:29-08:00

US lawmakers weigh cost of foreign aid freeze in competition with China	U.S. lawmakers Thursday weighed the impact that President Donald Trump's 90-day foreign aid freeze will have on competition with China. Trump signed an executive order within hours of being sworn in as president ordering a halt to all U.S. international assistance while the new administration determines whether the aid aligns with his 'America First' policy. Senate Foreign Relations Committee Chairman Jim Risch said the move was a necessary step to prioritize fiscal responsibility as the U.S. faces a debt of $36 trillion. 'This is obviously a work in progress,' Risch, a Republican from Idaho, said Thursday. 'It was intended to underscore the fact that we're going into debt at the rate of $1 trillion every 100 days. I think that has certainly been underscored as a result of this. If you think this is bad, when our debtors come and want their money and we can't pay it, that's going to be really bad,' Risch said. 'It's caused everyone to take a breath and look at how we're spending our money, where we're spending our money, seeing that it's done as efficiently as possible. Admittedly, there have been some inconveniences along the line, but they're continuing to work on this.' Democrats said the pause in aid creates a void that will be filled by the People's Republic of China (PRC). 'I'm particularly concerned about the expansion of China's influence, both at home and abroad, as a result of a freeze on our foreign assistance — and, in particular, the way it's implemented in its cascading effect,' Democratic Senator Chris Coons of Delaware said in a hearing about Chinese influence abroad. 'There is nothing China wants to do more than limit the reach of our global influence, than to reinforce its imprint,' Coons added. '[That way] we're an unreliable partner with countries throughout the world and particularly in the Global South, and my concern is that we put our security, our economic and our diplomatic interest at risk with an abrupt pause that puts a halt to actions to counter malign activity by the PRC, to advance to invest in infrastructure.' But Senator Jeanne Shaheen of New Hampshire, the top Democrat on the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, said Democrats should not be the only ones concerned about evaluating and restoring the aid. 'I hope that all of you on the other side of the aisle will share your concerns with the administration and point out that this is not a partisan issue,' she said. 'This is about what are we going to do to ensure that our influence continues around the world in the interest of our own national security.' Around the world, U.S.-funded foreign aid programs have already begun shutting down their programming and laying off staff in the wake of the freeze. The U.S. is the world's largest foreign aid provider but is outspent by China in some areas. According to the Government Accountability Office, between 2013 and 2022, China spent $679 billion on global infrastructure projects compared with the United States' $76 billion. 'Foreign aid is a really important arrow in the quiver of U.S. national security, along with other tools such as diplomacy, military assistance and so on,' Jennifer Lind, an associate professor of government at Dartmouth College, told lawmakers Thursday. 'And so ideally, we would want to be using all of our different tools in a coordinated fashion to achieve our objectives. For that reason, I think it's understandable if the administration wants to take a short pause and assess: Are we using the right tools in the right way?' But Melanie Hart of the Atlantic Council said the freeze 'is hobbling America's ability to compete with China in every domain.' 'Over $1 billion more foreign military financing for Taiwan. Frozen. NDI [National Democratic Institute] and IRI [International Republican Institute] are shutting down global operations. Human rights organizations — frozen,' she said. 'Washington has effectively abandoned the Hong Kong pro-democracy movement.' Hart said she understood the administration's desire to maximize the strategic focus of the aid and appreciated the State Department's waivers, but that 'this broad freeze hobbles America at a moment when we are in the battle of the century.' 'It is a massive gift to Beijing. The longer it goes on, the harder it will be to regain the ground we are already losing today, tomorrow and this week,' Hart said. U.S. Secretary of State Marco Rubio issued a waiver last Friday unfreezing emergency food assistance and earlier this week issued another waiver unfreezing humanitarian assistance. The top Democrat on the House Select Committee on Strategic Competition with China on Thursday welcomed Rubio's waivers but said more had to be done. 'While periodic review of foreign assistance programs' contribution to U.S. national security is necessary, abruptly freezing any foreign assistance directly cedes ground to our foremost adversary: the CCP,' said Representative Raja Krishnamoorthi, a Democrat from Illinois, in a statement. 'At a time when the CCP is aggressively investing abroad, rerouting supply chains and buying authoritarian favor, the United States must double down on foreign assistance — not kneecap ourselves.'	https://www.voanews.com/a/us-lawmakers-weigh-cost-of-foreign-aid-freeze-in-competition-with-china/7957852.html	2025-01-30T16:24:42-08:00	
Zelenskyy condemns Russian strike that killed 9 as ‘terrible tragedy’	Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy condemned an early Thursday morning Russian drone strike that killed at least nine people as a 'terrible tragedy.' The drone, which struck an apartment building in the city of Sumy in northeastern Ukraine, also injured 13 people, according to regional authorities. 'This is a terrible tragedy, a terrible Russian crime. It is very important that the world does not stop putting pressure on Russia for this terror,' Zelenskyy said on Telegram. Police said the search-and-rescue operation had concluded after 19 hours. Three elderly couples were among those killed, and an 8-year-old child was among those wounded. The child’s mother was killed in the attack. '[Russian President Vladimir] Putin claims to be ready for negotiations, but this is what he actually does,' Ukrainian Foreign Minister Andrii Sybiha said on social media. Russia launched 81 drones at Ukraine overnight, the Ukrainian military said Thursday. The attacks damaged businesses and homes around the country, according to the military. In the southern region of Odesa, the attack damaged a grain warehouse and a hospital, according to the governor. Meanwhile, James Anderson, a British man who was captured while fighting on the Ukrainian side in Russia’s Kursk region, will face terrorism and mercenary charges, Russian state investigators said Thursday. Russia announced in November that it had captured Anderson. Also, the review and 90-day freeze on U.S. foreign aid means Ukrainian aid groups that rely on U.S. funding are being forced to cut services. Zelenskyy said U.S. military assistance to Ukraine was not affected by U.S. President Donald Trump’s freeze on foreign aid, but the Ukrainian president still expressed concern about the funding pause.

After fires, Los Angeles gets moonshot moment to rebuild	As Los Angeles recovers from its devastating wildfires, environmental engineers, urban planners and natural disaster experts are casting forward with visions of what could come next for neighborhoods that have been reduced to ash and rubble. Apartment buildings could spring up where strip malls and parking lots once stood, with locals walking to ground-floor shops, offices and cafes, European-style. The city could 'infill' vertically to add affordable housing in safer downtown areas, rather than outwards with more single-family homes on fire-prone hills. Some blocks could be turned into buffer zones, where no building was allowed. And the city's trademark palm trees, which burn like Roman candles, could be replaced with fire-resistant native trees. These are some of the bold ideas academics have for Los Angeles as it recovers from the Eaton and Palisades fires, which killed 28 people and damaged or destroyed nearly 16,000 structures. Together, the blazes charred 152 square kilometers — an area larger than Paris. The city is far from rebuilding, with many people only now being allowed back to their burned neighborhoods. When construction does begin, few of the dozen experts Reuters spoke to expected their dream plans to be adopted, citing factors ranging from lack of future insurance coverage to political pressure to rebuild as before. Nonetheless, experts in urban development, climate change and housing said Los Angeles has a chance to think outside the box. Many also said there should be no rush to rebuild. Instead, residents of Pacific Palisades and Altadena should be afforded time to decide what their future communities should look like and dream big. 'The biggest thing is how do we promote infill development in safer areas,' said Emily Schlickman, assistant professor of landscape architecture and environmental design at the University of California, Davis, who suggests retreating from fire-prone peripheries. Model cities Los Angeles could learn from cities like Kobe, Japan, decimated by a 1995 earthquake, where officials imposed a two-month building moratorium, said Columbia University's Jeffrey Schlegelmilch. 'One of the most important things is to give yourself time to come up with a robust solution,' said Schlegelmilch, director of the National Center for Disaster Preparedness at the university's climate school. Then there are Houston's Harris County and the city of San Antonio, Texas, which bought up homes and properties to reduce future flood risk. In the case of Harris County, authorities offered willing sellers pre-flood market values for homes flooded during Hurricane Harvey in 2017 then demolished them. Char Miller, a professor of environmental analysis and history at Pomona College in Claremont, California, is among those who point to Texas' experience. While buying up properties in Pacific Palisades and Altadena would be costly, Miller said, it would be possible with the financial support of the city, county, state and possibly insurers. Burned-out lots could be turned into what he envisions as fire buffer zones. While disruptive to residents, Miller believes many would be willing to use the money to relocate. 'People go, 'Yeah, I don't want to be in danger, and you're buying me out. Yeah, thank you,'' said Miller. He despairs at city and state efforts to fast-track redevelopment in areas that burned at a similar housing density. 'They just pulled the plug on the moonshot,' Miller said. Alice Hill, a senior fellow for energy and the environment at the Council on Foreign Relations think tank, wants to see more green spaces like playing fields and bike paths between fire-risk areas and homes. 'It simply is unsafe to rebuild communities where they were, and retreating may be the wisest approach,' Hill wrote in a Jan. 14 essay. A little more panache Other experts advocate rebuilding the communities but in a way that will resist fire. 'The only way to do this impactfully is to do it communitywide so if the fire gets in, it has a hard time moving on,' said Michael Gollner, a professor of mechanical engineering at University of California, Berkeley. Gollner tests prototype houses to see how they handle flames. Homes can be made more fire-resistant by moving a wooden fence back five feet (1.5 meters), surrounding a house with gravel and putting mesh over attic vents to stop embers, he said. Then there is landscaping, a contentious subject for some homeowners. 'Who wants to cut down their juniper? But come a wildfire, your juniper is a torch,' said Gollner. Ecologists suggest Los Angelenos replace palms, junipers and eucalyptus with trees that evolved to survive fire, such as California oaks. The species has thick bark that resists flames and leathery leaves that burn slowly. 'There are lots of people who are working to plant oaks, and I think there's some effort in giving them more panache,' said Alexandra Syphard, a San Diego-based wildfire ecologist at the Conservation Biology Institute. For Hussam Mahmoud, a professor in civil and environmental engineering at Colorado State University, the key is predicting the path of future fires. He has developed a model that calculates which buildings will burn, allowing a community to fire-harden 'super spreader' structures, rather than fully adapt every house to resist wildfires. Hardening a home begins with using metal or concrete for a roof and fire-retardant materials on the sides. Multipane windows are less likely to break from the heat and cause a home to burn from within. 'When the fires hit L.A., it's clear that nobody knew what was going to happen, which buildings were more likely to burn,' said Mahmoud.	https://www.voanews.com/a/after-fires-los-angeles-gets-moonshot-moment-to-rebuild/7957503.html	2025-01-30T14:27:47-08:00	
Republican senator airs concerns about supporting RFK Jr to be US health secretary	WASHINGTON — A key Republican senator on Thursday said he was struggling with Robert F. Kennedy Jr.'s nomination by President Donald Trump to run the top U.S. health agency, saying he had reservations about the nominee's 'misleading arguments' on vaccines. 'Your past of undermining confidence in vaccines with unfounded or misleading arguments concerns me,' Republican Senator Bill Cassidy, a physician from Louisiana, told Kennedy. 'I have been struggling with the nomination,' he said at the end of Thursday's Senate health committee hearing to consider Kennedy to run the massive Department of Health and Human Services. 'Does a 70-year-old man ... who spent decades criticizing vaccines and who's financially vested in finding fault with vaccines, can he change his attitudes and approach now that he'll have the most important position influencing vaccine policy in the United States?' Cassidy said. The hearing was the second in two days for Kennedy during which he squared off with Democrats and some Republicans over his past comments on vaccines, abortion and COVID-19 among other topics. The Finance Committee, which Kennedy appeared before on Wednesday, has not yet said if it will send Kennedy's nomination to the full Republican-controlled Senate, which has not rejected any of Trump's nominees so far. A spokesperson for the Finance Committee said a vote could potentially take place next week, but that one had not yet been scheduled. Cassidy, who sits on both committees, told Kennedy at the end of Thursday's hearing that Kennedy would be hearing from him over the weekend, presumably regarding questions he has over the nomination. Kennedy's nomination could fail to move to the Senate for consideration if all Democrats on the Finance Committee voted against him and were joined by Cassidy. During wide-ranging questioning on Thursday, Kennedy spoke more confidently than the day prior, adjusting the characterization of previous statements, and saying he would support the U.S. children's vaccination schedule, research and development for bird flu, and scientific data on vaccine safety. Kennedy also said he would address rapidly increasing rates of chronic disease. 'Our country is not going to be destroyed because we get the marginal tax rate wrong. It is going to be destroyed if we get this issue wrong,' he said of chronic diseases. 'And I am in a unique position to be able to stop this epidemic.' He was asked about comments he has made over decades, including that it was 'highly likely' that Lyme disease was a military bioweapon. He said he never said that it was definitively created in a biolab. He would not answer a question from Senator Bernie Sanders about whether he agreed that vaccines do not cause autism. He also said he did not know if the coronavirus vaccine saved millions of lives. 'If you come out unequivocally, 'vaccines are safe, it does not cause autism' that would have an incredible impact,' Cassidy said. Kennedy has said vaccines are linked to autism, and he opposed state and federal restrictions imposed during the COVID-19 pandemic. The causes of autism are unclear, though theories that childhood vaccines cause autism have been widely debunked and are contrary to scientific evidence. Kennedy, who founded the anti-vaccine group Children's Health Defense, argued during both hearings that he was not against vaccines. The group has sued in state and federal courts over vaccines. 'News reports and many in the hearing yesterday have claimed that I'm anti-vaccine and anti-industry. Well, I'm neither,' Kennedy said, repeating that his children are vaccinated. Thursday's hearing in front of the Senate Committee on Health, Education, Labor and Pensions is a courtesy hearing with no vote involved. However, Republican Senators Cassidy, Lisa Murkowski and Susan Collins sit on the committee, all of whom are seen as potential swing votes against Kennedy. Supporters of Kennedy wearing 'Make America Healthy Again' hats crowded around the committee hearing room on Thursday, while some opposing his confirmation wore 'Reject RFK Jr' stickers on their shirts. 'Catastrophic' impacts If confirmed, Kennedy would run HHS, which oversees more than $3 trillion in healthcare spending, including at the Food and Drug Administration and the agency in charge of the Medicare and Medicaid health insurance programs covering nearly half of all Americans. He said he would follow Trump's direction on abortion and would hire for his department those who are against abortion rights. Kennedy also said gender-affirming care for children has 'catastrophic' impacts and that children are not equipped to make judgments about receiving such care. He said he would rescind a Biden-era rule that requires medical providers who receive federal funding to offer gender-affirming care. Kennedy said farmers should be offered an off-ramp from chemically intensive agriculture, and that illness in farm communities is 'undoubtedly' related to the use of pesticides. Some farm and food groups have expressed concern about Kennedy's positions on pesticides and food additives. Opposition groups have ramped up their efforts to persuade Republican senators to vote against Kennedy. Caroline Kennedy, another member of the storied American political family, on Tuesday urged senators to vote against her cousin's nomination, calling him a predator with dangerous views on health care. Kennedy has also faced scrutiny over his ties to Wisner Baum, a law firm specializing in pharmaceutical drug injury cases. He has an arrangement to earn 10% of fees awarded in contingency cases he refers to the firm, according to a letter Kennedy wrote to an HHS ethics official released last week. If confirmed, Kennedy would retain that financial interest in cases that do not directly impact the U.S. government, the letter said. If his nomination goes to the full Senate, Kennedy would need the support of at least 50 senators, which would allow Vice President JD Vance to cast another tie-breaking vote to confirm his nomination.	https://www.voanews.com/a/republican-senator-airs-concerns-about-supporting-rfk-jr-to-be-us-health-secretary/7957459.html	2025-01-30T14:17:33-08:00
