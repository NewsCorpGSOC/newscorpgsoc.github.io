Vatican: Francis stable, out of ‘imminent danger’ of death	The Vatican issued an update Saturday on the health of Pope Francis, who remains in Rome’s Gemelli hospital under the care of doctors, saying that while his prognosis remains 'complex,' the pope is no longer in 'imminent danger' of death. On Friday, the Vatican’s Holy See Press Office announced that since Francis’ condition is now considered stable, barring any major developments, updates on his health will be less frequent. The 88-year-old pontiff has spent four weeks in the hospital and is receiving treatment for double pneumonia. Medical bulletins from the pope’s doctors, which had been almost a daily occurrence since his admission to Gemelli hospital on Feb. 14, will be issued only when there is new information, the press office said Friday. The office emphasized that Francis’ recovery is progressing, but that it will require time to make sure the improvements continue. This also means the Holy See's daily morning update about how the pope spent the night will no longer be issued, which leaves only the evening news briefing for journalists. The Vatican said that this is a 'a positive sign' for the Catholic faithful, meaning that no news is essentially good news. Francis is continuing his prescribed medical treatments, which included motor physiotherapy Friday. He alternates between noninvasive mechanical ventilation at night and high-flow oxygenation with nasal cannulas during the day, according to the Vatican. Francis had part of a lung removed as a young man after a pulmonary infection and has in recent years battled recurring bouts of bronchitis. On Thursday, the press office said Francis celebrated the 12th anniversary of his papal election surrounded by health care staff. Part of the pope’s hospital stay comes during the Christian season of Lent. It is the annual 40-day period of prayer, fasting and almsgiving that begins on Ash Wednesday and ends at sundown on Holy Thursday. Lent began on March 5.	https://www.voanews.com/a/vatican-francis-stable-out-of-imminent-danger-of-death/8011730.html	2025-03-15T11:09:19-07:00	
Starmer: ‘Sooner or later’ Russia must yield to peace	Britain’s leader encouraged his global counterparts to continue pushing for a ceasefire between Russia and Ukraine at the start of a virtual meeting Saturday intended to end the fighting between the two countries. British Prime Minister Keir Starmer told a virtual meeting of mostly European leaders that 'sooner or later' Russia would have to engage in talks on reaching a ceasefire in the three-year conflict. He addressed the group, described as a 'coalition of the willing,' of mostly European leaders as well as those from Australia, New Zealand and Canada but not the United States. 'Sooner or later, he’s going to have to come to the table,' Starmer said of Russian President Vladimir Putin, whose country invaded Ukraine on Feb. 24, 2022. Earlier, U.S. President Donald Trump urged Moscow to accept a ceasefire deal agreed to by U.S. and Ukrainian delegations in Saudi Arabia, and U.S. Secretary of State Marco Rubio had said 'the ball is in Russia's court.' Putin has said he agrees with a ceasefire in theory, but Russia still has certain conditions and questions that must be addressed before accepting any agreement. In his nightly video address, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy suggested that Putin is stalling and has demanded so many preconditions 'that nothing will work out at all.' Meanwhile, the U.S. has expanded sanctions on Russian oil and gas as well as its financial sectors. Saturday’s discussion among world leaders could address future military and financial support for Ukraine and Zelenskyy’s security concerns if a peace deal is reached. Zelenskyy attended Saturday’s online video session.	https://www.voanews.com/a/starmer-sooner-or-later-russia-must-yield-to-peace/8011681.html	2025-03-15T08:56:05-07:00	
NASA, SpaceX launch crew to space station to retrieve stuck astronauts	The replacement crew for the International Space Station was launched late Friday, paving the way for the return home of Butch Wilmore and Suni Williams, two NASA astronauts stuck on the space station for nine months. The SpaceX Falcon 9 rocket lifted off at 7:03 p.m. from NASA’s Kennedy Space Center in Florida carrying Crew-10 members: NASA’s Anne McClain and Nichole Ayers, Japan’s Takuya Onishi and Russia’s Kirill Peskov. The crew is part of a routine six-month rotation. Crew-10 and the Dragon spacecraft are expected to reach the space station around 11:30 p.m. Saturday. Returning to Earth alongside Wilmore and Williams will be NASA astronaut Nick Hague and Russian cosmonaut Aleksandr Gorbunov. Their return is scheduled for Wednesday, to allow for an overlap of the two crews to brief the new team. Wilmore and Williams arrived aboard the International Space Station in June 2024 and expected to stay in space for about 10 days. But their return was delayed after mechanical issues with their spacecraft, which, after weeks of troubleshooting was subsequently sent back to Earth without them. Their return was continually pushed back due to other technical delays.	https://www.voanews.com/a/nasa-spacex-launch-crew-to-space-station-to-retrieve-stuck-astronauts/8011575.html	2025-03-15T03:04:44-07:00	
Starbucks hit with $50 million fine for spilled drink injury	A California jury Friday imposed a $50 million fine on Starbucks in the case of a delivery driver burned by a scalding cup of hot tea at a company location in Los Angeles. Michael Garcia was picking up three drinks in 2020 but one, he claimed, was 'negligently' unsecured and spilled in his lap. He claimed that he consequently 'suffered severe burns, disfigurement, and debilitating nerve damage to his genitals' and he was taken to an emergency room by paramedics. 'Michael Garcia’s life has been forever changed,' his attorney, Nick Rowley, said. 'No amount of money can undo the permanent catastrophic harm he has suffered, but this jury verdict is a critical step in holding Starbucks accountable for flagrant disregard for customer safety and failure to accept responsibility,' he added. Starbucks said it planned to appeal the verdict. 'We sympathize with Mr. Garcia, but we disagree with the jury’s decision that we were at fault for this incident and believe the damages awarded to be excessive,' company spokesperson Jaci Anderson said in a statement. 'We have always been committed to the highest safety standards in our stores, including the handling of hot drinks,' she added.	https://www.voanews.com/a/8011572.html	2025-03-15T02:47:48-07:00	
US Appeals court allows DEI crackdown	A U.S. federal appeals court Friday lifted a block on the Trump administration’s crackdown on diversity, equity and inclusion programs in the federal government, pausing a lower court ruling blocking enforcement of a series of presidential executive orders halting support of DEI initiatives. The three-judge panel on the Fourth Circuit of Appeals, in Richmond, Virginia, found that the directives by President Donald Trump were likely constitutional, disagreeing with a ruling in February by a federal judge in Maryland. The judges are allowing the Trump administration to implement the policy while they consider a final decision on the constitutionality of the orders. U.S. District Judge Adam Abelson in Baltimore had blocked implementation of Trump’s executive order nationwide pending the outcome of a lawsuit brought by the city of Baltimore and groups that claimed, among other things, the executive orders -- one abolishing DEI programs in the federal government and another requiring recipients of federal grants to not operate DEI programs -- improperly targeted constitutionally protected free speech. The Trump administration maintains the orders do not ban or discourage any speech but target instead unlawful discrimination. In addition to directing federal agencies to end diversity programs, the executive orders also precluded federal contractors from having them. Trump also ordered the Justice Department and other agencies to identify businesses, schools and nonprofit organizations that were deemed unlawfully discriminating through DEI policies.	https://www.voanews.com/a/us-appeals-court-allows-dei-crackdown/8011570.html	2025-03-15T02:35:26-07:00	
UN: Iran using drones to enforce hijab law	A Friday report by the United Nations says Iran is using advanced technology, including drones, facial recognition and a citizen-reporting app to crack down on violations of its mandatory hijab laws. A key element of the effort is the government-backed Nazer app, which enables the police and 'vetted' members of the public to report alleged violations by women in vehicles, including those in ambulances, mass transit and taxis. The report describes the app as allowing users to upload the vehicle license plate, location and time of an alleged violation. It then, according to the report, alerts police. Then, according to the report, the app 'triggers a text message (in real-time) to the registered owner of the vehicle, warning them that they had been found in violation of the mandatory hijab laws, and that their vehicles would be impounded for ignoring these warnings.' According to the report, authorities are using drones in Tehran and the southern part of the country to monitor hijab compliance in public areas, as well as new facial recognition software said to have been installed last year at the entrance of Tehran’s Amirkabir University. The report is to go to the U.N. Human Rights Council on Tuesday.	https://www.voanews.com/a/un-iran-using-drones-to-enforce-hijab-law/8011563.html	2025-03-15T01:49:23-07:00	
Widespread power outage in Cuba leaves millions in dark	Cuba’s power grid failed Friday night, leaving millions of the island nation’s 10 million residents in the dark. The outage, which began around 8 p.m. Eastern time, affected most of western Cuba, including the capital of Havana. Cuba has struggled with blackouts in recent months, including a nationwide one in December. Friday’s power failure was the fourth widespread one in five months. Government officials blame U.S. economic sanctions for the ongoing crisis, while others point to aging infrastructure, fuel shortages and the island’s susceptibility to hurricanes. Vicente de la O Levy, Cuba's minister of energy and mines, said on X Friday night that the country was making progress in restoring electricity. He gave no reason for the power grid’s crash apart from saying it started at the Diezmero substation, which then caused the National Electric System to fail. Power was still out early Saturday morning; officials gave no estimation of when it would be restored. CNN showed footage from Havana showing the city in darkness and pedestrians walking with flashlights. In October, a dayslong power outage forced some in Havana to resort to cooking over improvised stoves in the street. The situation also spurred protests, a rarity in the communist nation. Protesters blocked streets with heaps of trash before security forces dispersed them. At the time, O Levy dismissed the protests as 'isolated and minimal incidents.'	https://www.voanews.com/a/widespread-power-outage-in-cuba-leaves-millions-in-dark-/8011557.html	2025-03-15T01:15:11-07:00	
Forecasters warn of tornadoes in US in coming days	U.S. weather forecasters warned of the threat of tornados in multiple states this weekend following at least five twisters in the state of Missouri on Friday. Friday's storms left some 100,000 buildings without power as severe weather continued into the night. The tornado risk was expected to continue into the weekend in a slew of states including Mississippi, Louisiana and Alabama. Accuweather predicted the storm risk to peak from Saturday afternoon to Saturday night. The National Weather Service warned of heavy thunderstorms from the Midwest to the Mississippi Valley, bringing with them the chance of flash flooding, power outages, downed trees and travel disruptions. In Alabama, Governor Kay Ivey issued a state of emergency on Friday, extending into Sunday. In her proclamation, she said 'this severe weather could cause significant damage to public and private property and poses a danger to the health and safety of the people of Alabama, including potential disruption of essential utility systems, personal injury and loss of life.' The proclamation means the state National Guard will be on alert and could be activated. Missouri also declared a state of emergency. Forecasters expect the thunderstorms to swamp the South and move toward the East Coast on Saturday night into Sunday. Although the tornado threat is expected to decrease, the East Coast will likely face hail and potentially damaging wind gusts. The storm system is expected to move off into the Atlantic Ocean sometime Sunday night into Monday.	https://www.voanews.com/a/forecasters-warn-of-tornadoes-in-us-in-coming-days/8011541.html	2025-03-14T23:11:12-07:00

Trump vows accountability for those who pursued him in court cases	U.S. President Donald Trump promised to seek accountability for those who pursued legal cases against him when he was out of office, speaking Friday at the Justice Department. 'Our predecessors turned this Department of Justice into the Department of Injustice. But I stand before you today to declare that those days are over, and they are never going to come back. They're never coming back,' Trump said. During his years out of office, the department twice indicted Trump on charges that he illegally stored classified documents at his Florida estate and that he worked to overturn the results of the 2020 presidential election. Both cases were dismissed after Trump won election in November, with the department citing a long-standing policy of not prosecuting a sitting president. 'Now, as the chief law enforcement officer in our country, I will insist upon and demand full and complete accountability for the wrongs and abuses that have occurred. The American people have given us a mandate, a mandate like few people thought possible,' Trump said. Trump has fired prosecutors who investigated him during the Biden administration and scrutinized thousands of FBI agents who investigated some supporters of the president who stormed the U.S. Capitol on Jan. 6, 2021. Representative Jamie Raskin, the senior Democrat on the House Judiciary Committee, called Trump’s speech a 'staggering violation of [the] traditional boundary between independent criminal law enforcement and presidential political power.' Speaking outside Justice shortly after Trump spoke, Raskin said, 'No other president in American history has stood at the Department of Justice to proclaim an agenda of criminal prosecution and retaliation against his political foes.' Trump has long been critical of both the department and the FBI. He has installed political allies into top leadership positions at both of those agencies. FBI Director Kash Patel and Attorney General Pam Bondi attended Friday’s talk. In introducing Trump, Bondi said, 'We all work for the greatest president in the history of our country. ... He will never stop fighting for us, and we will never stop fighting for him and for our country.' During his speech, Trump promised 'historic reforms' at the agencies and said, 'Under the Trump administration, the DOJ and the FBI will once again become the premier crime fighting agencies on the face of the Earth.' His speech had echos of his campaign rallies, with music blaring from speakers before Trump entered the department’s Great Hall and his address hitting on some of the main themes from his campaign, including border security and fighting violent crime. On crime, Trump said that homicides, property crime and robberies rose during the Biden administration. 'I have no higher mission as president of the United States than to end this killing and stop this law breaking and to making America safe again. And that's what you're all about in this room. We want to protect Americans, and we protect everybody that's in our country,' he said.	https://www.voanews.com/a/trump-vows-accountability-for-those-who-pursued-him-in-court-cases-/8011522.html	2025-03-14T20:12:18-07:00	
US to expel South Africa ambassador as relations deteriorate	U.S. Secretary of State Marco Rubio announced Friday that South Africa's ambassador to Washington had been declared persona non grata, signaling worsening relations between the two countries. In a post on X, Rubio said South Africa's ambassador to the U.S., Ebrahim Rasool, was 'no longer welcome in our great country.' 'Ebrahim Rasool is a race-baiting politician who hates America and hates @POTUS [President of the United States].' There has been no immediate response from South Africa's embassy in Washington. Rubio's move came amid tense relations between the U.S. and South Africa. President Donald Trump recently signed an executive order suspending aid to South Africa over a controversial land expropriation act that Trump said would lead to the takeover of white-owned farms. Trump also said that South African farmers were welcome to settle in the United States. South Africa's President Cyril Ramaphosa, in a post on X, defended his government's measure. 'We are guided by the Constitution, which places a responsibility on the state to take measures to redress the effects of past racial discrimination,' he said. 'We have expressed concern about the mischaracterisation of the situation in South Africa and certain of our laws and our foreign policy positions,' Ramaphosa said after Trump signed the executive order in early February.	https://www.voanews.com/a/us-to-expel-south-africa-ambassador-as-relations-deteriorate/8011493.html	2025-03-14T19:05:55-07:00	
2 judges rule mass firings of agency employees to be illegal	Federal judges in two separate cases ruled this week that recent mass firings of employees as part of President Donald Trump’s push to cut the size of the federal workforce were illegal and ordered thousands of probationary employees to be reinstated — at least for now. The Trump administration pushed back, filing appeals in both cases. 'This injunction is entirely unconstitutional,' White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt said Friday. 'You cannot have a low-level district court judge filing an injunction to usurp the executive authority of the president of the United States,' she added. In the suit filed by federal employee unions, U.S. District Judge William Alsup of the Northern District of California said that the process had been a 'sham,' as some employees were told they were being fired for poor performance. Just before issuing his ruling Thursday, Alsup said, 'It is sad, a sad day. Our government would fire some good employee and say it was based on performance when they know good and well that's a lie.' The departments of Agriculture, Defense, Energy, Interior, Treasury and Veterans Affairs were ordered to 'immediately' rehire the employees. Alsup, however, noted that federal agencies may still proceed with reductions in force, following proper procedure. Later Thursday, U.S. District Judge James Bredar also ruled that probationary employees must be reinstated after finding that 18 agencies had acted illegally in firing them. Democratic attorneys general representing the District of Columbia, Maryland and 18 other states argued that agencies failed to follow proper procedures for mass layoffs, including providing states with 60 days' notice. 'Lacking the notice to which they were entitled, the states weren't ready for the impact of so many unemployed people. They are still scrambling to catch up,' Bredar wrote in his memorandum explaining his decision.	https://www.voanews.com/a/judges-rule-mass-firings-of-agency-employees-to-be-illegal-/8011510.html	2025-03-14T19:03:43-07:00	
Millions celebrate Hindu Holi festival, approach of spring	Hindus across India and other South Asian countries, dressed mostly in white, smeared or sprayed friends and relatives with brightly colored powder Friday as millions celebrated the return of spring during Holi, the festival of colors. Friday is a nationwide holiday in India, so people can participate in the raucous, joyfully messy celebration, which usually lands on the last full moon of the lunar month heralding the end of winter. In neighboring Nepal, festival activities began Thursday and stretched across two days. The boisterous festival is observed in other South Asian countries and by many in the Indian diaspora. Holi is one of India's biggest festivals, and millions of people make nostalgic journeys to their hometowns to celebrate with loved ones by lighting bonfires on festival eve, which signifies the triumph of good over evil. Gathering around the flames, family members sing, dance and pray to Hindu gods. Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi posted Holi greetings to the nation on social media Friday. In a post on X, Modi wrote about the important benefits of the festival in bringing people together. 'Happy Holi to all of you. It is my wish that this holy festival full of joy and happiness infuses new enthusiasm and energy in everyone's life and also deepens the color of unity of the countrymen,' Modi posted in Hindi. In one New Delhi park so many people hurled colored powder at one another that the air took on a rainbow haze, while others danced in the streets to music blaring from speakers. Water guns were the weaponry of choice for groups of young men who chased festival participants, already drenched in a variety of hues, through public parks and side streets. Children took aim from a greater distance, perched on rooftops or balconies, where they flung water balloons filled with colored pigments and glitter at the revelers below. The annual event also celebrates the mythical love affair between the Hindu god Krishna and his consort Radha. On a larger scale, it signifies rebirth and rejuvenation across Hindu culture.	https://www.voanews.com/a/millions-celebrate-hindu-holi-festival-approach-of-spring-/8011484.html	2025-03-14T18:41:19-07:00

Pi Day counts on never-ending numerical sequence for March 14 celebrations	March 14 is Pi Day, an annual celebration of the mathematical constant of pi, representing the ratio of a circle's circumference to its diameter. The holiday is observed on March 14 or 3/14 because 3.14 are the first three digits of the infinite number pi — 3.14159 ... and on and on. The celebration of Pi Day was the brainchild of physicist Larry Shaw and was first observed in 1988 at San Francisco’s Exploratorium, a science museum, and has since grown into an international event. At that first simple salute to pi in 1988, Shaw and his wife, Catherine, took — guess what? — pies — and tea to the museum for the celebration of the infinite number. Shaw became known as the Prince of Pi and reigned over the museum’s annual honoring of the never-ending number for years, until his death in 2017. Pi Day festivities grew to include the honoring of mathematical genius Albert Einstein because he was born on March 14. The U.S. House of Representatives officially designated March 14 as National Pi Day in 2009. The Exploratorium posted on its website that this year’s observance of pi would include the annual Pi Procession, which the museum described as being executed by 'a high spirited crowd' through the museum and would circle the museum’s Pi Shrine 3.14 times, while 'waving the digits of pi and dancing along' to a brass band. And, of course, all participants in the revelry would be rewarded with a free slice of pie. Pi Day is now celebrated around the world by pi lovers and is viewed as a way to arouse interest in the sciences among young people. Pi lovers had a special treat in 2015, History.com reports. That year Pi Day was celebrated on 3/14/15 at 9:26:53 a.m. The combined numbers of the date and time represent the first 10 digits of pi — 3.141592653.	https://www.voanews.com/a/pi-day-counts-on-never-ending-numerical-sequence-for-march-14-celebrations-/8011286.html	2025-03-14T16:57:14-07:00

US government shutdown likely averted; Democrats fracture	The U.S. Senate is set to pass a stopgap spending bill Friday that would avert a partial government shutdown, although many Democrats are expressing anger over plans by their party's leadership to support the measure. The measure cleared its first Senate hurdle early Friday evening, 62-38. The Republican-controlled House of Representatives passed the bill earlier this week to meet a March 14 deadline to keep the government running. Senate Democrats have fractured over whether to support the short-term continuing resolution (CR) that would fund the government for the next six months, reduce total government spending by about $7 billion from last year's levels and shift money to the military and away from non-defense spending. Much of the party's anger Friday was directed at Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer who announced Thursday night that while he disliked the bill, a shutdown was a 'far worse option.' Speaking on the Senate floor Friday morning, Schumer said not passing the Republican funding bill would give more power to the Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE) effort led by Elon Musk, including which agencies would be shut down. 'A shutdown would allow DOGE to shift into overdrive,' he said. Dozens of House Democrats, who opposed the funding measure in the lower chamber, sent a letter to Schumer on Friday, expressing their 'strong opposition' to his plan to vote for the bill. Former Democratic House Speaker Nancy Pelosi urged Senate Democrats to go against their leader. In a Friday statement, she wrote, 'America has experienced a Trump shutdown before — but this damaging legislation only makes matters worse.' Trump has called on Congress to pass the funding bill and on Friday praised Schumer for supporting it. 'Congratulations to Chuck Schumer for doing the right thing — Took 'guts' and courage!' he wrote on his Truth Social platform. Appropriations bills require a 60-vote threshold for passage in the Senate, which means Republicans need to secure at least eight Democratic votes. Schumer previously called for the Senate to pass an earlier version of the CR that Democrats were involved in negotiating. 'Funding the government should be a bipartisan effort. But Republicans chose a partisan path, drafting their continuing resolution without any input, any input, from congressional Democrats,' Schumer said on the Senate floor late Wednesday. The House passed the short-term spending measure Tuesday by a vote of 217-213. One Democrat voted for the bill and one Republican against it. The chamber went out of session for the rest of the week starting Tuesday afternoon, putting pressure on senators to pass its version of the CR. Speaker of the House Mike Johnson quelled dissent from within his Republican Party to pass the spending measure. He told reporters Tuesday the seven-month continuing resolution was an important step toward implementing Trump's agenda of rooting out government waste and abuse through DOGE. 'It allows us to move forward with changing the size and scope of the federal government. There is a seismic shift going on in Washington right now. This is a different moment than we have ever been in. The DOGE work is finding massive amounts of fraud, waste and abuse,' Johnson said. 'We have a White House that is actually dedicated to getting us back onto a fiscally responsible track.' Independent watchdogs and analysts, however, say DOGE is using overly broad claims of fraud to generate support for large-scale cuts to federal programs and offices. Representative Thomas Massie was the lone Republican holdout, despite Trump's post Monday night on Truth Social calling for Massie to lose his seat if he voted against the spending measure. The continuing resolution buys lawmakers time to reach a compromise on Senate and House versions of government spending for the next fiscal year, which begins in October, a key tool for implementing Trump's domestic policy agenda. At question is how and when to enact a proposed extension of the 2017 tax cuts and how to pay down the U.S. deficit without cutting key safety net programs that help American voters.	https://www.voanews.com/a/us-government-shutdown-likely-averted-democrats-fracture/8011226.html	2025-03-14T16:03:31-07:00	
Archaeologists use song to herald findings in Guinea-Bissau dig	Kansala, Guinea-Bissau — For centuries, the history of the West African kingdom of Kaabu has been told mainly by word of mouth. Kaabu existed from the mid-1500s to the 1800s. At its peak, it encompassed Guinea-Bissau and reached into what are now Senegal and Gambia. Sometimes Kaabu's story passed from father to son. Often it was passed by griots — or West African oral historians — who sang about the kingdom’s rulers. 'The griots have already sung it, but now we know it’s real,' is what Nino Galissa recounts in a recent song commissioned by archaeologists from their recent dig in Kansala — a site that was once the wealthy capital of the West African kingdom. Galissa is a direct descendent of the griots who sang for the last emperor of Kaabu. The song performed by Galissa is being shared along with a report of the archaeological findings, Sirio Canos-Donnay from the Spanish National Research Council, which was a lead institution of the dig, told VOA. 'He’s combined all of the ways and methods and phrases that are the trade of the griot with the archaeological information and, hence, using that we’ll be able to transmit what we’ve done to the local population in a much more effective manner.' In Kansala, griots have long been the way history lessons were passed between generations. They often sing the history accompanied by the kora, a string instrument that resembles both a harp and a guitar. 'The puzzle you cannot miss' Antonio Queba Banjai, a descendant of the last emperors of Kaabu, remembers listening as a young boy to the griots sing about his ancestors. 'Griots are not just important,' he said. 'They are the puzzle you cannot miss in African history, because to know what we know now is because of griots. I am from the tree of the last emperor of Kaabu. We were educated by the music of kora. The storytellers tell us where we come from.' Banjai is also president of Guinea-Lanta, an NGO that worked with the archaeologists. When team members began the project, they knew they wanted griots and oral history to play an important role in what is the biggest archaeological dig to ever take place in Guinea-Bissau. Canos-Donnay said she hoped that including oral storytelling in this report would show the academic world that things can be done differently and more inclusively. 'We should pay and need to pay respect to local ways of producing and consuming history. And the collaboration and the knowledge that can come from that dialogue from these two disciplines is something that is quite extraordinary.' Canos-Donnay and others worked closely to verify that many events griots had sung about for generations actually occurred. One such event was the explosive ending of the kingdom. 'Kansala had a fairly spectacular end in the 1860s, when the town was sieged by an enemy kingdom, and the local king realized he was going to lose the battle,' she said. 'The legend is he set fire to the gunpowder house and blew the whole site up. So, this particular point of the site is where the elders said it happened. And one of the fun things is we proved that’s where it properly did.' The dig also produced evidence of residents’ extensive trading with Europeans – Venetian beads, Dutch gin and more. Joao Paulo Pinto is the former director of Guinea-Bissau's National Institute of Study and Research. He says West African ways of recording history should be taken as seriously as European techniques. 'In our system, when you talk about the ritual of passage - everything has a process, everything has a code of conduct,' he said. 'All our oral history systems have a commitment to the truth. I have a commitment to the truth as I speak, just the same as a book has a commitment to the truth.' As for Banjai, he hopes the project will allow others to learn about the histories and kingdoms of West Africa that he says are too often neglected in school.	https://www.voanews.com/a/archaeologists-use-song-to-herald-findings-in-guinea-bissau-dig-/8011218.html	2025-03-14T15:39:48-07:00	
Iraq says key Islamic State leader is dead	WASHINGTON — One of the Islamic State terror group's most senior leaders is reportedly dead, killed in what Iraq is describing as a U.S.-supported operation. Iraqi Prime Minister Mohammed Shia al-Sudani posted on social media Friday that the country's intelligence service 'successfully eliminated' IS deputy caliph Abdallah Makki Muslih al-Rufay'i. Sudani did not say when or how al-Rufay'i was killed, calling the death a 'significant security achievement.' Iraqi special forces, in a subsequent post on the X social media platform, said al-Rufay’i was killed Thursday in an airstrike targeting his location in Iraq’s Anbar desert. Officials said the strike was the result of a two-year effort to track his location, with breakthroughs coming in the past six months. The officials also said they arrested seven additional IS members, including two women, in a follow-up operation in Anbar. Intelligence collected at the scene of the airstrike further led to the arrest of another five people in the northern Iraqi city of Irbil. Iraqi officials said that al-Rufay'i, also known as Abu Khadija, was the top IS official for Iraq and Syria, and that he also played a key role in the group's external operations. A recent United Nations report, based on intelligence from U.N. member states, said al-Rufay'i ran IS operations across Iraq, Syria, Turkey and other parts of the Middle East. Other U.N. intelligence reports have identified al-Rufay'i as a member of IS' delegated committee, viewed as the terror group's most influential executive body. U.S. officials have yet to comment on the Iraqi claims. Various intelligence estimates put the number of IS fighters across Iraq and Syria at between 1,500 and 3,000, with the majority operating out of Syria. U.S. military officials warned in July of a possible IS resurgence in the region, saying the terror group was on a pace to more than double the number of attacks it had carried out in Iraq and Syria the previous year. More recently, in December, U.S. forces carried out a series of airstrikes against IS in Syria, hitting targets in areas abandoned by counterterror forces loyal to former Syrian president Bashar al-Assad. Despite those operations, intelligence shared by the U.N. indicated IS has been trying to take advantage of the fall of the Assad regime and resulting political turmoil. The U.N. report also said IS 'maintained the ability to operate and replace field commanders.' Yet while Iraq and Syria are central to IS' founding ideology, there has been a growing consensus among intelligence officials and experts that the terror group no longer sees the Middle East as its base for global operations. Officials, including those from the U.S., have said there is growing confidence that the group is now being led by Abdul Qadir Mumin, who has been based in Somalia, where he rose to prominence as the emir of the group's Somali affiliate, IS-Somalia. An offensive launched by forces in Somalia's Puntland region earlier this month, in part to chase after Mumin, has met with surprising success, pushing IS-Somalia out of some of its key strongholds. But the campaign has yet to find any traces of Mumin or other top IS leaders.	https://www.voanews.com/a/iraq-says-key-islamic-state-leader-is-dead/8011115.html	2025-03-14T13:30:26-07:00	
Analysts see flaws in Syria's temporary constitution	WASHINGTON — Syria’s newly adopted constitution is facing criticism from legal experts and political groups arguing that its loopholes could deepen division and instability in the conflict-ridden country. Three months after the fall of former President Bashar al-Assad’s government, interim President Ahmed al-Sharaa signed a constitutional declaration Thursday that will serve as Syria’s constitution during the five-year transitional period. Al-Sharaa — leader of the Islamist Hayat Tahrir al-Sham that spearheaded the offensive against Assad’s leadership in December 2024 — said following the signing ceremony that he hoped the document would mark 'the beginning of a new history for Syria, where oppression is replaced by justice, destruction by construction, ignorance by education and torture by mercy.' The Kurdish-led Autonomous Administration in north and east Syria, a de facto civilian authority affiliated with the U.S.-backed Syrian Democratic Forces (SDF) that controls nearly one-third of Syria’s territory, was the first to reject the constitution, calling it exclusionary. 'The so-called constitutional declaration contains a framework and articles similar to those adopted by the Baath government,' it said, referring to the ruling party that governed Syria from 1963 to late 2024. Legal experts also argue that the 53-article document fails to adequately reflect Syria’s realities, particularly its ethnic and religious diversity. 'The draft speaks generally of Syrians who resisted the regime, without distinguishing between Arabs, Kurds, Assyrians and other ethnic groups,' said Jian Badrakhan, vice chairman of the Germany-based Kurdish Center for Studies and Legal Consultancy. 'However, Article 1 explicitly uses the term ‘Arab’ in the country’s name, undermining the inclusive language found elsewhere in the document.' Badrakhan told VOA that 'the absence of any reference to the Kurds, as the second-largest ethnic group in the country, or to the Assyrians, one of Syria’s oldest indigenous peoples, is a clear rejection of Syria’s multicultural identity.' Definition, limits The constitution defines Syria as an Arab republic and mandates that the president must be Muslim. Additionally, it limits official recognition to 'heavenly religions,' referring to Abrahamic faiths like Christianity, Islam and Judaism. 'This effectively denies recognition to several long-standing religious communities in Syria, including the Yazidis and Druze,' Badrakhan said. 'Over time, this provision could also be interpreted as a means to exclude the Ismaili and Alawite sects [of Shiite Islam] from formal recognition.' According to the CIA World Factbook, Arabs constitute 50% of Syria’s nearly 24 million people, while Alawites, Kurds and Christians make up 35%. The remaining percentage is made up of Druze, Ismaili, and other ethnic and religious groups. There are also concerns that the temporary constitution grants vast powers to the interim president and promotes Islamist ideology. Al-Sharaa’s HTS is an Islamist group that is designated as a terrorist organization by the United States. 'The constitution says there is separation between government branches, but that is clearly false,' said Sarbast Nabi, professor of political philosophy at Koya University in Iraqi Kurdistan. 'Article 24 stipulates that the president gets to pick 20 percent of members of the transitional parliament, which shows there is no separation between the executive and legislative branches,' he told VOA, adding that the document 'will not achieve stability in Syria.' The constitution justifies the inclusion of the clause 'to ensure fair representation and efficiency.' Anwar al-Bunni, co-founder and executive director of the Syrian Center for Legal Studies and Research, says that while the constitutional declaration has some promising provisions – such as the creation of a commission for transitional justice and the establishment of political parties and associations – there are significant concerns. 'The declaration oversteps its role as a constitutional declaration, functioning more like a mini-constitution by predetermining the name of the republic, designating Islam as its main source of legislation and defining presidential powers – effectively undermining the will of the Syrian people,' he said. Such matters, he told VOA, should be decided through referendums. 'All ethnicities and religions in the country want constitutional guarantees,' al-Bunni said. 'Since this is a temporary document, the formation of a permanent constitution must include discussions over all these points and issues.' Geir Pedersen, the U.N. special envoy for Syria, said in a statement Friday that he 'hopes this [constitutional declaration] will move Syria toward restoring the rule of law and promoting an orderly inclusive transition.' Since Assad’s fall, the U.S. and other Western nations have repeatedly called for an inclusive government in Syria that protects the country’s ethnic and religious groups.

Military says death toll in Pakistan's train hijacking rises to 31	ISLAMABAD — Pakistan officials confirmed Friday that 31 people, including 23 security personnel, lost their lives in Tuesday’s train hijacking by armed militants in the country’s restive Balochistan province. In a news briefing, Lieutenant General Ahmed Sharif Chaudhry said 18 off-duty military and paramilitary Frontier Corps personnel, three railway staff and five civilian passengers were among those killed in the initial attack. Five Frontier Corps personnel were also killed in the attack and the ensuing battle with militants. Separatist militants from Baloch Liberation Army (BLA), a designated terror group, took over the Jaffar Express near Sibi hours after it left the provincial capital, Quetta, on Tuesday. In the clearance operation that lasted more than 30 hours, the Pakistan military said it killed 33 BLA terrorists. Chaudhry, director general of military public relations, said 354 passengers were freed, 37 of whom were injured. Officials also revised the tally of passengers on the train downward to 425 from 440. Speaking alongside Chaudhry, Balochistan Chief Minister Sarfraz Bugti said 425 tickets were sold for the cross-country train. However, passengers could board at any station along the roughly 1,600-kilometer route, which, Bugti said, largely explained the gap between the number of passengers and those rescued. 'Maybe some did not travel; some were boarding later, maybe some of those who ran [from the terrorists] lost their way, and maybe some got caught [by the terrorists],' the chief minister said. Blaming neighbors Tuesday’s attack marked a dramatic escalation in the separatist insurgency that has seen a sharp increase in violence in recent months. In 2024, the BLA and other Baloch separatist groups killed nearly 400 people in over 500 attacks. Pakistani officials blamed archrival India, accusing it of providing support to anti-Pakistan militants in Afghanistan, a charge New Delhi quickly rejected. 'We strongly reject the baseless allegations made by Pakistan,' Indian foreign ministry spokesperson Randhir Jaiswal told reporters. Bugti and Chaudhry reiterated the claim that Tuesday’s attack was orchestrated by militants with bases in Afghanistan, a charge Afghan foreign ministry spokesperson Abdul Qahar Balkhi rejected Thursday. Intelligence failure? Pakistani officials acknowledged there was a security threat, but rejected questions that the brazen hijacking in the heavily militarized province was an intelligence failure. 'There was a threat in the general area,' said Chaudhry, adding that it was not specifically about an attack on the train. 'There are thousands of intelligence success stories too behind [such incidents], which you don’t know — incidents that did not happen because our intelligence was successfully able to detect them,' he said. The military spokesperson said law enforcement agencies have conducted 11,654 intelligence-based operations across the country so far this year. Nearly 60,000 such operations were conducted nationwide last year, he said. Resource-rich Balochistan is Pakistan’s largest and least-populated province, where members of the ethnic Baloch minority say they face discrimination and exploitation by the government in Islamabad. In the last 15 months, 1,250 terrorists from various groups have been killed in Pakistan, along with 563 security personnel, Chaudhry said.	https://www.voanews.com/a/military-says-death-toll-in-pakistan-s-train-hijacking-rises-to-31/8011076.html	2025-03-14T12:40:17-07:00	
US envoy says Hamas misrepresented release of hostage	U.S. special envoy to the Middle East Steve Witkoff said a Hamas statement issued Friday announcing it had agreed to release an American-Israeli soldier was, in reality, a condition of a 'bridge' ceasefire proposal offered by U.S. officials earlier this week. Early Friday, the U.S.-designated terrorist group Hamas issued a statement saying it had agreed to release Edan Alexander, believed to be the last living American hostage held in Gaza, as well as the bodies of four other hostages after receiving a proposal from mediators to resume negotiations on the second phase of a Gaza ceasefire deal. The statement said the proposal had been offered by unnamed mediators as part of the work in Qatar to restart ceasefire negotiations. The United States, Egypt and host Qatar have been mediating the ceasefire talks. Hamas expressed its 'complete readiness to begin negotiations and reach a comprehensive agreement on the issues of the second phase.' Later Friday, in a joint statement issued along with the National Security Council, Witkoff's office explained he and National Security Council Senior Middle East Director Eric Trager had presented the bridge proposal to extend the current ceasefire beyond Ramadan and Passover and allow time to negotiate a framework for a permanent ceasefire. In the statement, Witkoff said that under the proposal, Hamas would release additional living hostages in exchange for prisoners, and that the extension of the phase-one ceasefire would allow more time for humanitarian aid to resume into Gaza. He said the U.S. had its Qatari and Egyptian mediating partners convey to Hamas 'in no uncertain terms' that the new proposal would have to be implemented soon and Edan Alexander would have to be released immediately. 'Unfortunately, Hamas has chosen to respond by publicly claiming flexibility,' Witkoff said in the statement, 'while privately making demands that are entirely impractical without a permanent ceasefire.' In a statement released on the X social media platform, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's office said that while Israel had accepted 'the Witkoff framework,' Hamas 'continues to wage psychological warfare against hostage families.' The statement went on to say that the prime minister would convene his ministerial team Saturday evening for a detailed briefing from the negotiating team and 'decide on steps to free the hostages and achieve all our war objectives.' Hamas is believed to be holding 24 living hostages taken in the Oct. 7, 2023, attack that triggered its war with Israel. The group also is holding the bodies of 34 others who were either killed in the initial attack or in captivity, as well as the remains of a soldier killed in 2014. In comments to FOX Business news Friday, White House Press Secretary Karoline Leavitt said she was wary of taking Hamas statements at face value but emphasized that U.S. President Donald Trump was working 'diligently' to bring hostages home. Witkoff told reporters at the White House early in March that gaining the release of Alexander was a 'top priority.' A ceasefire has been in place since January. During the first phase of the three-phase ceasefire, Hamas exchanged 33 Israeli hostages and five Thais for some 2,000 Palestinian prisoners and detainees. Israel has been pressing Hamas to accept an extension of the first phase, which ended March 2. Hamas had said it wanted to move to the second phase of the agreement, which would involve the release of more hostages and Israel's withdrawal from Gaza.	https://www.voanews.com/a/us-envoy-says-hamas-misrepresented-release-of-hostage/8011067.html	2025-03-14T12:35:19-07:00	
Author says ban on her book reflects Taliban's repression of women	WASHINGTON — When Naveeda Khoshbo published her book of political analysis in 2019, she received widespread praise and recognition. For many, 'it was the first time that they were reading a book written by a young woman,' she said. So, when she received a text message from a friend and fellow journalist in November 2024, telling her the Taliban had banned her book, she was shocked. Khoshbo, 33, said she can't figure out why the book, 'Siyasi Jaj' or 'Political Analysis,' was banned, saying 'it did not address any sensitive topics.' Published by the Peace Publish Center in Kabul, her book covers political events and processes from 2001 to 2019. But last year it was included in a list circulated on social media of more than 400 books banned by the Taliban. The list covers a range of topics: democracy, the arts, literature, poetry, history, religion, governance, rights and freedoms. The Taliban's deputy minister for the Ministry of Information and Culture, Zia-ul Haq Haqmal, told media his department had identified 400 books deemed 'against Afghanistan's national interest and Islamic values.' 'Hostility is directed at women' Khoshbo believes her book also was banned because it was written by a woman. She is now based in London. 'I believe their hostility is directed at women, and for them, the books written by women are the first to be targeted, regardless of their content,' she said. About a dozen titles in the book ban are by women, or they were translated by women. Other titles include the book by Nobel laureate Malala Yousafzai, 'I am Malala: The Story of the Girl Who Stood Up for Education.' The Taliban, who seized power in August 2021, have imposed strict measures against women in Afghanistan, barring them from education, work, long-distance travel and participating in public life. Afghan writer Nazeer Ahmad Sahaar told VOA the Taliban jettison anything they see as contrary to their ideology. 'Anything that is against the Taliban's political and religious beliefs and narrative is banned under the Taliban,' said Sahaar. The author has written more than a dozen books. One of those, 'Waziristan: The Last Stand' is also on the list of banned publications. Sahaar sees the book ban as part of a larger crackdown on 'women, the press and freedom of expression.' Sahaar said the ban on books, though, is of little surprise. 'It was evident that they would impose restrictions in many areas,' he said. Alongside the book ban and restrictions imposed on women, the Taliban return has led to restrictions on freedom of expression. Media outlets work under rules that are not always clear about what can and cannot be covered, and in some cases must submit coverage for review before publication. The Taliban also imposed restrictions on printing books. An owner of a printing press in the eastern province of Nangarhar, who requested anonymity for fear of reprisal, told VOA that the provincial Directorate of Information and Culture instructed publishers not to print anything without prior permission. 'In a meeting with publishers, the Taliban officials said that 'if you are publishing any book, you must first obtain permission from the directorate,'' said the business owner. The owner said that businesses are struggling under the Taliban, but there is an increased demand for books, particularly ones that are banned. 'The Taliban's restrictions have sparked social and cultural resistance,' he said, with people seeking ways to oppose the limitations, including by reading prohibited books. 'It reflects the fear' Abdul Ghafoor Lewal, an Afghan writer and former diplomat, told VOA the Taliban's actions reveal fear of any opposition. 'It reflects the fear authoritarian regimes have of freedom of expression, books and knowledge,' said Lewal. Khoshbo said the Taliban's ban would not stop her and other women from writing and participating in social and political life. 'The Taliban can't suppress our voices by 'banning books,' said Khoshbo, but 'women can't be erased from society and politics.'	https://www.voanews.com/a/author-says-ban-on-her-book-reflects-taliban-s-repression-of-women/8011004.html	2025-03-14T11:59:58-07:00	
VOA Mandarin: BlackRock makes major move in Panama	This week, BlackRock, one of the largest U.S. asset management firms, signed an agreement with CK Hutchison Holdings to acquire 90% of Panama Ports Company, which operates the crucial Balboa and Cristobal ports. The acquisition comes amid U.S. concerns that the Hong Kong-based CK Hutchison could create a strategic foothold for China in the Panama Canal. The deal also addresses some of the U.S.’s strategic anxieties for now, yet the implications extend beyond the Canal’s waters. The agreement holds critical weight in the broader context of U.S.-China competition across the Americas.

G7 urges Russia to accept ceasefire or face further sanctions	CHARLEVOIX, QUEBEC, CANADA — Top diplomats from the Group of Seven leading democracies urged Russia on Friday to agree to a U.S.-proposed ceasefire in the Russia-Ukraine war. 'We called for Russia to reciprocate by agreeing to a ceasefire on equal terms and implementing it fully,' the diplomats said in a joint statement from the talks in Canada. 'We discussed imposing further costs on Russia in case such a ceasefire is not agreed, including through further sanctions, caps on oil prices, as well as additional support for Ukraine, and other means.' The White House said U.S. President Donald Trump’s special envoy, Steve Witkoff, spoke with Russian President Vladimir Putin on Thursday. 'All G7 foreign ministers agree with the U.S. proposal of a ceasefire that is supported by Ukrainians,' and the focus now is on Russia’s response, said Canadian Foreign Minister Melanie Joly on Friday. She added, 'The ball is now in Russia's court when it comes to Ukraine.' British Foreign Minister David Lammy echoed this sentiment, stating, 'There is unity that now is the time for a ceasefire with no conditions. Ukraine has made its position clear. It is now up to Russia to accept it.' Lammy also noted that a 'coalition of the willing' is forming to provide Ukraine with the necessary 'security architecture' and monitoring mechanisms to support the ceasefire. The G7 joint statement comes as the Kremlin said that much remains to be done on a Ukraine ceasefire deal, signaling its reluctance to fully endorse the U.S. proposal. Kremlin spokesperson Dmitry Peskov said that Putin still awaits answers after raising several questions about the ceasefire's implementation. Meanwhile, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy dismissed Putin's response as 'deliberately' setting conditions that complicate and 'drag out the process.' 'An unconditional 30-day interim ceasefire is the first crucial step that could bring us significantly closer to a just and lasting peace,' Zelenskyy wrote Wednesday in a post on the social media platform X. The G7 talks in Charlevoix, Quebec, brought together ministers from Britain, Canada, France, Germany, Italy, Japan and the United States. China’s position Behind closed doors, G7 foreign ministers also discussed China’s role in global security, stability for the Indian and Pacific Ocean regions, and maritime security. On Friday, G7 foreign ministers held a session focused on strategic challenges posed by China, North Korea, Iran and Russia. Many foreign policy analysts and military officials refer to these four nations as the 'Axis of Upheaval,' describing their growing anti-Western collaboration. The G7 joint statement said the group remains 'concerned with China’s military build-up and the continued, rapid increase in China’s nuclear weapons arsenal.' They called on China 'to engage in strategic risk reduction discussions and promote stability through transparency.' The foreign ministers also reaffirmed their serious concerns over the situations in the East and South China Seas, strongly opposing any unilateral attempts to alter the status quo, particularly through force or coercion. G7 members also emphasized the importance of peace and stability across the Taiwan Strait, reiterating their opposition to any unilateral attempts to change the status quo by force or coercion. A potential ceasefire in the Russia-Ukraine war could affect the U.S. presence in the Indo-Pacific, as officials and analysts suggest that ending the conflict would allow Washington to redirect resources toward addressing challenges in the region. 'I don’t think an endless, ongoing conflict in Europe or in Ukraine is good for the Indo-Pacific region. It diverts a lot of the world’s attention, time and resources away from areas where we continue to see growing threats,' Rubio told VOA earlier this week during a briefing aboard a military plane. 'In many ways, we could be spending even more time focused on the Indo-Pacific if somehow we could bring peace to the European continent,' the top U.S. diplomat said.	https://www.voanews.com/a/g7-urges-russia-to-accept-ceasefire-or-face-further-sanctions/8010842.html	2025-03-14T09:35:50-07:00	
Kremlin: Reasons to be optimistic about ceasefire deal	Kremlin spokesperson Dmitry Peskov said Friday there are reasons for 'cautious optimism' regarding a proposed ceasefire deal between Ukraine and Russia, following talks between a U.S. envoy and Russian President Vladimir Putin in Moscow. Speaking to reporters in a telephone news briefing, Peskov referenced comments from Putin on Thursday in which he expressed qualified support for a U.S. ceasefire proposal to halt Russia’s war with Ukraine for 30 days but said some questions needed to be answered. Peskov said that 'while much remains to be done, Putin 'expressed solidarity with [U.S. President Donald] Trump’s position.' He said Putin held late night talks Thursday with U.S. special envoy Steve Witkoff, during which Putin 'conveyed information and additional signals to President Trump.' The Kremlin spokesperson said both sides agreed Putin and Trump should speak, adding that the timing of the conversation will be agreed upon once Witkoff has conveyed the new information to Trump. In his nightly address to his nation Thursday, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy said that Putin’s comments were 'very manipulative' and that he thought Putin’s qualified support for the U.S. plan was an effort to lay the groundwork for rejecting it. 'He is in fact preparing a rejection at present, because Putin is, of course, scared to tell President Trump that he wants to continue this war, that he wants to kill Ukrainians,' Zelenskyy said. He noted Ukraine had accept the U.S. proposal and was ready to organize monitoring and verification. 'We are not setting conditions that complicate the process; Russia is,' Zelenskyy said. White House Press Secretary Karoline Leavitt said Friday that no discussions between Trump and Putin have been scheduled, but she said that could always change. Referencing comments on the president’s Truth Social media account, Leavitt said Trump is pressuring the Russians to 'do the right thing.' She called the talks in Moscow Thursday 'a productive day for the United States of America and for the world in terms of peace.' On Thursday at the White House, ahead of talks with NATO Secretary General Mark Rutte, Trump said it would be 'very disappointing' if Russia ends up rejecting U.S. efforts to end the fighting. Meanwhile, Britain’s Defense Ministry said Friday that Russia’s prioritization of funding its war with Ukraine has likely resulted in insufficient funding for average Russians’ health care, leading to shortages of medical staff and equipment. In its defense intelligence report, the ministry said Russia reportedly closed at least 160 hospitals in 2024, including 18 maternity facilities and at least 10 children’s clinics. The report said Russia’s small towns and villages have been particularly affected. The Defense Ministry said the 500,000 casualties Russia has sustained in the Ukraine war most certainly continue to put a strain on all levels of care in the Russian military medical system.	https://www.voanews.com/a/kremlin-reasons-to-be-optimistic-about-ceasefire-deal/8010812.html	2025-03-14T09:13:20-07:00	
Africa faces diabetes crisis, study finds	JOHANNESBURG, SOUTH AFRICA — Researchers warn that type 2 diabetes could affect millions more people in the coming decades after a study published this month revealed the disease is rising far faster among people in sub-Saharan Africa than previously thought. Take 51-year-old security guard Sibusiso Sithole, for example. Being diagnosed with type 2 diabetes came as a shock, he said, because he walked six miles to and from work every day and never thought his weight was a problem. Then his wife noticed changes in his health. Since his diagnosis 13 years ago, Sithole has been on a rigorous treatment for diabetes and high blood pressure. 'I have to take six ... medications every day,' he said. Diabetes is a condition in which the body struggles to turn food into energy due to insufficient insulin. Without insulin, sugar stays in the blood instead of entering cells, leading to high blood-sugar levels. Long-term complications include heart disease, kidney failure, blindness and amputations. The International Diabetes Federation estimated in 2021 that 24 million adults in sub-Saharan Africa were living with the condition. Researchers had projected that by 2045, about 6% of sub-Saharan Africans — over 50 million — would have diabetes. The new study, published this month in the medical journal The Lancet, suggested the actual percentage could be nearly double that. By tracking more than 10,000 participants in South Africa, Kenya, Ghana and Burkina Faso over seven years, researchers found that poor eating habits, lack of health care access, obesity and physical inactivity are key drivers of diabetes in Africa. Dr. Raylton Chikwati, a study co-author from the University of Witwatersrand in South Africa, said another risk factor is living in or moving to the outskirts of cities, or 'peri-urban areas.' 'Access to health care, you know, in the rural areas is a bit less than in the urban areas,' Chikwati said, adding that increased use of processed foods in the peri-urban areas was a problem. Palwende Boua, a research associate at the Clinical Research Unit of Nanoro in Burkina Faso, said long-term studies are rare in Africa but essential to understanding diseases. 'Being able to have a repeated measure and following up [with] the same people ... is providing much more information and much valuable information,' Boua said, 'rather than having to see people once and trying to understand a phenomenon.' Boua is preparing a policy brief for Burkina Faso’s government to assist in the fight against diabetes. For Sithole, managing his diabetes has been a long journey. But with treatment and lifestyle changes, he has regained control over his health. 'What I can tell people is that they must go and check — check the way they eat — because that time I was having too much weight in my body,' he said. 'I was wearing size 40 that time. Now I'm wearing size 34.' Experts stressed that Africans should get their blood-sugar level tested and seek treatment when diabetes is diagnosed.	https://www.voanews.com/a/africa-faces-diabetes-crisis-study-finds/8010779.html	2025-03-14T09:06:35-07:00	
Chinese officials look to limit social media and screen time in China	Washington — While some youth in China admit to spending an excessive amount of time on the internet, many are skeptical about new government proposals aimed at regulating the time young Chinese spend online and on social media sites. In conversations at China’s annual political meetings that wrapped up in Beijing this week, retired international basketball star Yao Ming, called for some limits on internet access for young people in China. Yao was advocating for a plan that would mandate children turn off all electronics for one full day every academic semester and get outside and exercise. Officials also called for tighter controls of online gaming and cited concerns about harmful online content, warning that excessive internet use is hurting the physical health and academic performance of Chinese minors under the age of 18. China already has some of the world’s tightest internet controls, with tens of thousands of websites, foreign social media sites and content blocked. It also has a massive online population. On social media in China some commenters praised the efforts, but many expressed frustrations with what they viewed to be an inherent contradiction within the policies. Some noted that children are already in school most of the day and rely on internet resources to complete assignments. 'Schools should assign less homework that requires phone check-ins and online research,' wrote one user from northern Hebei Province. 'Minors get home around 9 p.m. or 10 p.m. at night, so when do they even have time to use social media?' wrote another user from Beijing. A college student in Beijing, who spoke with VOA on condition of anonymity because of the sensitivity of the topic, said she agreed with officials’ concerns, but added that policies like the one suggested by Yao are likely to have a limited impact. 'Chinese teenagers and young people are absolutely addicted to the internet. You can find people walking on the streets looking at their phones everywhere and all the time. We use the internet to do almost everything,' the student told VOA. 'I don’t really think proposals to limit internet accessibility for young people would be effective. The addiction is always hard to get rid of, so how can a ‘limit day’ alleviate the excessive internet use?' the student said, using the word 'addiction' to describe the excessive use of the internet. According to the '2024 China Game Industry Minor Protection Report' released by the Game Working Committee of the China Audio-Video and Digital Publishing Association, as of December 2023, the number of internet users in China under the age of 18 reached 196 million, with the percentage of minors who are on the internet and can access it reaching 97.3%. Will Wang, a Chinese student attending college in the United States, said when he returns home in Beijing during school break his impression is that the internet is used heavily in everyday life, and that teenagers are very active on social media platforms. 'There’s definitely a significant increase in screen and internet usage across all ages in China…many Chinese teenagers are deeply engaged with TikTok, RedNote, Bilibili, and many internet platforms,' Wang said in a written response to VOA. Amid the busy academic and personal lives of young Chinese, the internet provides them with a rare space for privacy, which Wang said is fueling high levels of internet use. 'Most Chinese teenagers don’t have a lot of private space for themselves at home or at school so [the] internet is the only option, especially with their busy schedules––nearly every kid has to attend some sort of classes or studying-related activities outside of school,' Wang said. 'For teenagers, if anything, [the] internet makes them more connected with their friends and the world.' Xu Quan, a media commentator based in Hong Kong, said online spaces can have a positive effect on children, who are often overwhelmed with parental and educational expectations. 'Contrary to what some might think, the internet helps them deal with stress to a certain extent. If you were to remove the internet from their lives, that would actually be harmful to their physical and mental well-being,' Xu told VOA. The recent proposals to limit internet use build on previous regulations regarding youth internet use. In October 2020, China revised the 'Law on the Protection of Minors,' adding an 'internet protection' chapter requiring that social media, gaming and live streaming platforms implement tools to limit their excessive use. The law targeted gaming addictions in particular. A 2021 notice required strict limits on gaming time allotments for children under 18. The regulation banned gaming between the hours of 10 p.m. and 8 a.m., and limited minors to no more than one hour of gaming per day on weekdays or two hours per day on weekends. During Chinese New Year this year, Tencent Games issued a 'limited play order' for minors. During the 32-day break from academics, teenagers were only permitted to play the company’s games for a total of 15 hours. However, all of these regulations can be circumvented through using or creating accounts belonging to adults, who are not subject to the restrictions. Despite previous momentum, A Qiang, who used to work in the Chinese media industry, thinks proposals from the recently concluded political meetings in Beijing are just talk and won’t lead to any concrete policy change. The real way forward, he argues, is by lessening burdens impacting the quality of minors’ lives offline such as intense academic pressure. The problem is not that they have too much freedom online but have too little freedom offline, he said.	https://www.voanews.com/a/chinese-officials-look-to-limit-social-media-and-screen-time-in-china-/8010657.html	2025-03-14T08:10:21-07:00	
UN urges end to violence in Syria 14 years after Arab Spring protests	The U.N. special envoy for Syria is calling for an end to violence and for the protection of civilians, as the country grapples with renewed violence three months after the fall of President Bashar al-Assad. Geir Pedersen issued his appeal Friday, which is the 14th anniversary of the start of pro-democracy protests of al-Assad that led to more than a decade of civil war. 'What began as a plea for reform was met with staggering brutality, leading to one of the most harrowing conflicts of our time,' Pederson said. 'The conflict exposed the darkest depths of human cruelty. Families continue to mourn the loss of loved ones, communities remain fractured, millions remain uprooted from their homes, and far too many persist in their search for the missing.' The U.N. says the conflict displaced some 12 million people in Syria, including more than 6 million refugees. Assad was ousted in December 2024 but hope for a return to stability has been shaken by deadly violence that began March 6 in Syria's coastal region, where security forces clashed with fighters loyal to the former president, leading to hundreds of deaths, including many civilians. The fighters were members of the country's Alawite minority — the same religious group of which the Assad family is a member. Syria’s transitional authorities said their forces in the sect's coastal region near the port city of Latakia came under a calculated attack from Assad loyalists in an attempted insurrection. Pedersen said Friday that recent agreements between Syria’s transitional authorities and an armed group, the Syrian Democratic Forces (SDF), 'are a positive reminder of how important it is that Syria comes together in a manner that truly restores its sovereignty, unity, independence and territorial integrity.' He called for the creation of a 'credible and inclusive transitional government and legislative body; a constitutional framework and process to draft a new constitution for the long term that is credible and inclusive too; and genuine transitional justice.' Margaret Besheer contributed to this report from the United Nations.	https://www.voanews.com/a/un-urges-end-to-violence-in-syria-14-years-after-arab-spring-protests-/8010694.html	2025-03-14T07:23:08-07:00	
Botswana hunting revenues almost double amid UK opposition	Gaborone, Botswana — Botswana has made $4 million from the sale of licenses to hunt wild animals, the highest figure since lifting a hunting ban in 2019. The hunting season, which ended in November, was held amid growing opposition from some European countries that want a ban on the importation of African wildlife trophies. Botswana issues around 400 elephant licenses annually, with most purchased by overseas hunters. Wynter Mmolotsi, minister of environment and tourism, told Parliament Thursday that millions of dollars were generated through the sale of mostly elephant licenses in villages in wildlife areas. 'In order to manage the wildlife population, the country is implementing a combination of both consumptive and nonconsumptive utilization of our wildlife resources to derive optimum economic benefit, particularly for our communities,' he said. 'For the 2024 hunting season, the community quotas generated the sum of 42,863,423 pulas. Further, a total of 15,633,950 pulas was realized from the sale of special elephant quotas to support elephant conservation and community-led projects within the elephant range.' In 2023, Botswana earned $2.7 million from hunting licenses. Mmolotsi, however, says the hunts face increasing Western opposition. Canada and Belgium are among countries that have recently banned importation of wildlife trophies. 'The country is facing opposition from animal rights organizations to our policy of sustainable wildlife utilization of using hunting as a tool and empowerment to our local communities. The ministry, working with the hunting industry and affected community trusts stepped up efforts to counter this growing opposition to sustainable hunting through engagements carried out in the U.K. and Germany,' he said. Siyoka Simasiku, director at the conservation coalition, Ngamiland Council of Non-Governmental Organisations says communities will be the hardest hit if the U.K. imposes restrictions. He has been to Europe to campaign against trophy import bans. 'The U.K. ban is going to be bad on community benefits as the U.K. is an economic superpower and might influence other countries to actually follow suit and then communities might lose the market that already exists as more hunters will not be coming to Botswana to hunt in community concessions due to the trophy bans,' he said. Oaitse Nawa of the Elephant Protection Society is among those who want the hunts to be stopped. He also argues, revenue accrued from hunting does not significantly benefit Botswanans. 'They are giving us figures of the money that they made from hunting, but also let us look at the compensation that they give the people. And also the result of hunting, what does hunting bring to the local people because the animals that experience hunting, they tend to change their behavior and they kill people. That is why we are saying there should be proper research in that regard,' said Nawa. Botswana, with the world’s largest elephant herd at more than 130,000 elephants has recorded an increase in human fatalities, while crops are damaged.	https://www.voanews.com/a/botswana-hunting-revenues-almost-double-amid-uk-opposition-/8010588.html	2025-03-14T05:21:32-07:00	
Report: US bird population is declining	The U.S. bird population is declining at an alarming rate, according to a report published Thursday by an alliance of science and conservation groups. Habitat loss and climate change are among the key contributing factors to the bird population losses, according to the 2025 U.S. State of the Birds report. More than 100 of the species studied, have reached a 'tipping point,' losing more than half their populations in the last 50 years. The report revealed that the avian population in all habitats is declining, including the duck population, previously considered a triumph of conservation. 'The only bright spot is water birds such as herons and egrets that show some increases,' Michael Parr, president of the American Bird Conservancy, told Reuters. The decline in the duck population fell by approximately 30% from 2017, but duck population numbers still remain higher, however, than their 1970 numbers, according to an Associated Press account on the report. 'Roughly one in three bird species (229 species) in the U.S. requires urgent conservation attention, and these species represent the major habitats and systems in the U.S. and include species that we've long considered to be common and abundant,' Amanda Rodewald, faculty director of the Cornell Lab of Ornithology's Center for Avian Population Studies told Reuters. Included among the birds with highest losses, Reuters reported, are the mottled duck, Allen's hummingbird, yellow-billed loon, red-faced cormorant, greater sage-grouse, Florida scrub jay, Baird's sparrow, saltmarsh sparrow, mountain plover, Hawaiian petrel, Bicknell's thrush, Cassia crossbill, pink-footed shearwater, tricolored blackbird and golden-cheeked warbler. Some of the birds in this 'red alert' group are already protected under the U.S. Endangered Species Act, the news agency said. 'For each species that we're in danger of losing, it's like pulling an individual thread out of the complex tapestry of life,' Georgetown University biologist Peter Marra. who was not involved in the new report, told AP. While the outlook may seem dire, it is not without hope, said Marra, who noted the resurgence of the majestic bald eagle.	https://www.voanews.com/a/report-us-bird-population-is-declining/8010492.html	2025-03-13T23:55:47-07:00	
Exclusive: Second Iranian ship suspected of carrying missile ingredient leaves China	WASHINGTON — A second Iranian ship that Western news reports have named as part of a scheme to import a missile propellant ingredient from China is heading to Iran with a major cargo load, an exclusive VOA analysis has found. Ship-tracking websites show the Iranian-flagged cargo ship Jairan departed China on Monday, a month later than the expected departure cited by one of the news reports. The Jairan was named in January and February articles by The Financial Times, The Wall Street Journal and CNN as one of two Iranian cargo ships Tehran is using to import 1,000 metric tons of sodium perchlorate from China. The three news outlets cited unnamed Western intelligence sources as saying the purported shipment could be transformed into enough ammonium perchlorate — a key solid fuel propellant component — to produce 260 midrange Iranian missiles. The other Iranian cargo ship named in the news reports, the Golbon, completed a 19-day journey from eastern China to the Iranian port of Bandar Abbas on Feb. 13. During the trip, it made a two-day stop at southern China's Zhuhai Gaolan port and delivered an unknown cargo to Iran, according to ship-tracking website MarineTraffic. Both the Golbon and the Jairan are sanctioned by the U.S. Treasury Department as vessels operated by the state-run Islamic Republic of Iran Shipping Lines, which itself is sanctioned for being what the State Department has called 'the preferred shipping line for Iranian proliferators and procurement agents.' As the Golbon sailed from China to Iran in late January and early February, the Jairan’s automatic identification system transponder — a device that transmits positional and other data as part of an internationally mandated tracking system — reported the vessel as being docked at eastern China's Liuheng Island. In a joint review of the Jairan's AIS data on MarineTraffic and fellow ship-tracking website Seasearcher, VOA and Dubai-based intelligence analyst Martin Kelly of EOS Risk Group determined that the Jairan reported no significant draught change while docked at Liuheng Island through February and into early March. That meant the Iranian vessel was sitting at the almost same depth in the water as when it arrived in eastern China late last year, indicating it had not been loaded with any major cargo since then. The Jairan remained at Liuheng Island until March 3, when it headed south toward Zhuhai Gaolan and docked at the port on March 8. Two days later, the Jairan departed, reporting its destination as Bandar Abbas with an expected arrival of March 26. The Iranian ship also reported a significant draught change upon leaving Zhuhai Gaolan, transmitting data showing it was sitting more than 2 meters deeper in the water and indicating it had taken on a major cargo at the port, Kelly told VOA. As of Friday, local time, the Jairan was in the waters of Indonesia's Riau Archipelago, heading southwest toward the Singapore Strait. The U.S. State Department had no comment on the Jairan's departure from China when contacted by VOA. Iran's U.N. mission in New York did not respond to a similar VOA request for comment, emailed on Tuesday. Last month, the State Department told VOA it was aware of the January news reports by The Financial Times and Wall Street Journal regarding Iran's purported use of the Golbon and Jairan to import sodium perchlorate from China. A spokesperson said the State Department does not comment on intelligence matters but 'remains focused on preventing the proliferation of items, equipment, and technology that could benefit Iran's missile or other weapons programs and continues to hold Iran accountable through sanctions.' Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesperson Mao Ning responded to the news reports in a Jan. 23 press briefing, asserting that China abides by its own export controls and international obligations and rejects other countries' imposition of what Beijing considers illegal unilateral sanctions. In the past month, Chinese state media have made no reference to the Jairan, while China’s social media platforms also have had no observable discussion about the Iranian ship, according to a review by VOA’s Mandarin Service. In its Jan. 22 report, The Financial Times cited 'security officials in two Western countries' as saying the Jairan would depart China in early February, but it did not leave until March 10. Gregory Brew, a senior Iran analyst at the Eurasia Group, a New York-based political risk consultancy, said Iran may have wanted to see if the Golbon could complete its voyage from China without being interdicted before sending the Jairan to follow it. 'Ships carrying highly sensitive materials related to Iran's missile industry, which is under U.S. sanctions, are at risk of interception, and the Iranians likely are conscious of that,' Brew said. Eight Republican U.S. senators led by Jim Risch and Pete Ricketts sent a letter to Secretary of State Marco Rubio about the purported Iran-China chemical scheme dated Feb. 4, urging him to work with global partners of the U.S. 'to intercept and stop the shipments currently underway' if the press reports proved accurate. There was no sign of the Golbon being intercepted on its recent China to Iran voyage. Responding to VOA's query about the letter, a U.S. State Department press officer said: 'We do not comment on Congressional correspondence.' Ricketts' office also did not respond to a VOA inquiry about whether Rubio has responded to the senators' letter. VOA's Mandarin Service contributed to this report.	https://www.voanews.com/a/exclusive-second-iranian-ship-suspected-of-carrying-missile-ingredient-leaves-china/8010476.html	2025-03-13T22:05:35-07:00	
Putin says Ukrainians must 'surrender or die'	Russian President Vladimir Putin said on Thursday that Russia had trapped the remaining Ukrainian soldiers in its western Kursk region, where they have held on for more than seven months in one of the most important battles of the war. Putin told reporters in Moscow that the situation in Kursk was 'completely under our control, and the group that invaded our territory is in isolation,' according to Reuters. Ukraine launched a surprise incursion into Kursk last August to divert Russian forces away from the front lines and grab land to trade for its own occupied territory. Ukraine's top commander denied this week that his men were being encircled. Putin on Wednesday made a surprise visit to troops in Russia's western Kursk region Wednesday, ordering soldiers to swiftly retake the region from Ukrainian forces. 'If a physical blockade occurs in the coming days, then no one will be able to leave at all, there will be only two ways — to surrender or die,' Putin said at the Thursday press conference, according to Reuters. At the press conference, Putin also offered his qualified support for a U.S. ceasefire plan. Putin's comments came after Russian aerial attacks overnight killed at least two people in the southern Ukrainian region of Kherson, officials said Thursday. Kherson Governor Oleksandr Prokudin said on Telegram that his region came under attack by Russian drones and shelling, and that one other person was injured. In the neighboring Dnipropetrovsk region, Governor Serhiy Lysak said at least three people were hospitalized after a Russian attack hit the city of Dnipro. Lysak said on Telegram the attack damaged multiple apartment buildings, including blowing out windows. Officials in the Sumy region reported Thursday that Russian drones fell on a set of garages, setting about 20 of them on fire. Ukraine's military said Thursday it shot down 74 of the 117 drones that Russian forces launched overnight. The intercepts took place over the Chernihiv, Dnipropetrovsk, Kharkiv, Khmelnytskyi, Kyiv, Mykolaiv, Odesa, Poltava, Sumy, Vinnytsia and Zaporizhzhia regions, the military said. Russia's Defense Ministry said it shot down 77 Ukrainian drones, most of them in regions located along the Russia-Ukraine border. Vladislav Shapsha, governor of the Kaluga region, said the attacks injured one person and damaged an industrial building, a communication tower and a power line. The Russia military said it destroyed 30 of the drones over Bryansk, while officials in the region reported no damage or casualties. Russian air defense also shot down drones over Kursk, Voronezh, Rostov and Belgorod, the military said. The daily aerial attacks continue amid a U.S. push to secure a cease-fire in the conflict. The U.S. has proposed a 30-day halt in fighting, which Ukraine has said it would accept. U.S. officials are expected to discuss the plan with Russian officials in the coming days. Some information for this report was provided by Agence France-Presse and Reuters.	https://www.voanews.com/a/putin-says-ukrainians-must-surrender-or-die-/8010430.html	2025-03-13T19:50:59-07:00

Constitutional crisis shakes Bosnia	The national assembly of Bosnia's Serb-controlled Republika Srpska on Thursday adopted the draft of the new Republic Constitution, introduced by the autonomous republic's president, Milorad Dodik, that includes articles that violate Bosnia's constitution. Bosnian state prosecutors on Wednesday had ordered the arrest of Dodik and his aides for ignoring a court summons for allegedly trying to undermine Bosnia's constitution. Republika Srpska is an entity within Bosnia and Herzegovina. Last month, a Bosnian court sentenced Dodik to one year in prison and banned him from politics for six years over his separatist activities and for defying decisions by the international High Representative that oversees the 1995 Dayton Accords. That agreement ended an ethnically rooted war that lasted more than three years and killed 100,000 people. Dodik rejected the arrest warrant, telling journalists in the regional capital, Banja Luka, on Wednesday that it was politically motivated and that he would ask Russia to veto an extension of the presence of EUFOR, the European Union's peacekeeping force in Bosnia, at the U.N. Security Council. In an interview Thursday with VOA's Bosnian Service, Dodik's lawyer, Anto Nobilo, said Dodik does not recognize either the Bosnian court or state prosecutor's office, and thus does not need legal defense. 'I do not believe there will be Dodik's arrest,' Nobilo said. 'Mr. Dodik will not cooperate, or name his defense team, because he does not consider the proceedings legitimate. ... Bosnia needs this situation defused immediately. This is a huge constitutional and legal and political crisis and has to be resolved politically.' Nenad Stevandic, president of Republika Srpska's national assembly and a close ally of Dodik, denounced the moves against the Serb-controlled autonomous republic as an attack on the constitutional order. 'We are absolutely right,' he said Wednesday. 'However, to be right in Bosnia and Herzegovina means to be persecuted.' Meanwhile, in Washington, three members of the U.S. Senate — Chuck Grassley, Jeanne Shaheen and Jim Risch — led a group of nine other members of the U.S. Congress in calling on Secretary of State Marco Rubio to prevent further deterioration in Bosnia. 'We are deeply concerned about the recent actions of Milorad Dodik, the leader of the Republika Srpska entity within Bosnia and Herzegovina,' they wrote in a letter to Rubio. 'For years, he has engaged in secessionist activity, challenging Bosnia and Herzegovina's state institutions, undermining the constitution and threatening the territorial integrity of the country.' The U.S. imposed sanctions on Dodik and his 'patronage network' in 2023 and again in January of this year. Asked by VOA while en route Monday to Jeddah, Saudi Arabia, if the U.S. was considering 'any punitive action against Dodik,' Rubio said the Trump administration did not want to see a partition of Bosnia. 'The last thing the world needs is another crisis, and we've spoken out about that already,' he said. 'As far as what we maybe do next, we're reviewing those options. But it's been abundantly clear that whatever differences may exist internally there, this cannot lead to a country breaking apart, and it cannot lead to another conflict.' Experts say the actions of Dodik and the Republika Srpska national assembly have precipitated Bosnia's most serious constitutional crisis since 1995. 'First of all, it is a reflection of [Dodik's] disrespect for fundamental state institutions, meaning, the Court of Bosnia and Herzegovina, and the Constitutional Court of Bosnia and Herzegovina and all those fundamental postulates on which the constitutional-legal order rests,' Milos Davidovic, professor of law at the University of Sarajevo, told VOA's Bosnian Service. Ahmed Kico, a political and security expert, told VOA the actions of Dodik and the Republika Srpska national assembly were among 'hybrid operations … realized at the behest of the Russian Federation and Serbia … therefore, it is a really dangerous situation where they are trying to show and prove that Bosnia and Herzegovina's survival is not possible as a democratic state.' Amid the growing crisis, additional European peacekeepers arrived in Bosnia on Wednesday to bolster those of EUFOR.	https://www.voanews.com/a/constitutional-crisis-shakes-bosnia/8010418.html	2025-03-13T18:57:43-07:00

Homeland Security, rights group to meet in court over migrants at Guantanamo Bay	PENTAGON — U.S. government lawyers are expected to face off with attorneys for civil and immigration rights groups over the use of a U.S. naval base in Cuba to hold migrants slated for deportation. Arguments in the two lawsuits over operations at Naval Station Guantanamo Bay, filed against the Department of Homeland Security and Secretary Kristi Noem, are set for a U.S. District Court in Washington on Friday. The suits allege that the U.S. government has overstepped its bounds by denying migrants sent to Guantanamo Bay access to legal representation and also by attempting to send migrants to the base's facilities without the proper legal authority in violation of the U.S. Constitution. DHS officials did not immediately respond to a request for comment on the upcoming hearing, but they have repeatedly denied the allegations while criticizing the groups bringing the lawsuits. 'The American Civil Liberties Union appears far more interested in promoting open borders and disrupting public safety missions than in protecting the civil liberties of Americans,' a DHS spokesperson told VOA in a statement earlier this month, declining to be named. 'They should consider changing their name,' the spokesperson added, further describing the legal challenges as 'baseless.' President Donald Trump first raised the idea of using the U.S. naval base in Cuba as part of his administration's plans for mass deportations shortly after taking office in January. Homeland Security's Noem said the base, which features a secure prison to hold captured terrorists, would be used to house 'the worst of the worst.' Trump and other U.S. officials also suggested the base could be used to hold up to 30,000 migrants while they awaited deportation. Those plans, however, never fully materialized. The U.S. began sending what officials described as 'high threat illegal aliens' to Guantanamo Bay's detention center in early February, followed by other nonviolent migrants, who stayed at other facilities. At times, the facilities held close to 200 detainees, many of whom were deported to Honduras, Venezuela or other countries. But despite efforts to prepare the facilities for more migrants, capacity has been limited. According to a U.S. defense official, who spoke to VOA on the condition of anonymity, the prison as currently configured can hold only 130 detainees, while the base's Migrant Operations Center and a temporary tent city can hold, at most, 550 people. As VOA first reported, DHS officials decided to remove all 40 remaining migrants from the prison and other facilities at Guantanamo Bay this past Tuesday, flying them instead to the U.S. southern state of Louisiana. Neither DHS nor its subagency, Immigration and Customs Enforcement, have responded to requests for comment on the decision to evacuate migrants from the naval base or on their status or whereabouts since being returned to the U.S. mainland. The move — and lack of communication — has drawn criticism from immigrants' rights groups, including some of those involved in the current litigation. 'The arbitrary and secret shuttling of people between Guantanamo and the U.S. demonstrates a complete disregard for human dignity, an affront to the rule of law, and a waste of public resources,' said the International Refugee Assistance Project's Pedro Sepulveda. 'No one should be detained at Guantanamo,' Sepulveda added. 'The Trump administration must stop these ill-conceived and cruel transfers and stop detaining immigrants at Guantanamo once and for all.'	https://www.voanews.com/a/homeland-security-rights-group-to-meet-in-court-over-migrants-at-guantanamo-bay-/8010057.html	2025-03-13T16:09:03-07:00	
Publisher Zamora reimprisoned in Guatemala in move lawyer calls ‘inhumane’	washington — A Guatemalan judge ordered prominent journalist Jose Ruben Zamora back to prison this week in a move that the leader of his legal team called 'inhumane.' Zamora on Monday returned to Mariscal Zavala prison in Guatemala City on the orders of Judge Erick Garcia, whose decision came after another court revoked house arrest from the elPeriodico founder. The publisher is awaiting another trial in a money-laundering case that press freedom groups say is politically motivated. 'We’re very troubled by what’s happening in Jose Ruben Zamora’s case, because what we’re seeing here is a total breakdown of rule of law in Guatemala,' Caoilfhionn Gallagher, who is leading Zamora’s international legal team, told VOA. 'He obviously shouldn’t have spent a single day in prison. This latest revocation of his house arrest terms is legally problematic, grossly unfair and inhumane,' Gallagher added. Zamora, 67, attended the hearing on Monday. Near the end of his appearance, he called the ruling 'arbitrary.' During the hearing, the judge said he and his staff had been threatened by unnamed individuals, but he did not elaborate. 'They left him cornered with no way out,' Zamora said in court. Zamora founded elPeriodico in 1996. The newspaper was known for its investigations into corruption across multiple governments in Guatemala. But in 2022, authorities arrested Zamora and later froze the newspaper’s assets. The publication was forced to shutter in 2023. A court later sentenced Zamora to six years in prison on money-laundering charges. An appeals court overturned the conviction and ordered a new trial for 2025. Zamora’s legal team has rejected all the accusations. The United Nations Working Group on Arbitrary Detention has also determined that Zamora’s detention is arbitrary and called for his release. The publisher spent more than 800 days in prison before a court in October granted him house arrest while he awaited his new trial. Another court in November revoked Zamora’s house arrest, but his lawyers were able to postpone the order for a few months. Artur Romeu, director of the Latin America bureau of Reporters Without Borders, called the decision to reimprison Zamora a 'blatant case of judicial weaponization.' Guatemala’s Washington embassy did not immediately reply to VOA’s email requesting comment. During Zamora’s previous time in prison, the publisher was subjected to conditions that Gallagher characterized as 'inhumane and degrading' and 'a violation of international standards.' Zamora’s health was better while under house arrest, Gallagher said, but now his legal team is concerned about the environment he returned to. 'Being returned to those conditions is horrifying and unacceptable,' Gallagher said. Nine press freedom and rights groups this week called for Zamora’s immediate release. 'We urge Guatemalan authorities to guarantee his right to a fair and impartial trial, free from undue interference and pressure,' they said in a joint statement. Zamora’s case underscores a global trend in which politically motivated legal proceedings and trials against journalists are drawn out over a long time, according to Gallagher. Gallagher’s other clients include jailed pro-democracy publisher Jimmy Lai in Hong Kong; Nobel laureate Maria Ressa from the Philippines; and the family of journalist Daphne Caruana Galizia, who was killed in Malta in 2017. 'What we’re seeing in Jose Ruben Zamora’s case in Guatemala, or Jimmy Lai’s case in Hong Kong, are these very prolonged proceedings which actually keep the person in prison and try to hold the international response at bay for as long as possible,' Gallagher said. 'That’s a real problem.'	https://www.voanews.com/a/publisher-zamora-reimprisoned-in-guatemala-in-move-his-lawyers-call-inhumane-/8010046.html	2025-03-13T16:03:04-07:00	
Ukraine peace, global security top G7 agenda as diplomats convene in Canada	CHARLEVOIX, QUEBEC — Top diplomats from the Group of Seven leading industrial nations gathered Thursday in Charlevoix, Quebec, as host country Canada outlined its top agenda, focusing on achieving a 'just and lasting peace in Ukraine' and strengthening security and defense partnerships as the G7 marks 50 years. During the opening remarks, Canadian Foreign Minister Melanie Joly said, 'Peace and stability is on the top of our agenda, and I look forward to discussing how we can continue to support Ukraine in the face of Russia's illegal aggression.' Joly also emphasized the importance of addressing maritime security challenges, citing threats such as 'growing the use of growing shadow fleets, dark vessels' and 'sabotage of critical undersea infrastructure.' U.S. Secretary of State Marco Rubio has said he hopes a ceasefire between Russia and Ukraine could take place within days if the Kremlin agrees. He also plans to urge G7 foreign ministers to focus on ending the Russia-Ukraine war. The G7 talks in Quebec follow U.S.-Ukraine talks in Jeddah, Saudi Arabia, where Ukraine said it is ready to accept a U.S. proposal for 'an immediate, interim 30-day ceasefire.' 'Ukraine is committed to moving quickly toward peace, and we are prepared to do our part in creating all of the conditions for a reliable, durable, and decent peace,' Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy wrote Wednesday in a post on social media platform X. He added that 'Ukraine was ready for an air and sea ceasefire,' and 'welcomed' the U.S. proposal to extend it to land. Russian President Vladimir Putin said Thursday that Russia supports the U.S. ceasefire proposal in principle, but key details still need to be worked out. 'Ceasefire, they can't be coming with conditions, because all these conditions just blur the picture. Either you want to end this war, or you don't want to end this war, so we need to be very firm,' said European Union foreign policy chief Kaja Kallas during an interview with CNN International. 'What we need to keep in mind is that Russia has invested, like over 9% of its GDP on the military, so they would want to use it,' Kallas said, adding the European nations 'are massively increasing' their 'defense investments.' The G7 talks bring together ministers from Britain, Canada, France, Germany, Italy, Japan and the United States. Rubio has underscored the need for monitors if a ceasefire is implemented. He told reporters on Wednesday that 'one of the things we'll have to determine is who do both sides trust to be on the ground to sort of monitor some of the small arms fire and exchanges that could happen.' Beyond Ukraine, G7 foreign ministers also discussed China’s role in global security, Indo-Pacific stability, and maritime security behind closed doors. Rubio is expected to have a pull-aside meeting with Japanese Foreign Minister Takeshi Iwaya on Thursday.	https://www.voanews.com/a/ukraine-peace-global-security-top-g7-agenda-as-diplomats-convene-in-canada-/8010030.html	2025-03-13T14:46:06-07:00	
Turkey warns Iran against hindering peace deal with Kurdish rebels	Tensions are rising between Turkey and Iran, with Ankara warning Tehran not to undermine efforts to end its war with a Kurdish rebel group, the PKK. As Dorian Jones reports from Istanbul, a peace deal with the Kurdish rebels would be a boost for Turkey in its race to gain influence in Syria.	https://www.voanews.com/a/turkey-warns-iran-against-hindering-peace-deal-with-kurdish-rebels/8010004.html	2025-03-13T14:32:21-07:00	
Wall Street tumbles 10% below its record after Trump escalates trade war	NEW YORK — Wall Street's sell-off hit a new low Thursday after U.S. President Donald Trump's escalating trade war dragged the S&P 500 more than 10% below its record, which was set just last month. A 10% drop is deemed a correction by professional investors, and the S&P 500's 1.4% slide on Thursday sent the index to its first since 2023. The losses came after Trump upped the stakes in his trade war by threatening huge taxes on European wines and alcohol. Not even a double-shot of good news on the U.S. economy could stop the bleeding. The Dow Jones Industrial Average dropped 537 points, or 1.3% Thursday, and the Nasdaq composite fell 2%. The dizzying, battering swings for stocks have been coming not just day to day but also hour to hour, and the Dow hurtled between a slight gain and a drop of 689 points through Thursday's trading. The turbulence is a result of uncertainty about how much pain Trump will let the economy endure through tariffs and other policies to reshape the country and world as he wants. The president has said he wants manufacturing jobs back in the United States, along with a smaller U.S. government workforce and other fundamental changes. Trump's latest escalation came Thursday when he threatened 200% tariffs on Champagne and other European wines, unless the European Union rolls back a tariff it announced on U.S. whiskey. The European Union unveiled that move on Wednesday, in response to U.S. tariffs on European steel and aluminum. U.S. households and businesses have reported drops in confidence because of all the uncertainty about which tariffs will stick from Trump's barrage of on-again, off-again announcements. That's raised fears about a pullback in spending that could sap energy from the economy. Some U.S. businesses say they've begun to see a change in their customers' behavior because of the uncertainty. A particularly feared scenario for the economy is one where its growth stagnates but inflation stays high because of tariffs. Few tools are available in Washington to fix what's called stagflation. There was good news Thursday, and it came on both those economic fronts. One report showed inflation at the wholesale level last month was milder than economists expected. It followed a similarly encouraging report from the prior day on inflation that U.S. consumers are feeling. A separate report, meanwhile, said fewer U.S. workers applied for unemployment benefits last week than economists expected. It's the latest signal that the job market remains relatively solid overall. If that can continue, it could allow U.S. consumers to keep spending, and that's the main engine of the economy.	https://www.voanews.com/a/wall-street-tumbles-10-below-its-record-after-trump-escalates-trade-war/8010009.html	2025-03-13T14:14:25-07:00	
Afghanistan denies link to train attack in Pakistan	The Afghan Taliban have rejected Pakistan's allegation that Tuesday's deadly hostage-taking of a train was planned and directed from Afghan soil. Afghanistan's Ministry of Foreign Affairs called Pakistan's assertions 'baseless,' in a statement Thursday. 'We categorically reject baseless allegations by Pakistani army spokesperson linking attack on a passenger train in Balochistan province with Afghanistan,' foreign ministry spokesperson Abdul Qahar Balkhi said in a statement posted on X. Militants linked with the banned Baloch Liberation Army attacked a passenger train Tuesday near Sibi, Balochistan, taking hundreds hostage. At least 21 passengers and four paramilitary troops died in the attack. The military claimed the killing of 33 terrorists. Lieutenant General Ahmed Sharif Chaudhry, director general of the Pakistani military's media wing Inter Services Public Relations, had earlier said attackers collaborated with partners in Afghanistan. 'During the operation, these terrorists were in contact with their supporters and masterminds in Afghanistan via satellite phone,' Chaudhry told a private news channel as he declared the clearance operation over Wednesday night. Later, the military's media wing reiterated the assertion. 'Intelligence reports have unequivocally confirmed that the attack was orchestrated and directed by terrorist ringleaders operating from Afghanistan, who were in direct communication with terrorists throughout the incident,' a statement from the ISPR said. Rebutting the claim, Balkhi said Islamabad must address internal issues. '[We] urge Pakistani side to focus on resolving their own security and internal problems instead of such irresponsible remarks,' the Taliban foreign ministry spokesperson said. Tuesday's attack marked a dramatic escalation in the separatist insurgency that has ravaged Balochistan for nearly two decades. The militants blew up tracks, bringing the train with nearly 450 passengers to a halt in a tunnel, where they stormed it. Survivors told VOA the attackers singled out security personnel and ethnic Punjabi passengers, shooting many. 'Pakistan expects the Interim Afghan Government to uphold its responsibilities and deny use of its soil for terrorist activities against Pakistan,' the military said in written comments to the media Wednesday, repeating an increasingly frequent demand. On Thursday, the spokesperson for Pakistan's Ministry of Foreign Affairs, Ambassador Shafqat Ali Khan, repeated Islamabad's stance. 'We urge Afghanistan to hold perpetrators, organizers, financiers, of this reprehensible act of terrorism accountable and cooperate with the government of Pakistan to bring all those who are concerned with this attack, including the real sponsors of terrorism, to justice,' Khan told media at the weekly briefing. Balkhi rejected the allegation that Baloch separatists have put down roots across the border. 'No members of Balouch opposition have presence in Afghanistan, nor have they ever had or have any links with the Islamic Emirate,' Balkhi said in his post on X. The Taliban refer to their government as the Islamic Emirate. Pakistan has seen a sharp increase in terrorism in the last year, with deaths rising by nearly 45% in 2024 from the year before. The country now ranks second on the Global Terrorism Watchlist with Tehreek-e-Taliban Pakistan, or TTP, an ideological offshoot of the Afghan Taliban, and the separatist Baloch Liberation Army emerging as the deadliest outfits. Speaking at a United Nations Security Council meeting on Afghanistan this week, Pakistan's permanent representative to the United Nations, Munir Akram, said Kabul was failing to rein in Baloch separatists. 'The Kabul authorities have failed to address the threat posed to the region and beyond by other terrorist groups, such as al Qaida, the TTP and Baloch terrorists, including the BLA and the Majeed Brigade, which are present in Afghanistan,' the Pakistani envoy said Monday.	https://www.voanews.com/a/afghanistan-denies-link-to-train-attack-in-pakistan/8009976.html	2025-03-13T14:12:06-07:00	
Foreign bloggers help China spread propaganda, analysis finds	Foreign bloggers who praise China rapidly gain popularity and millions of followers on Chinese social media platforms. VOA examined the facts and spoke with experts to shed light on the government’s efforts behind the phenomenon. 'It is a long-standing tradition of the Chinese Communist Party to use foreigners to voice its propaganda for added credibility,' said Mareike Ohlberg, a senior fellow at the German Marshall Fund. Foreign influencers cooperate with the Chinese government, the media and third parties to create and boost content that supports government narratives, Ohlberg said. One of the most common topics that foreign influencers focus on is whitewashing human rights abuses in Xinjiang. The U.N. Human Rights Office and groups like Amnesty International estimate that more than 1 million people – mostly Uyghurs – have been confined in internment camps in Xinjiang. One of the most recent and maybe most popular foreign characters in China is a French national, Marcus Detrez, who became a media sensation in 2024. Japanese occupation photos Last year, Detrez posted a series of historic photographs on the Chinese social media platform Douyin that depicted life under the Japanese occupation in the early 20th century. He claimed the images were taken by his grandfather and said he wanted to donate them to China. Detrez enjoyed a year of celebrity treatment from Chinese authorities, including touring across China, while state media outlets profiled him as a hero. In February, however, historians exposed Detrez as a fraud. The photographs he claimed were unique family heirlooms turned out to be publicly available online in various museums around the world. But the thread of glorified foreign bloggers started much earlier. One of the pioneers on Chinese social media is a Russian internet celebrity, Vladislav Kokolevskiy, known in China as Fulafu. He amassed 12.89 million followers on Douyin, where he posts short video clips praising life in China. In November 2023, the Australian Strategic Policy Institute wrote that in China, Fulafu has 'become a household name through his ostentatious displays of affection for China,' identifying him as a Chinese government propagandist. Kokolevskiy does not make commercial ad disclaimers. However, CMGM, an outlet covering China news, reported in January 2021 that he received advertisement contracts within 15 days for NetEase's 'Heavenly Oracle' mobile game and online retailers Pinduoduo and Tmall. The companies paid about $11,000 for each ad, bringing Fulafu's advertising revenue up to about $33,000 for January 2021 alone, according to the report. Like Fulafu, dozens of foreigners grew to stardom on the Chinese internet during the last decade, Ohlberg said. Among them is Gerald Kowal, known also as Jerry Guo, an American who has risen to popularity in China after an interview with state-owned CCTV in 2020. At the time, Kowal had been posting series of short videos critical of New York City authorities’ handling of the COVID-19 pandemic. He also repeated debunked conspiracy theories, claiming, for example, that the U.S. military brought the coronavirus to China. CCTV broadcasted his interview from New York live. The China Newsweek magazine profiled Kowal in May 2020 as 'one of the most influential internet celebrities,' calling him a 'war correspondent' for his videos from pandemic-stricken New York. Third-party promoters The success of a large number of foreign influencers is closely tied to multichannel networks or MCNs, which are third-party organizations that promote the growth of certain content creators, operating behind the scenes. One of the MCN industry leaders is YChina, founded in 2016 by Israeli businessman Amir Gal-Or and his Chinese partner and former classmate, Fang Yedun, as part of Gal-Or's 'Crooked Nuts Research Institute,' which focuses on documenting the lives of foreigners in China. YChina started with the cross-platform sharing of short video interviews with Western expats living in China. It initially focused on cultural topics and soon accumulated more than 100 million followers among its internet influencers from over 30 countries, including Israel, the United States, Australia, Spain, Argentina, Japan and Thailand. Chinese democracy activists in exile have accused YChina of supporting Chinese government propaganda about Xinjiang and Hong Kong. In July 2024, the China Public Diplomacy Association, which is under the supervision of China's Ministry of Foreign Affairs, gathered more than 30 foreign influencers from 25 countries to participate in a training camp and visit various cities in China. The bloggers were asked to record their experiences on video and share them online. China’s state-controlled media outlets boost such bloggers, presenting them to domestic audiences within the narrative of a prosperous nation under the Communist Party. For example, the Xinhua News Agency's series in 2024 on foreign internet celebrities in China showed videos of influencers from all over the world walking the streets of China's major cities praising their 'cleanest streets in the world' and 'efficient garbage disposal system.' In using these foreign bloggers, the Chinese Communist Party wants to show that life in China is not what rights groups and China’s critics abroad say it is. The government exploits the idea that unless 'you come and see, you have no right to judge,' the German Marshall Fund’s Ohlberg said. The core of this idea is 'very hypocritical,' Ohlberg added, because 'the Communist Party allows these people to go only where it wants them to go and see only what it wants them to see. And if you're critical, you certainly won't get the opportunity to go on a field trip.'	https://www.voanews.com/a/foreign-bloggers-help-china-spread-propaganda-analysis-finds/8009973.html	2025-03-13T13:29:05-07:00	
Trump asks Supreme Court to intervene in bid to curb birthright citizenship	WASHINGTON — Donald Trump took the fight over his attempt to restrict automatic U.S. birthright citizenship to the Supreme Court on Thursday as the Republican president's administration asked the justices to narrow a judicial block imposed on this key element of his hardline approach toward immigration. The Justice Department made the request challenging the scope of three nationwide injunctions issued against Trump's order by federal courts in Washington state, Massachusetts and Maryland. The administration said the injunctions should be scaled back from applying universally and limited to just the plaintiffs that brought the cases and are 'actually within the courts' power.' 'Universal injunctions have reached epidemic proportions since the start of the current administration,' the Justice Department said in the filing. 'This court should declare that enough is enough before district courts' burgeoning reliance on universal injunctions becomes further entrenched.' Trump's order, signed on his first day back in office on Jan. 20, directed federal agencies to refuse to recognize the citizenship of U.S.-born children who do not have at least one parent who is an American citizen or lawful permanent resident. The order was intended to apply starting Feb. 19 but has been blocked nationwide by multiple federal judges. Trump's action has drawn a series of lawsuits from plaintiffs, including 22 Democratic state attorneys general, immigrant rights advocates and expectant mothers. They argue among other things that Trump's order violates a right enshrined in the U.S. Constitution's 14th Amendment that provides that anyone born in the United States is a citizen. The 14th Amendment's citizenship clause states that all 'persons born or naturalized in the United States, and subject to the jurisdiction thereof, are citizens of the United States and of the state wherein they reside.' The administration contends that the 14th Amendment, long understood to confer citizenship to virtually anyone born in the United States, does not extend to immigrants who are in the country illegally or even to immigrants whose presence is lawful but temporary, such as university students or those on work visas. Its request to the justices marks its latest trip to the top U.S. judicial body to defend Trump's actions. The Supreme Court's 6-3 conservative majority includes three justices appointed by Trump during his first term as president. Trump's push to restrict birthright citizenship is part of a broader immigration and border crackdown that includes tasking the U.S. military with aiding border security and issuing a broad ban on asylum. The judges who ruled against Trump's order faulted it as conflicting with the Constitution. An 1898 U.S. Supreme Court ruling in a case called United States v. Wong Kim Ark long has been interpreted as guaranteeing that children born in the United States to noncitizen parents are entitled to American citizenship. Trump's Justice Department has argued that the court's ruling in that case was narrower, applying to children whose parents had a 'permanent domicile and residence in the United States.'	https://www.voanews.com/a/trump-asks-supreme-court-to-intervene-in-bid-to-curb-birthright-citizenship/8009956.html	2025-03-13T13:15:52-07:00	
Asteroid probe snaps rare images of Martian moon	PARIS — On the way to investigate the scene of a historic asteroid collision, a European spacecraft swung by Mars and captured rare images of the red planet's mysterious small moon Deimos, the European Space Agency said Thursday. Europe's HERA mission is aiming to find out how much of an impact a NASA spacecraft made when it deliberately smashed into an asteroid in 2022 in the first test of our planetary defenses. But HERA will not reach the asteroid — which is 11 million kilometers from Earth in the asteroid belt between Mars and Jupiter — until late 2026. On the long voyage there, the spacecraft swung around Mars on Wednesday. The spacecraft used the planet's gravity to get a 'kick' that also changed its direction and saved fuel, mission analyst Pablo Munoz told a press conference. For an hour, HERA flew as close as 5,600 kilometers from the Martian surface, at a speed of 33,480 kilometers an hour. It used the opportunity to test some of its scientific instruments, snapping around 600 pictures, including rare ones of Deimos. The lumpy, 12.5-kilometer-wide moon is the smaller and less well-known of the two moons of Mars. Exactly how Deimos and the bigger Phobos were formed remains a matter of debate. Some scientists believe they were once asteroids that were captured in the gravity of Mars, while others think they could have been shot from a massive impact on the surface. The new images add 'another piece of the puzzle' to efforts to determine their origin, Marcel Popescu of the Astronomical Institute of the Romanian Academy said. There are hopes that data from HERA's 'HyperScout' and thermal infrared imagers — which observe colors beyond the limits of the human eye — will shed light on this mystery by discovering more about the moon's composition. Those infrared imagers are why the red planet appears blue in some of the photos. Next, HERA will turn its focus back to the asteroid Dimorphos. When NASA's DART mission smashed into Dimorphos in 2022, it shortened the 160-meter-wide asteroid's orbit around its big brother Didymos by 33 minutes. Although Dimorphos itself posed no threat to Earth, HERA intends to discover whether this technique could be an effective way for Earth to defend itself against possibly existence-threatening asteroids in the future. Space agencies have working to ramp up Earth's planetary defenses, monitoring for potential threats so they can be dealt with as soon as possible. Earlier this year, a newly discovered asteroid capable of destroying a city was briefly given a more than 3% chance of hitting Earth in 2032. However further observations sent the chances of a direct hit back down to nearly zero. Richard Moissl, head of the ESA's planetary defense office, said that asteroid, 2024 YR, followed a pattern that will become more common. As we get better at scanning the skies, 'we will discover asteroids at a higher rate,' he said. The ESA is developing a second planetary defense mission to observe the 350-metre-wide asteroid Apophis, which will fly just 32,000 kilometers from Earth on April 13, 2029. If approved by the ESA's ministerial council, the Ramses mission will launch in 2028, reaching the asteroid two months before it approaches Earth.	https://www.voanews.com/a/asteroid-probe-snaps-rare-images-of-martian-moon/8009850.html	2025-03-13T12:29:34-07:00	
Children being brutalized in Sudan's civil war, say UNICEF and MSF	UNITED NATIONS — The head of the U.N. children’s program, UNICEF, said Thursday that 16 million children in Sudan are suffering horribly from the country’s civil war, with many facing daily threats of violence, starvation, disease and sexual assault. 'The fighting is happening right at their doorsteps, around their homes, their schools and hospitals, and across many of Sudan’s cities, towns, and villages,' Catherine Russell, UNICEF’s executive director, told a meeting of the U.N. Security Council. She said children under the age of five are particularly at risk, with more than 1.3 million living in five famine hotspots in the country, and another 3 million at risk of diseases including cholera, malaria and dengue due to the failing health system. At least 16.5 million young people are out of school. Russell said there were 221 cases of rape against children reported in nine of Sudan’s 18 states last year. She said two-thirds were girls. 'In 16 of the recorded cases, the children were under the age of five. Four were babies under the age of one,' she said. While she demanded an end to the hostilities, she said it would not erase the pain those children have endured. 'The trauma these children experience and the deep scars it leaves behind do not end with the signing of a ceasefire or a peace agreement,' she said. 'They will need ongoing care and support to heal and rebuild their lives.' The head of Doctors Without Borders (MSF) told the council that his teams in Sudan have also seen evidence of sexual violence, having treated 385 survivors last year. 'The vast majority — including some younger than five — had been raped, often by armed men,' said Secretary General Christopher Lockyear. 'Nearly half were assaulted while working in the fields. Women and girls are not merely unprotected, they are being brutally targeted.' The children are caught up in a power struggle between two rival generals that began in the capital, Khartoum, in April 2023, but has since spread to large parts of the country, including the Darfur region. The paramilitary Rapid Support Forces has been fighting the Sudanese Armed Forces, and the United Nations says both sides have committed grave human rights abuses. The head of MSF told the council that he was in Sudan six weeks ago and witnessed a scene of 'utter carnage' at one of their partner hospitals in Omdurman, near the capital. 'I witnessed the lives of men, women, and children being torn apart in front of me,' Lockyear said. He told the 15-nation Security Council that their repeated calls on the parties to end the war have gone unanswered. 'While statements are made in this chamber, civilians remain unseen, unprotected, bombed, besieged, raped, displaced, deprived of food, of medical care, of dignity,' Lockyear said. He later told reporters that the situation in Sudan 'is so catastrophic for millions of people, it should be something that is on all of our consciences on a daily basis.' The UNICEF director said the agency needs a billion dollars this year to provide critical support to 8.7 million children in Sudan, including nutrition, water and sanitation, protection, health, and education. She and Lockyear both urged the council to press the warring parties to remove obstacles to the delivery of aid.	https://www.voanews.com/a/children-being-brutalized-in-sudan-s-civil-war-say-unicef-and-msf/8009853.html	2025-03-13T12:25:26-07:00	
US lawmakers running out of time to fund government	U.S. lawmakers are running out of time to pass a short-term continuing resolution, or CR, that will fund the government past a March 14 deadline. 'Democrats need to decide if they're going to support funding legislation that came over from the House, or if they're going to shut down the government. So far, it's looking like they plan to shut it down,' Senate Majority Leader John Thune said on the Senate floor Thursday. Appropriations bills require a 60-vote threshold for passage in the Senate, which means Republicans need to secure at least eight Democratic votes. Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer has called for the Senate to pass an earlier version of the CR that Democrats were involved in negotiating. 'Funding the government should be a bipartisan effort. But Republicans chose a partisan path, drafting their continuing resolution without any input, any input, from congressional Democrats,' Schumer said on the Senate floor late Wednesday. Democratic senators say they are concerned about easing the way for the Trump administration to continue large-scale changes to the federal government and social safety net programs. 'I don't want a government shutdown,' Democratic Senator Chris Van Hollen said in a statement Thursday. 'And that's why I'd like to vote on a bill to keep the government open for 30 days while we have a bipartisan negotiation. But I will not support this Republican House bill that simply gives Elon Musk more fuel and more tools to dismantle big parts of the federal government in order to rig it for people like himself and the very rich.' 'Voting against the CR will hurt the American people and kill the incredible momentum that President [Donald] Trump has built over the past 51 days,' White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt told reporters earlier this week. The Republican-majority House of Representatives passed a short-term spending measure Tuesday by a vote of 217-213. The House went out of session for the rest of the week starting Tuesday afternoon, putting pressure on senators to pass its version of the CR. Speaker of the House Mike Johnson quelled dissent from within his Republican party to pass the spending measure. He told reporters Tuesday the seven-month continuing resolution was an important step toward implementing Trump's agenda of rooting out government waste and abuse through the Department of Government Efficiency, known as DOGE. 'It allows us to move forward with changing the size and scope of the federal government. There is a seismic shift going on in Washington right now. This is a different moment than we have ever been in. The DOGE work is finding massive amounts of fraud, waste and abuse,' Johnson said. 'We have a White House that is actually dedicated to getting us back onto a fiscally responsible track.' Independent watchdogs and analysts, however, say DOGE is using overly broad claims of fraud to generate support for large-scale cuts to federal programs and offices. Representative Thomas Massie was the lone Republican holdout, despite Trump's post Monday night on Truth Social calling for Massie to lose his seat if he voted against the spending measure. The continuing resolution buys lawmakers time to reach a compromise on Senate and House versions of government spending, a key tool for implementing Trump's domestic policy agenda. At question is how and when to enact a proposed extension of the 2017 tax cuts and how to pay down the U.S. deficit without cutting key safety net programs that help American voters. Senate leadership has proposed passing the tax cuts in a separate bill later this year.	https://www.voanews.com/a/us-lawmakers-running-out-of-time-to-fund-government/8009839.html	2025-03-13T12:03:21-07:00	
Can the US pry Russia away from China?	Western politicians have repeatedly called on China to limit or cease tacit support for Russia’s bloody war against Ukraine. In response, China’s leadership insists it is committed to peace and respect for the territorial integrity of other nations. But unlike most United Nations member states, China has never condemned Russia's full-scale invasion of Ukraine, and their military-diplomatic partnership — from joint bomber flights near the U.S. state of Alaska to votes in the U.N. Security Council — has only helped the Kremlin overcome its international isolation. While President Donald Trump has said he has good personal relations with both Russian President Vladimir Putin and Chinese President Xi Jinping, there is a consensus among experts in Washington that the China-Russia partnership poses a threat to U.S. interests, and that while Trump’s predecessor, Joe Biden, tried to establish a strategic dialogue with China, the Trump team appears to be prioritizing normalized ties with Russia while punishing China over trade. As the White House talks about the possibility of restoring economic cooperation with Russia, some of its officials are hinting at lifting or reducing the sanctions Washington has imposed on Moscow in recent years. Charles Hecker, an expert on Western-Russian economic ties and risks, and author of the book Zero Sum: The Arc of International Business in Russia, says some Western companies will quickly return to Russia if sanctions are lifted, particularly those involved in energy, metals and minerals. 'There’s only so much oil in Norway, and there’s only so much oil in Canada; the rest of it is in some countries that have a very high-risk environment,' Hecker told VOA’s Russian Service. 'And so, these kinds of companies are accustomed to business in these sorts of places, and they have the internal structures to help protect them. You know, there are energy companies doing business in Iraq right now. And I don’t want to compare Russia and Iraq, but they are high-risk environments.' Still, Hecker cautions, their return to doing business in Russia wouldn’t signal an overall U.S.-Russian rapprochement — let alone a fracturing of Sino-Russian relations. 'I think it will be very difficult for the West to pull Russia away from China,' he said. 'Allowing Western companies back into Russia doesn’t necessarily change President Putin’s hostility towards the West. President Putin remains antagonistic towards a Western-dominated political and economic system, and he has said over and over again that he wants to create an alternative political and economic environment – an alternative to the West. 'Part of that alternative includes China,' he added. 'You have never heard President Putin say anything ideologically against China. And the two are now important energy partners.' Limited popular domestic appeal U.S.-based FilterLabs analyzes public sentiment in regions where polling is problematic. According to a recently published assessment of popular attitudes expressed on Russian and Chinese social media networks, Sino-Russian relations are 'full of underlying tensions, mistrust, and diverging interests.' One of the report’s authors, Vasily Gatov, told VOA its research found that 'the Chinese and Russian populations are far from happy with this alliance of their authorities.' 'China does not perceive Russia as a reliable, safe and equal partner,' he said. 'Russia annexed the Amur Region from China; Russia adopted a completely colonial policy towards China during the 19th and early 20th centuries. Therefore, in my opinion, it is entirely possible to consider historical frictions as a vulnerability.' A media analyst at the University of Southern California’s Annenberg School for Communication and Journalism, Gatov also noted that, despite the Kremlin’s expectations, China’s economic presence inside Russia today remains 'several times smaller' than that of either Europe or the U.S. before Russia invaded Ukraine. Thus, while Russian and China have overlapping interests, they are not 'marching in lockstep.' 'They are very different, they have very different geopolitical focuses, very different political philosophies,' he said. Other experts, however, question the Filterlabs findings, warning that random Russian and Chinese opinions online are of limited value, especially as those casting the insights aren’t likely to influence policy. 'People who have the time and desire to comment on things on social media do not have much influence on how state policy is conducted,' Alexander Gabuev, director of the Berlin-based Carnegie Russia Eurasia Center, told VOA. 'And these people certainly do not have much influence on whether China transfers components for Russia's weapons or takes certain military technologies from it, since the people who comment on this simply do not have real knowledge of what is actually happening.' Gabuev added that 'the Chinese leadership has reasons to think that they have something to take from Russia in terms of military technology,' suggesting that China is extremely interested in gaining Russian experience in countering Western weapons during Russia's war in Ukraine. Does Trump see China as a threat? One critical question about whether Washington’s improved ties with Russia will loosen the Sino-Russian pact, say some analysts, is how Trump perceives China. Ali Wyne, senior research and advocacy advisor on the U.S. and China at the International Crisis Group, describes Trump as an anomaly for U.S. policy. 'Widespread bipartisan agreement in Congress and from one administration to the next [is] that China is American’s foremost strategic competitor,' he said. But 'President Trump, in many ways, is the most prominent dissenter from this alleged China consensus.' 'He doesn’t view President Xi [Jinping] in adversarial terms,' Wyne said. 'He actually calls President Xi a ‘dear friend’ of his. And he believes that his personal rapport with President Xi will be the decisive dynamic in setting — or resetting — the U.S.-China relationship over the next four years.'	https://www.voanews.com/a/can-the-us-pry-russia-away-from-china/8009771.html	2025-03-13T11:26:15-07:00	
Judge orders Trump administration to reinstate thousands of fired government workers	A California federal judge on Thursday ordered six U.S. agencies to reinstate thousands of recently hired employees who were fired as part of President Donald Trump's purge of the federal workforce. The ruling made by U.S. District Judge William Alsup during a hearing in San Francisco applies to the U.S. Department of Defense, Department of Veterans Affairs, Department of Agriculture, Department of Energy, Department of Interior and the Treasury Department. Alsup last month temporarily blocked the U.S. Office of Personnel Management, the human resources department for federal agencies, from ordering agencies to fire probationary employees, but he declined at the time to require that fired workers get their jobs back. Probationary workers typically have less than one year of service in their current roles, although some are longtime federal employees. They have fewer job protections than other government workers but, in general, can be fired only for performance issues. Alsup said on Thursday that OPM has no power to order firings, and there was evidence that it had improperly directed the termination of workers at the six agencies. He did not order the 16 other agencies named in the lawsuit by unions and nonprofit groups to reinstate workers. 'It is a sad day when our government would fire some good employee and say it was based on performance when they know good and well that’s a lie,' Alsup said. The potential scale of Trump's efforts to shrink the U.S. federal government could become clearer on Thursday, the deadline for government agencies to submit plans for a second wave of mass layoffs and to slash their budgets.	https://www.voanews.com/a/judge-orders-trump-administration-to-reinstate-thousands-of-fired-government-workers/8009741.html	2025-03-13T11:03:46-07:00	
Cyclone Jude batters Malawi, Mozambique; no deaths reported	BLANTYRE, MALAWI — Tropical Cyclone Jude slammed into parts of southern Africa this week, causing no deaths but leaving widespread damage, especially in Malawi and Mozambique. Officials in the two countries said thousands of people were homeless and some areas were without power. Aid agencies distributed relief where they could, but washed-away roads made the task difficult. The storm made landfall in northern Mozambique early Sunday and moved over southern Malawi, resulting in heavy rains affecting 13 districts from Monday to Wednesday. A preliminary assessment from Malawi’s Department of Disaster Management Affairs released Thursday showed that the cyclone had so far affected more than 11,000 people. This means their crops were washed away or their houses and property were either destroyed or submerged by floods. The assessment said the cyclone displaced more than 3,000 people, who are now sheltered in six evacuation camps. No deaths were recorded, but the disaster management department said collapsing buildings injured 15 people, including 5- and 8-year-old boys. 'The 5-year-old is receiving medical attention at Queen Elizabeth Central, and the 8-year-old is admitted as well and is at Mwanza District Hospital following the collapsing of a wall of a house,' said disaster management department spokesperson Chipiliro Khamula. He said rescuers were still looking for three people who went missing Tuesday in Nsanje and Phalombe districts after their boat capsized on a flooded river. The U.N. Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs said that in Mozambique, relief operations were severely hampered by lack of access to thousands of people in Nampula province, where main roads, bridges and culverts were washed away. The United Nations agency said moving relief items and personnel from Cabo Delgado province to Nampula was also difficult because the storm cut off the N1 national highway. In Malawi, international aid agencies and the government were able to start relief operations in accessible areas. For example, the World Food Program on Thursday distributed some relief items to affected people in Mulanje district. Simon Denhere, WFP’s acting country director in Malawi, said, 'With support from the UK government, WFP and the Department of Management Affairs have prepositioned food supplies, emergency kits and operational equipment, including search and rescue boats, to enable rapid response.' Lucy Mtilatila, director of Malawi’s Department of Climate Change and Meteorological Services, told VOA that Cyclone Jude had moved from Malawi to Mozambique, where it was expected to dissipate. 'Right now, the threat of the cyclone is almost over.' she said, adding that floods were still a concern, although 'the impact that could come with rains that we are getting now will be very minimal.' Jude is the third cyclone to affect Mozambique in the past three months, following Cyclones Chido in December and Dikeledi in January. Malawi avoided a hit from Dikeledi but was struck by Chido in December.	https://www.voanews.com/a/cyclone-jude-batters-malawi-mozambique-no-deaths-reported/8009719.html	2025-03-13T10:49:24-07:00	
Under what circumstances can a US green card be revoked?	Washington — The recent arrest of Palestinian activist and U.S. legal permanent resident Mahmoud Khalil, who played a prominent role in last year's Columbia University protests over the war in Gaza, has prompted questions about the limits of a green card. A green card holder since 2024, Khalil was granted lawful permanent residency status in the U.S. But green card holders can lose their status and face deportation if they violate immigration law. A federal judge on Wednesday extended efforts to halt Khalil’s deportation, and the New York resident remains in detention in Louisiana although he has not been charged with any crime. It is not a criminal offense to disagree, even openly, with the U.S. government's policy or actions, and the Bill of Rights protects free speech and the right to assemble. The why Green cards can be revoked, New York-based immigration lawyer Linda Dakin-Grimm told VOA. 'It’s not that common, but it also isn’t rare. People lose their green cards most often when they’re convicted of crimes. … A green card is not citizenship. It’s seen as a privilege that you earn, but you can also lose it if you engage in conduct that is contrary to the conditions that green card holders live under,' she said. Examples of crimes that can cause a green card holder can lose their status include aggravated felonies, drug offenses, fraud, or national security concerns such as ties to a terrorist group. Green card holders can also lose their status and lawful permanent residency status for being deemed a threat to national security. If a green card holder is accused of a crime, their criminal case will go through the justice system. But the process to revoke their permanent status takes place in immigration court, where officials must present evidence to justify revoking a green card. The how Revoking a green card is a legal process that starts when the U.S. government determines that an individual has violated immigration laws. The case can come to the government’s attention in different ways, either through a routine immigration check, law enforcement investigation, or whistleblower. 'It could theoretically be a whistleblower. Someone who has some information. … Could they call the State Department? Maybe. Could they call the ICE hotline? Maybe,' Dakin-Grimm said. The Department of Homeland Security usually initiates the process. The green card holder will receive a document known as a Notice to Appear in immigration court or, in serious cases, they may be arrested and detained. White House officials said Wednesday that Secretary of State Marco Rubio has the authority to revoke a green card or any visa if an individual’s activities in the United States 'would have potentially serious adverse foreign policy consequences' to the country. Rubio has said that Khalil’s case is not about free speech. 'No one has a right to a green card, by the way. … If you told us that’s what you intended to do when you came to America, we would have never let you in,' Rubio said on Wednesday. 'If you do it once you get in, we’re going to revoke it and kick you out.' The authority for the secretary of state to intervene in a case like Khalil’s stems from the Immigration and Nationality Act of 1952. A provision in the law allows the secretary of state to deem a non-citizen deportable if their presence or activities are believed to significantly harm U.S. foreign policy interests. According to Khalil’s NTA, Rubio has made that determination. Khalil has been ordered to appear in front of an immigration judge on March 27 at the Lasalle Detention Facility in Louisiana. The court In immigration court, the burden of proof is on the government; it must show the person violated immigration laws. In a case like Khalil’s, ICE attorneys will ask for deportation, but they will have to prove he is a threat to national security. The green card holder can also present a defense. In the criminal justice system, if a person cannot afford an attorney, the government must provide a public defender. In immigration court, however, immigrants have the right to their own attorney, but the government does not have to provide one. If immigrants cannot afford an attorney or cannot find one to represent them pro bono, they do will not have access to legal representation. Dakin-Grimm says the process can sometimes go fast, but it is also complex. In the immigration court system, the decision to revoke a green card is an administrative procedure conducted by the Department of Justice, under an office known as the Executive Office for Immigration Review. 'It’s kind of like the government is prosecuting a case, and the judge is also the government,' Dakin-Grimm said. The outcome If the immigration judge rules against the green card holder, they can appeal to the Board of Immigration Appeals (BIA). And if the BIA agrees with the government, the green card holder can appeal to a Federal Court of Appeals. Although the case can end up at the U.S. Supreme Court, Dakin-Grimm says that rarely happens, mostly because the Supreme Court has complete discretion over the cases it chooses. 'Most people can’t afford to do this kind of legal work themselves. It’s just very, very expensive — you know, hundreds of thousands of dollars to take a case from the trial court level all the way to the Supreme Court,' she said. 'But in the immigration space, you tend to see nonprofit agencies, law school clinics, working pro bono, working for free in significant cases like this.' A final decision If the green card is revoked and all appeals fail, the person is usually deported from the U.S. If the appeal is successful, the person keeps their green card and is allowed to stay in the country. Dakin-Grimm said many green card holders think because it is called 'permanent residency,' the status is actually permanent. 'But it’s only permanent as long as you follow the rules,' she said.

UN judge from Uganda convicted in UK of forcing woman into slavery	LONDON — A British jury on Thursday convicted a United Nations judge of forcing a young woman to work as a slave after tricking her into coming to the U.K. Prosecutors said Lydia Mugambe made the Ugandan woman work as her maid and provide childcare for free. Mugambe, who is also a high court judge in Uganda, was studying for a doctorate in law at the University of Oxford when the offenses occurred. Prosecution lawyer Caroline Haughey told jurors during the trial that Mugambe 'exploited and abused' the victim, deceiving her into coming to the U.K. and taking advantage of her lack of understanding of her rights. Mugambe, 49, denied the charges. Jurors at Oxford Crown Court convicted her on all four charges she faced, including an immigration offense, forcing someone to work and conspiracy to intimidate a witness. There were gasps from the public gallery as the verdicts were read out, and the court was cleared after Mugambe appeared unwell. She is due to be sentenced on May 2. According to her United Nations profile page, Mugambe was appointed to one of the global body's international courts in May 2023.	https://www.voanews.com/a/un-judge-from-uganda-convicted-in-uk-of-forcing-woman-into-slavery-/8009684.html	2025-03-13T10:29:28-07:00	
Jewish protesters flood Trump Tower lobby to demand Columbia University activist's release	Demonstrators from a Jewish group filled the lobby of Trump Tower on Thursday to denounce the immigration arrest of a Columbia University activist who helped lead student protests on the Manhattan campus against Israel's war in Gaza. The Jewish Voice for Peace protesters, who wore red shirts reading 'Jews say stop arming Israel' and carried banners reading 'Opposing fascism is a Jewish tradition' and 'Fight Nazis not students,' chanted 'Bring Mahmoud home now!' Mahmoud Khalil, a permanent U.S. resident who is married to an American citizen and who hasn't been charged with breaking any laws, was arrested outside his New York City apartment on Saturday and faces deportation. President Donald Trump has said Khalil's arrest was the first 'of many to come' and vowed on social media to deport students who he said engage in 'pro-terrorist, anti-Semitic, anti-American activity.' Police, who were staged inside and outside the Fifth Avenue building ahead of the demonstration, began arresting protesters after warning them to leave. Among the protesters was actor Debra Winger, who has discussed her Jewish faith and upbringing over the years. Winger accused the Trump administration of having 'no interest in Jewish safety' and 'co-opting antisemitism.' Khalil's supporters say his arrest is an attack on free speech and have staged protests elsewhere in the city and around the country. Hundreds demonstrated Wednesday outside a Manhattan courthouse during a brief hearing on his case. Trump Tower serves as headquarters for the Trump Organization and is where the president stays when he is in New York. The skyscraper often attracts demonstrations, both against and in support of its namesake, though protests inside are less common. The building's main entrance opens to a multi-story atrium that is open to the public and connects visitors to stores and eateries such as the Trump Grill. Khalil, 30, was being detained at an immigration detention center in Louisiana, where he has remained after a brief stop at a New Jersey lockup. Columbia was a focal point of the pro-Palestinian protest movement that swept across U.S. college campuses last year and led to more than 2,000 arrests. Khalil, whose wife is pregnant with their first child, finished his requirements for a Columbia master's degree in December. Born in Syria, he is a grandson of Palestinians who were forced to leave their homeland, his lawyers said in a legal filing.	https://www.voanews.com/a/jewish-protesters-flood-trump-tower-lobby-to-demand-columbia-university-activist-s-release-/8009664.html	2025-03-13T10:15:38-07:00	
The story of Chinese Americans who call Texas home	The state of Texas has the third-largest Asian American population in the U.S. Chinese Americans in the Lone Star State have roots that trace back for generations, just like those of their counterparts on the nation's East and West coasts. While the history of these Texans might not be as well known, their stories are just as intertwined with America’s.

Belgium makes arrests in corruption probe linked to EU	BRUSSELS — Belgian federal prosecutors announced Thursday the arrests of several people as part of a corruption probe linked to the European Parliament amid reports in local media that Chinese company Huawei bribed EU lawmakers. The arrests came as an investigation by Le Soir newspaper and other media said lobbyists working for the Chinese telecoms giant are suspected of bribing current or former European Parliament members to promote the company’s commercial policy in Europe. About 100 federal police officers carried out 21 searches in Brussels, the Flanders and Wallonia regions, and Portugal, the federal prosecutor’s office said. The suspects would be questioned over 'alleged involvement in active corruption within the European Parliament, as well as for forgery and use of forgeries,' prosecutors said. 'The offenses were allegedly committed by a criminal organization.' Huawei public relations representatives in London did not respond to an emailed request for comment and could not be reached by phone. The European Parliament said only that the assembly 'takes note of the information' and 'always cooperates fully with the judicial authorities.' Huawei, which makes cellphones and is the biggest maker of networking gear for phone and internet carriers, has been caught in tensions between the United States and China over technology and trade. Some European nations have followed Washington’s lead and banned Huawei’s equipment from next-generation mobile networks over allegations that it poses a security risk that could help facilitate Chinese spying. The company has repeatedly denied this. European Commission spokesperson Thomas Regnier said the EU’s executive branch had no comment regarding the investigation, but underlined security concerns the commission has about Huawei and Europe’s fifth-generation mobile phone networks. 'The security of our 5G networks is obviously crucial for our economy,' Regnier told reporters. 'Huawei represents materially higher risks than other 5G suppliers.' EU member states should swiftly 'adopt decisions to restrict or to exclude Huawei from their 5G networks,' Regnier said. 'A lack of swift action would expose the EU as a whole to a clear risk.' The federal prosecutor's office, which did not name Huawei, said it believes there was corruption 'from 2021 to the present day' in various forms, 'such as remuneration for taking political positions or excessive gifts such as food and travel expenses or regular invitations to football matches.' Prosecutors say payments might have been disguised as business expenses and in some cases may have been directed to third parties. They would also look to 'detect any evidence of money laundering.' Police seized several documents and objects during the searches. Staff at Huawei’s offices in Brussels declined to comment and turned the lights off inside to avoid photographs taken through the window. According to Follow The Money, an investigative journalism platform, one of the main suspects in the probe is 41-year-old Valerio Ottati, a Belgian Italian lobbyist who joined Huawei in 2019. Before becoming Huawei’s EU public affairs director, Ottati was an assistant to two Italian MEPs who were both members of a European Parliament group dealing with China policy, Follow the Money reported. This is the second corruption case targeting the EU Parliament in less than three years. In December 2022, the legislature was shaken by a corruption scandal in which Qatari officials were accused of bribing EU officials to play down labor rights concerns ahead of the soccer World Cup.	https://www.voanews.com/a/belgium-makes-arrests-in-corruption-probe-linked-to-eu/8009509.html	2025-03-13T08:42:42-07:00	
The story of Chinese Americans who call Texas home	The state of Texas has the third-largest Asian American population in the United States, according to the U.S. census, and Chinese people, some whose families arrived more than 150 years ago, make up the largest group. Chinese Americans trace back for generations in the Lone Star State. Their story may not be as well known as that of their counterparts in California or New York City, but it is just as intertwined with America's history. At Rice University, the Houston Asian American Archive, or HAAA, is keeping their stories alive and sharing them with new generations. Launched in 2009, the archive now contains the oral histories of some 500 people in its database, providing a crucial window to the past. 'Oral history gives you a sense of immediacy and maybe more informality. And it's also unfiltered,' said Anne Chao, HAAA co-founder and program manager. The archive also preserves memorabilia and artifacts from Asian Americans in Houston — a city known for its oil and gas industry. It is also known for space exploration and is home to NASA's Johnson Space Center. Albert Gee One Chinese American who found success in 1960s and '70s Houston was Albert Gee, who at the time was considered the unofficial mayor of the Chinese community. Gee appeared with Hollywood celebrities in the society pages of local newspapers and was once invited to the White House of President Richard Nixon. Born in Detroit, Michigan, in 1920, Gee and his family moved to New Orleans, where they operated a laundry business. When his father died in 1927, Gee's mother, who did not speak English, decided to take her children back to their home in China, hoping that her three sons would return one by one to the U.S., which they did. 'Albert found himself only around 11 years old, coming back to the United States,' said his daughter Linda Wu. 'He was just working — working and trying to send money back to his mother.' Gee returned to the U.S. with his godfather, whom he lived with for a few years in San Francisco, California. Eventually, with the help of friends and relatives, Gee ended up in Houston. He eventually opened grocery stores and restaurants, which became a draw for Hollywood celebrities, who would stay at a nearby hotel when in town. Wu has photos of celebrities such as singer Elvis Presley and comedian Bob Hope posing at the restaurants, some next to her father. Helping newcomers Wu said her parents saw themselves as Americans but never forget their roots. Her mother, Jane Eng, the child of Chinese immigrants, was born and raised in Texas. 'I always remember different people coming to live with us at the grocery store, family members who would start their roots here,' she said. By assisting newcomers, the established Chinese Americans helped fuel the growth of the Gee family surname in Houston. Not all the Gees in Houston were related, however. Stories about some of the city's Gees can be found in the HAAA database and in the 1998 anthology 'The Gees in Houston, Texas.' 'For the Gee family, it's been discerned that we've come from about three to four villages in China,' said Rogene Gee Calvert, who contributed stories about her father, David Gee — no relation to Albert Gee — to the anthology. David Gee David Gee migrated from China to the U.S. in the late 1920s, during the Chinese Exclusion Act, which allowed Chinese merchants, diplomats and students into the country but banned laborers. Gee was 17 when he arrived, but his passport indicated he was four years younger. He was a so-called paper son. ''Paper sons' and 'paper daughters' are the names given to people who buy false papers,' said Casey Dexter-Lee, an educator at Angel Island State Park in San Francisco Bay. Part of the island served as a major immigration station from 1910 to 1940. 'It's about $100 for each year of life that the person claims,' she said. 'So a 10-year-old would cost about $1,000 to buy false papers.' After arriving in the U.S., David Gee was detained at the Angel Island Immigration Station for almost a year. Eventually, he received permission to stay. David Gee worked in San Francisco with a relative. In 1938, he moved to Houston to join a family friend. He returned to San Francisco to get married, then brought his wife to Houston, where he worked in the grocery business. 'There was discrimination and, of course, there were natural barriers of language and just knowing how to navigate … how to get around and what to do,' Calvert said. 'So, there were some elders who were well-spoken that were respected in the mainstream community that really helped our family.' Houston and Jim Crow Chao said the first large group of Chinese immigrants arrived in Houston in the 1940s and '50s. At that time, racial segregation was legal in Texas and Southern states through a series of codes known as Jim Crow laws. 'Even though Houston also was subject to Jim Crow law, the law wasn't applied the same way as [in] the other Southern states. And so, there's a sense of more equitable equity in Houston.' Chao said, adding that people, including Chinese Americans, settled in Houston because there was a 'sense of business opportunity.' Being neither Black nor white, the Chinese Texans occupied a gray area under Jim Crow law. 'They were just in between and just dependent upon how well the neighborhood or people accepted them,' said Ted Gong, senior adviser to the Chinese American Museum in Washington. Albert Gee, as president of the Houston Restaurant Association, took part in the desegregation of the city's restaurants in the early 1960s. Decades later, his work in the community was immortalized in a web comic for Texas students in 2023. The comic is part of a free website called Adventures of Asia, developed by Asia Society Texas, which also collaborated with HAAA to create lesson guides for teachers called Asia in the Classroom. 'Our Asian American students in particular said they want to see themselves represented in the curriculum,' said Jennifer Kapral, director of education and outreach at Asia Society Texas Center. The Asian population in the U.S. nearly doubled from 2000 to 2019 and is expected to continue to grow, according to the Pew Research Center. But the history of the Asians who settled in the U.S. is missing from many textbooks, Kapral said. 'There was a study that looked at 30 U.S. history textbooks from across the U.S., and they found that Asian American history was only mentioned in half of them. And of that half, it was an average of about one to two pages in the entire textbook. So, it's been a big gap.' Asian American Houstonians are filling this void by sharing their stories, preserving artifacts from their past, and educating the next generation about how their forebears carved a place for themselves in Texas' largest city.	https://www.voanews.com/a/the-story-of-chinese-americans-who-call-texas-home/8008697.html	2025-03-13T08:39:17-07:00	
UN chief in Bangladesh to visit Rohingya camps as he pushes for aid	DHAKA, BANGLADESH — U.N. Secretary-General Antonio Guterres is getting a first-hand look at the situation of more than 1 million Rohingya refugees in Bangladesh as fears mount of serious aid cuts across the world following Washington's decision to shut down USAID operations. Bangladesh's foreign affairs adviser, Touhid Hossain, welcomed Guterres at Dhaka's main airport on Thursday. Guterres's four-day visit — his second to Bangladesh — is seen as crucial after the announcement of possible aid cuts by the World Food Program, or WFP, and others in the aftermath of the USAID shuttering. Bangladesh's interim government — which came to power last August after a mass uprising ousted former Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina — hopes the visit will boost international efforts to mobilize aid for the Rohingya refugees and attract new global attention to their crisis. A letter from the U.N. food agency earlier this month said cuts to food rations could take effect from next month at Cox's Bazar, home to dozens of camps housing Rohingya refugees. The WFP said the food rations could be reduced to $6, from the current $12.50 per month — unless adequate funding is secured. According to WFP spokesperson Kun Li, if the WFP is unable to secure sufficient funding — $81 million to sustain operations through the end of the year, including $15 million needed for April — it will have no choice but to reduce rations starting in April. Ahead of Guterres' visit, Amnesty International urged the international community to urgently step up and deliver the necessary support to avoid the devastating impact on the Rohingya refugees in Bangladesh. 'The funding shortfall will only exacerbate the existing desperate shortage of essential supplies and services in the camps,' said Smriti Singh, regional director for South Asia at Amnesty International. 'The Rohingya community in Cox's Bazar have little alternative but to rely on WFP aid,' Singh said, adding that the Bangladesh government prohibits the refugees from leaving the camps and finding jobs. Guterres and Bangladesh's interim leader, Muhammad Yunus, are to visit Cox's Bazar district on Friday. On Saturday, the two will hold talks at Yunus' office in Dhaka, the country's capital, and jointly talk to reporters afterward. Bangladesh's interim government has said that the end of USAID payments would stop other projects in the country but that funding for Rohingya refugees would continue to flow. The U.S. has been the top donor to Bangladesh for Rohingya refugees, providing the United Nations with emergency food and nutrition assistance. The U.S. usually provides almost half of the aid money spent on the humanitarian response to Rohingya refugees in Bangladesh, which provided about $300 million in 2024. Hundreds of thousands of Rohingya have lived in Bangladesh for decades and about 70,000 crossed the border from Myanmar in 2024. During fighting with the military junta, the opposition force known as the Arakan Army effectively took over the Rakhine state where Rohingya were displaced and took shelter in Bangladesh. Bangladesh says repatriation of the refugees to Myanmar, which has been accused in an international court of genocide against Rohingya, is the ultimate solution of the crisis, but complexities over verification and other diplomatic and political issues have made the future of the refugees bleak.	https://www.voanews.com/a/un-chief-in-bangladesh-to-visit-rohingya-camps-as-he-pushes-for-aid-/8009479.html	2025-03-13T08:20:44-07:00	
Trump threatens hefty tariffs on European spirits	U.S. President Donald Trump on Thursday threatened the European Union with 200% tariffs on wine, champagne and other spirits produced in the 27-nation bloc after the EU levied what he said was 'a nasty 50% tariff' on American-distilled whiskey. Trump contended in a post on his Truth Social media platform that the EU is 'one of the most hostile and abusive taxing and tariffing authorities in the World.' He said it was formed in 1993 'for the sole purpose of taking advantage of the United States' economically. In the last month, Trump has been waging a tit-for-tat tariff fight with its biggest trading partners — Mexico, Canada, China and the EU — in what he says is an effort to staunch the flow of drugs, especially fentanyl, into the United States from Mexico and Canada, and also convince manufacturers to close their operations overseas and move them to the U.S. to create more American jobs. On Wednesday, Trump levied 25% tariffs on steel and aluminum exports to the U.S. from 35 countries, including the EU bloc. Europe quickly retaliated with its own tariffs on $28 billion worth of U.S. exports to countries that have long been U.S. geopolitical allies, while Canada imposed new tariffs on $20.7 billion worth of U.S. exports to its northern neighbor. The new EU measures will apply not only to steel and aluminum products but also textiles, home appliances and agricultural goods. Motorcycles, bourbon, peanut butter and jeans also will be hit, as they were during Trump's first term that ran from 2017 to 2021. The EU duties aimed for political pressure points in the U.S. while minimizing additional damage to Europe. EU officials have said its tariffs, which are paid by importing companies and the cost of which is then mostly passed on to consumers, are targeting products from states dominated by Republicans like Trump, such as beef and poultry from Kansas and Nebraska, wood products from Alabama and Georgia, and liquor from Kentucky and Tennessee. Spirits producers have become collateral damage in the steel and aluminum dispute. Chris Swonger, head of the Distilled Spirits Council of the United States, called the EU move to tax U.S.-produced spirits 'deeply disappointing and will severely undercut the successful efforts to rebuild U.S. spirits exports in EU countries.' The EU is a major destination for U.S. whiskey, with exports surging 60% in the past three years after an earlier set of tariffs was suspended. On Thursday, Swonger said in a statement, 'The U.S.-EU spirits sector is the model for fair and reciprocal trade, having zero-for-zero tariffs since 1997.' He urged the end to a tariff fight over spirits between the U.S. and Europe, saying, 'We want toasts not tariffs.' Trump’s tariff wars have led to a broad Wall Street stock selloff, with the three major U.S. stock indexes plunging in recent days, with stocks falling again on Thursday in early trading. But Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent told CNBC he was not worried. 'We're focused on the real economy,' he said. 'I'm not concerned about a little bit of volatility over three weeks. I can't tell you the market is going to go up today, tomorrow, next week.' He dismissed concerns about Trump’s threat to impose bigger tariffs on European spirits. 'One or two items with one trading bloc — I'm not sure why that's a big deal for the markets,' he said. Trump said in his social media post that if Europe follows through on its 50% tariff on U.S.-distilled whiskey, he will impose the 200% tariff on 'all wines, champagne & alcoholic products coming out of France and other E.U. represented countries. This will be great for the Wine and Champagne businesses in the U.S.' Trump also attacked The Wall Street Journal newspaper, the country’s leading business publication, for refusing to support his tariff plans. A Journal editorial said this week that 'most Americans understand that tariffs are a tax on consumers and businesses.' The U.S. leader said the newspaper 'has no idea what they are doing or saying. They are owned by the polluted thinking of the European Union.' He said the newspaper’s 'thinking is antiquated and weak, and very bad for the USA.'	https://www.voanews.com/a/trump-threatens-hefty-tariffs-on-european-spirits/8009495.html	2025-03-13T08:18:14-07:00	
Meta tests 'Community Notes' to replace fact-checkers	SAN FRANCISCO — Social media giant Meta on Thursday announced it would begin testing its new 'Community Notes' feature across its platforms on March 18, as it shifts away from third-party fact-checking toward a crowd-sourced approach to content moderation. Meta's chief executive Mark Zuckerberg announced the new system in January as he appeared to align himself with the incoming Trump administration, including naming a Republican as the company's head of public policy. The change of system came after years of criticism from supporters of U.S. President Donald Trump, among others, that conservative voices were being censored or stifled under the guise of fighting misinformation, a claim professional fact-checkers vehemently reject. Meta has also scaled back its diversity initiatives and relaxed content moderation rules on Facebook and Instagram, particularly regarding certain forms of hostile speech. The initiative, similar to the system already implemented by X (formerly Twitter), will allow users of Facebook, Instagram and Threads to write and rate contextual notes on various content. Meta said approximately 200,000 potential contributors in the United States have already signed up across the three platforms. The new approach requires contributors to be over 18 with accounts more than six months old that are in good standing. During the testing period, notes will not immediately appear on content and the company will gradually admit people from the waitlist and thoroughly test the system before public implementation. Meta emphasized that the notes will only be published when contributors with differing viewpoints agree on their helpfulness. 'This isn't majority rules,' the company said. Moreover, unlike fact-checked posts that often had reduced distribution, flagged content with Community Notes will not face distribution penalties. Notes will be limited to 500 characters, must include supporting links and will initially support six languages commonly used in the United States: English, Spanish, Chinese, Vietnamese, French and Portuguese. 'Our intention is ultimately to roll out this new approach to our users all over the world, but we won't be doing that immediately,' the company said. 'Until Community Notes are launched in other countries, the third party fact checking program will remain in place for them,' it added. Meta said that it would not be 'reinventing the wheel' and will use X's open-source algorithm as the basis of its system. U.N. Secretary-General Antonio Guterres last month warned that the rollbacks to fact-checking and moderation safeguards were 'reopening the floodgates' of hate and violence online.	https://www.voanews.com/a/meta-tests-community-notes-to-replace-fact-checkers/8009430.html	2025-03-13T07:36:37-07:00	
White House withdraws nomination for CDC director	WASHINGTON — The White House has withdrawn the nomination of Dr. David Weldon, a former Florida congressman, to lead the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. The Senate health committee announced Thursday morning that it was canceling a planned hearing on Weldon's nomination because of the withdrawal. A person familiar with the matter, who spoke on the condition of anonymity to discuss internal deliberations, said the White House pulled the nomination because it became clear Weldon did not have the votes for confirmation. Weldon was considered to be closely aligned with Robert F. Kennedy Jr., the U.S. health secretary who for years has been one of the nation's leading anti-vaccine activists. A former Florida congressman, Weldon also has been a prominent critic of vaccines and the CDC, which promotes vaccines and monitors their safety. Weldon becomes the third Trump administration nominee who didn't make it to a confirmation hearing. Previously, former congressman Matt Gaetz withdrew from consideration for attorney general and Chad Chronister for the Drug Enforcement Administration.	https://www.voanews.com/a/white-house-withdraws-nomination-for-cdc-director/8009394.html	2025-03-13T07:12:21-07:00	
Syrian leader signs constitution putting Islamist group in charge for 5 years	DAMASCUS, SYRIA — Syria's interim president on Thursday signed a temporary constitution that leaves the country under Islamist rule for five years during a transitional phase. The country's interim rulers have struggled to exert their authority across much of the country since the Islamist former insurgent group, Hayat Tahrir al-Sham, or HTS, led a lightning insurgency that overthrew former leader Bashar al-Assad in December. Former HTS leader Ahmad al-Sharaa is now the country's interim president — a decision that was announced after a meeting of the armed groups that took part in the offensive against Assad. At the same meeting, the groups agreed to repeal the country's old constitution and said a new one would be drafted. While many were happy to see an end to the Assad family's dictatorial rule of over 50 years in the war-torn country, religious and ethnic minorities have been skeptical of the new Islamist leaders and reluctant to allow Damascus under its new authorities to assert control of their areas. Abdulhamid al-Awak, one of the seven members of the committee al-Sharaa tasked to draft the temporary constitution, told a press conference Thursday that it will maintain some provisions from the previous one, including the stipulation that the head of state must be a Muslim and Islamic law is the main source of jurisprudence. However, al-Awak, a constitutional law expert who teaches at the Mardin Artuklu University in Turkey, also said the temporary constitution includes provisions that enshrine freedom of expression and the press. The constitution will 'balance between social security and freedom' during Syria's shaky political situation, he said. A new committee to draft a permanent constitution will be formed, but it is unclear if it will be more inclusive of Syria's political, religious and ethnic groups. Al-Sharaa on Monday reached a landmark pact with the U.S.-backed Kurdish-led authorities in northeastern Syria, including a ceasefire and a merging of their armed forces with the central government's security agencies. The deal came after government forces and allied groups crushed an insurgency launched last week by gunmen loyal to Assad. Rights groups say that hundreds of civilians — mostly from the Alawite minority sect to which Assad belongs —were killed in retaliatory attacks by factions in the counteroffensive. A key goal of the interim constitution was to give a timeline for the country's political transition out of its interim phase. In December, al-Sharaa said it could take up to three years to rewrite Syria's constitution and up to five years to organize and hold elections. Al-Sharaa appointed a committee to draft the new constitution after Syria held a national dialogue conference last month, which called for announcing a temporary constitution and holding interim parliamentary elections. Critics said the hastily organized conference was not inclusive of Syria's different ethnic and sectarian groups or civil society. The United States and Europe have been hesitant to lift harsh sanctions imposed on Syria during Assad's rule until they are convinced that the new leaders will create an inclusive political system and protect minorities. Al-Sharaa and regional governments have been urging them to reconsider, fearing that the country's crumbling economy could bring further instability.	https://www.voanews.com/a/syrian-leader-signs-constitution-putting-islamist-group-in-charge-for-5-years/8009335.html	2025-03-13T06:42:37-07:00	
US, Russian officials to discuss Ukraine ceasefire proposal	U.S. and Russian officials are expected to meet in Moscow to discuss a U.S. proposal for a 30-day ceasefire in Russia’s war in Ukraine. The Kremlin said Thursday that U.S. negotiators were on the way to Russia. That followed comments Wednesday from the White House saying special envoy Steve Witkoff would head to Moscow. 'People are going to Russia right now as we speak,' U.S. President Donald Trump told reporters Wednesday. 'And hopefully we can get a ceasefire from Russia.' White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt told Fox News that national security adviser Mike Waltz spoke to his Russian counterpart on Wednesday. U.S. officials met earlier this week with Ukrainian officials in Saudi Arabia to present the ceasefire plan. Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy welcomed the U.S. effort, saying Wednesday Ukraine is 'ready for a ceasefire for 30 days as proposed by the American side.' Zelenskyy said the halt in fighting could be used to create a broader peace deal for the conflict, which began with Russia’s February 2022 full-scale invasion of Ukraine. Some information for this report was provided by The Associated Press, Agence France-Presse and Reuters.	https://www.voanews.com/a/us-russian-officials-to-discuss-ukraine-ceasefire-proposal/8009215.html	2025-03-13T04:16:18-07:00	
Deadly Russian aerial attacks hit Ukraine's Kherson region	Russian aerial attacks overnight killed at least two people in the southern Ukrainian region of Kherson, officials said Thursday. Kherson Governor Oleksandr Prokudin said on Telegram his region came under attack by Russian drones and shelling, and that one other person was injured. In the neighboring Dnipropetrovsk region, Governor Serhiy Lysak said at least three people were hospitalized after a Russian attack hit the city of Dnipro. Lysak said on Telegram the attack damaged multiple apartment buildings, including blowing out windows. Officials in the Sumy region reported Thursday that Russian drones fell on a set of garages, setting about 20 of them on fire. Ukraine’s military said Thursday it shot down 74 of the 117 drones that Russian forces launched overnight. The intercepts took place over the Chernihiv, Dnipropetrovsk, Kharkiv, Khmelnytskyi, Kyiv, Mykolaiv, Odesa, Poltava, Sumy, Vinnytsia and Zaporizhzhia regions, the military said. Russia’s Defense Ministry said it shot down 77 Ukrainian drones, most of them in regions located along the Russia-Ukraine border. Vladislav Shapsha, governor of the Kaluga region, said the attacks injured one person and damaged an industrial building, a communication tower and a power line. The Russia military said it destroyed 30 of the drones over Bryansk, while officials in the region reported no damage or casualties. Russian air defense also shot down drones over Kursk, Voronezh, Rostov and Belgorod, the military said. The daily aerial attacks continue amid a U.S. push to secure a ceasefire in the conflict. The U.S. has proposed a 30-day halt in fighting, which Ukraine has said it would accept. U.S. officials are expected to discuss the plan with Russian officials in the coming days. Some information for this report came from Agence France-Presse and Reuters.	https://www.voanews.com/a/deadly-russian-aerial-attacks-hit-ukraine-s-kherson-region/8009158.html	2025-03-13T02:50:57-07:00	
Taiwan president warns of China's 'infiltration' effort	TAIPEI, TAIWAN — Taiwan President Lai Ching-te said on Thursday that China has deepened its influence campaigns and infiltration against the democratic island, pledging measures to tackle Beijing's efforts to 'absorb' Taiwan. Taiwan has accused China of stepping up military drills, trade sanctions and influence campaigns against the island in recent years to force the island to accept Chinese sovereignty claims. Speaking to reporters after holding a meeting with senior security officials, Lai said Beijing had used Taiwan's democracy to 'absorb' various members of society, including organized crime groups, media personalities, and current and former military and police officers. 'They (China) are carrying out activities such as division, destruction, and subversion from within us,' Lai told a news briefing broadcast live from the presidential office. China's Taiwan Affairs Office did not immediately respond to a request for comment. Citing government data, Lai said 64 people were charged for Chinese espionage last year, three times more than in 2021. He said the majority of them were current or former military officials. 'Many are worried that our country, hard-earned freedom and democracy and prosperity will be lost, bit by bit, due to these influence campaigns and manipulation,' Lai said. By making these efforts, Lai said China constituted what Taiwan's Anti-Infiltration Act defined as 'foreign hostile forces.' The president proposed 17 legal and economic countermeasures, including the strict review of Taiwan visits or residency applications by Chinese citizens, and proposals to resume the work of the military court. Lai also said his government would make 'necessary adjustments' to the flows of money, people and technology across the strait. He did not elaborate. In addition, he said the government would issue 'reminders' to Taiwanese actors and singers performing in China on their 'statements and actions,' a response to what Taipei sees as an ongoing Chinese campaign to pressure pop stars to make pro-Beijing comments. 'We have no choice but to take more active actions.' China claims Taiwan as its own territory and has never renounced the use of force to bring the island under its control. Taiwan's government rejects Beijing's sovereignty claims and says only the island's people can decide their future.	https://www.voanews.com/a/taiwan-president-warns-of-china-s-infiltration-effort-/8009149.html	2025-03-13T02:03:43-07:00	
China accuses New Zealand's top spy of spreading 'false information'	BEIJING — China's embassy in New Zealand on Thursday accused Wellington's top spy of lying after the intelligence chief warned of security risks posed by Beijing's growing influence in the Pacific. In a speech in Wellington last week, New Zealand's Security Intelligence Service Director-General Andrew Hampton said the focus of Pacific nations on economic and transnational crime issues had opened the door for China to sign strategic deals with them that linked economic and security cooperation. 'The relevant remarks are totally baseless, all fabrication, and amount to spreading false information,' the Chinese Embassy in Wellington said. 'For someone holding a hammer, everything looks like a nail.' In recent years, Beijing has struck deals with a number of Pacific nations, worrying New Zealand, a member of the Five Eye intelligence alliance along with Britain, the U.S., Canada, and Australia. Hampton said last week that China wanted to 'create competing regional architectures, and expand its influence with Pacific Island countries,' which posed foreign interference and espionage risks. The Cook Islands, a self-governing Pacific nation in free-association with New Zealand, is at the heart of recent tensions between China and New Zealand. Cook Islands Prime Minister Mark Brown travelled to China in February, signing a comprehensive strategic partnership deal with Chinese Premier Li Qiang. That angered Wellington, which complained about the lack of consultation and transparency around Brown's visit. Relevant cooperation documents have been made public, the Chinese statement said, adding that there is no 'secret agenda' in China's relations with the Cook Islands. China's embassy in Wellington also handles the country's diplomatic relations with the island nations of Niue and the Cook Islands.	https://www.voanews.com/a/china-accuses-new-zealand-s-top-spy-of-spreading-false-information-/8009141.html	2025-03-13T01:23:41-07:00	
EPA announces rollback of dozens of environmental regulations	WASHINGTON — The Trump administration announced a wave of regulatory rollbacks on Wednesday including a repeal of Biden-era emissions limits on power plants and automobiles, as well as reduced protections for waterways. The announcements from Trump's Environmental Protection Agency align with the president's vows to slash regulations to boost industries from coal to manufacturing and ramp up oil and minerals production. But they are also destined to weaken bedrock environmental rules imposed by past presidencies to protect air and water quality and fight climate change. 'Today is the most consequential day of deregulation in American history,' EPA Administrator Lee Zeldin said in a video message posted on X. In total, his agency announced more than 30 deregulatory measures in a dizzying succession of press releases. Zeldin started the day by announcing he will narrow the definition of waterways that receive protection under the Clean Water Act -- a move that could ease limits on runoff pollution from agriculture, mining, and petrochemicals. The agency later said it would review the Biden-era clean power plant rule that seeks to reduce carbon emissions from power plants to fight global warming and would also roll back greenhouse gas emissions standards for heavy- and light-duty vehicles for model year 2027 and later. The power and transport industries together make up around half of U.S. greenhouse gas emissions and were vital targets in former President Joe Biden's efforts to slow climate change. The agency also said it will take steps to undo a scientific finding from 2009 that greenhouse gas emissions endanger public health, a provision that forms the bedrock of the EPA's greenhouse-gas regulations so far. The so-called 'endangerment finding' came as a result of a Supreme Court ruling in the 2007 Massachusetts v. EPA case that greenhouse gases are covered by the Clean Air Act. The EPA under former President Barack Obama finalized the finding in 2009, and the 2022 Inflation Reduction Act - Joe Biden’s signature climate law - codified language deeming greenhouse gases are air pollutants. Obama's EPA Administrator Gina McCarthy said Wednesday was 'the most disastrous day in EPA history.' Environmental groups said they will fight the rollback. 'This move won’t stand up in court. We’re going to fight it every step of the way,' said Jason Rylander, legal director at the Center for Biological Diversity’s Climate Law Institute. Other environmental groups slammed Trump's broader deregulation agenda. 'EPA Administrator Lee Zeldin is driving a dagger straight into the heart of public health,' said Abel Russ, a director at the Environmental Integrity Project. Industry groups expressed support for the announcements. 'Voters sent a clear message in support of affordable, reliable and secure American energy, and the Trump administration is answering the call,' said Mike Sommers, president of the American Petroleum Institute. The National Mining Association, which represents some coal miners, applauded the rollback of the clean power plant rule, saying it was 'long overdue' as datacenters and AI increased electricity demand. Decades of precedent The Trump administration plans to roll back other air and water regulations that have been in place for decades for the power industry. The EPA, for example, said it will reconsider mercury and air toxics rules that had been updated under Biden that it says were designed to target coal-fired power plants. It also said it plans to revisit standards set under the Biden administration to reduce soot and air particulate matter. Reuters had reported that review earlier in the day. The EPA also announced measures that would dial back regulations for the oil and gas industry, including required reporting of methane emissions from oil and gas infrastructure. It would also consider allowing the reuse of drilling wastewater, potentially for agriculture and industry.	https://www.voanews.com/a/epa-announces-rollback-of-dozens-of-environmental-regulations/8009132.html	2025-03-13T00:43:59-07:00	
Japan eyes boosting rice exports eightfold by 2030	TOKYO — Japan wants to boost its rice exports almost eightfold by 2030, a ministry official said Thursday, despite currently suffering a domestic shortage of the grain. The country's rice consumption has more than halved over the past 60 years as diets have expanded to include more bread, noodles and other energy sources. The new target is part of a long-term national policy to boost overseas shipments of the staple, and make farming it more efficient, especially as the ageing population shrinks. 'We plan to set a goal of 350,000 tons in 2030,' an objective likely to be approved by the cabinet this month, Masakazu Kawaguchi, an agriculture ministry official in charge of the rice trade, told AFP. The target is 7.8 times the 2024 volume -- around 45,000 tons -- which was sold for 12 billion yen, or $81 million. However, rice is in short supply at the moment. This week the government began a rare auction of its emergency rice stockpiles in a bid to help drive down prices, which have nearly doubled over the past year. The shortages have been driven by various factors, including poor harvests caused by hot weather and panic-buying prompted by a 'megaquake' warning last summer. Exacerbating the problem, some businesses are also thought to be keeping their inventories and waiting for the most opportune time to sell.	https://www.voanews.com/a/japan-eyes-boosting-rice-exports-eightfold-by-2030/8009122.html	2025-03-13T00:04:32-07:00	
US October-February budget deficit hits record $1.147 trillion	WASHINGTON — The U.S. budget deficit for the first five months of fiscal 2025 hit a record $1.147 trillion, the Treasury Department said on Wednesday, including a $307 billion February deficit for President Donald Trump's first full month in office that was up 4% from a year earlier. The October-February deficit, which included nearly four months until Jan. 20 under former president Joe Biden, topped the previous record $1.047 trillion from October 2020 to February 2021, a period marked by high COVID-19 relief spending and pandemic-constrained revenues. The Treasury said February's deficit rose $11 billion from the same month in 2024, as outlays for debt interest, Social Security and health care benefits swamped growth in revenues. The results showed little impact from Trump's initial import tariffs on major trading partners and his administration's efforts to slash government spending so far. February receipts totaled $296 billion, a record for that month. That figure was up 9%, or $25 billion, compared with the year-earlier period. But outlays in February totaled $603 billion, also a record for that month, and up 6%, or $36 billion, from a year earlier. After calendar adjustments for both receipts and outlays, the adjusted deficit would have been $311 billion, matching the record February reported budget deficit in 2021, which was driven by COVID-19. The Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget, a fiscal watchdog group, said government borrowings so far this fiscal year work out to about $8 billion a day. 'What needs no confirmation is that we are almost halfway through the fiscal year and yet we have done nothing in the way of making progress toward getting our skyrocketing debt under control,' the group's president, Maya MacGuineas, said in a statement. Fiscal year-to-date receipts rose 2%, or $37 billion, to a record $1.893 trillion, but outlays grew 13%, or $355 billion, to a record $3.039 trillion. Including calendar shifts of benefit payments, the adjusted year-to-date deficit would have been $1.063 trillion - still a record - up 17%, or $157 billion, from the prior-year period. Effects of tariffs, DOGE Trump imposed an additional 10% tariff on Chinese imports on Feb. 4, but that increase did not materially impact customs receipts last month and will likely start showing up in March data, a Treasury official said. Trump increased the extra duty on Chinese goods to 20% on March 4. Net customs receipts totaled $7.25 billion in February, down from $7.34 billion in January but up from $6.21 billion in February 2024. The budget results for February did not show an appreciable change in overall outlays as a result of Trump's drive to slash the federal workforce and government spending through the informal Department of Government Efficiency, known as DOGE, led by billionaire entrepreneur Elon Musk. The Department of Education, a major target of DOGE for cuts, saw its outlays fall to $8 billion last month from $14 billion in the year-earlier period. The Treasury official attributed the decline to reductions in outlays for elementary and secondary education programs. The U.S. Agency for International Development, which the Trump administration is attempting to dismantle, still showed an outlay of $226 million for February, compared to $542 million in the year-earlier period. Driving the spending growth in February and year-to-date periods were higher spending on Treasury's interest on the public debt, outlays for Child Tax Credit payments and increased Social Security payments due in part to a 2.5% cost-of-living adjustment for 2025. For the year-to-date period, Treasury's interest costs for the public debt came to $478 billion, up about 10%, or $45 billion, from a year earlier and outstripping military outlays of about $380 billion. Social Security outlays grew 8% to about $663 billion.	https://www.voanews.com/a/us-october-february-budget-deficit-hits-record-1-147-trillion/8009113.html	2025-03-12T23:37:10-07:00	
Hospitalized pope marks 12 years in job with future uncertain	VATICAN CITY — Pope Francis marks 12 years as head of the Catholic Church on Thursday, seemingly out of danger after a month in hospital but with his health casting a shadow over his future. The 88-year-old was, for a time, critically ill as he battled pneumonia in both lungs at Rome's Gemelli hospital, where he was admitted on Feb. 14. The Argentine's situation has markedly improved since then, with the Vatican confirming his condition as stable on Wednesday evening, and talk is now turning to when he might go home. But his hospitalization, the longest and most fraught of his papacy, has raised serious doubts about his ability to lead the world's nearly 1.4 billion Catholics. Slowing down Francis had before now refused to make any concessions to his age or increasingly fragile health, which saw him begin using a wheelchair three years ago. He maintained a packed daily schedule interspersed with frequent overseas trips, notably a 12-day tour of the Asia-Pacific region in September, when he presided over huge open-air masses. But experts say his recovery could take weeks given his age and recurring health issues, not helped by having part of one lung removed as a young man. 'The rest of his pontificate remains a question mark for the moment, including for Francis himself,' said Father Michel Kubler, a Vatican expert and former editor in chief of the French religious newspaper La Croix. 'He doesn't know what his life will be like once he returns to the Vatican and so, no doubt, reserves the option of resigning if he can no longer cope,' he told AFP. Francis has always left the door open to resigning were his health to deteriorate, following the example of Benedict XVI, who in 2013 became the first pope since the Middle Ages to voluntarily step down. But the Jesuit has distanced himself from the idea more recently, insisting the job is for life. While in hospital, Francis has delegated masses to senior cardinals but has kept working on and off, including signing decrees and receiving close colleagues. But he has missed a month of events for the 2025 Jubilee, a holy year organized by the pope that is predicted to draw an additional 30 million pilgrims to Rome and the Vatican. And it is hard to imagine he will be well enough to lead a full program of events for Easter, the holiest period in the Christian calendar that is less than six weeks away. Many believe that Francis, who has not been seen in public since he was hospitalized, has to change course. 'This is the end of the pontificate as we have known it, until now,' Kubler said. Unfinished reforms Francis struck a sharp contrast to his cerebral predecessor when he took office, eschewing the trappings of office and reaching out to the most disadvantaged in society with a message that the Church was for everyone. A former archbishop of Buenos Aires more at home with his flock than the cardinals of the Roman Curia, Francis introduced sweeping reforms across the Vatican and beyond. Some of the changes, from reorganizing the Vatican's finances to increasing the role of women and opening the Church to divorced and LGBTQ members, have been laid down in official texts. But a wide-ranging discussion on the future of the Church, known as a Synod, is not yet finished. And there are many who would happily see his work undone. Traditionalists have strongly resisted his approach, and an outcry in Africa caused the Vatican to clarify its authorization of non-liturgical blessings for same-sex couples in 2023. 'Whether we like him or not, he has shifted the dial, but many things are still pending,' a Vatican source said.	https://www.voanews.com/a/hospitalized-pope-marks-12-years-in-job-with-future-uncertain/8009112.html	2025-03-12T23:26:42-07:00

Total lunar eclipse to be visible from Western Hemisphere on Thursday	A total lunar eclipse will be visible in the Western Hemisphere overnight Thursday, with the best views in North America and South America. Skywatchers in Africa and parts of Europe may also be lucky enough to catch a glimpse of the celestial spectacle. A lunar eclipse occurs when the Earth, the moon and the sun line up and the Earth’s shadow blocks, or eclipses, the moon. The moon will look like a coppery red ball in the sky, a phenomenon known as the blood moon. The moon’s color is the result of stray bits of sunlight filtering through Earth's atmosphere. Skywatchers won’t need any special equipment, glasses or gadgets to see the eclipse, although binoculars or a telescope could provide a better view. 'As long as the sky is clear, you should be able to see it,' Shannon Schmoll, director of the Abrams Planetarium at Michigan State University, told The Associated Press. In North America, peak viewing time will be at 2:59 a.m. EDT (6:59 GMT) March 14. That’s when the Earth’s deepest, darkest shadow – the umbra – will cover the moon. The moon is expected to be totally obscured for 65 minutes, although the eclipse will last for about six hours in its entirety. Check here for where and when the blood moon will be visible in different parts of the hemisphere. The last total lunar eclipse occurred in 2022, but the world won’t have to wait long for the next one. A total lunar eclipse will happen overnight this September 7 and 8 and will be visible across Africa, Europe, Asia and Australia. A partial eclipse will occur later this month, on March 29. Some information for this report came from The Associated Press.	https://www.voanews.com/a/total-lunar-eclipse-to-be-visible-from-western-hemisphere-on-thursday/8009036.html	2025-03-12T23:01:16-07:00	
US markets flail amid trade war, uncertainty in Washington	U.S. President Donald Trump received a piece of good news Wednesday morning, when the Labor Department reported a lower-than-expected annualized inflation rate of 2.8% for February. It was a bright spot in a week that had seen stock market turmoil in response to the escalation of a potentially damaging trade war and continued uncertainty about the administration's ongoing effort to slash the federal workforce. At one point on Tuesday, the S&P 500 stock index had fallen by 10% since hitting an all-time high in February — a decline that would have qualified as a market 'correction' had it not recovered slightly before the end of the day. The index was up slightly on Wednesday afternoon but off 8.8% from last month's high. Economists warned that the positive inflation news may be a temporary respite. Since the beginning of March, Trump has imposed additional tariffs of 10% on Chinese goods, tariffs as high as 25% on many goods imported from Mexico and Canada, and an across-the-board tariff of 25% on steel and aluminum. The impact of those moves was not reflected in the numbers released Wednesday. Also not reflected was the pledge from the European Union and other countries to impose retaliatory tariffs on U.S. goods, which would make it harder for American manufacturers to sell their products outside the domestic market. Strong medicine Trump has occasionally acknowledged his policies may cause short-term economic disruption and pain but has insisted they will lead to greater prosperity that will benefit all Americans. At an appearance before the Business Roundtable in Washington on Tuesday, he insisted that manufacturing firms are already scouting new U.S. locations so they can move operations and avoid tariffs. 'They're looking all over the place for places. … And also, very importantly, the tariffs are — they don't want to pay 25% or whatever it may be, it may go up higher,' the president said. At a separate event at the White House on Tuesday, Trump was asked about Americans who might be concerned that a tanking stock market had damaged their retirement savings. 'Markets, they're going to go up, they're going to go down, but you know what? We have to rebuild our country,' Trump said. 'Our country had to do this,' he said. 'We had to go and do this. Other countries have taken away our business, taken away our jobs.' Deregulation and 'tax cuts' Mary Lovely, a senior fellow with the Peterson Institute for International Economics, said economists will be closely watching certain factors for clues about where the economy is headed in the coming months. The Trump administration has signaled that it wants to enact sweeping deregulation on some industries, which could boost certain sectors of the economy and help lower prices. 'This is something that a lot of companies say is going to offset the cost, but it's clearly going to be selective,' Lovely said, so the degree to which it will impact the broader economy is unclear. A second factor will be whether Congress extends tax cuts enacted during Trump's first term or adds additional reductions. 'A lot of people talk about the 'tax cuts,' but in fact, most of them are extensions,' Lovely said. So, unless there are new cuts, 'it's not new juice for the economy,' she said. Lovely also pointed out that higher prices due to tariffs will have a disproportionately harmful effect on lower-income Americans. They will see a larger percentage of their income eaten up by higher prices as tax policies largely benefiting the wealthy are likely to be extended. 'So, you have a kind of reverse Robin Hood going on there,' she said. Consumer uncertainty The economists who spoke to VOA — whether their focus was consumer behavior, corporate decision-making or the vagaries of international trade — all said that the number one issue facing economic actors today is uncertainty. On tariff policy, in particular, the Trump administration has been inconsistent in its approach, announcing that specific new tariffs would be imposed only to shift direction — sometimes on the same day. On Tuesday, for instance, Trump announced a further 25% tariff on some goods from Canada only to walk back the threat hours later. Elizabeth Renter, a senior economist with the personal finance website NerdWallet, said the effects on consumer confidence are already measurable. 'We've begun seeing the impact of potential economic policies make their way into the data,' she told VOA via email. 'Inflation expectations have risen, consumer sentiment has fallen and households are feeling more pessimistic about their future financial conditions.' 'Current consumer reactions are pretty natural responses to uncertainty about the economy,' Renter wrote. 'It's difficult to make financial plans when you're uncertain of where policy will land, and people are being confronted with possible changes often. This sentiment shapes behavior, as businesses and households may pull back on planned investments and spending, choosing to save their money in a precautionary way instead. Those behavior changes can shape the economy directly.' Businesses reel For corporations trying to make business decisions, the environment feels treacherous, Desmond Lachman, a senior fellow with the conservative think tank American Enterprise Institute, told VOA. 'It's very worrying what's going on, because what Trump has done is just injected a huge amount of uncertainty into economic policymaking,' he said. 'You saw that most clearly with the import tariffs,' Lachman said. 'One minute he's got the tariff on, the next minute he's got it off, the next minute he's making an exemption. The next day he's announcing another tariff. So, it's very difficult for businesses to plan. They've just got no clue what's going on … and can't make a reasonable investment decision.' The vacillating on tariffs hasn't been businesses' only concern, Lachman said. The effort by the so-called Department of Government Efficiency, led by the world's richest man, Elon Musk, to slash the government workforce has created confusion. In a number of cases, workers have been summarily fired only to be called back to work shortly after, creating doubt about which government programs will be supported by adequate staff going forward. 'Things just look very haphazard to the markets, and they're voting with their feet,' Lachman said. Trade in disarray On Wednesday, the European Union and Canada announced a raft of retaliatory tariffs set to roll out next month on billions of dollars' worth of U.S. goods. The levies, which will affect Harley-Davidson motorcycles, Kentucky bourbon and various agricultural products, were in response to Trump's global 25% tariff on steel and aluminum. U.S. Trade Representative Jamieson Greer issued a blistering statement Wednesday accusing the European Union of ignoring legitimate U.S. interests in having strong domestic steel and aluminum production sectors. 'The EU's punitive action completely disregards the national security imperatives of the United States — and indeed international security — and is yet another indicator that the EU's trade and economic policies are out of step with reality.' Lachman of the American Enterprise Institute said he is concerned about the dangers of further escalation. 'This is dangerous where we're going,' he said. 'I'm particularly worried about the retaliation — if [Trump] retaliates for the retaliation.' He said that risks a cycle of ever-increasing tariffs of the sort that helped deepen the Great Depression nearly 100 years ago. 'We just get this kind of tit for tat and ratchet up, and there are no winners,' he said. 'It's just a question of who's going to lose more.'	https://www.voanews.com/a/us-markets-flail-amid-trade-war-uncertainty-in-washington/8009034.html	2025-03-12T23:00:46-07:00	
Judge extends ban on Columbia student's deportation from US	NEW YORK — A U.S. judge on Wednesday extended his order blocking federal authorities from deporting a detained Columbia University student, in a case that has become a flashpoint of the Trump administration's pledge to deport some pro-Palestinian college activists. U.S. District Judge Jesse Furman had temporarily blocked Mahmoud Khalil's deportation earlier this week and extended the prohibition on Wednesday in a written order following a hearing in Manhattan federal court to allow himself more time to consider whether the arrest was unconstitutional. The Department of Homeland Security says Khalil, 30, is subject to deportation under a legal provision holding that migrants whose presence in the country are deemed by the U.S. Secretary of State to be incompatible with foreign policy may be removed, according to a document seen by Reuters. 'The Secretary of State has determined that your presence or activities in the United States would have serious adverse foreign policy consequences for the United States,' read the DHS document, dated March 9, ordering Khalil to appear before an immigration judge on March 27. The document did not provide additional detail. The DHS did not immediately respond to requests for comment. Khalil's lawyers say his arrest on Saturday by DHS agents outside his university residence in Manhattan was in retaliation for his outspoken advocacy against Israel's military assault on Gaza following the October 2023 attack on Israel by Hamas, a U.S.- designated terrorist group, and thus violated Khalil's right to free speech under the U.S. Constitution's First Amendment. 'Mr. Khalil was identified, targeted, detained and is being processed for deportation on account of his advocacy for Palestinian rights,' Khalil's lawyer, Ramzi Kassem, said in court. In her first media interview, Noora Abdalla, Khalil's wife, told Reuters after the hearing she hoped her husband would be free and back in New York in time for the birth of their first child, who is due next month. 'It's been so hard not having him here,' she said. 'There's a lot of emotions and pain. He's been there for me truly every step of the way.' Outside the courthouse on Wednesday, Kassem told reporters that the legal provision DHS referred to was rarely used and was not meant to silence dissent. Khalil was born and raised in a Palestinian refugee camp in Syria and came to the U.S. on a student visa in 2022, becoming a permanent resident last year. He was a prominent member of Columbia's protest movement against Israel's military assault on Gaza. U.S. President Donald Trump has said on social media that Khalil supported Hamas, but his administration has not charged him with a crime and has not provided evidence to show Khalil's alleged support for Hamas. The Trump administration says pro-Palestinian protests on college campuses, including Columbia, have included support for Hamas and antisemitic harassment of Jewish students. Student protest organizers say criticism of Israel is being wrongly conflated with antisemitism. 'This is not about free speech,' Secretary of State Marco Rubio told reporters earlier on Wednesday during a trip to Ireland. 'Being a supporter of Hamas and coming into our universities and turning them upside down ... If you told us that's what you intended to do when you came to America, we would have never let you in.' Refusing to stay silent' The case could ultimately test where immigration courts draw the line between protected free speech and alleged support for groups the United States calls terrorists. Hundreds of protesters gathered outside the courthouse in lower Manhattan, holding signs reading 'Release Mahmoud Khalil' and chanting 'Down, down with deportation, up, up with liberation.' At the hearing, Brandon Waterman, a lawyer for the government, said Khalil's challenge to his arrest should be moved to New Jersey, where he was held when his lawyers first sought his release, or Louisiana, where he is currently being held. Furman also ordered that Khalil be allowed two hourlong private phone calls with his lawyers, one on Wednesday and one on Thursday, after Kassem said Khalil's sole phone call with a member of his legal team from detention in Louisiana so far was cut off prematurely and was on a line recorded and monitored by the government. Even before Furman blocked it, there was no indication Khalil's deportation was imminent. Khalil has the right to plead his case to avoid deportation before a separate judge in immigration court, a potentially lengthy process.	https://www.voanews.com/a/judge-extends-ban-on-columbia-student-s-deportation-from-us/8009106.html	2025-03-12T22:56:37-07:00	
Archaeologists find million-year-old fossil of a human ancestor	WASHINGTON — A fossil of a partial face from a human ancestor is the oldest in western Europe, archaeologists reported Wednesday. The incomplete skull — a section of the left cheek bone and upper jaw – was found in northern Spain in 2022. The fossil is between 1.1 million and 1.4 million years old, according to research published in the journal Nature. 'The fossil is exciting,' said Eric Delson, a paleontologist at the American Museum of Natural History, who was not involved in the study. 'It's the first time we have significant remains older than 1 million years old in western Europe.' A collection of older fossils from early human ancestors was previously found in Georgia, near the crossroads of eastern Europe and Asia. Those are estimated to be 1.8 million years old. The Spanish fossil is the first evidence that clearly shows human ancestors 'were taking excursions into Europe' at that time, said Rick Potts, director of the Smithsonian’s Human Origins Program. But there is not yet evidence that the earliest arrivals persisted there long, he said. 'They may get to a new location and then die out,' said Potts, who had no role in the study. The partial skull bears many similarities to Homo erectus, but there are also some anatomical differences, said study co-author Rosa Huguet, an archaeologist at the Catalan Institute of Human Paleoecology and Social Evolution in Tarragona, Spain. Homo erectus arose around 2 million years ago and moved from Africa to regions of Asia and Europe, with the last individuals dying out around 100,000 years ago, said Potts. It can be challenging to identify which group of early humans a fossil find belongs to if there's only a single fragment versus many bones that show a range of features, said University of Zurich paleoanthropologist Christoph Zollikofer, who was not involved in the study. The same cave complex in Spain's Atapuerca Mountains where the new fossil was found also previously yielded other significant clues to the ancient human past. Researchers working in the region have also found more recent fossils from Neanderthals and early Homo sapiens.	https://www.voanews.com/a/archaeologists-find-million-year-old-face-fossil-of-a-human-ancestor/8009101.html	2025-03-12T22:43:35-07:00

Eyewitnesses give harrowing account of Pakistan train attack	ISLAMABAD — Passengers of a Pakistani train held hostage in the restive Balochistan province shared with VOA disturbing details of their ordeal on Wednesday as the military completed an hourslong rescue operation and killed 33 terrorists. Speaking to a private news channel, Lt. Gen. Ahmed Sharif Chaudhry, director general of military’s media wing, Inter Services Public Relations, said that all hostages were rescued. Two of the passengers described to VOA harrowing moments with the Baloch Liberation Army. 'They shot and killed people on the train. They said, 'Come out quietly and we will let you go.' We came outside and sat down,' said Jamshed Ajmal. The militants then asked passengers of Punjabi and Saraiki ethnicity to come forward, he said. 'Then they picked out police officers and tied their hands and shot them several times. At night, they picked out 10 more people and shot them,' Ajmal said. 'Whoever didn’t leave the train, they killed them,' he said. 'We planned to run away. We escaped and came to our [armed] forces.' Another passenger, Allah Ditta, told VOA that he and several others ran for their lives after militants pulled them off the train. 'When we saw two people quietly escape, then we all braved up and started running. Still 150 to 200 people were left sitting,' Ditta said. 'Some soldiers also ran and that’s when we felt brave, too, and we ran for about 2 kilometers and reached a frontier corps post.' According to earlier reports, close to 200 passengers had been freed before the final push Wednesday evening. The attack The Jaffar Express, a cross-country train with roughly 450 people on board, came under a bomb and gun attack on Tuesday while passing through a tunnel near Sibi, Balochistan, on its way north to Peshawar from Quetta. Separatists belonging to the banned BLA claimed responsibility for the attack. Pakistan and the United States have designated BLA a terrorist group. The military spokesperson said the army, air force, paramilitary frontier corps, and commandos of the Special Services Group took part in the operation that lasted almost 30 hours. 'Since terrorists were holding passengers as human shields, the operation was conducted with skill and caution,' Chaudhry said, adding that snipers killed suicide bombers before forces advanced to clear the train’s nine cars. The spokesperson said no passengers were killed during the operation. However, he said 21 passengers died in the initial attack by the BLA. Four frontier corps personnel were also killed, including one during the clearance operation, Chaudhry said. A bomb disposal squad searched the area for explosives, while passengers who escaped in several directions were gathered up, he said. 'This incident of Jaffar Express changes the rules of the game,' Chaudhry said, warning that terrorists will not be spared. The BLA had warned a day earlier that it would execute security personnel among the hostages if the state did not release political prisons, missing persons, and what it called resistance workers held in Balochistan prisons within 48 hours. BLA surges Since last August, BLA has claimed responsibility for several deadly attacks, primarily targeting security forces and workers from the eastern Punjab province, the seat of power in Pakistan. The separatist group accuses Pakistan of exploiting the rich natural resources of their impoverished province. The group also opposes Chinese investment in Balochistan, which is home to the China-funded Gwadar port and the country’s biggest yet largely unused airport. Both Pakistan and China reject claims that their joint ventures are depriving ethnic Baloch of economic opportunities and their share in the province's mineral wealth. According to the Global Terrorism Index 2025, BLA is one of two militant groups driving a surge in violence that has pushed Pakistan to the second spot on the list of countries most affected by terrorism. According to the report, the separatist militant group launched 504 attacks in 2024, compared with 116 in 2023. Deaths in these attacks surged from 88 in 2023 to 388 in 2024. Military spokesperson Chaundry claimed Tuesday's attacker were in touch with planners in Afghanistan. Islamabad has blamed several recent attacks on militants present on Afghan soil. Afghan Taliban routinely deny providing sanctuary to anti-Pakistan fighters.

Kuwait frees group of jailed Americans, including contractors held on drug charges	WASHINGTON — Kuwait has released a group of American prisoners, including veterans and military contractors jailed for years on drug-related charges, in a move seen as a gesture of goodwill between two allies, a representative for the detainees told The Associated Press on Wednesday. The release follows a recent visit to the region by Adam Boehler, the Trump administration's top hostage envoy, and comes amid a continued U.S. government push to bring home American citizens jailed in foreign countries. Six of the newly freed prisoners were accompanied on a flight from Kuwait to New York by Jonathan Franks, a private consultant who works on cases involving American hostages and detainees and who had been in the country to help secure their release. 'My clients and their families are grateful to the Kuwaiti government for this kind humanitarian gesture,' Franks said in a statement. He said that his clients maintain their innocence and that additional Americans he represents also are expected to be released by Kuwait later. The State Department did not immediately respond to a request for comment. The names of the released prisoners were not immediately made public. Kuwait, a small, oil-rich nation that borders Iraq and Saudi Arabia and is near Iran, is considered a major non-NATO ally of the United States. Secretary of State Marco Rubio paid tribute to that relationship as recently as last month, when he said the U.S. 'remains steadfast in its support for Kuwait's sovereignty and the well-being of its people.' The countries have had a close military partnership since America launched the 1991 Gulf War to expel Iraqi troops after Iraqi dictator Saddam Hussein invaded the country, with some 13,500 American troops stationed in Kuwait at Camp Arifjan and Ali al-Salem Air Base. But Kuwait has also detained many American military contractors on drug charges, in some cases, for years. Their families have alleged that their loved ones faced abuse while imprisoned in a country that bans alcohol and has strict laws regarding drugs. The State Department warns travelers that drug charges in Kuwait can carry long prison sentences and the death penalty. Defense cooperation agreements between the U.S. and Kuwait likely include provisions that ensure U.S. troops are subject only to American laws, though that likely doesn't include contractors. Since President Donald Trump returned to the White House, his Republican administration has secured the release of American schoolteacher Marc Fogel in a prisoner swap with Russia and has announced the release by Belarus of an imprisoned U.S. citizen.	https://www.voanews.com/a/kuwait-frees-group-of-jailed-americans-including-contractors-held-on-drug-charges/8009058.html	2025-03-12T19:14:03-07:00	
Advocates for jailed publisher Lai turn to Trump administration	WASHINGTON — The son of imprisoned pro-democracy publisher Jimmy Lai this week brought the campaign to secure his father’s release to the Trump administration in Washington. Nearly two months into President Donald Trump’s second term, Lai’s son Sebastien and their international legal team were in Washington this week to meet with Trump administration officials and lawmakers in hopes that the United States can help push for Lai’s release. Lai, a businessman and founder of the now-shuttered Apple Daily newspaper in Hong Kong, stands accused of collusion with foreign forces and sedition under a Beijing-imposed national security law. He rejects the charges, but if convicted in an ongoing trial, he could face life in prison. 'We were incredibly grateful that President Trump said that he will help release my father. It’s given us as a family a lot of hope,' the younger Lai said at a Wednesday event at the Cato Institute think tank in Washington. In October 2024, Trump said he would '100%' be able to secure Lai’s release if he were reelected. 'I’ll get him out. He’ll be easy to get out. But we don’t have people that even talk about it,' Trump said in an interview with conservative podcast host Hugh Hewitt. The White House did not reply to VOA’s email requesting comment on whether the Trump administration had any specific plans to help secure Lai’s release. But a State Department spokesperson reaffirmed that the United States calls for Lai’s immediate release. 'Lai’s lengthy trial and unjust detention are an example of how China uses vague national security laws to suppress fundamental freedoms and political discourse,' the spokesperson added in a statement emailed to VOA on Wednesday. Lai, a 77-year-old British national, has been held in solitary confinement in Hong Kong since late 2020. His trial, which was originally estimated to last about 80 days, has been ongoing since December 2023 and is widely viewed as politically motivated. Hong Kong authorities have rejected accusations that Lai’s trial is unfair and maintain that press freedom and the rule of law are intact. Speaking at the Cato Institute event, Mark Clifford, president of the Committee for Freedom in Hong Kong, suggested that the U.S. government should use sanctions against Hong Kong officials as a way to push for Lai’s release. Clifford, who previously served on the board of Apple Daily’s parent company, also suggested the United States could shutter the Hong Kong Economic and Trade Offices in Washington, New York and San Francisco. 'There’s a pretty good tool kit that the administration has,' Clifford said. Even though the government-appointed judges are likely to find Lai guilty, Mark Simon, who worked with Lai for decades in Hong Kong, argued that releasing Lai may be in Beijing’s interest. 'Your influence as a dissident is at the height when you’re in prison. The world is campaigning for you. If you’re China and you release him, his influence goes down,' Simon said at the Cato Institute. 'If he dies in prison, then you don’t control anything.' Jimmy Lai’s international legal team has expressed concern about the conditions in which the publisher is being held, including prolonged solitary confinement and no access to specialized medical care for diabetes. Hong Kong authorities have rejected those claims. 'Everybody realizes that the clock is ticking, and time is running out for my father,' Sebastien Lai said. But even though his father’s physical health has become fragile, Sebastien Lai said his mind has stayed strong. 'He’s still strong mentally, and he’s still fighting,' the younger Lai said. 'That’s something that should inspire all of us.' Before concluding his cross-examination in Lai’s national security trial last week, Hong Kong prosecutor Anthony Chau read out the charges, alleged conspiracies and co-conspirators, and asked the elder Lai if he agreed with them. 'Of course I disagree. Totally rubbish,' Lai said. After 52 days in the witness box, Lai completed his testimony in the trial last week. Lawyers from both sides aren’t expected to return to court to deliver their closing statements until August, marking the trial’s latest months-long delay. Lai’s plight has received bipartisan support in Washington, according to Caoilfhionn Gallagher, the attorney leading Lai’s international legal team. She told VOA she hopes the United States and the United Kingdom can coordinate their efforts and work together to secure Lai’s release.

Argentines protesting austerity measures clash with police	BUENOS AIRES, ARGENTINA — Argentine retirees and fans of several soccer teams clashed with police Wednesday during a protest in front of Congress in the capital, Buenos Aires, against the economic policies implemented by the government of President Javier Milei. What started as a peaceful demonstration escalated into violent clashes as police deployed water cannons, tear gas and pellets against stone-throwing protesters. For weeks, Buenos Aires retirees have held weekly protests demanding higher pensions, citing a precarious standard of living. While previous demonstrations involved minor incidents, including tear gas use against the elderly, Wednesday's protest was unprecedented in scale. The government of far-right Milei, who has championed a policy of public spending cuts since coming to power a year and a half ago, had warned of restrictions on entry to stadiums for those who cause disorder. Police deployed shotguns and water hoses before the scheduled 5 p.m. protest. Clashes erupted when a large group of Boca Juniors soccer fans, waving flags and chanting in support of the retirees, arrived. Police formed a cordon to block their advance toward Congress. At the rear, a group of retirees were pushed back by high-pressure water cannons fired by two tanks at the perimeter closest to the Legislative Assembly. In an unprecedented show of unity, fans from Boca Juniors, River Plate and other Argentine soccer clubs joined pensioners who gather outside Congress every Wednesday to protest the government's austerity measures. Surrounded by police, protesters chanted, 'Don't touch the elderly.' A man draped in the Argentine flag held a sign that read 'Help me fight. You'll be the next elderly person.' A resolution published Wednesday by Argentina's Ministry of Security bans anyone who engages in violent behavior, disrupts security, traffic, or public order from entering soccer stadiums. This means that fans involved in Wednesday's riots will be barred from attending their team's games for a period set by the authorities.	https://www.voanews.com/a/argentines-protesting-austerity-measures-clash-with-police/8009041.html	2025-03-12T18:26:34-07:00	
Zimbabwe journalist still in custody after case adjourned	A High Court judge in Zimbabwe on Wednesday adjourned the case of a journalist arrested over his interviews with a war veteran-turned-politician who criticized the country's president. Blessed Mhlanga, a journalist with NewsDay and Heart and Soul Television, has been in custody since Feb. 24 over accusations of incitement. Lawyers for the journalist had requested that he be bailed out, but at a hearing in Zimbabwe's capital, Harare, Justice Gibson Mandaza requested more time to examine the case. Chris Mhike, who represents Mhlanga, told VOA he was waiting for the High Court to announce when the case would resume. Mhike said it would be 'improper' to go into the arguments because the case was active but said the judge 'indicated that it was necessary for him to consider the issues that are at stake.' Speaking ahead of Wednesday's hearing, Mhike said the arrest of Mhlanga sent a chilling message. The arrest is related to his interviews with war veteran and politician Blessed Geza in November and January, in which Geza said that he would mobilize public protests to push President Emmerson Mnangagwa out of office, citing economic issues and what he called the president's failure to govern. On Friday, Geza was expelled from the Zanu PF party for what the party described as violating regulations in public comments about the president. Mhike said he believed his client's arrest served as a warning to others to refrain from discussing political topics, such as whether Mnangagwa should seek a third term. Zimbabwean presidents serve five-year terms, which are renewable once. Mhlanga's arrest 'has had a chilling effect on the practice of journalism, as is always the case when journalists are either harassed, or put through the legal process, really for activities that are directly linked to their work,' Mhike told VOA. It is 'worrisome to many in the journalistic fraternity,' he added. 'This has been the impact, and this has been my client's position: that he is being tormented purely on grounds of him carrying out his work as a journalist.' Mhlanga, who faces two charges relating to 'transmitting of data messages inciting violence or damage to property,' denies the charges against him. Mhike said his client's arrest also could be unconstitutional. Zimbabwe's Constitution guarantees the right to freedom of expression, which includes freedom to seek, receive and communicate ideas and other information, and entitles citizens to freedom of the press. Farai Marapira, the Zanu PF information director, said he expected courts to preside fairly over the case. 'I believe people should allow the court process to pursue this matter as it is designed to find out what are the material facts of the matter, and I'm sure the courts will deal fairly with this issue,' Marapira said. Marapira also said Mhlanga's arrest was not a reflection of the state of press freedom in the country. 'People write about Zanu PF every day — people write positively, people write negatively, some even write and insult Zanu PF,' he said. Marapira then rhetorically asked aloud: 'Who is dead? No one is dead. So, what are they fearing for their lives from? Where is the example? Where are the examples of killed journalists? So, like I said, this is all overexcitement.' The media watchdog Reporters Without Borders said that conditions for journalists have improved since the end of longtime leader Robert Mugabe's rule. But, it noted in its press freedom index, media have faced greater persecution since the 2023 election. In the past two years, journalists have been blocked or harassed while covering events and briefly detained and assaulted, media groups said. Mhlanga himself has had a previous brush with the law. In 2022, he and his colleague Chengeto Chidi were arrested for taking photos of the police during the arrest of an opposition lawmaker. In his latest case, international and local media rights organizations have condemned Mhlanga's arrest and urged the Zimbabwean government to drop all charges against him.

IS in Sahel expands terror threat beyond strongholds	On Feb. 24, the Moroccan counterterror agency broke up a terrorist cell calling itself 'the Lions of the Caliphate in the Maghreb Al Aqsa.' Authorities said the group was making remote-controlled bombs to carry out attacks in the North African country. In November, a similar terrorist cell was dismantled in the Spanish cities of Seville and Ceuta. The connection? Both Moroccan and Spanish authorities said the groups were aligned with Islamic State in The Sahel. The group is best known for wreaking a devastating wave of violence across Burkina Faso, Niger and Mali, plunging these countries into chaos and fueling a spiraling humanitarian crisis. But analysts say the foiled terror cells farther afield are a worrying sign. 'Because the counterinsurgency infrastructure in Mali, Burkina Faso and Niger has been compromised, then it allows them to make inroads into other countries that they perceive to be vulnerable,' said Beverly Ochieng, a senior analyst at geopolitical risk consultancy Control Risks. Ochieng said IS Sahel’s strategy appears increasingly focused on exploiting security gaps beyond their core Sahelian strongholds. 'IS Sahel has seen that its expansion could be directed much further West and much further North, and Morocco would be one place which would be of strategic interest to it,' she said. Andrew Lebovich of the Dutch international affairs think tank Clingendael said these disrupted plots are indicative of IS Sahel's broader ambitions. 'It does suggest an ongoing effort to increase operations in different ways in other countries,' he said, adding that Algeria is facing an increasing threat. And it’s not just North Africa that's at risk. Ochieng warns that countries traditionally seen as stable, such as Guinea or even Senegal, could become future targets for IS Sahel militants too. In March, the Global Terrorism Index named the Sahel the epicenter of global terrorism for the second year running.	https://www.voanews.com/a/is-in-sahel-expands-terror-threat-beyond-strongholds/8009027.html	2025-03-12T18:07:35-07:00	
Putin orders army to push last Ukrainian troops from Russian territory	President Vladimir Putin donned military fatigues for a surprise visit to troops in Russia's western Kursk region on Wednesday, where he ordered them to press their lightning advance and swiftly retake the rest of the area from Ukrainian forces. Putin made his visit after Washington asked him to consider a 30-day ceasefire proposal backed by Ukraine, and after Russian forces retook a swath of territory in Kursk, forcing Ukrainian troops to fall back and cede control of the town of Sudzha. Ukraine sprang one of the biggest shocks of the war on Aug. 6, 2024, by storming across the border and grabbing a chunk of land inside Russia, boosting citizens' morale and gaining a potential bargaining chip. But after clinging for more than seven months to a gradually shrinking area, Ukraine has seen its position worsen sharply in Kursk in the past week after its main supply lines were severed. Putin made it clear he was considering setting up a new buffer zone inside Ukraine's Sumy region, which is adjacent to Kursk, to guard against any future Ukrainian incursions. He also said foreign citizens fighting with Ukrainian forces captured in Kursk were not entitled to enjoy the protection of the Geneva Conventions, and that Ukrainian soldiers captured in Kursk should be treated as terrorists. 'Our task in the near future, in the shortest possible timeframe, is to decisively defeat the enemy entrenched in the Kursk region and still fighting here, to completely liberate the territory of the Kursk region, and to restore the situation along the line of the state border,' Putin said. 'And of course, we need to think about creating a security zone along the state border.' Valery Gerasimov, the chief of Russia's General Staff, was shown telling Putin that Russian forces had pushed Ukrainian forces out of more than 86% of the territory they had once held in Kursk, the equivalent of 1,100 square kilometers of land. Ukraine's plans to use Kursk as a bargaining chip in possible future negotiations with Russia had failed, he added. Kyiv's gambit that its Kursk operation would force Russia to divert troops from its advance in eastern Ukraine also had not worked. Gerasimov said Russian forces had retaken 24 settlements and 259 square kilometers from Ukrainian forces in the last five days, along with more than 400 prisoners. Russian units also had crossed into Ukraine's Sumy region, where he said they were expanding 'a security zone.' Reuters could not independently verify his assertions. Reuters was, however, able to verify video published by Russian bloggers and state media showing troops standing with a Russian tricolor flag on a square in the center of Sudzha, a town near the Ukrainian border on a highway used by Ukraine as a supply route. Deep State, an authoritative Ukrainian site that charts the front lines of the war, updated its battlefield map to show Ukrainian forces were no longer in control of Sudzha. However, it said fighting was continuing on the outskirts. Ukraine's top army commander said Wednesday that Kyiv's troops would keep operating in Russia's Kursk region as long as needed and that fighting continued in and around Sudzha.	https://www.voanews.com/a/putin-orders-army-to-push-last-ukrainian-troops-from-russian-territory/8009023.html	2025-03-12T17:59:50-07:00	
US: Iran ignoring international concerns about its nuclear program	united nations — The United States warned Wednesday that it will continue to exert 'maximum pressure' on Iran in order to prevent it from achieving a nuclear weapon, as Tehran rejected its offer for new nuclear talks amid growing concerns about its stockpile of enriched uranium. 'As reported by the International Atomic Energy Agency [IAEA] Director General, Tehran continues to rapidly accelerate its production of highly enriched uranium,' the U.S. Mission to the United Nations said in a statement. 'It is also the only country in the world without nuclear weapons producing highly enriched uranium, for which it has no credible peaceful purpose.' The United States said Iran is 'flagrantly' defying the U.N. Security Council and ignoring 'the clear and consistent concerns' of both the council and the international community. 'The Council must be clear and united in addressing and condemning this brazen behavior,' the U.S. statement said. Iran has denied for years that its nuclear pursuits are for military purposes. But starting in May 2019, it gradually stopped implementing its nuclear-related commitments under the 2015 nuclear deal, known as the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action, or JCPOA, which provided Tehran with sanctions relief in exchange for limits on its nuclear program. In February 2021, it stopped implementing its commitments altogether. As a result, the IAEA no longer conducts verification and monitoring activities related to the deal, and that has raised many questions about what Iran is doing. The United States, along with Britain and France, which remain parties to the JCPOA, which the first Trump administration pulled out of, called a private meeting Wednesday of the U.N. Security Council to discuss Iran’s proliferation efforts. Council members Greece, Panama and South Korea also supported the call. 'We're seriously concerned about the latest IAEA report about Iran's production of highly enriched uranium,' British Deputy U.N. Ambassador James Kariuki told reporters. 'The director general reported last month that Iran has now produced 275 kilos of uranium enriched to 60% – that's way beyond anything needed for civilian use – and no other non-nuclear state has anything like that amount,' he said. Kariuki said Britain will take any diplomatic measures necessary to prevent Iran from acquiring a nuclear weapon, including reimposing U.N. sanctions – a process known as snapback. Under the terms of the deal, previous U.N. sanctions can 'snap back' if Tehran does not live up to its commitments. The JCPOA is due to expire in October, which means the window could soon be closing for substantive negotiations. Iran’s U.N. ambassador participated in the meeting, but his U.N. mission criticized it, saying on the social media platform X that 'Washington openly seeks to weaponize the UNSC to escalate economic warfare against Iran. This dangerous abuse must be rejected to protect the Council’s credibility.' UNSC is shorthand for the U.N. Security Council. Russia and China, who also are JCPOA signatories, are allies of Tehran. China’s U.N. ambassador told reporters that the nuclear issue is being dealt with in Vienna at the IAEA and that Beijing was not supportive of Wednesday’s council meeting. Fu Cong blamed the Trump administration for disrupting the JCPOA in the first place by withdrawing in 2017, but at the same time he said China hopes there can be a new deal before October’s expiration. 'Putting maximum pressure on a certain country is not going to achieve the goal,' he added. Fu noted that China will convene a meeting in Beijing with Iran and Russia on Friday, to try to facilitate a possible deal to stabilize the situation. It will be chaired by Executive Vice Foreign Minister Ma Zhaoxu, and Russian Deputy Foreign Minister Ryabkov Sergey Alexeevich and Iranian Deputy Foreign Minister Kazem Gharibabadi are expected to attend.	https://www.voanews.com/a/us-iran-ignoring-international-concerns-about-its-nuclear-program-/8009004.html	2025-03-12T17:33:23-07:00

ECOWAS regional bloc activates counterterror force	ABUJA, NIGERIA — Security analysts are praising ECOWAS, the Economic Community of West African States, for activating its regional standby force but remain doubtful about its effectiveness following the recent withdrawal of three member states. Nigerian Defense Minister Mohammed Badaru Abubakar announced the activation of a standby military force Tuesday on the sidelines of the 43rd security meeting of the Economic Community of West African States, or ECOWAS. The force, expected to comprise 5,000 troops, is part of a broader regional security strategy to curb terrorism and cross-border crimes. Abubakar said the initiative aims to mobilize personnel and resources to combat terrorism spreading across the subregion and urged security counterparts to seize the opportunity and coordinate efforts against threats. 'I am pleased to highlight the activation of the ECOWAS standby force to combat terrorism in the subregion,' said Mohammed Badaru Abubakar, Nigeria's defense minister. 'The activation of this force underscores our collective determination to confront the stretch of terrorism with regards to insecurity and ensure the safety and security of our citizens.' ECOWAS security chiefs also discussed peace support operations and maritime security in the Gulf of Guinea. The force's activation follows a report by the Global Terrorism Index, which identified Africa's Sahel region as the global epicenter of extremism — accounting for half of all terror-related fatalities in 2024. This marks an almost tenfold increase compared to 2019. Security analyst Kabiru Adamu welcomed the move but expressed concerns about its effectiveness. 'The last detail that we know, even though that could change, is that it will have two operational bases within the subregion,' said Adamu. 'We know that the ability to even acquire the 5,000-man troops has been a bit challenged. The countries that initially agreed to contribute, three of them are no longer with ECOWAS. So now ECOWAS will have to look back within its members to see who among them will augment the gap.' In late January, Burkina Faso, Mali and Niger withdrew from ECOWAS and created a confederation known as the Alliance of Sahel States, after a yearlong dispute with the bloc. The three military-led nations accused the regional body of failing to protect its members while allegedly serving foreign interests. Despite their exit, ECOWAS has stated it will maintain trade and security relations with the trio. Adamu said these ongoing relationships could be beneficial. 'Given the conditions of the military contingents in almost all the countries, it will be very difficult for these things to be met in a manner that would allow speedy deployment,' said Adamu. 'The good thing is that the defense and security cooperation between the AES and ECOWAS still stands both multilateral and bilateral. We're hoping that in spite of the exit, all sides will see the necessity to continue to engage in the security defense.' Jihadist groups, including Boko Haram and Islamic State's Sahel affiliate, have taken advantage of political instability and public resentment to recruit and expand their influence. With almost all the ECOWAS countries facing internal security challenges, observers are watching to see whether the regional force can shift the status quo amid strained cooperation.	https://www.voanews.com/a/ecowas-regional-bloc-activates-counterterror-force/8008619.html	2025-03-12T16:11:40-07:00

Trump, Irish leader meet amid differences on trade, Gaza war	WASHINGTON — U.S. President Donald Trump met Irish Prime Minister Micheal Martin on Wednesday for wide-ranging talks that reflected differences over trade and the conflict in Gaza, although both leaders pledged to expand cooperation between the two countries. The annual White House meeting around the time of St. Patrick's Day is usually a relatively straightforward affair for both the United States and Ireland. Trump, sitting next to Martin in the Oval Office, said 'of course' he would respond to retaliatory tariffs announced Wednesday by the European Union, of which Ireland is a member, and said April 2 would mark the start of reciprocal tariffs. 'Whatever they charge us, we're charging them,' Trump said. 'If they charge us 25% or 20% or 10% or 2% or 200%, then that's what we're charging them.' Trump underscored his belief that higher tariffs will encourage investment and increased manufacturing in the United States. He said Ireland had lured away U.S. pharmaceutical companies and others with low tax rates, telling Martin that while he respected that decision, he felt U.S. leaders should have acted to prevent the offshoring moves. He said he expected to work with Ireland, calling it a beautiful country, but said the 'massive deficit' in trade had to be addressed. Martin lauded Trump's own investment in Ireland, a golf course in Doonbeg, and said he was the only president to have invested there. Martin also noted that companies like pharmaceutical giant Eli Lilly, which has extensive operations in Ireland, valued the skilled workforce and good productivity in his country but had also announced plans to invest more heavily in the U.S. The Indianapolis-based drugmaker announced plans to plow money into four new U.S. production plants, more than doubling its investments announced since 2020 to $50 billion. It has been operating in Ireland since 1978 and currently employs more than 3,500 people across three sites there. Irish companies were also investing more in the U.S., he said, citing investments by Ryanair and others. 'It's only fair ... I think it's a relationship that can develop.' Trump said he expected the two countries to work together. 'There's a massive deficit that we have with Ireland and with other countries, too, and we want to sort of even that out as nicely as we can, and we'll work together,' he said. While none of Trump's trade measures has been aimed directly at Ireland, the nation of 5.4 million has a trade surplus with the United States and U.S.-owned foreign multinationals employ a significant portion of Irish workers. It will be subject to any EU tariffs, given that trade is governed by the bloc. Trump has also threatened to place tariffs on pharmaceutical products, a major industry in Ireland. Martin downplayed differences over Gaza, saying that both countries were pressing for the release of hostages held by Hamas, a U.S.-designated terror group, and enactment of a ceasefire. Trump has resumed his close alliance with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu since taking office in January, and he has said that all Palestinians should be removed from Gaza, at least temporarily, following a peace deal. In December, Israel announced it would close its embassy in Ireland, citing the country's 'anti-Israel policies.' Among the moves Ireland has made that have upset Israel was one in May to recognize an independent Palestinian state. The Irish leader repeated his call for a surge of humanitarian aid into the Palestinian enclave and his support for a two-state solution, but did not directly address a question about Trump's call for removing Palestinians from Gaza. 'Nobody is expelling any Palestinians from Gaza,' Trump shot back to a question on the issue. The two leaders later traveled to the U.S. Capitol for a traditional lunch. U.S. Vice President JD Vance, who joined Trump and Martin in the Oval Office, also hosted the Irish leader at his vice presidential residence for a breakfast.	https://www.voanews.com/a/trump-irish-leader-meet-amid-differences-on-trade-gaza-war/8008689.html	2025-03-12T15:11:22-07:00	
US steered Syrian Kurds toward Damascus deal, sources say	DAMASCUS, SYRIA — The United States encouraged its Syrian Kurdish allies to reach Monday's landmark deal with the Islamist-led government in Damascus, six sources said, an agreement that could stave off further conflict in northern Syria at a time of uncertainty over the future of U.S. forces deployed there. The deal aims to stitch back together a country fractured by 14 years of war, paving the way for Kurdish-led forces, which hold a quarter of Syria, to merge with Damascus along with regional Kurdish governing bodies. Key details of how this will happen have yet to be spelled out, however. General Mazloum Abdi, head of the Kurdish-led Syrian Democratic Forces (SDF), was flown to Damascus for Monday's signing with interim President Ahmed al-Sharaa aboard a U.S. military aircraft, three sources said. Three other sources — U.S. officials — said the United States had encouraged the SDF to move toward an agreement to resolve its status in the new Syria — the focus of multi-track talks which began after Bashar al-Assad was toppled in December and which Reuters reported on in January. 'The U.S. played a very crucial role,' a senior regional intelligence source said. The deal came at a moment of pressure on both sides. Sharaa is grappling with the fallout of sectarian killings, which were reportedly carried out by militants aligned with his government, while the SDF is locked in conflict with Turkey-backed Syrian groups who are allied to Damascus. Four sources, including one close to the Syrian government, said the sectarian violence had nudged along the agreement. The intelligence source and a Damascus-based diplomat expected the deal to ease Turkish military pressure on the SDF, deemed by Ankara as an extension of the outlawed Kurdistan Workers Party (PKK). Turkey has welcomed the agreement. A Syrian government official said the presidency would work to address pending issues between the SDF and Turkey. Deep ties Washington has developed deep ties to Syria's Kurdish groups since deploying forces to the country to fight Islamic State a decade ago, partnering with Kurdish fighters despite objections from Turkey. The U.S. troop deployment has come into renewed focus since President Donald Trump returned to power. Ahead of any policy decisions on Syria, the Pentagon has started developing plans for a potential withdrawal, should one be ordered, U.S. officials tell Reuters. Still, a U.S. defense official told Reuters on Tuesday there was no sign that a pullout was imminent. The U.S. defense official said General Michael Kurilla, commander of U.S. Central Command, had helped pushed the SDF toward the deal but that the agreement was already moving along. The thinking in the U.S. administration was that the SDF would be unlikely to hold onto its territory in the long-term if it faced pressure from Turkey and the new Syrian government combined, the U.S. defense official said. 'The United States is looking for ways to withdraw from Syria without chaos and blowback. The best way of doing that is to secure a deal among the Syrian factions,' said Aron Lund of Century International, a U.S.-based think tank. 'A negotiated handover makes sense for the United States. It's Washington's best bet, to avoid conflict between the Kurdish-led forces and the new government in Damascus, and to prevent a Turkish attack across the border,' he said. Devil in the details The U.S. military declined comment on all aspects of the deal, including any role it may have had in encouraging talks or whether it provided transportation to Abdi to reach Damascus. U.S. Secretary of State Marco Rubio said on Tuesday that Washington welcomed the agreement. Erdem Ozan, a former Turkish diplomat and expert on Syria, said the agreement benefited both sides. 'Sharaa gains political breathing room after recent unrest in the coastal area, and the SDF avoids a direct clash with Turkey at a time when U.S. policy on Syria remains uncertain,' he said. The deal did not say how the SDF will be merged with Syria's armed forces. The SDF has previously said its forces must join as a bloc. Damascus wants them to join as individuals. The Syrian government official said committees would work to address details, including the control of borders. 'While it might seem like a win-win now, the real test will be in its execution,' Ozan said. An SDF spokesperson did not immediately respond to questions. Abdi has called the deal a 'real opportunity to build a new Syria.' The deal was struck at a potentially historic moment for the Kurds, following a call by the jailed PKK leader Abdullah Ocalan for his group to disarm. Though heavily influenced by Ocalan, the SDF has said this does not apply to it. Aaron Zelin, a senior fellow at the Washington Institute for Near East Policy, said Washington wants to ensure the fight against Islamic State continues smoothly, with Damascus eventually taking up responsibilities for countering it. 'It also helps unify the country which is in the interest of the U.S. since it wants stability and not internal power fights,' he said.	https://www.voanews.com/a/us-steered-syrian-kurds-toward-damascus-deal-sources-say/8008684.html	2025-03-12T15:06:41-07:00

China, Iran, Russia hold joint naval drills in Middle East	TEHRAN, IRAN — China, Iran and Russia conducted joint naval drills Tuesday in the Middle East, offering a show of force in a region still uneasy over Tehran's rapidly expanding nuclear program and as Yemen's Houthi rebels threaten new attacks on ships. The joint drills, called the Maritime Security Belt 2025, took place in the Gulf of Oman near the strategic Strait of Hormuz, the narrow mouth of the Persian Gulf through which a fifth of the world’s crude oil passes. The area around the strait has in the past seen Iran seize commercial ships and launch suspected attacks in the time since President Donald Trump first unilaterally withdrew America from Tehran's nuclear deal with world powers. The drill marked the fifth year the three countries took part in the drills. This year's drill likely sparked a warning late Monday from the British military's United Kingdom Maritime Trade Operations center, which said there was GPS interference in the strait, with disruptions lasting for several hours and forcing crews to rely on backup navigation methods. 'This was likely GPS jamming to reduce the targeting capability of drones and missiles,' wrote Shaun Robertson, an intelligence analyst at the EOS Risk Group. 'However, electronic navigation system interference has been reported in this region previously during periods of increased tension and military exercises.' US-patrolled waters Russia's Defense Ministry identified the vessels it sent to the drill as the corvettes Rezky and the Hero of the Russian Federation Aldar Tsydenzhapov, as well as the tanker Pechenega. China's Defense Ministry said it sent the guided-missile destroyer Baotou and the comprehensive supply ship Gaoyouhu. Neither offered a count of the personnel involved. Neither China nor Russia actively patrol the wider Middle East, whose waterways remain crucial for global energy supplies. Instead, they broadly cede that to Western nations largely led by the U.S. Navy's Bahrain-based 5th Fleet. Observers for the drill included Azerbaijan, Iraq, Kazakhstan, Oman, Pakistan, Qatar, South Africa, Sri Lanka and the United Arab Emirates — with the Americans likely keeping watch as well. However, China and Russia have deep interests in Iran. For China, it has continued to purchase Iranian crude oil despite facing Western sanctions, likely at a discount compared with global prices. Beijing also remains one of the top markets for Iranian imports. Russia, meanwhile, has relied on Iran for the supply of bomb-carrying drones it uses in its war on Ukraine. Iran highlights drills The drills marked a major moment for Iran's state-run television network. It has aired segments showing live fire during a night drill and sailors manning deck guns on a vessel. The exercises come after an Iranian monthslong drill that followed a direct Israeli attack on the country, targeting its air defenses and sites associated with its ballistic missile program. While Tehran sought to downplay the assault, it shook the wider populace and came as a campaign of Israeli assassinations and attacks have decimated Iran's self-described 'Axis of Resistance' — a series of militant groups allied with the Islamic Republic. Syrian President Bashar al-Assad was also overthrown in December, further weakening Iran's grip on the wider region. All the while, Iran has increasingly stockpiled more uranium enriched at near-weapons-grade levels, something done only by atomic-armed nations. Tehran has long maintained its program is for peaceful purposes, even as its officials increasingly threaten to pursue the bomb. Iran's nuclear program has drawn warnings from Israel and the U.S., signaling that military action against the program could happen. But just last week, Trump sent a letter to Iranian Supreme Leader Ali Khamenei seeking a new nuclear deal. Iran says it hasn't received any letter but still issued a flurry of pronouncements over it. Houthis renew threats As a shaky ceasefire holds in Israel's war against Hamas in the Gaza Strip, Yemen's Houthi rebels said they were resuming attacks on shipping in the Red Sea and the Gulf of Aden, as well as the Bab el-Mandeb Strait that connects the two waterways. The rebels' secretive leader, Abdul-Malik al-Houthi, warned Friday that attacks against Israel-linked vessels would resume within four days if Israel didn't let aid into Gaza. As the deadline passed Tuesday, the Houthis said they were again banning Israeli vessels from the waters off Yemen. Although no attacks were reported, it has put shippers on edge. The rebels targeted over 100 merchant vessels with missiles and drones, sinking two vessels and killing four sailors, since November 2023.	https://www.voanews.com/a/china-iran-russia-hold-joint-naval-drills-in-middle-east/8008597.html	2025-03-12T13:55:19-07:00	
DRC, M23 rebels to begin direct peace talks, Angola says	LUANDA, ANGOLA — Direct peace talks between the Democratic Republic of Congo and M23 rebels will begin in the Angolan capital on March 18, Angola's presidency said in a statement on Wednesday. The Southern African country has been trying to mediate a lasting ceasefire and de-escalate tensions between the DRC and neighboring Rwanda, which has been accused of backing the Tutsi-led rebel group. Rwanda denies those allegations. Angola announced on Tuesday that it would attempt to broker the direct talks. Congo's government has repeatedly refused to hold talks with M23 and on Tuesday said only that it had taken note of the Angolan initiative. There was no immediate comment from Kinshasa on Wednesday.	https://www.voanews.com/a/drc-m23-rebels-to-begin-direct-peace-talks-angola-says/8008553.html	2025-03-12T13:08:40-07:00	
Chest X-ray confirms improvements in pope's condition, Vatican says	ROME — Pope Francis' recovery from double pneumonia continued Wednesday as a chest X-ray confirmed improvement, two days after doctors declared he is no longer in imminent danger of death. The latest medical bulletin said the pope's condition remained stable but indicated a complex picture considering his overall fragility. The Vatican said Francis, 88, again followed its spiritual retreat remotely and resumed physical and respiratory therapy after a quiet night. He continues to receive high flows of oxygen through nasal tubes during the day and a noninvasive mechanical mask to aid his rest at night. His weekly Wednesday general audience was canceled since the Vatican hierarchy is on retreat this week as part of the Lenten spiritual exercises that have been a mainstay of the Jesuit pope's pontificate. Francis faces important milestones this week. On Thursday, he marks the 12th anniversary of his election as the 266th pope. The Holy See has not said how the anniversary, a public holiday in the Vatican, might be commemorated. No medical bulletin will be issued. The former Cardinal Jorge Mario Bergoglio was elected on the fifth ballot of the 2013 conclave that was called after Pope Benedict XVI resigned. While Francis has praised Benedict's humility in stepping down and said he might follow in his footsteps, more recently he has said the papacy is a job for life. Another milestone comes Friday, when Francis marks four weeks of hospitalization. St. John Paul II holds the record for a hospital stay, at 55 days, when in 1981 he underwent a minor surgical operation and then was treated for a cytomegalovirus infection. Francis is on track to equal the second-longest stay, 28 days, which John Paul recorded in 1994, when he had surgery to repair his right hip joint after he fractured his right femur in a fall, according to Gemelli hospital. The Vatican has released no photos or video of Francis since he was admitted. The pope recorded an audio message last week to thank people for their prayers, though the weakness and breathlessness of his voice made clear how frail he was.	https://www.voanews.com/a/chest-x-ray-confirms-improvements-in-pope-s-condition-vatican-says/8008567.html	2025-03-12T13:06:33-07:00	
VOA Kurdish: Syrian Kurds concerned following attacks on Alawites	Following the recent attacks carried out against civilians in the Alawite-majority region in Syria’s coastal region, many Kurds are expressing fears that Syria is heading into yet a new wave of violence, especially targeting the country’s ethnic and religious minorities. In the city of Kobani in northern Syria, residents said the attacks against Alawites in western Syria were reminiscent of Islamic State atrocities against Yazidis in Sinjar, Iraq, and Syrian Kurds in Kobani.

US drops lawsuit against shelter provider accused of sexual abuse of migrant children	WASHINGTON — The U.S. Department of Justice has dropped a civil rights lawsuit it filed last year against the national nonprofit Southwest Key Programs alleging its employees had sexually abused unaccompanied minors who were housed in its shelters after entering the country illegally, according to a court filing. Austin, Texas-based nonprofit Southwest Key contracts with the federal government to care for young migrants arriving in the U.S. without parents or legal guardians. It has operated 27 shelters in Texas, Arizona and California. It is the largest provider of shelter to unaccompanied minor children. The U.S. Department of Justice sued in July 2024 in the Western District of Texas alleging a pattern of 'severe or pervasive sexual harassment' going back to at least 2015 in the network of Southwest Key shelters. The complaint includes alleged cases of 'severe sexual abuse and rape, solicitation of sex acts, solicitation of nude photos, entreaties for sexually inappropriate relationships, sexual comments and gestures.' The department decided to drop the lawsuit after the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services stopped the placement of unaccompanied migrant children in shelters operated by Southwest Key and initiated a review of its grants with the organization, the department said in a press release on Wednesday. The department said it has moved all children in Southwest Key shelters to other shelters. 'For too long, pernicious actors have exploited such children both before and after they enter the United States,' HHS Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. said in the release. 'Today’s action is a significant step toward ending this appalling abuse of innocents.' While Southwest Key did not immediately respond to a request for comment, it had previously sought to have the case dismissed and denied the allegations of sexual assault of children. 'Southwest Key takes pride in its record of providing safe shelter care, and it vehemently denies the allegations that there is any ‘pattern or practice’ of sexual abuse, harassment or misconduct at its facilities, or that it ‘failed to take reasonable, appropriate, and sufficient action to prevent, detect, and respond to sexual abuse and harassment of the children entrusted to its care,’' it wrote in a court filing last year. The plans to dismiss the case were first reported by Bloomberg. In that story, the news outlet reported that an attorney for Southwest Key had reached out to the Justice Department and asked it to dismiss the matter, saying the case could hinder the crackdown on illegal immigration by President Donald Trump’s administration. The reversal by the Justice Department comes at a time when Attorney General Pam Bondi has made combatting illegal immigration take priority over other initiatives that were pursued during President Joe Biden’s administration.	https://www.voanews.com/a/us-drops-lawsuit-against-shelter-provider-accused-of-sexual-abuse-of-migrant-children/8008470.html	2025-03-12T12:12:44-07:00	
US sanctions Sweden-based gang with links to Iran	WASHINGTON — The United States on Wednesday announced sanctions against the Foxtrot Network, a Sweden-based gang accused of carrying out attacks against Israeli interests in Europe on behalf of Iran. Describing Foxtrot as one of Sweden's 'most notorious criminal gangs,' the U.S. Treasury and State Departments also placed sanctions on its leader Rawa Majid, with both agencies saying in statements that he had 'specifically cooperated with the Iranian Ministry of Intelligence and Security.' 'Iran's brazen use of transnational criminal organizations and narcotics traffickers underscores the regime's attempts to achieve its aims through any means, with no regard for the cost to communities across Europe,' Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent said. The sanctions, which usually include asset freezes and U.S. entry bans, were issued in line with President Donald Trump's reinstated 'maximum pressure' campaign against Iran, the agencies said. Sweden's Sapo intelligence service announced last May that it believed Iran had recruited Swedish criminal gang members as proxies to commit 'acts of violence' against Israeli and other interests in Sweden. That announcement came weeks after nighttime gunfire was reported outside Israel's embassy in Stockholm, and three months after police found a live grenade lying on the grounds of the Israeli compound. At the time, Swedish newspaper Dagens Nyheter reported that both Majid's Foxtrot and arch-rival gang Rumba had been recruited by the Iranian regime, citing documents from Israel's intelligence agency Mossad. DN said the Mossad documents showed Majid — a Swedish-Turkish dual national nicknamed the 'Kurdish Fox' — had been arrested in Iran and ordered to cooperate with the Iranian regime or go to jail. Later, in October, the embassy was hit by gunfire, while the day after two explosions occurred near the Israeli embassy in Copenhagen. Swedish nationals have been arrested over the suspected grenade attack, according to Danish police. The attacks in Europe last year occurred as tensions soared between Iran and Israel over the devastating war in Gaza. But Sweden has struggled to contain surging gang violence in recent years, with shootings and bombings frequently occurring across the country.	https://www.voanews.com/a/us-sanctions-sweden-based-gang-accused-of-attacking-for-iran/8008420.html	2025-03-12T12:06:49-07:00	
US lawmakers welcome Ukraine's agreement to 30-day ceasefire	U.S. lawmakers welcomed Tuesday’s announcement that Ukraine had agreed to a 30-day ceasefire as a step toward peace in Europe. 'I'm very encouraged the parties have reached an agreement. I think the president now has decided to lift the freeze on intelligence and weapons — very significant,' Republican Representative Michael McCaul, former chairman of the House Foreign Affairs Committee, told VOA. The United States announced last week that it would cease military aid and intelligence sharing with Ukraine, following the Oval Office clash between U.S. President Donald Trump and Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy on Feb. 28. Following the announcement of the ceasefire agreement, the United States said Tuesday that it would resume cooperation with Ukraine. 'That actually should never have happened in the first place. That never should have been a pause that has real life consequences for Ukrainians who are fighting for their freedom and for democracy and for national security. So it's positive that that was lifted by the administration,' Democratic Representative Jason Crow told VOA. The United States and Ukraine were supposed to sign a minerals deal, although that was called off after the two leaders publicly disagreed over U.S. aid to Ukraine. 'The next step will be for President Zelenskyy to come hopefully back to the Oval Office to sign the economic cooperation agreement. Then everything is going to turn to Mr. Putin,' McCaul said, referring to Russian President Vladimir Putin. Russia has not agreed to the ceasefire, but Trump said Tuesday that he had representatives on their way to Moscow for discussions. 'I'm hoping the Trump administration will start reaching out to Putin and Russia, bring them to the table and make sure they make some concessions that are reasonable and beneficial to the Ukrainian people,' Democratic Representative Glenn Ivey told VOA. But Steven Pifer, a Brookings Institution senior fellow and former diplomat, told VOA there was still a great deal of uncertainty. 'Russia, unfortunately, does not have a good record of living up to ceasefires,' Pifer said. 'We saw what happened between 2014 and 2021 in Donbas, but this is going to be the challenge now, and if the Russians cannot abide by the ceasefire, I think that will be a signal to Washington that the Russians are not serious about finding a solution to this war.' Trump and Zelenskyy also publicly disagreed about who was responsible for starting the three-year conflict between Russia and Ukraine. 'We have to understand that Vladimir Putin is the aggressor. He's the one who started this war. He's the one who can end it by withdrawing his troops. So we're going to see whether this administration can force him to the table on terms that are favorable to the United States and Ukraine,' Crow told VOA. Secretary of State Marco Rubio led more than eight hours of peace talks with Ukrainian officials in Jeddah, Saudi Arabia, to reach the agreement. Republican lawmakers praised Trump and his Cabinet for their strong negotiating stance. 'For three years now, there’s been too much killing and too much destruction in Ukraine and in Russia. So this is a very, very positive thing, and I'm very proud of Secretary Rubio, also Mike Waltz, national security adviser,' Republican Representative Derrick Van Orden, told VOA. Lawmakers also expressed hope that economic cooperation between the United States and Ukraine could resume. 'President Trump is right, and President Trump's proposal to enhance and deepen U.S. investment in Ukraine and critical minerals, oil, natural gas will strengthen deterrence against Russian aggression,' Republican Representative Andy Barr told VOA. Pifer noted the ceasefire deal 'also has language where it talks about continuing to work between Washington and Kyiv on Ukraine's long-term security. I think that's important, because I think one of the key demands, as I understand from Ukraine, is that there has to be some guarantee for Ukraine security so this war does not resume at some point in the future.' Kateryna Lisunova and Iryna Shynkarenko contributed to this report.	https://www.voanews.com/a/us-lawmakers-welcome-ukraine-s-agreement-to-30-day-ceasefire/8008456.html	2025-03-12T11:49:57-07:00	
US clears out remaining migrants from Guantanamo Bay	PENTAGON — The United States has cleared out the last migrants being held at its naval base at Guantanamo Bay, Cuba, sending them back to the U.S. mainland as they await deportation. Two U.S. defense officials told VOA on Wednesday that 40 detainees, including 23 'high-threat illegal aliens' incarcerated at the base’s detention center, were flown to Louisiana on Tuesday. The officials, speaking on the condition of anonymity to discuss the operation, said the detainees were flown aboard a nonmilitary aircraft at the direction of officials with Immigration and Customs Enforcement. Neither ICE nor its parent agency, the Department of Homeland Security, have responded to requests for comment. Last week, in response to a request for updates on the detainees being held at Guantanamo, an ICE spokesperson declined comment 'due to pending litigation.' ICE and DHS, which has been spearheading the U.S. deportation efforts under President Donald Trump, have repeatedly declined to respond to questions about the identities of the detainees, their countries of origin or the crimes with which they are charged. U.S. Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem said on social media that many of the 'high-threat illegal aliens' sent to Guantanamo are members of the Venezuelan street gang Tren de Aragua and have confessed to or been charged with murder, attempted murder, assault, weapons trafficking and drug crimes. The Trump administration announced plans to use the U.S. naval base at Guantanamo Bay to hold migrants slated for deportation in late January. At the time, Noem told reporters that the facilities would be used to house 'the worst of the worst.' Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth, also speaking in late January, called the detention center at Guantanamo Bay 'the prefect place' to hold criminals slated for removal, but also said the base’s migrant operations center, first built in the 1990s, would also be opened for nonviolent migrants awaiting deportation. The first detainees began arriving at Guantanamo Bay in February aboard U.S. military cargo jets, some staying for days or weeks before being deported. At times, the base held nearly 200 detainees between its prison and migrant facilities. Last month, ICE at one point deported 177 detainees from Guantanamo Bay to Honduras, from which they were to be taken to Venezuela for repatriation, before bringing in more detainees. Immigration rights groups, including the American Civil Liberties Union, have filed multiple lawsuits against the U.S. government over its use of Guantanamo Bay. One suit, filed earlier this month, seeks to stop U.S. officials from transferring migrants to the base, alleging the moves violate U.S. law. An earlier lawsuit filed in February alleged the U.S. government had prevented family members and lawyers from contacting the detainees. DHS has dismissed the allegations in the lawsuits. 'The American Civil Liberties Union appears far more interested in promoting open borders and disrupting public safety missions than in protecting the civil liberties of Americans — they should consider changing their name,' a DHS spokesperson told VOA in a statement earlier this month. 'In the meantime, we will continue working with DOJ (Department of Justice) to fend off these baseless legal challenges.'	https://www.voanews.com/a/us-clears-out-remaining-migrants-from-guantanamo-bay/8008349.html	2025-03-12T11:13:51-07:00	
Iran's Khamenei rejects idea of nuclear talks with US	DUBAI — Iran's Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei on Wednesday rejected the idea of holding negotiations with the United States over a nuclear deal, as a letter arrived from U.S. President Donald Trump calling for such talks. Trump said last week he had sent a letter to Khamenei proposing nuclear talks but also warning that 'there are two ways Iran can be handled: militarily, or you make a deal' preventing Tehran from acquiring nuclear weapons. The letter was handed over to Iranian Foreign Minister Abbas Araqchi on Wednesday by Anwar Gargash, diplomatic adviser to the president of the United Arab Emirates. While Araqchi and Gargash were meeting, Khamenei told a group of university students that Trump's offer for talks was 'a deception aimed at misleading public opinion,' state media reported. 'When we know they won't honor it, what's the point of negotiating? Therefore, the invitation to negotiate ... is a deception of public opinion,' Khamenei was quoted as saying by state media. Khamenei said negotiating with the Trump administration, which he said has excessive demands, 'will tighten the knot of sanctions and increase pressure on Iran.' In 2018, Trump withdrew the United States from Tehran's 2015 nuclear deal with world powers and reimposed sanctions that have crippled Iran's economy. Tehran reacted a year later by violating the deal's nuclear curbs. Khamenei, who has the final word in Iranian state matters, said last week that Tehran would not be bullied into talks with 'excessive demands' and threats. The UAE, one of Washington's key Middle East security partners and host to U.S. troops, also maintains warm ties with Tehran. Despite past tensions, business and trade links between the two countries have remained strong, and Dubai has served as a key commercial hub for Iran for more than a century. While leaving the door open for a nuclear pact with Tehran, Trump has reinstated the 'maximum pressure' campaign he applied in his first term as president to isolate Iran from the global economy and drive its oil exports towards zero. Iran has long denied wanting to develop a nuclear weapon. 'If we wanted to build nuclear weapons, the U.S. would not be able to stop it. We ourselves do not want it,' Khamenei said. However, Iran's stock of uranium enriched to up to 60% purity, close to the roughly 90% weapons-grade level, has jumped, the International Atomic Energy Agency said late last month. Separately, Araqchi denounced a closed-door U.N. Security Council meeting on Wednesday about Iran's nuclear work as a new process that puts in doubt the goodwill of the states requesting it. Six of the council's 15 members — France, Greece, Panama, South Korea, Britain and the U.S. — requested the meeting over Iran's expansion of its stock of close to weapons-grade uranium. Araqchi said Iran would soon have a fifth round of talks with France, Britain and Germany — parties to Iran's 2015 nuclear pact. 'Our talks with Europeans have been ongoing and will continue ... however, any decision by the U.N. Security Council or board of governors of the U.N. nuclear watchdog to pressure us will put under question the legitimacy of these talks,' Araqchi said according to state media. Separately, the Chinese foreign ministry said China and Russia will hold talks with Iranian officials in Beijing on Friday to discuss the Iranian nuclear issue.	https://www.voanews.com/a/iran-s-khamenei-rejects-idea-of-nuclear-talks-with-us/8008333.html	2025-03-12T11:05:45-07:00	
Philippine ex-president Duterte faces charges linked to ‘war on drugs’	THE HAGUE — A jet that took former Philippine President Rodrigo Duterte from Manila landed Wednesday in the Netherlands a day after he was arrested on an International Criminal Court warrant accusing him of crimes against humanity over deadly anti-drugs crackdowns he oversaw while in office. Rights groups and families of victims hailed Duterte's arrest. Within days, he will face an initial appearance at which the court will confirm his identity, check that he understands the charges against him and set a date for a hearing to assess if prosecutors have sufficient evidence to send him to a full trial. If his case goes to trial and he is convicted, the 79-year-old Duterte could face a maximum sentence of life imprisonment. The small jet taxied into a hangar where two buses were waiting. An ambulance also drove close to the hangar, and medics wheeled a gurney from the ambulance into the hangar. The court did not immediately confirm that Duterte was aboard the arriving plane, which made a stopover in Dubai during its flight from Manila, or that the former president was in court custody. Duterte's arrest was announced Tuesday by Philippine President Ferdinand Marcos, who said that the former leader was arrested when he returned from a trip to Hong Kong and that he was sent aboard a plane to the ICC. 'This is a monumental and long-overdue step for justice for thousands of victims and their families,' said Jerrie Abella of Amnesty International. 'It is therefore a hopeful sign for them, as well, in the Philippines and beyond, as it shows that suspected perpetrators of the worst crimes, including government leaders, will face justice wherever they are in the world.' Emily Soriano, the mother of a victim of the crackdowns, said she wanted more officials to face justice. 'Duterte is lucky he has due process, but our children who were killed did not have due process,' she said. Duterte's supporters, however, criticized his arrest as illegal and sought to have him returned home. Small groups of Duterte supporters and people who backed his arrest demonstrated on Wednesday outside the court before his arrival. The ICC opened an inquiry in 2021 into mass killings linked to the so-called war on drugs overseen by Duterte when he served as mayor of the southern Philippine city of Davao and later as president. Estimates of the death toll during Duterte's presidential term vary, from the more than 6,000 that the national police have reported and up to 30,000 claimed by human rights groups. ICC judges who looked at prosecution evidence supporting their request for his arrest found 'reasonable grounds to believe that Mr. Duterte is individually responsible for the crime against humanity of murder' as an 'indirect co-perpetrator for having allegedly overseen the killings when he was mayor of Davao and later president of the Philippines,' according to his warrant. Duterte could challenge the court's jurisdiction and the admissibility of the case. While the Philippines is no longer a member of the ICC, the alleged crimes happened before Manila withdrew from the court. That process will likely take months. If the case progresses to trial, it could take years. Duterte will be able to apply for provisional release from the court's detention center while he waits, although it's up to judges to decide whether to grant such a request. Duterte's legal counsel, Salvador Panelo, told reporters in Manila that the Philippine Supreme Court 'can compel the government to bring back the person arrested and detained without probable cause and compel the government to bring him before the court and to explain to them why they [government] did what they did.' Marcos said Tuesday that Duterte's arrest was 'proper and correct' and not an act of political persecution. Duterte's daughter, Vice President Sara Duterte, criticized the Marcos administration for surrendering her father to a foreign court, which she said currently has no jurisdiction in the Philippines. She left the Philippines on Wednesday to arrange a meeting in The Hague with her detained father and talk to his lawyers, her office told reporters in Manila. Duterte withdrew the Philippines in 2019 from the ICC, in a move human rights activists say was aimed at escaping accountability. The Duterte administration moved to suspend the global court's investigation in late 2021 by saying that Philippine authorities were already looking into the same allegations and arguing that the ICC — a court of last resort — therefore didn't have jurisdiction. Appeals judges at the ICC rejected those arguments and ruled in 2023 that the investigation could resume. The ICC judges who issued the warrant also said that the alleged crimes fall within the court's jurisdiction. They said Duterte's arrest was necessary because of what they called the 'risk of interference with the investigations and the security of witnesses and victims.'	https://www.voanews.com/a/philippine-ex-president-duterte-faces-charges-linked-to-war-on-drugs-/8008270.html	2025-03-12T10:14:01-07:00

Court rejects Russian oligarch’s challenge to US efforts to confiscate yacht	A federal court in New York has rejected a Russian businessman’s challenge to the U.S. government's efforts to confiscate a luxury superyacht that allegedly belongs to sanctioned Russian oligarch Suleyman Kerimov. The decision brings the United States closer to taking ownership of the yacht — known as Amadea — through a legal procedure known as civil forfeiture. The ruling likely represents the biggest victory so far in plans started under former President Joe Biden’s administration to seize assets of sanctioned Russian tycoons and use them to support Ukraine’s war effort. On March 10, the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York ruled that Russian businessman Eduard Khudainatov did not have standing to challenge forfeiture of the yacht because he was not its owner. And because no one else has claimed ownership, the U.S. Department of Justice will now pursue a judgment of forfeiture by default. Khudainatov’s legal team plans to appeal the decision. 'The ruling is both legally and factually flawed, and we are confident it will not withstand appellate review,' Adam Ford, a lawyer representing Khudainatov and his company, said in a statement. The DOJ declined to comment on the ruling. U.S. prosecutors believe the 106-meter elite superyacht that is valued at over $230 million belongs to Kerimov, a senator, businessman and ally of Russian President Vladimir Putin. The court also concluded in legal documents that the evidence suggests that after September 2021, Kerimov or his family exercised ownership of the vessel. In 2018, the U.S. government imposed sanctions on Kerimov. The government later alleged he or people acting on his behalf made payments for repairs and upkeep of the yacht that passed through the U.S financial system — a violation of those sanctions. U.S. law enforcement seized the Amadea in 2022. But the following year, Khudainatov, who is not under U.S. sanctions, claimed ownership interest, setting the stage for a legal battle that continues today. The outcome of the case will be important not only for the true owner and Ukraine but also for American citizens. As VOA reported in May 2024, U.S. taxpayers have spent more than $740,000 a month on the yacht’s maintenance. Last December, The Washington Post reported that servicing the yacht had cost the country roughly $30 million. The court previously denied the DOJ permission to sell the yacht and convert it into cash, a move that would save the government money. Battle for Amadea In May 2022, a few months after Russia launched its full-scale invasion of Ukraine, the island nation of Fiji seized the Amadea at the United States’ request. It was later transferred to U.S. law enforcement. The seizure appeared to be a major victory for Task Force KleptoCapture, a DOJ unit established by the Biden administration to enforce sanctions on Russian oligarchs. But that victory turned out to be elusive. Civil forfeiture allows law enforcement to seize assets — frequently drugs, cash, automobiles and houses — that have been used in or resulted from the commission of a crime. The legal procedure’s main advantage is that it does not require a criminal or civil judgment against the property’s owner. But in the case of the Amadea, if Khudainatov is the yacht’s owner, then financial transactions made through the U.S. to service the yacht do not violate the sanctions order. The DOJ considers Khudainatov a 'straw owner' and alleges that he is the beneficiary owner of at least eight yachts and yacht projects — a fleet worth over $1 billion. Prosecutors say that stretches far beyond his financial means, and that the yachts belong to other people. For example, the DOJ claims that Igor Sechin, the sanctioned CEO of Russian state-controlled oil company Rosneft, owns one of them. Journalists have tied the Scheherazade, another superyacht from this fleet, to Putin. In May 2022, it was seized in Italy. But proving that the Amadea belongs to Kerimov has been a challenge for the DOJ. Prosecutors alleged that the yacht’s ownership was hidden behind several companies. They asserted that documents and testimony discovered during the DOJ's investigation confirmed it was controlled by Kerimov. Khudainatov’s legal team argued that U.S. law enforcement conducted a hasty, partial investigation before seizing the yacht. They alleged that the DOJ also pressured yacht personnel and witnesses to provide the testimony it wanted and selectively presented evidence to support its version of the story. Among the evidence that Khudainatov’s legal team submitted is a sworn statement by Kerimov’s daughter Gulnara, claiming to have chartered the Amadea for a trip in early 2022 with her children, brothers and sisters, and their nannies and bodyguards. But she stated that her parents were not present on the yacht, and that she never owned it. The U.S. government 'resorted to desperate, strong-arm tactics to get the statements that fit their false narrative,' lawyer Ford said in a statement last month. 'The government simply fabricated the allegations that Kerimov purchased the Amadea. It is owned by Mr. Khudainatov and always has been.' Next steps Stefan Cassella, a former federal prosecutor and expert on civil forfeiture, does not expect the case to be over anytime soon. A month before the ruling on Khudainatov’s status, he told VOA that the standard strategy for resisting forfeiture typically consists of dragging out the proceedings for as long as possible to increase the costs for the government. Cassella expected Khudainatov to appeal any ruling, a process he thought would take at least a year. 'Civil forfeiture is often mistaken to be a streamlined process,' Cassella said. 'It is not. It is saturated with due process — and it should be.' Additionally, DOJ priorities have changed since the start of the case. On Feb. 5, Pam Bondi took office as the new U.S. attorney general. That same day, she sent a memorandum stating that the DOJ’s new priority would be the 'total elimination' of drug cartels and transnational criminal organizations. In the same document, she announced the dissolution of the KleptoCapture task force, the anti-kleptocracy team and the kleptocracy asset recovery initiative.	https://www.voanews.com/a/us-court-rejects-russian-oligarch-s-attempt-to-claim-yacht/8008203.html	2025-03-12T09:29:51-07:00

Somali forces kill 50 militants in airstrikes after ending hotel siege	WASHINGTON — Security forces in Somalia say they killed all six attackers who laid siege to a hotel in the central town of Beledweyne and later killed at least 50 al-Shabab militants in airstrikes. Speaking to reporters, Beledweyne District Commissioner Omar Osman Alasow confirmed that the hotel siege ended early Wednesday. 'Our security forces successfully got rid of six militants who attacked a hotel where traditional elders and security officials were meeting,' he said. Al-Shabab, a U.S.-designated terrorist group, claimed responsibility for the hotel attack on Tuesday. Alasow said the government soldiers backed by African Union troops worked through the night to rescue elders, military officers and civilians trapped inside the hotel. 'During 18 hours of siege, our brave soldiers shot dead two militants, and four of them desperately blew themselves up when they realized that they could not escape,' he said. 'Seven other people, including government security officials and two prominent traditional elders, were killed.' Since August 2022, when Somalian President Hassan Sheikh Mohamud called for a 'total war' against al-Shabab, Beledweyne, a town near Somalia’s border with Ethiopia in Hirshabelle state, about 300 kilometers north of Mogadishu, has been the center of a local community mobilization against al-Shabab. The city has suffered more terrorist attacks than any other in Somalia except Mogadishu. Since 2009, hundreds of people have been killed in suicide attacks and car bombs on hotels, restaurants and government bases. The single biggest attack, in 2009, killed at least 25 people and injured 60 others. Airstrikes kill 50 militants Hours after ending this week’s hotel siege, Somalia’s National Intelligence and Security Agency, or NISA, said the country’s security forces killed dozens of al-Shabab members elsewhere in Hirshabelle. 'Coordinated airstrikes by the Somali army and international partners in the Middle Shabelle region have killed at least 50 al-Shabab militants, including senior leader in charge of the coordination of the group’s combat vehicles,' the NISA statement said. NISA said the airstrikes targeted the Damasha and Shabeelow areas and killed Mansoor Tima-Weeyne, a senior al-Shabab leader who masterminded the preparation and use of combat vehicles for terrorist attacks. In a separate statement, the Somali Military Command said, 'The operation was a significant blow to the group's combat capabilities and part of ongoing efforts to weaken terrorism in the region.' Media outlets closed On another counterterrorism front, NISA said Wednesday that it closed 12 media outlets and websites linked to the Khawarij, a derogatory term referring to al-Shabab that loosely translates as 'those who deviate from the Islamic faith.' This latest announcement followed another crackdown on over 30 al-Shabab-related websites. 'The operation targeted platforms spreading extremist ideologies, inciting violence, and disseminating false information. During the operation the government seized critical data and identified individuals involved,' said a statement posted by the government’s National News Agency.	https://www.voanews.com/a/somali-forces-kill-50-militants-in-airstrikes-after-ending-hotel-siege/8008152.html	2025-03-12T08:42:56-07:00	
‘I was there to try to kill the journalist,’ gunman tells New York court	A self-described member of a Russian organized crime group told a court on Tuesday that he tried to kill the Iranian American journalist and VOA host Masih Alinejad in New York in 2022. Khalid Mehdiyev told jurors that he was arrested in July 2022 in his car in Brooklyn while in possession of an AK-47 rifle and a ski mask. The 27-year-old made the admission in testimony at a trial in New York of his associates Rafat Amirov and Polad Omarov, who are facing murder-for-hire and conspiracy charges. The Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps of Iran was allegedly behind the plot, according to prosecutors. Amirov and Omarov, both from Azerbaijan, have pleaded not guilty. If convicted, they face decades in prison. Media advocates say the case highlights how far the Iranian government will go to silence its critics. Iran’s Foreign Ministry did not immediately reply to VOA’s email requesting comment. Prosecutors say Amirov, 45, and Omarov, 40, hired Mehdiyev to kill Alinejad, a vocal critic of Tehran’s human rights abuses. She left Iran in 2009 and now lives in New York, where she is a host with Voice of America’s Persian Service. During opening statements on Tuesday, federal prosecutor Jacob Gutwillig said Tehran offered to pay Amirov and Omarov $500,000 to plan Alinejad’s murder. 'The defendants were hired guns for the government of Iran,' Gutwillig said. 'Masih Alinejad was almost gunned down on the streets of New York City by a hitman sent by the defendants.' In his testimony Tuesday, Mehdiyev said he observed Alinejad during a seven-day stakeout outside her home. He tracked when she watered her flowers and where and when she bought coffee, he said. 'I was there to try to kill the journalist. I know her as Masih,' Mehdiyev told jurors. Mehdiyev, who is Azerbaijani, said he is cooperating with prosecutors after pleading guilty to attempted murder and illegal possession of a firearm. He faces at least 15 years in prison. Prosecutors told the court they would present 'substantial electronic communications' documenting the plan found on Omarov’s accounts and devices. Amirov’s lawyer, Michael Martin, said the evidence was circumstantial, while Omarov’s lawyer, Michael Perkins, said the evidence would not show that his client planned to kill Alinejad. Alinejad, 48, told VOA she could not comment while the trial is ongoing. In a Tuesday afternoon post on X, Alinejad said that while Mehdiyev was testifying, she was 'overwhelmed with mixed emotions.' 'As a witness, I’m not allowed in the courtroom, so I’m sitting outside, reliving the moment when that man stood with a loaded gun in front of my home,' Alinejad wrote in the post. Alinejad is scheduled to testify later in the trial, Gutwillig said. 'Masih Alinejad inspires others in Iran and around the world to do the same thing. That is why they want to kill her. And you will hear all of that from Ms. Alinejad herself,' he told the court. Alinejad has been targeted over her work for years. In 2018, Iranian officials allegedly offered to pay Alinejad’s relatives in Iran to invite her to Turkey, with the apparent goal of then bringing her to Iran for imprisonment, according to court documents. The relatives refused. Then, in 2021, Iranian operatives were accused of planning to kidnap Alinejad. An indictment described a plan to bring her from New York to Venezuela, which has close ties with Iran. Tehran has previously called the abduction allegations 'baseless.' Iran ranks among the worst countries in the world in terms of press freedom, according to rights groups. The country is also among the top perpetrators of transnational repression.	https://www.voanews.com/a/i-was-there-to-try-to-kill-the-journalist-gunman-tells-new-york-court/8008126.html	2025-03-12T08:25:56-07:00	
UN chief initiates organizational review amid growing funding cuts	UNITED NATIONS — U.N. Secretary-General Antonio Guterres said Wednesday that he is launching a robust review of the world body to improve its efficiency and cut costs as it faces a worsening liquidity crisis. 'Resources are shrinking across the board — and they have been for a long time,' he told reporters. He said the initiative — called UN80 and pegged to the organization’s 80th anniversary this year — seeks to expand and intensify reforms he has introduced since taking office in 2017, to make the world body more effective and cost-efficient. The U.N. chief did not give details on how much money his proposals could save or how many jobs it might cost, but said he plans to move quickly in areas where he has the authority and will send proposals to the 193 member states to review on decisions that are up to them. The effort will be led by a 14-person internal task force, which Guterres made clear will not be a U.N. version of DOGE — the Elon Musk-run Department of Government Efficiency that has slashed the jobs of thousands of federal workers in the United States. 'We are talking about completely different processes, methodologies and objectives,' he said. 'This is a continuation and an intensification of a work that we have always been doing.' Since taking office seven weeks ago, the Trump administration has substantially reduced its voluntary contributions to U.N. funds, agencies and programs through its near-elimination of foreign aid programs and the initiation of the year-long withdrawal process from the World Health Organization, raising financial anxieties at the United Nations. Washington is the world body’s top donor. But Guterres noted that since he took office seven years ago, the U.N. has faced a growing cash crisis for many reasons, including because many countries do not pay their mandatory dues in full or on time. The secretary-general said his main concern is for the vulnerable people who will be cut off from help as a result of the cost cuts. 'Budgets at the United Nations are not just numbers on a balance sheet — they are a matter of life and death for millions around the world,' he said. The U.N. secretariat is a big bureaucracy, having around 9,000 staffers. Funds, agencies and programs have thousands more. The organization’s regular budget for 2024-2025 was about $6 billion, but billions more are poured into the agencies, funds and programs. Guterres acknowledged that 'thousands' of U.N. agency staffers have already been laid off as a result of shrinking contributions not just from Washington, but also by other countries. The new task force will be looking to cut redundant programs and people. One way, Guterres said, he will save money is by moving services from high-cost countries where the U.N. has large offices — New York, Geneva, Vienna — to less expensive locations, including its hub in Kenya’s capital. 'We have been investing in Nairobi, creating the conditions for Nairobi to receive services that are now in more expensive locations,' he said. 'And UNICEF will be transferring soon some of the functions to Nairobi, and UNFPA will be essentially moving to Nairobi.' UNICEF is the U.N. children’s fund and UNFPA is the U.N. Population Fund, which deals with women’s health and reproductive issues.	https://www.voanews.com/a/un-chief-initiates-organizational-review-amid-growing-funding-cuts/8008136.html	2025-03-12T08:24:58-07:00	
India, Mauritius upgrade strategic ties with eye on China	NEW DELHI — India and Mauritius have upgraded their ties, say leaders of both countries — a move analysts say is aimed at increasing New Delhi’s influence in the Indian Ocean as it seeks to counter China’s expanding footprint in the region. The announcement of upgraded ties came during a two-day visit by Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi to Mauritius, an island nation that sits along vital seaways in the western Indian Ocean. Modi, who was chief guest at Mauritius’s National Day celebrations on Wednesday, said that the countries had elevated ties to the status of 'enhanced strategic partnership.' Following talks with Mauritius Prime Minister Navinchandra Ramgoolam, both leaders also reaffirmed their commitment to a 'free, safe, secure and open Indian Ocean.' Mauritius conferred the country’s highest civilian honor on Modi, and the prime ministers signed eight pacts to boost cooperation in several sectors including maritime security. Modi announced that New Delhi would invest about $11 million in several community development projects and that India will cooperate in building a new parliament for Mauritius, calling it a gift 'from the mother of democracy.' China trade with Mauritius on rise While India has long enjoyed good relations with Mauritius, where 70% of the population is of Indian origin, analysts said Modi’s visit came amid a recognition that India needs to step up its engagement with a country that is called the gateway to the Western Indian Ocean and Africa, and where Beijing’s presence has grown. 'China’s rise in the island has been quite phenomenal and it is now one of the most important economic players in Mauritius,' according to Harsh Pant, the vice president of studies at the Observer Research Foundation in New Delhi. 'So, to offset that, it is necessary for India to have constant engagement with Mauritius and help them build capacities in areas such as health, education, and maritime capabilities to demonstrate that it can assist in meeting such challenges.' In 2019, China signed a free trade agreement with Mauritius that went into effect in 2021. A page for Mauritius on China’s Foreign Ministry website that outlines relations states that the two have a strategic partnership. Bilateral trade between the two countries hit $1.1 billion, a 10.1% increase from the previous year, according to the website. As the region becomes a hotspot for geopolitical competition, India and China have stepped up efforts to build ties with Indian Ocean countries. Underlining India’s naval cooperation with Mauritius, an Indian navy contingent participated in the National Day parade and an Indian warship — the INS Imphal, a stealth guided-missile destroyer — paid a visit to the capital, Port Louis. Last year, India helped Mauritius build an airstrip and a jetty in Agalega — two tiny islands covering 25 square kilometers that are located north of the main island. Although Mauritius has said that the facilities are not for military use, they give India a foothold to monitor traffic in the western Indian Ocean, say analysts. 'India’s construction of logistics infrastructure on Agalega Island underlines both Mauritius’s enduring geopolitical significance in the Indian Ocean and Delhi’s growing maritime stakes in regional security,' political analyst C. Raja Mohan wrote in the Indian Express newspaper. India backs Chagos handover Indian officials have also said that New Delhi would support a planned deal between Britain and Mauritius to hand over control of the Chagos Islands to Mauritius that is being finalized. One of the islands on the archipelago, Diego Garcia, has been home to a joint U.K.-U.S. military base since the 1970s. British media have reported that Britain will cede sovereignty of the Chagos Islands and lease back Diego Garcia from Mauritius to allow the military base to remain. 'We support Mauritius in its stance on its sovereignty over Chagos, and this is obviously in keeping with our long-standing position with regard to decolonization and support for sovereignty and territorial integrity of other countries,' Indian foreign secretary Vikram Misri said Saturday while announcing plans that Modi will soon also visit the Maldives. Although officials have made no comment, analysts point out that India backs the continuation of the military base in Diego Garcia. Last month, U.S. President Donald Trump said he was 'inclined' to go along with the deal between Mauritius and Britain over the future of the base. 'From New Delhi’s standpoint, it helps if there is some American presence there because it balances out the strategic realities of the region,' said Pant.	https://www.voanews.com/a/india-mauritius-upgrade-strategic-ties-with-eye-on-china/8008079.html	2025-03-12T07:44:32-07:00	
Democratic senator will not seek reelection in New Hampshire	Senator Jeanne Shaheen, a Democrat from the U.S. state of New Hampshire, will not seek reelection next year, a decision that will end the longtime senator's historic political career and deals a significant blow to Democrats who were already facing a difficult path to reclaiming the Senate majority. Shaheen was the first woman elected to serve as both governor and senator in the United States. She turned 78 in January. A spokesperson confirmed her decision through email. Even before Shaheen's move, Democrats were facing a challenging political map in next year's midterm elections — especially in the Senate, where Republicans now hold 53 Senate seats compared with the Democrats' 47, including two independents who caucus with Democrats. The party that controls the Senate majority also controls President Donald Trump's most important political and judicial nominations — and his legislative agenda. At least for now, Maine represents the Democrats' best pickup opportunity in 2026. Senator Susan Collins, the sole Republican senator remaining in New England, is the only Republican serving in a state Trump lost who's up for reelection. But with a four-seat advantage in Congress' upper chamber already, Republicans have legitimate pickup opportunities in Georgia, Michigan and now New Hampshire. Shaheen has been a political force in New Hampshire for decades and climbed through the ranks of Senate leadership to serve as the top Democrat on the powerful Senate Foreign Relations Committee. She likely would have been easily reelected had she sought another term. Former Massachusetts Senator Scott Brown, who served as ambassador to New Zealand in the first Trump administration, was considering a New Hampshire Senate bid even before Shaheen's announcement. Brown challenged Shaheen unsuccessfully in 2014. New Hampshire has narrowly favored Democrats in recent presidential elections, but the state has a long history of electing leaders from both parties. Republican Governor Kelly Ayotte was elected last fall, when Trump lost the state by less than 3 percentage points. Shaheen became the first woman elected New Hampshire governor, in 1996. She served for three terms and was later elected to the Senate in 2008.	https://www.voanews.com/a/democratic-senator-will-not-seek-reelection-in-new-hampshire/8008040.html	2025-03-12T07:26:12-07:00	
Bosnian prosecutors order arrest of Bosnian Serb leader Dodik	SARAJEVO — Bosnian state prosecutors on Wednesday ordered the arrest of Russian-backed Bosnian Serb leader Milorad Dodik and his aides for ignoring a court summons, raising the stakes in a standoff that threatens the Balkan country's stability. The decision was taken two weeks after a separate case in which Dodik was sentenced to a year in jail for defying the rulings of an international peace envoy, a spokesperson from the state security agency, SIPA, said. Prosecutors have sought the help of Bosnia's State Investigation and Protection Agency (SIPA) in the arrest, which comes after Dodik and aides ignored a court summons. It was not clear if the plan was to detain Dodik or to accompany him to answer the summons. The state prosecutors' office was investigating Dodik, the pro-Russian nationalist president of Bosnia's autonomous Serb Republic, for what it described as an attack on constitutional order after he initiated the adoption of laws barring state judiciary and police from the region after his sentencing. 'We have received a request from the court police of Bosnia and Herzegovina to assist them,' SIPA spokeswoman Jelena Miovcic said. Serb Republic television, citing the regional government, reported that the state prosecution has also ordered the arrest of Serb Republic Prime Minister Radovan Viskovic and regional parliament president Nenad Stevandic over ignoring summons in the case of the attack on constitutional order. The Serb Republic is one of two regions created to end a 1992-95 war that killed more than 1000,000 people in multi-ethnic Bosnia. They are linked by a weak central government in a state supervised by an international authority to stop it slipping back into conflict.	https://www.voanews.com/a/bosnian-prosecutors-order-arrest-of-bosnian-serb-leader-dodik-/8007854.html	2025-03-12T04:45:25-07:00	
Georgian ex-president Saakashvili gets nine more years in jail on fraud charge	TBILISI — Former Georgian president Mikheil Saakashvili, who has been imprisoned since 2021, was sentenced on Wednesday to nine more years in jail after being found guilty of embezzlement. Saakashvili, in office from 2004 to 2013, had been convicted of embezzling $3.3 million via expenses claims for what prosecutors called 'luxury' spending. In a post on X after the sentencing, Saakashvili, who denies the charges and says the expenses were legitimate, called the verdict an 'outrageous case of political persecution.' Saakashvili was already serving a six-year sentence for abuse of power, having been jailed after returning to Georgia in 2021. He has spent much of that time in a prison hospital. The sentences will run concurrently, so Wednesday's ruling will keep him in jail until 2030. He is also on trial for entering Georgia illegally in 2021 and, separately, for a crackdown on protesters in 2007. Georgian television showed a commotion in court after the verdict was announced, with Saakashvili's supporters calling the judge a 'slave' of the government. Now a deeply polarizing figure, Saakashvili rose to power on a tide of acclaim in the 2003 Rose Revolution. He reorientated Georgia towards the West and introduced public sector reforms that delivered rapid improvements in governance and the economy of the South Caucasus country of 3.7 million. However, the latter part of his tenure was marked by authoritarianism, police brutality, and a disastrous 2008 war with Russia. In 2012, his United National Movement lost an election to a coalition headed by Bidzina Ivanishvili, a billionaire businessman who is still Georgia's de facto leader. After leaving office, Saakashvili moved to Ukraine, where he briefly served as governor of the Odesa region. He returned in 2021, despite having been convicted in absentia of abuse of power, and was jailed on arrival. The ruling Georgian Dream party regularly accuses all opposition parties, including those critical of Saakashvili, of having links to him. In recent years, Georgian Dream has clamped down on opposition and steered the former Soviet republic closer to Moscow again.	https://www.voanews.com/a/georgian-ex-president-saakashvili-gets-nine-more-years-in-jail-on-fraud-charge-/8007863.html	2025-03-12T04:42:51-07:00	
Russian missile attack kills 4 in Odesa, Ukrainian officials say	Ukrainian officials said Wednesday a Russian missile attack hit the southern port city of Odesa overnight, killing four Syrians and injuring several other people. Oleksiy Kuleba, vice prime minister for reconstruction, said on Telegram that the missile struck a cargo ship that was being loaded with wheat set to be exported to Algeria. Russia is attacking Ukraine's infrastructure, including ports that are involved in ensuring the world's food security,' he said. Another missile attack hit Kryvyi Rih, President Volodymyr Zelenskyy’s hometown in the Dnipropetrovsk region, killing at least one person and injuring nine others, according to the regional governor. Governor Serhiy Lysak said the region also came under attack from Russian drones, and that the assaults damaged high-rise and administrative buildings, as well as a school. Officials in the Zaporizhzhia region said a Russian drone struck a medical van. Ukraine’s military said Wednesday it shot down 98 of the 133 drones that Russian forces launched overnight. The intercepts took place over the Cherkasy, Chernihiv, Dnipropetrovsk, Kharkiv, Kherson, Khmelnytskyi, Kyiv, Odesa, Poltava, Rivne, Sumy, Ternopil, Vinnytsia, Zaporizhzhia and Zhytomyr regions, the military said. Russia’s Defense Ministry said Wednesday it destroyed 21 Ukrainian drones, with air defenses downing the aircraft over the Bryansk, Kursk and Kaluga regions, as well as the Black Sea and Russia-occupied Crimea. Officials in those areas did not report casualties or damage from the Ukrainian attacks. Some information for this story was provided by Agence France-Presse and Reuters.	https://www.voanews.com/a/russian-missile-attack-kills-4-in-odesa-ukrainian-officials-say-/8007835.html	2025-03-12T04:08:44-07:00	
Vietnam, Singapore agree to boost ties, cooperation on subsea cables	HANOI, VIETNAM — Singapore and Vietnam on Wednesday agreed to enhance cooperation in subsea cables, finance, and energy, marking an upgrade in their relations to Vietnam's highest level, during a visit by its Communist Party Chief To Lam to the city-state. Singapore is the third Southeast Asian nation, after Malaysia and Indonesia, with which Vietnam has established a 'comprehensive strategic relationship.' In a joint statement released following the upgrade, Lam and Singapore's Prime Minister Lawrence Wong witnessed the exchange of six agreements and discussed cooperation in undersea cable development, digital connectivity, and cross-border data flows. Southeast Asian countries, a major junction for cables connecting Asia to Europe, aim to expand their networks to meet the surging demand for AI services and data centers. Vietnam alone plans to launch 10 new submarine cables by 2030. In December, Reuters reported that Singaporean asset manager Keppel and Vietnamese conglomerate Sovico Group were discussing plans for new undersea fiber-optic cables to boost the region's data center industry, according to sources familiar with the matter. In April last year, Vietnam's state-owned telecom company Viettel and Singapore's Singtel announced a preliminary agreement to develop an undersea cable linking Vietnam directly to Singapore, although no construction contract has been announced yet. The two leaders also discussed green development, industrial parks expansion, and peace and stability in the region. Singapore pledged to support Vietnam in developing international financial centers, the joint statement said. Singapore ranks among Vietnam's top foreign investors, having invested $10.21 billion last year, which accounted for 27% of Vietnam's total foreign investment, official data showed.	https://www.voanews.com/a/vietnam-singapore-agree-to-boost-ties-cooperation-on-subsea-cables/8007800.html	2025-03-12T02:32:09-07:00	
G7 to discuss Ukraine after US restarts aid, proposes 30-day ceasefire	Jeddah, Saudi Arabia — Foreign ministers from the G7 group of leading industrial nations are set to gather for several days of talks in Quebec, Canada, including meetings focused on support for Ukraine in its battle against a three-year Russian invasion. The talks follow a decision by the United States to resume intelligence sharing and security assistance to Ukraine, after senior officials from the two countries met in Jeddah, Saudi Arabia. After nearly eight hours of talks, Ukraine announced Tuesday its readiness to accept a U.S. proposal for 'an immediate, interim 30-day ceasefire' in the war with Russia, pending Kremlin approval. German Chancellor Olaf Scholz welcomed the 30-day ceasefire proposal, saying Wednesday on X that it is 'an important and correct step towards a just peace for Ukraine.' 'We stand with Ukraine and the United States and welcome the proposals from Jeddah. Now it is up to Putin,' Scholz said. The Kremlin had no immediate comment on a ceasefire proposal from the U.S. and Ukraine. Russia’s Foreign Ministry said only that negotiations with U.S. officials could take place this week. U.S. Secretary of State Marco Rubio told reporters late Tuesday that Ukraine has taken a concrete step toward ending the war. 'Now hopefully we'll take this offer now to the Russians. And we hope that they'll say yes. That they'll say yes to peace. The ball's now in their court,' he said. National security adviser Mike Waltz, who joined Rubio in leading the U.S. side in Jeddah, said he would speak with his Russian counterpart 'in the coming days.' On Thursday, NATO Secretary-General Mark Rutte will visit the White House. All these discussions are part of the efforts to advance the peace process. Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy did not participate in the U.S.-Ukraine talks, but he said during his nightly address Tuesday that the ceasefire plan was a 'positive proposal.'	https://www.voanews.com/a/g7-to-discuss-ukraine-after-us-restarts-aid-proposes-30-day-ceasefire/8007797.html	2025-03-12T02:22:03-07:00

NASA's newest space telescope blasts off to map the entire sky and millions of galaxies	NASA’s newest space telescope rocketed into orbit Tuesday to map the entire sky like never before — a sweeping look at hundreds of millions of galaxies and their shared cosmic glow since the beginning of time. SpaceX launched the Spherex observatory from California, putting it on course to fly over Earth’s poles. Tagging along were four suitcase-size satellites to study the sun. Spherex popped off the rocket's upper stage first, drifting into the blackness of space with a blue Earth in the background. The $488 million Spherex mission aims to explain how galaxies formed and evolved over billions of years, and how the universe expanded so fast in its first moments. Closer to home in our own Milky Way galaxy, Spherex will hunt for water and other ingredients of life in the icy clouds between stars where new solar systems emerge. The cone-shaped Spherex — at 500 kilograms, or the heft of a grand piano — will take six months to map the entire sky with its infrared eyes and wide field of view. Four full-sky surveys are planned over two years, as the telescope circles the globe from pole to pole, 650 kilometers up. Spherex won’t see galaxies in exquisite detail like NASA’s larger and more elaborate Hubble and Webb space telescopes, with their narrow fields of view. Instead of counting galaxies or focusing on them, Spherex will observe the total glow produced by the whole lot, including the earliest ones formed in the wake of the universe-creating Big Bang. 'This cosmological glow captures all light emitted over cosmic history,' said the mission’s chief scientist Jamie Bock of the California Institute of Technology. 'It’s a very different way of looking at the universe,' enabling scientists to see what sources of light may have been missed in the past. By observing the collective glow, scientists hope to tease out the light from the earliest galaxies and learn how they came to be, Bock said. 'We won’t see the Big Bang. But we’ll see the aftermath from it and learn about the beginning of the universe that way,' he said. The telescope’s infrared detectors will be able to distinguish 102 colors invisible to the human eye, yielding the most colorful, inclusive map ever made of the cosmos. It's like 'looking at the universe through a set of rainbow-colored glasses,' said deputy project manager Beth Fabinsky of NASA’s Jet Propulsion Laboratory. To keep the infrared detectors super cold — minus minus 210 degrees Celsius — Spherex has a unique look. It sports three aluminum-honeycomb cones, one inside the other, to protect from the sun and Earth's heat, resembling a 3-meter shield collar for an ailing dog. Besides the telescope, SpaceX’s Falcon rocket provided a lift from Vandenberg Space Force Base for a quartet of NASA satellites called Punch. From their own separate polar orbit, the satellites will observe the sun’s corona, or outer atmosphere, and the resulting solar wind. The evening launch was delayed two weeks because of rocket and other issues.	https://www.voanews.com/a/nasa-s-newest-space-telescope-blasts-off-to-map-the-entire-sky-and-millions-of-galaxies/8007768.html	2025-03-12T00:17:27-07:00	
Pakistani military rescues 155 passengers after Balochistan train attack	ISLAMABAD — Security sources said Wednesday a Pakistani military operation rescued 155 passengers and killed 27 terrorists, a day after an attack on a train in Pakistan’s restive southwestern Balochistan province. The Jaffar Express, with roughly 450 people on board, was traveling north from Quetta, Balochistan, to Peshawar, Khyber Pakhtunkhwa, when it came under a bomb and gun attack Tuesday. The train has been blocked in a tunnel near Sibbi, Balochistan since Tuesday afternoon. Injured in the initial attack, the driver of the train has died. At least 37 injured people are in hospitals for treatment. The Baloch Liberation Army, or BLA, quickly claimed responsibility for the brazen attack. In a statement to media, the banned separatist militant group claimed to be holding more than 200 hostages, which it said were security and intelligence personnel. Without sharing details about the number of hostages or their background, security sources said Wednesday that potential suicide bombers were holding hostages in three different places. Suicide bombers are wearing suicide jackets, security sources said, adding that suicide bombers were using innocent people as human shields. Threatening to kill the hostages, BLA demanded the release of political prisoners, missing persons, and what it called resistance workers held in Balochistan prisons. In the statement released hours after the attack, the group gave authorities 48 hours to comply. Reaction Officials have not publicly responded to BLA’s demands. 'The attack on Jaffar Express is an attack on national security and will be responded to with full force,' Balochistan Chief Minister Sarfraz Bugti said, condemning the attack. Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif said the Ramadan attack shows, 'terrorists have no link with Islam, Pakistan or Balochistan.' Freed passengers shaken by the incident told media they heard a blast and gunfire soon after the train entered a tunnel. 'Don’t look back,' Shafiq-ul-Rehaman said armed men who boarded the train told passengers, ordering them to leave with their families. 'We took cover under the seats,' Ghulam Nabi, another freed passenger, told media about the moments soon after the attack. Earlier, Imran Hayat, divisional superintendent railways in Quetta told VOA that 70 passengers had arrived at Paneer train station Tuesday evening, about 6 kilometers from the site of that attack. Militants said they released dozens of women, children and Baloch passengers early on. However, security sources say the military rescued all 155 passengers freed so far. Difficult terrain Although just around 150 kilometers from the provincial capital Quetta, the scene of the attack, located in barren mountains, is hard to reach. 'So far, it's no foot on the ground,' railway official Hayat told VOA, noting the inability of railway staff to reach the scene. 'It's a no signal area. They [attackers] stopped the train at a spot where there is no signal support,' Hayat said. Provincial spokesperson Shahid Rind, earlier, told media that security forces, a rescue train and ambulances had been dispatched. An emergency was declared at the government hospital in Sibbi, to facilitate receiving the injured. BLA surges The United States and Pakistan have both designated BLA as a terrorist group. According to the Global Terrorism Index 2025 released last week, Pakistan experienced a 45% increase in terrorism deaths last year, compared to 2023. That is the largest year-to-year rise in more than a decade. The BLA emerged as one of the top two militant groups driving the increase. According to the report, the separatist group launched 504 attacks in 2024, compared to 116 in 2023. Deaths in the attacks surged from 88 in 2023 to 388 in 2024. The separatist group has been fighting a deadly insurgency against the Pakistani state, accusing it of exploiting the rich natural resources of the impoverished province. The group also opposes Chinese investment in Balochistan, which is home to the China-funded Gwadar port and the country’s biggest, yet largely unused airport. Both Pakistan and China reject the claims that their joint ventures are depriving ethnic Baloch from economic opportunities and their share in the province's mineral wealth. Security sources have said those involved in Tuesday's attack are based in Afghanistan. Islamabad has blamed several recent attacks on militants present on Afghan soil. Afghan Taliban routinely deny providing sanctuary to anti-Pakistan fighters. Recent attacks Since the beginning of the year, the BLA has ramped up attacks on security forces, settlers and workers, primarily from the eastern Punjab province. Earlier this month, a female suicide bomber detonated her explosive devices near a military convoy in Balochistan’s Kalat district, killing at least one security worker and injuring four others. Last month, BLA insurgents ambushed a bus transporting a paramilitary force in Kalat and killed 18 of those on board. Days later, a roadside bomb blast killed 11 coal miners in the city, while the BLA took credit for attacking a military vehicle securing a supply convoy for a mining company operated by China. Pakistani authorities reported the convoy was passing through Kalat when it came under attack, resulting in injuries to eight security personnel.

US enacts tariffs on all steel, aluminum imports	The United States enacted new 25% tariffs Wednesday on all steel and aluminum imports, ending previous exemptions that had been in place for a number of U.S. allies. The move affects imports from Argentina, Australia, Brazil, Britain, Canada, Japan, Mexico, South Korea and the European Union. 'In my judgment, these modifications are necessary to address the significantly increasing share of imports of steel articles and derivative steel articles from these sources, which threaten to impair U.S. national security,' U.S. President Donald Trump said in a proclamation announcing the tariffs. Australian Prime Minister Anthony Albanese called the U.S. action 'entirely unjustified,' but ruled out imposing retaliatory tariffs. 'Tariffs and escalating trade tensions are a form of economic self-harm and a recipe for slower growth and higher inflation. They are paid by the consumers. This is why Australia will not be imposing reciprocal tariffs on the United States,' Albanese said Wednesday. Canada was spared an even higher set of tariffs after Trump backed down from a threat to push duties on Canadian steel and aluminum to 50%. Trump ignited an economic war last week with Canada, normally a staunch ally and the second biggest U.S. trading partner after Mexico, by first imposing and then delaying for a month a 25% tariff on all products exported to the United States. Trump said he is pressuring Canada to further curb the flow of migrants and illicit drugs, especially the deadly opioid fentanyl, into the United States. Canada’s response included officials in Ontario province imposing a 25% levy on electricity sold to 1.5 million American customers, drawing Trump’s ire and the threat to increase the steel and aluminum tariffs. U.S. and Canadian officials spoke Tuesday and agreed to reverse course, with Ontario canceling the electricity levy and the Trump administration dropping the steel and aluminum tariffs back to 25%. Outgoing Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau retaliated to Trump’s targeting of Canadian goods last week by announcing increased tariffs on U.S. exports. Mark Carney, who is set to become prime minister in the coming days, said Tuesday that the government’s response will maximize impact on the United States and minimize impact on Canada. 'My government will keep our tariffs on until the Americans show us respect and make credible, reliable commitments to free and fair trade,' Carney said in a statement. Trump has further stoked tensions with Canada by suggesting it become the 51st U.S. state. 'This would make all Tariffs, and everything else, totally disappear,' Trump said Tuesday on his Truth Social platform. 'Canadians’ taxes will be very substantially reduced, they will be more secure, militarily and otherwise, than ever before, there would no longer be a Northern Border problem, and the greatest and most powerful nation in the World will be bigger, better and stronger than ever — And Canada will be a big part of that.' He suggested that the Canadian national anthem, 'O Canada,' could still be sung, 'but now representing a GREAT and POWERFUL STATE within the greatest Nation that the World has ever seen!' Trump’s tariff-trade wars with Canada and Mexico, which he also hit last week with a new 25% levy on exports before likewise delaying it, have sent jitters through Wall Street. Stock indexes have plunged for days, wiping out vast market gains for wealthy Americans along with much more modest profits for everyday investors.

US economy on edge with uncertainty over tariffs	Talk of tariffs combined with fears of inflation sent the U.S. stock market tumbling Monday and again on Tuesday, a day of give and take between the United States and Canada with President Donald Trump defending his use of tariffs.

China boosting development of AI for use in trade war with US	NEW DELHI — Encouraged by the enthusiastic reception to its DeepSeek artificial intelligence platform in January, China's leaders are going all out to encourage AI companies to harness the power of this technology to compete with the United States and other countries in business and military spheres. China considers AI an important tool to handle U.S. restrictions on Chinese business, particularly after DeepSeek shook up Wall Street, resulting in a loss of $589 billion for Nvidia stockholders in late January. 'The government in China works directly with the private sector and universities in the advancement and deployment of AI technology and are reducing their dependence on imports of high-technology products,' said Lourdes Casanova, director of Cornell University's Emerging Markets Institute. The past few weeks have seen China rolling out several new AI models, including Manus, which experts say can rival the latest model of ChatGPT. Industry experts were more than surprised to find that DeepSeek was equally efficient as ChatGPT, though it used older generation Nvidia chips. The U.S. has banned the supply of advanced chips. 'China and the U.S. have pulled way out front in the AI race. China used to be one to two years behind the U.S. Now, it is likely two to three months,' Jeffrey Towson, owner of Beijing-based TechMoat Consulting, told VOA. 'Alibaba's Qwen is now a clear leader internationally in LLMs [large language models]. Chinese Kling AI and Minimax are arguably the global leaders in video generation,' Towson said. Government involvement In 2017, China released an AI development program to make the country a world leader by 2030. The government's Next Generation Artificial Intelligence Development Plan said that AI would be adopted across different sectors and drive economic transformation. 'China has the most elaborate AI strategy compared to any other country,' Rogier Creemers, assistant professor in Modern Chinese Studies at Leiden University in the Netherlands, told VOA. China has established a National Computing Power Grid — somewhat like electricity grids — making it possible for Chinese AI companies to invest less in their own computing power. In the U.S., each company must fend for itself, Creemers said. Competition ChatGPT's updated GPT4 large language model has gotten the attention of several top-ranking CEOs of Chinese tech companies. Baidu chief Robin Li recently said his firm was under 'huge pressure and a sense of crisis' after seeing the updated ChatGPT. Baidu, which has launched Ernie Bot, said 'the gap [between China] and leading international levels [in the field] has widened.' 'AI plus robotics is likely where China will take a commanding lead over the U.S., just like in EVs,' Towson said. 'Chinese companies like Unitree are already pulling ahead. Watch for China to surprise everyone in personalized robots, industrial robots and speciality robots,' he said. Communist Party control Chinese President Xi Jinping recently convened a meeting with heads of private companies, including tech firms, calling on them to 'show your talent' in overcoming challenges such as an economic slowdown and U.S. restrictions on Chinese business. 'There are discussions that the growth of large language models — the technology behind chatbots like DeepSeek and ChatGPT — may be hindered by media censorship, because the models will have less diverse data to work with,' said Creemers. On the other hand, the government's control ensures industrial policy coordination, which is helpful in the growth of AI in China. China is focusing more on specialized software for health and other industries, which can largely tolerate political censorship. Chinese AI models are improving diagnostic accuracy in diverse areas from detecting rib fractures to cancer. US ban on advanced chips 'It will take some time, but it would not be a surprise if China is also soon capable of building advanced chips for AI,' Cornell’s Casanova said. Companies such as Huawei have shown that they can design and manufacture advanced chips successfully, thereby overcoming restrictions imposed by the U.S., she said. Towson said China is 100% dedicated to building an independent semiconductor supply chain. 'It is advancing faster than anyone thought possible. But the frontier is always advancing, and it's unclear how this will play out over time,' he said. 'But you can do a lot with software,' Creemers said. 'China can work with more chips with less computing power or with fewer sophisticated chips.' The risk for China is not limited to chips, because the Trump administration could impose restrictions on the Chinese AI model. It could also react to China’s restriction on the use of ChatGPT, because it can violate its censorship rules. AI and the military China's air force is using AI-powered biometric tests to screen potential pilots as part of a rigorous hiring process, according to state broadcaster CCTV. 'AI now plays a crucial role in interpreting candidates' biological signals, revealing underlying health risks that might not be immediately apparent to human evaluators,' CCTV said. 'This data-driven approach allows the air force to predict long-term risks, ultimately ensuring that only the most suitable candidates are chosen.' Chinese researchers have also revealed that the Chinese army has been using Meta's publicly available Llama model to develop an AI tool for potential military applications.	https://www.voanews.com/a/china-boosting-development-of-ai-for-use-in-trade-war-with-us/8007739.html	2025-03-11T21:12:00-07:00	
Australia rules out reciprocal move on US after Trump proceeds with steel tariffs	SYDNEY — Australia will not impose reciprocal tariffs on the United States, Prime Minister Anthony Albanese said on Wednesday, after President Donald Trump ruled out exemptions or exceptions for all countries on steel and aluminum tariffs. Trump said in February he would 'give great consideration' to exempting Australia from the tariffs in view of the U.S. annual trade surplus with the country, following a phone call with Albanese. However, on Tuesday the White House announced that the previously planned 25% tariffs on all imported steel and aluminum products into the U.S. from all countries would take effect on Wednesday. Albanese said the decision by the Trump administration was 'entirely unjustified ... and against the spirit of our two nations' enduring friendship and fundamentally at odds with the benefit of our economic partnership.' But he said imposing reciprocal tariffs on the U.S. would only push up prices for Australian consumers and spur inflation. 'Tariffs and escalating trade tensions are a form of economic self-harm, and a recipe for slower growth and higher inflation. They are paid by the consumers,' Albanese told reporters. During his first presidential term, Trump exempted Australia from U.S. tariffs on steel and aluminum. Albanese said he would continue to lobby the U.S. administration for a reprieve. He said he had requested a phone call with Trump but would not travel to the United States to meet the president. 'I'll be sorting out Australia's interests here,' he said. Trump on Tuesday threatened to raise tariffs on Canadian aluminum and steel to 50%, but reversed course just hours later, in a rapid-fire move that scrambled financial markets. While the tariffs will directly affect Australian metal producers, they will indirectly hurt miners that produce the raw materials used in metals manufacturing, said Scott French, an economics professor at the University of New South Wales. 'But due to the complexity of global supply chains, it's hard to predict precisely where the impact will be greatest, but the overall effect is going to be negative,' French said. A key U.S. security ally in the Indo-Pacific, Australia is a small global exporter of steel although it is the world's largest exporter of the main steelmaking raw material iron ore. Australian steel and aluminum exports to the U.S. represent less than 0.2% of the total value of the country's annual exports and they are not in the top 10 products Australia sells to the United States, Albanese said. The U.S. trade surplus with Australia was $17.9 billion in 2024, a 1.6% increase over 2023, data from the U.S. Trade Representative's office showed.	https://www.voanews.com/a/australia-rules-out-reciprocal-move-on-us-after-trump-proceeds-with-steel-tariffs/8007723.html	2025-03-11T20:14:33-07:00	
Irish PM visits White House amid divisions on economy, Ukraine, Gaza	WASHINGTON — For more than 70 years, Irish leaders have visited the White House for the annual St. Patrick's Day celebration of Irish-America heritage. But this year, Taoiseach (Prime Minister) Micheal Martin will need to present President Donald Trump with more than just the traditional gift of a bowl of shamrock, as he navigates potential friction over Ireland's low defense spending, support for Palestinians in Gaza and Ukrainians, and the large trade imbalance between the two countries. While past Irish prime ministers enjoyed warm White House hospitality from former President Joe Biden, who often highlighted his 'fierce pride' of his Irish ancestry, Wednesday's meeting will largely be a test of Martin's diplomatic acumen as he navigates the relationship with a crucial partner his country depends on economically. Martin appeared clear-eyed about the stakes of his visit. 'I am very, very conscious that in a very challenging world, thousands and thousands of jobs depend on the economic relationship between the United States and Ireland,' he said Monday at the South by Southwest conference in Austin, Texas, where he began his U.S. tour. 'And my overriding objective is to copper fasten that for the time ahead and to protect those people who are working in jobs,' Martin said. The meeting comes amid concern in Ireland about Trump's moves to impose steep new tariffs on Canada and Mexico, neighboring countries that have large trade imbalances with the United States. According to data from the U.S. Bureau of Economic Analysis, Ireland holds the fourth-largest trade surplus with the U.S., about $87 billion, behind Vietnam, Mexico and China but ahead of Canada. Trump has also threatened to apply tariffs on goods from the European Union, which would also affect Ireland, an EU member. Ireland is also highly dependent on long-standing investment from U.S. multinational companies for jobs, tax revenue and exports. According to data from the American Chamber of Commerce Ireland, around 970 U.S. companies directly employ 211,000 people and indirectly support a further 168,000 jobs across Ireland. Major American companies including Apple, Google, Microsoft, Meta and Pfizer have established European headquarters in the country, lured by its English-speaking and skilled workforce, access to the European single market, and its low corporate tax rate of 12.5%. As president-elect, Trump pledged to slash the U.S. corporate tax rate to match the Irish rate and 'reshore' American companies, bringing back their business activities and their tax dollars. The U.S. is an 'absolutely critical partner,' and the Irish have 'a lot of trepidation' on what Trump might bring up during this meeting, said Eoin Drea, senior researcher at the Wilfried Martens Centre for European Studies. 'The best-case scenario would be if there is no public bust up or major disagreement' between the leaders, Drea told VOA. Ukraine and Gaza Taxes and tariffs aside, Martin will also need to navigate geopolitical divides, including on Ukraine and Gaza. The Irish prime minister will be the first foreign leader to visit the White House following the fiery exchange between Trump and Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy 11 days ago. Dublin's position mirrors that of Kyiv's, in that Ukraine needs U.S.-backed security guarantees to secure a ceasefire with Russia. But out of all the potential irritants, Gaza might be the issue that needs the most delicate handling from Martin. Irish opposition leaders including Sinn Féin leader Mary Lou McDonald and Labour Party politician Duncan Smith have pressed Martin to stand up to Trump and advocate for the plight of the Palestinians in Gaza. Dublin is one of Europe's staunchest critics of Israel's conduct in Gaza, and one of only three European states, along with Norway and Spain, that in 2024 recognized the State of Palestine. It has also joined a South African legal action at the International Court of Justice accusing Israel of committing genocide in Gaza. The Irish delegation would be wise to keep the focus on economic issues, where the two countries are 'less diametrically opposed' as they are compared to their positions on Gaza, Drea said. As Trump presses European countries to boost spending and rely less on Washington for its security, Ireland's low defense spending, only 0.2% of the gross domestic product, is another area where the U.S. can exert pressure. Ireland is not a member of NATO and relies heavily on the United Kingdom for its defense, including to protect the massive network of undersea cables that make the backbone of global internet and communication systems. Seventy-five percent of all transatlantic cables go through, or are close to, Irish waters. To counter pressures from the deal-making American president, the Irish government 'would be clever to induce some kind of personalized incentives,' Drea said, noting Trump's properties in Ireland, including one of the country’s most famous golf courses.	https://www.voanews.com/a/irish-pm-visits-white-house-amid-divisions-on-economy-ukraine-gaza/8007713.html	2025-03-11T19:39:54-07:00

Voting ends in Greenland election dominated by Trump's control pledge	NUUK, Greenland — Polling stations closed in Greenland on Tuesday in a parliamentary election brought into the international spotlight by U.S. President Donald Trump's pledge to take control of the mineral-rich island, firing up a debate over its independence. Voting had been extended by half an hour past a 2200 GMT deadline amid high turnout at several of the 72 polling stations across the arctic island, where 40,500 people were eligible to cast their ballots. There were no exit polls, and a final tally of the vote could take between three and five hours to complete, Greenland's election authority has said. Since taking office in January, Trump has vowed to make Greenland — a semiautonomous territory of Denmark — part of the United States, saying it is vital to U.S. security interests. The vast island, with a population of 57,000, has been caught up in a geopolitical race for dominance in the Arctic, where melting ice caps are making its resources more accessible and opening new shipping routes. Both Russia and China have intensified military activity in the region. Greenland is a former Danish colony and a territory since 1953. It gained some autonomy in 1979 when its first parliament was formed, but Copenhagen still controls foreign affairs, defense and monetary policy and provides just under $1 billion a year to the economy. In 2009, it won the right to declare full independence through a referendum, even though it has not done so out of concern living standards would drop without Denmark's economic support. 'I strongly believe that we will very soon start to live a life more based on who we are, based on our culture, based on our own language, and start to make regulations based on us, not based on Denmark,' said Qupanuk Olsen, candidate for the main pro-independence party Naleraq. Inge Olsvig Brandt, a candidate for the ruling Inuit Ataqatigiit Party, said: 'We don't need the independence right now. We have too many things to work on. I think we have to work with ourselves, our history, and we are going to have a lot of healing work with us before we can take the next step.' Trump's interest has shaken up the status quo, and coupled with the growing pride of the Indigenous people in their Inuit culture, put independence front and center in the election. In the final debate on Greenland's state broadcaster KNR late on Monday, leaders of the five parties currently in parliament unanimously said they did not trust Trump. 'He is trying to influence us. I can understand if citizens feel insecure,' said Erik Jensen, leader of government coalition partner Siumut. A January poll suggested a majority of Greenland's inhabitants support independence but are divided on timing. Early on, the election campaign focused on the anger and frustration aimed at historical wrongdoings by former colonial ruler Denmark, according to Julie Rademacher, a consultant and former adviser to Greenland's government. 'But I think the fear of the U.S. imperialist approach has lately become bigger than the anger towards Denmark,' said Rademacher. Reuters spoke to more than a dozen Greenlanders in Nuuk, all of whom said they favored independence, although many expressed concern that a swift transition could damage the economy and eliminate Nordic welfare services like universal health care and free schooling. The island holds substantial natural resources, including critical minerals such as rare earths used in high-tech industries, ranging from electric vehicles to missile systems. However, Greenland has been slow to extract them because of environmental concerns, severe weather, and China's near-total control of the sector, which has made it difficult for companies elsewhere to make a profit or secure buyers. Trump initially declined to rule out military force, alarming many Greenlanders, although he later softened his stance, stating he would respect the will of the local people and was 'ready to invest billions of dollars' if they joined the U.S. Greenland's prime minister, Mute Egede, has stressed the island is not for sale and advocated for a broad coalition government to resist external pressure. In an interview aired on Monday by Danish broadcaster DR, he dismissed Trump's offer as disrespectful, expressing willingness to cooperate with other countries instead. Denmark's prime minister has said Greenland is not for sale but made it clear that it is up to the local people to decide their future. The pro-independence Naleraq Party, the leading opposition force, has gained momentum ahead of the election, bolstered by U.S. interest and fresh accusations of Denmark's historic exploitation of Greenland's mineral wealth. The party believes the U.S. attention strengthens Greenland's position in secession talks with Denmark and aims to bring a deal with Copenhagen to a vote before the next election in four years.	https://www.voanews.com/a/voting-ends-in-greenland-election-dominated-by-trump-s-control-pledge/8007683.html	2025-03-11T18:21:52-07:00

US Education Department plans to lay off 1,300 employees	WASHINGTON — The Education Department plans to lay off more than 1,300 of its employees as part of an effort to halve the organization's staff — a prelude to President Donald Trump's plan to dismantle the agency. Department officials announced the cuts Tuesday, raising questions about the agency's ability to continue usual operations. The Trump administration had been whittling the agency's staff though buyout offers and the termination of probationary employees. After Tuesday's layoffs, the Education Department's staff will sit at roughly half of its previous 4,100, the agency said. The layoffs are part of a dramatic downsizing directed by Trump as he moves to reduce the footprint of the federal government. Thousands of jobs are expected to be cut across the Department of Veterans Affairs, the Social Security Administration and other agencies. Ending leases The department is also terminating leases on buildings in cities including New York; Boston, Massachusetts; Chicago, Illinois; and Cleveland, Ohio; officials said. Department officials said it would continue to deliver on its key functions such as the distribution of federal aid to schools, student loan management, and oversight of Pell Grants. 'Today's reduction in force reflects the Department of Education's commitment to efficiency, accountability, and ensuring that resources are directed where they matter most: to students, parents, and teachers,' Education Secretary Linda McMahon said. McMahon told employees to brace for profound cuts in a memo issued March 3, the day she was confirmed by the Senate. She said it was the department's 'final mission' to eliminate bureaucratic bloat and turn over the agency's authority to states. The department sent an email to employees Tuesday telling them its Washington headquarters and regional offices would be closed Wednesday, with access forbidden, before reopening Thursday. The only reason given for the closures was unspecified security reasons. Secretary aiming for efficiency, she says Trump campaigned on a promise to close the department, saying it had been overtaken by 'radicals, zealots and Marxists.' At McMahon's confirmation hearing, she acknowledged only Congress has the power to abolish the agency but said it might be due for cuts and a reorganization. Whether the cuts will be felt by America's students — as Democrats and advocates fear — is yet to be seen. There are concerns the administration's agenda has pushed aside some of the agency's most fundamental work, including the enforcement of civil rights for students with disabilities and the management of $1.6 trillion in federal student loans. McMahon told lawmakers at her hearing that her aim is not to defund core programs, but to make them more efficient. Even before the layoffs, the Education Department was among the smallest Cabinet-level agencies. Its workforce included 3,100 people in Washington and an additional 1,100 at regional offices across the country, according to a department website. The department's workers had faced increasing pressure to quit their jobs since Trump took office, first through a deferred resignation program and then through a $25,000 buyout offer that expired March 3. The buyout offer came with a warning that there would be 'significant layoffs in the near future.'	https://www.voanews.com/a/us-education-department-plans-to-lay-off-1-300-employees-/8007652.html	2025-03-11T17:33:41-07:00	
White House defends Trump's push to deport pro-Palestinian activist	THE WHITE HOUSE — The White House on Tuesday defended President Donald Trump's deportation policy after the weekend arrest of Mahmoud Khalil, a Palestinian activist and U.S. legal permanent resident, who played a prominent role in last year's university protests over the Gaza war. White House officials echoed Trump's vow on Monday to 'find, apprehend, and deport these terrorist sympathizers from our country — never to return again.' Trump doubled down on his language on Tuesday. 'We ought to get them all out of the country,' he said. 'They're troublemakers. They're agitators. They don't love our country. We ought to get them the hell out.' Khalil, who remained in detention Tuesday, has not been charged with any criminal offense. It is not a criminal offense to disagree, even openly, with the U.S. government's policy or actions, and the Bill of Rights protects free speech and the right to assemble. 'This is an individual who organized group protests that not only disrupted college campus classes and harassed Jewish American students and made them feel unsafe on their own college campus but also distributed pro-Hamas propaganda fliers with the logo of Hamas,' said White House Press Secretary Karoline Leavitt. 'That is the behavior and activity that this individual engaged in.' According to the U.S. government database that tracks immigration arrests, a man by the name of Mahmoud Khalil, who is listed as being born in Syria, is being held in an ICE facility in rural Louisiana. Khalil was a student at Columbia University in New York City and a prominent figure during last year's protests at the university. Trump also promised, in his Monday social media post, that more arrests would come. When asked how many more, Leavitt did not provide a number. 'But I do know that DHS is actively working on it,' she replied. 'And I also know that Columbia University has been given the names of other individuals who have engaged in pro-Hamas activity, and they are refusing to help DHS identify those individuals on campus, and as the president said very strongly in his statement yesterday, he is not going to tolerate that, and we expect, expect all America's colleges and universities to comply with this administration's policy.' Last week, the U.S. government announced the immediate cancellation of about $400 million in federal grants and contracts to Columbia University, due, they said, 'to the school's continued inaction in the face of persistent harassment of Jewish students.' 'Step in the right direction' In a statement, the Heritage Foundation, whose Project 2025 document has effectively become a policy playbook for the Trump administration, praised both the move to defund and Khalil's arrest, saying, in a headline, 'Heritage Praises Trump Administration's Decision to Defund Columbia University, Arrest Pro-Hamas Student Leader.' 'This is a great step in the right direction,' said the foundation's Jason Bedrick, a researcher on education policy. 'For far too long, universities like Columbia have allowed radicals to engage in targeted harassment of Jewish students, incite violence, openly support terrorist organizations, and break campus policies with impunity.' 'Straight from the authoritarian playbook' On Capitol Hill, Democratic Representative Jamie Raskin said the arrest was a violation of Khalil's First Amendment rights. Raskin said he was 'closely monitoring' the situation. While Leavitt said Tuesday that the secretary of state has the authority to revoke a person's Permanent Resident Card, also known as a green card, over issues of national security, critics question the legality of such a move. 'The detention of Mahmoud Khalil is ripped straight from the authoritarian playbook,' said Raskin, a constitutional law professor, in a statement. 'His arrest sets an extremely dangerous and chilling precedent from an administration that is hellbent on wielding fear and intimidation as weapons to crush political dissent. All Americans, including those who strongly disagree with Khalil's speech, should be outraged by this brazen attack on our fundamental freedoms.' The Council on American-Islamic Relations told VOA via email that they are comforted by a judge's decision to block Khalil's deportation. 'What ultimately happens to Mahmoud may set a precedent for countless other lawful permanent residents and possibly even American citizens targeted in this anti-American war on free speech and peaceful activism,' said Edward Ahmed Mitchell, CAIR national deputy director. 'Free speech for everyone in our nation, including lawful permanent residents, is a cornerstone of American democracy.' The American-Arab Anti-Discrimination Committee told VOA via email that this case prompts many questions. 'They are constantly moving the goalposts on what is antisemitism and what isn't,' National Executive Director Abed Ayoub told VOA. 'There is no proof Mahmoud committed a crime. What is the statutory authority they are using? What about the [First Amendment]? How far is the administration going with this? Will they be targeting naturalized U.S. citizens? These seem like obvious questions, but they haven't been asked.' U.S. District Court Judge Jesse Furman on Monday ordered that Khalil not be deported for now and set his next hearing for Wednesday.	https://www.voanews.com/a/white-house-defends-trump-s-push-to-deport-pro-palestinian-activist/8007400.html	2025-03-11T17:00:35-07:00	
Russia's gains in Kursk threaten Kyiv's leverage	KYIV, UKRAINE — The images shared by Kremlin-controlled media were shocking: Russian troops hunched, dirt on their faces, as they crept through an empty gas pipeline under Ukrainian defense lines. Since Kyiv launched its audacious cross-border assault into the Kursk region last August, Moscow has been pushing back hard, using unconventional tactics and deploying thousands of North Korean troops against the Ukrainian army. They have since stepped up their advances. In the past five days, Moscow has broken through Kyiv's defensive lines, reclaiming dozens of square kilometers of territory, according to military bloggers. Russian military bloggers reported Tuesday that Moscow's troops had entered the town of Sudzha, the largest settlement in the region under Kyiv's control. 'The enemy is retreating in panic and disorder without [having] received any orders. That's it. It's a collapse,' a Russian serviceman, who identified himself as Zombie, told Kremlin-run television. The result is that Kyiv may have lost one of its only bargaining chips on swapping land with Russia, which has seized and occupied around a fifth of Ukraine since it took Crimea in 2014 and launched its full-scale invasion of Ukraine in February 2022. For Ukraine, which has painted a more controlled picture of the fighting, the stakes of its difficult operation in Kursk could hardly be higher. The assault last summer injected a much-needed morale boost into the Ukrainian war effort and represented the first and only incursion by a foreign army into Russian territory since World War II. President Volodymyr Zelenskyy said the operation was key to future negotiations on ending the war and that holding Russian territory would give Kyiv vital leverage. But that leverage — just as Washington starts rounds of talks with Moscow and Kyiv — is dwindling as Russian forces press forward. Franz-Stefan Gady, a military analyst, said Russia had built up its force in Kursk over recent weeks and escalated strikes on Ukraine's supply route. 'The result is that now that the Russians are pushing a lot. Parts of the front line are actually giving way,' he told AFP. The British defense ministry estimates Ukraine controls around 300 square kilometers of Kursk, a five-fold territorial loss since Kyiv launched its gambit. On Monday, Ukrainian commander-in-chief Oleksandr Syrsky conceded the situation was worsening. He dismissed reports Ukrainian troops were in danger of being encircled but acknowledged they had been forced to fall back and that he was sending forward reinforcements. One Ukrainian soldier who had been deployed in Kursk told AFP on Monday his unit had 'fortunately' withdrawn five days earlier and described fighting there as 'very' hard. Another, who had overseen operations from inside Ukraine and also asked not to be identified to speak freely about the dynamics of the fighting, said Russia's use of drones to disrupt logistics was a key problem. 'It was the end, so to speak. And we started to get out of there because if we didn't, we would have been surrounded,' he said, recounting the decision of some troops to leave Kursk because of resupply problems and Russian advances. From the outset, analysts were skeptical of the purpose of diverting thousands of Ukrainian troops and key military assets from front lines inside Ukraine that were under immense Russian pressure. With Moscow now clawing back land, this question remains. Russia last week even claimed to have captured a village inside Ukraine, Novenke, which lies just several kilometers from the vital Ukrainian resupply route into Kursk. The Institute for the Study of War has said that Moscow is consolidating its gains and likely preparing to attack the largest town still under Ukrainian control, Sudzha.	https://www.voanews.com/a/russia-s-gains-in-kursk-threaten-kyiv-s-leverage-/8007377.html	2025-03-11T16:51:07-07:00	
House Republicans block Congress' ability to challenge Trump tariffs	WASHINGTON — The Republican-controlled U.S. House of Representatives voted on Tuesday to block the ability of Congress to quickly challenge tariffs imposed by President Donald Trump that have rattled financial markets. The 216-214 vote, largely along party lines, delays lawmakers' ability for the rest of the year to force a vote that could revoke Trump's tariffs and immigration actions. Trump has made a blitz of tariff announcements since taking office, upending relations with key trading partners, including Mexico and China. This week he has ramped up a trade war with Canada, sending markets reeling and prompting business leaders to warn of weakening consumer demand. Trump has said the tariffs will correct unbalanced trade relations, bring jobs back to the country and stop the flow of illegal narcotics from abroad. Tuesday's vote effectively derails an effort to challenge Trump's Canada and Mexico tariffs, sponsored by Democratic Representative Suzan DelBene of Washington, which had been due to take place later this month. 'Every House Republican who voted for this measure is voting to give Trump expanded powers to raise taxes on American households through tariffs with full knowledge of how he is using those powers, and every Republican will own the economic consequences of that vote,' DelBene and a fellow Democrat, Representative Don Beyer from Virginia, said in a statement. Rule changes governing the House voting processes in the majority's favor are a common affair on Capitol Hill. 'This is an appropriate balance of powers and we trust this White House to do the right thing, and I think that was the right vote and it was reflected in the vote count,' House Speaker Mike Johnson said when asked by Reuters why he was comfortable giving more trade power to the executive branch. The provision was tucked into a procedural vote related to the Republicans' six-month stopgap funding bill. DelBene had sought to force a vote under the National Emergencies Act, which gives the president special powers in an emergency and was cited by Trump in his tariff actions. That law also allows for representatives to force a vote in the House within 15 days to revoke the president's emergency authority. The Senate would have to also pass the resolution for it to take effect. But Tuesday's vote tweaks how the House will count calendar days for the remainder of 2025, effectively blocking a vote of this kind this year. The voting change is the latest example of the legislative branch offloading its constitutional trade authority to the executive branch. 'The international emergency economic powers have not been used before to impose tariffs, and many members want to have a chance to weigh in,' said Greta Peisch, former general counsel to the U.S. Trade Representative. 'Without a fast-track voting process, they are unlikely to have an opportunity to do so.'	https://www.voanews.com/a/house-republicans-block-congress-ability-to-challenge-trump-tariffs-/8007404.html	2025-03-11T16:32:20-07:00	
Wall Street swings wildly, briefly dropping more than 10% below its record	NEW YORK — The U.S. stock market fell further Tuesday following President Donald Trump's latest escalation in his trade war, briefly pulling Wall Street 10% below its record set last month. The S&P 500 fell 0.8%, but only after careening between a modest gain and a tumble of 1.5%. The main measure of Wall Street's health finished 9.3% below its all-time high after flirting with the 10% threshold that professional investors call a correction. Other indexes likewise swung sharply through the day. The Dow Jones Industrial Average lost 478 points, or 1.1%, and the Nasdaq composite ended up slipping 0.2%. Such head-spinning moves are becoming routine in what's been a scary ride for investors as Trump tries to remake the country and world through tariffs and other policies. Stocks have been heaving mostly lower on uncertainty about how much pain Trump is willing for the economy to endure in order to get what he wants. And moves by Trump and comments by his White House on Tuesday didn't clarify much. Stocks began tumbling in the morning after Trump said he would double planned tariff increases on steel and aluminum coming from Canada. The president said it was a response to moves a Canadian province made after Trump began threatening tariffs on one of the United States' most important trading partners. Trump has acknowledged the economy could feel some 'disturbance' because of the tariffs he's pushing. Asked on Tuesday just how much pain Trump would be willing for the economy and stock market to take, White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt declined to give an exact answer. But she said earlier in the press briefing that 'the president will look out for Wall Street and for Main Street.' For his part, Trump said earlier on social media, 'The only thing that makes sense is for Canada to become our cherished Fifty First State. This would make all Tariffs, and everything else, totally disappear.' Stocks pared their losses later in the day, even briefly eliminating them altogether, after Ontario's premier said he had agreed to remove the surcharge on electricity that had enraged Trump so much. Trump afterward returned the steel and aluminum tariffs on Canada to 25%. After that brief tilt higher, though, stocks would go on to slide again into the end of trading. Tuesday's swings followed more warning signals about the economy as Trump's on-again-off-again rollout of tariffs creates confusion and pessimism for U.S. households and businesses. Such tariffs can hurt the economy directly by raising prices for U.S. consumers and gumming up global trade. But even if they end up being milder than feared, all the whipsaw moves could create so much uncertainty that U.S. companies and consumers freeze, which would sap energy from the economy. Helping to keep the market in check were several Big Tech stocks, which steadied a bit after being walloped in recent months. Elon Musk's Tesla rose 3.8%, for example, after Trump said he would buy a Tesla in a show of support for 'Elon's 'baby.'' Tesla's sales and brand have been under pressure as Musk has led efforts in Washington to cut spending by the federal government. Tesla's stock is down 42.9% for the year so far. Other Big Tech superstars, which had led the market to record after record in recent years, also held a bit firmer. Nvidia added 1.7% to trim its loss for the year so far to 19%. It's struggled as the market's sell-off has particularly hit stocks seen as getting too expensive in Wall Street's frenzy around artificial-intelligence technology. All told, the S&P 500 fell 42.49 points to 5,572.07. The Dow dropped 478.23 to 41,433.48, and the Nasdaq composite slipped 32.23 to 17,436.10.	https://www.voanews.com/a/wall-street-swings-wildly-briefly-dropping-more-than-10-below-its-record-/8007363.html	2025-03-11T16:04:13-07:00	
US House passes short-term funding resolution as shutdown date nears	The Republican-majority U.S. House of Representatives on Tuesday took a key step toward funding the federal government past a March 14 deadline. The short-term spending measure — also known as a continuing resolution (CR) — passed in a 217-213 vote, with one Republican voting no and one Democrat voting yes. The measure still has to pass the Republican-majority Senate to be signed into law. 'Voting against the CR will hurt the American people and kill the incredible momentum that President [Donald] Trump has built over the past 51 days,' White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt told reporters Tuesday afternoon. Appropriations bills are required to pass a 60-vote threshold for passage in the Senate, which means Republicans will need to secure Democratic votes. The House went out of session for the rest of the week starting Tuesday afternoon, putting pressure on senators to pass its version of the CR. 'We are prepared to take it up here in the Senate and make sure that on Friday, the government stays open. But it will be up to the Democrats as to whether or not that happens between now and then,' Senate Majority Leader John Thune told reporters Tuesday. Speaker of the House Mike Johnson quelled dissent from within his own party to pass the spending measure. He told reporters Tuesday the seven-month continuing resolution was an important step toward implementing Trump’s agenda of rooting out government waste and abuse through the Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE). 'It allows us to move forward with changing the size and scope of the federal government. There is a seismic shift going on in Washington right now. This is a different moment than we have ever been in. The DOGE work is finding massive amounts of fraud, waste and abuse,' Johnson said. 'We have a White House that is actually dedicated to getting us back onto a fiscally responsible track.' Independent watchdogs and analysts, however, say DOGE is using overly broad claims of fraud to generate support for large-scale cuts to federal programs and offices. Earlier Tuesday, Vice President JD Vance spoke to lawmakers on Capitol Hill to shore up support for the measure. Representative Thomas Massie was the lone Republican holdout, despite Trump’s post Monday night on Truth Social calling for Massie to lose his seat if he voted against the spending measure. The continuing resolution buys lawmakers time to reach a compromise on Senate and House versions of government spending, a key tool for implementing Trump’s domestic policy agenda. At question is how and when to enact a proposed extension of the 2017 tax cuts and how to pay down the U.S. deficit without cutting key safety net programs that help American voters. 'Donald Trump, Elon Musk and Senate Republicans know their math on billionaire tax cuts won't work without slashing these vital benefits,' Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer told reporters Tuesday. Senate leadership has proposed passing the tax cuts in a separate bill later this year.

Europe holds high-level talks on rearming continent, boosting Ukraine aid	Paris — European military and political heads are holding high-level talks this week after calls for massively rearming Europe — and boosting aid for Kyiv — amid fears of a less engaged United States. Lisa Bryant has more from Paris. Speaking to top NATO and European Union military brass gathered in Paris Tuesday, Dutch Defense Minister Ruben Brekelmans stressed the urgency of boosting Europe’s defense. While the transatlantic alliance is important, he said Europeans can no longer take U.S. protection for granted. 'Europe therefore needs to fortify its security architecture. And we don’t have much time to get this right. We only have one shot,' said Brekelmans. The same message came from European Commission chief Ursula von der Leyen at the European Parliament. 'We need a surge in European defense, and we need it now,' she said. The European Union’s executive arm has proposed an $873 billion plan for rearming Europe and supporting Ukraine. It includes relaxing fiscal rules and some $164 billion in loans for defense investments. It has proposed increasing defense spending by an additional 1.5 percent of member states’ GDP yearly over four years. The proposed surge comes as Washington’s priorities appear to be shifting. And European leaders are worried Russia may not stop at Ukraine — fears their populations appear to share. One Ipsos survey found three-quarters of French and half of Germans are concerned the Ukraine conflict will spread elsewhere in Europe. Another poll, however, found few Europeans want to pay more for defense. Critics, including Hungary’s Viktor Orban, suggest Europe can’t afford to defend Ukraine. Others argue Brussels is assuming too much power. Europeans are also divided over whether to invest in their own defense industry — or buy externally. The U.S. has been a top supplier. Former French Ambassador Michel Duclos said, 'They want to continue to sell weapons to European counties.' Duclos is now an analyst at the Montaigne Institute research group in Paris. That’s one argument, he believes, for Washington’s at least short-term commitment to Europe’s security. 'What I fear more is not that they [the U.S.] will disengage. It’s more that they will want the Europeans to pay more and more for European protection,' he said. This week sees more high-level meetings on Ukraine and European security. There’s another in Paris Wednesday, gathering Europe’s five top military powers, along with NATO and Ukrainian defense chiefs.	https://www.voanews.com/a/europe-holds-high-level-talks-on-rearming-continent-boosting-ukraine-aid/8007271.html	2025-03-11T13:46:45-07:00	
Measles cases rising in southwestern US as more states report infections	Measles outbreaks in West Texas and New Mexico are now up to more than 250 cases, and two unvaccinated people have died from measles-related causes. Measles is caused by a highly contagious virus that is airborne and spreads easily when an infected person breathes, sneezes or coughs. It is preventable through vaccines and has been considered eliminated from the U.S. since 2000. Texas state health officials said Tuesday there were 25 new cases of measles since the end of last week, bringing Texas' total to 223. Twenty-nine people in Texas are hospitalized. New Mexico health officials announced three new cases Tuesday, bringing the state's total to 33. The outbreak has spread from Lea County, which neighbors the West Texas communities at the epicenter of the outbreak, to include one case in Eddy County. Oklahoma's state health department reported two probable cases of measles Tuesday, saying they are associated with the West Texas and New Mexico outbreaks. A school-age child died of measles in Texas last month, and New Mexico reported its first measles-related death in an adult last week. Measles cases have been reported in Alaska, California, Georgia, Kentucky, Maryland, New Jersey, New York, Pennsylvania and Rhode Island. The U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention defines an outbreak as three or more related cases — and there have been three clusters that qualified as outbreaks in 2025. In the U.S., cases and outbreaks are generally traced to someone who caught the disease abroad. It can then spread, especially in communities with low vaccination rates. The best way to avoid measles is to get the measles, mumps and rubella (MMR) vaccine. The first shot is recommended for children between 12 and 15 months old and the second between 4 and 6 years old. People at high risk for infection who got the shots many years ago may want to consider getting a booster if they live in an area with an outbreak, said Scott Weaver with the Global Virus Network, an international coalition. Those may include family members living with someone who has measles or those especially vulnerable to respiratory diseases because of underlying medical conditions. Adults with 'presumptive evidence of immunity' generally don't need measles shots now, the CDC said. Criteria include written documentation of adequate vaccination earlier in life, lab confirmation of past infection or being born before 1957, when most people were likely to be infected naturally. A doctor can order a lab test called an MMR titer to check your levels of measles antibodies, but health experts don't always recommend this route and insurance coverage can vary. Getting another MMR shot is harmless if there are concerns about waning immunity, the CDC says. People who have documentation of receiving a live measles vaccine in the 1960s don't need to be revaccinated, but people who were immunized before 1968 with an ineffective measles vaccine made from killed virus should be revaccinated with at least one dose, the agency said. That also includes people who don't know which type they got. There's no specific treatment for measles, so doctors generally try to alleviate symptoms, prevent complications and keep patients comfortable.	https://www.voanews.com/a/measles-cases-rising-in-southwestern-us-as-more-states-report-infections/8007201.html	2025-03-11T12:46:46-07:00	
US transportation agency urges ban on some helicopter flights after deadly Washington crash	U.S. federal investigators looking for the cause of the January collision between a passenger jet and an Army helicopter near Washington that killed 67 people on Tuesday recommended a ban on some helicopter flights to improve safety. A military helicopter collided with the American Airlines jet as it was approaching Ronald Reagan National Airport over the Potomac River on Jan. 29. Among the victims were 28 members of the figure skating community. National Transportation Safety Board Chair Jennifer Homendy said the board determined that the existing separation distance between planes and helicopters at the airport is 'insufficient and poses an intolerable risk to aviation safety.' 'It shouldn't take tragedy to require immediate action,' she said. Under the current practice, helicopters and planes can be as close as 75 feet apart during landing, Homendy said. Investigators have identified 15,214 instances of planes receiving alerts about helicopters being in close proximity between October 2021 and December 2024, she said. Following the crash, the Federal Aviation Administration took steps to restrict helicopter flights around Reagan National Airport to ensure that planes and helicopters are no longer sharing the same airspace. Now flights are put on hold temporarily when helicopters need to pass by the airport. Investigators have said the helicopter may have had inaccurate altitude readings in the moments before the crash, and the crew may not have heard key instructions from air traffic controllers. The collision likely occurred at an altitude just under 91 meters, as the plane descended toward the helicopter, which was well above its 61-meter limit for that location. The helicopter pilots may have also missed part of another communication, when the tower said the jet was turning toward a different runway, Homendy said last month. The helicopter was on a 'check' flight that night in which the pilot was undergoing an annual test and a test on using night vision goggles, Homendy said. Investigators believe the crew was wearing night vision goggles throughout the flight. The Army has said the Black Hawk crew was highly experienced and accustomed to the crowded skies around the nation's capital. Within just a month's time earlier this year, there were four major aviation disasters in North America, including the midair collision over the Potomac and, most recently, in mid-February, when a Delta flight flipped and landed on its roof at Toronto's Pearson Airport, injuring 21 people. Those accidents and close calls left some worried about the safety of flying even though fatal crashes are rare and the track record of U.S. airlines is remarkably sound. U.S. President Donald Trump blamed the midair collision over Washington on what he called an 'obsolete' air traffic control system and promised to replace it. He also faulted the helicopter for flying too high. Federal officials have been raising concerns about an overtaxed and understaffed air traffic control system for years, especially after a series of close calls between planes at U.S. airports. Among the reasons they have cited for staffing shortages are uncompetitive pay, long shifts, intensive training and mandatory retirements.	https://www.voanews.com/a/us-transportation-agency-urges-ban-on-some-helicopter-flights-after-deadly-washington-crash/8007152.html	2025-03-11T12:24:47-07:00

Trump escalates trade war; doubles tariffs on Canada steel, aluminum	U.S. President Donald Trump ramped up his trade war with Canada on Tuesday, doubling the 25% U.S. tariff on its northern neighbor’s steel and aluminum exports to 50% after Canada’s Ontario provincial leader said he is adding a 25% levy on electricity sold to 1.5 million American customers. In an all-caps post on his Truth Social media platform, Trump called Canada 'one of the highest tariffing nations anywhere in the world.' The president said the doubled U.S. steel and aluminum tariffs would take effect Wednesday morning. In addition, Trump demanded that Ottawa 'must immediately drop their Anti-American Farmer Tariff of 250% to 390% on various U.S. dairy products, which has long been considered outrageous.' Trump ignited the economic war last week with Canada, normally a staunch ally and the U.S.’s second-biggest trading partner after Mexico, by first imposing and then delaying for a month a 25% tariff on all products exported to the United States. Trump said he is pressuring Canada to further curb the flow of migrants and illicit drugs, especially the deadly opioid fentanyl, into the United States. Outgoing Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau retaliated by announcing increased tariffs on U.S. exports. Then, Doug Ford, Ontario’s provincial leader, said that effective Monday, he was charging 25% more for electricity Ontario sends to residential and business customers in three northern U.S. states that border Canada: Michigan, Minnesota and New York. 'I will not hesitate to increase this charge. If the United States escalates, I will not hesitate to shut the electricity off completely,' Ford said at a news conference in Toronto. He added, 'Believe me when I say I do not want to do this. I feel terrible for the American people, who didn’t start this trade war. It’s one person who is responsible. It’s President Trump.' With the added Canadian duty, U.S. residential bills in the three states would increase by about $69 a month, Ford said. In his social media posting, Trump responded that he will 'shortly be declaring a National Emergency on Electricity within the threatened area. This will allow the U.S to quickly do what has to be done to alleviate this abusive threat from Canada.' 'If other egregious, long time Tariffs are not likewise dropped by Canada, I will substantially increase, on April 2nd, the Tariffs on Cars coming into the U.S. which will, essentially, permanently shut down the automobile manufacturing business in Canada,' Trump declared. 'Those cars can easily be made in the USA!' Trump also renewed his designs on making Canada the 51st U.S. state. 'This would make all Tariffs, and everything else, totally disappear,' he contended. 'Canadians’ taxes will be very substantially reduced, they will be more secure, militarily and otherwise, than ever before, there would no longer be a Northern Border problem, and the greatest and most powerful nation in the World will be bigger, better and stronger than ever — And Canada will be a big part of that.' He suggested that the Canadian national anthem, 'O Canada,' could still be sung, 'but now representing a GREAT and POWERFUL STATE within the greatest Nation that the World has ever seen!' Trump’s tariff-trade wars with Canada and Mexico, which he also hit last week with a new 25% levy on exports before likewise delaying it, have sent jitters through Wall Street. Stock indexes have plunged for days, wiping out vast market gains for wealthy Americans along with much more modest gains for everyday investors. After sharp losses in the three major U.S. stock indexes on Monday, the markets lost more ground in early trading on Tuesday but not anywhere near as much. The bellwether Dow Jones average of 30 key stocks was off about a percentage point after falling by 2 percentage points on Monday.	https://www.voanews.com/a/trump-escalates-trade-war-doubles-tariffs-on-canada-steel-aluminum/8006924.html	2025-03-11T09:53:42-07:00	
The Roosevelt Hotel: A window into New York City's history	The Roosevelt Hotel, a New York City landmark for over a century, once again faces an uncertain future. Last month, city officials announced plans to stop using it as a migrant shelter and processing center beginning this summer. Opened in 1924 to cater to passengers using the nearby Grand Central Terminal, the iconic hotel has weathered Prohibition, the Great Depression, a World War and 9/11. The COVID-19 pandemic in 2020, however, forced the hotel to close its doors to guests due to financial losses before its short-lived reincarnation in 2023 as a hub for undocumented migrants flooding the city. Through it all, the Roosevelt, affectionately known as the 'Grand Dame of Madison Avenue,' became a favorite movie backdrop featured in countless Hollywood classics and TV shows. While its fate remains in question, the Roosevelt's past, captured in photographs and movies, serves as a microcosm of New York City and American history. Here are seven images that capture key moments in the hotel's history. 1924: Named after President Theodore Roosevelt, the hotel opened just four years after the start of Prohibition, the 13-year national ban on alcohol in the United States. While Prohibition forced some city hotels to close, the area around Grand Central flourished in the postwar years, attracting commercial developers, including those behind the Roosevelt. While not among New York's most opulent hotels, the four-star property stood as a towering presence in Midtown Manhattan, rising 19 stories into the skyline. Because of Prohibition, the Roosevelt broke with tradition and featured storefronts instead of lounges and bars on its street level. It was also among the first hotels in the world to offer pet service, child care and an in-house doctor. 1929: With alcohol off the menu, the Roosevelt became a magnet for tourists and music lovers. At the height of Prohibition, famed bandleader Guy Lombardo and His Royal Canadians performed their first live show at the hotel’s Roosevelt Grill, continuing to entertain fans for the next three decades. Their rendition of 'Auld Lang Syne,' a Scottish song about old friendships and loves, became a New Year’s Eve tradition. Variety magazine later hailed Lombardo as the 'only Canadian ever to create an American tradition,' cementing his legacy at the Roosevelt. 1943: Hotel magnate Conrad Hilton bought the Roosevelt, along with The Plaza hotel, calling the Roosevelt 'a fine hotel with grand spaces,' and took up residence in its Presidential Suite. The acquisition established Hilton as the first coast-to-coast American hotel chain. Four years later, the Roosevelt made history again when it became the first to offer a television set in every room. But Hilton's ownership ended in 1956 when his company was forced to sell the property as part of an antitrust lawsuit brought by the government. 1948: The Roosevelt became a political hub in the mid-20th century, serving as the campaign headquarters for Republican presidential nominee Thomas Dewey in 1944 and 1948. Dewey lost both elections and conceded them from the hotel. In the years that followed, the hotel hosted other high-profile political events. 1970s-2010s: Starting in the 1970s, the Roosevelt, with its neoclassical facade and old- world interior, became a favorite filming location for Hollywood studios. Among the more than a dozen movies filmed there: 'The French Connection' (1971), 'Wall Street' (1987), 'Presumed Innocent' (1990) and 'Maid in Manhattan' (2002). Several TV shows have also been filmed there, among them: 'Mad Men' and 'Law & Order.' 1979: The hotel changed owners multiple times before. Pakistan International Airlines, with backing from Saudi Prince Khalid bin Faisal Al Saud, took over its management from a New York real estate family. The agreement came with the option to buy the hotel for $36.5 million after 20 years — a deal the airline finalized in 2000. Considered a national asset by the Pakistan government, the Roosevelt became the preferred lodging place for visiting Pakistani prime ministers and other dignitaries to New York. In the late 1990s, the hotel hosted a live performance in the Grand Ballroom by Junoon, Pakistan’s biggest rock band. 2020-2023: In recent decades, the Roosevelt has struggled financially. In 2020, it closed its doors to guests, citing the 'unprecedented environment' stemming from the pandemic. It received a fresh start when New York City signed a three-year, $220 million lease in 2023 to use it as a migrant shelter and processing center. But the lease proved a mere Band-Aid for the struggling hotel. In February 2024, Mayor Eric Adams announced the city was canceling the lease, marking the end of an era in New York history.	https://www.voanews.com/a/the-roosevelt-hotel-a-window-into-new-york-city-history/8006811.html	2025-03-11T09:50:57-07:00	
Trump says he'll buy a Tesla to show support for Musk	WASHINGTON — With Elon Musk facing escalating political blowback and financial troubles, U.S. President Donald Trump said he would buy a Tesla vehicle from his company, an unusual show of support from the president to his most powerful adviser. It was the latest example of how Trump has demonstrated loyalty to Musk, who spent heavily on his comeback campaign last year and has been a key figure in his second administration. The Republican president announced early Tuesday that he was going to buy a new Tesla as 'a show of confidence and support for Elon Musk, a truly great American.' Musk's electric vehicle company is being battered by sagging sales and plunging stock prices. He continues to run the automaker — as well as the social media platform X and the rocket manufacturer SpaceX — while also serving as Trump's adviser on overhauling and downsizing the federal government. 'Elon Musk is ‘putting it on the line’ in order to help our Nation, and he is doing a FANTASTIC JOB!' Trump wrote on social media. 'But the Radical Left Lunatics, as they often do, are trying to illegally and collusively boycott Tesla, one of the World’s great automakers, and Elon’s ‘baby,’ in order to attack and do harm to Elon, and everything he stands for.' The White House did not immediately elaborate on Trump's plans, such as how the purchase would be handled or where the car would be kept. Presidents almost never drive for security reasons. Joe Biden got behind the wheel of an electric truck while promoting domestic manufacturing, and Barack Obama took a spin with Jerry Seinfeld in the White House driveway for a comedy show. But regardless of the practicality of Trump's purchase, his overnight announcement about buying a Tesla represented another step in how the president has blurred lines by bringing Musk into his administration. Musk is the world's richest person, with billions of dollars in government contracts. He's also exerting sweeping influence over Trump's administration through the Department of Government Efficiency, or DOGE, and traveling frequently with the president. During an interview with the Fox Business Network on Monday, host Larry Kudlow asked Musk 'how are you running your other businesses' while also advising Trump. 'With great difficulty,' he said. 'But there’s no turning back, you say?' Kudlow responded. 'I’m just here trying to make government more efficient, eliminate waste and fraud,' Musk said. Tesla has recently faced protests and vandalism. Police are investigating gunshots fired at a dealership in Oregon, and fire officials are examining a blaze that destroyed four Cybertrucks at a Tesla lot in Seattle. At times, the White House has needed to play cleanup for Musk, who had never worked in public service before and has admitted that he'll make mistakes along the way. For example, Musk presented inflated estimates of fraud in government benefits such as Social Security on Monday, leading Democrats to argue that he was planning cuts to the popular programs. 'Most of the federal spending is entitlements,' Musk said in the interview. 'That’s the big one to eliminate.' The next morning, a White House account on X criticized news organizations as 'lying hacks' and told Democrats to 'spare us the fake outrage' about reducing benefits. 'He was clearly talking about the WASTE in the programs,' the White House posted.	https://www.voanews.com/a/trump-says-he-ll-buy-a-tesla-to-show-support-for-musk/8006879.html	2025-03-11T09:23:55-07:00	
Fate of 8 Uyghurs in Thailand in limbo after 40 deported to China	BANGKOK — Human rights advocates say at least some of the eight ethnic minority Uyghurs who remain in Thailand’s custody since authorities deported 40 others to China last month are at risk of the same fate. After weeks of denying it was planning to repatriate any of the 48 Chinese Uyghurs it had held since arresting them for illegal entry in 2014, Thailand abruptly turned 40 of them over to China on Feb. 27. The United States, United Nations and international rights groups strongly condemned Thailand for sending Uyghurs back to China. They say it violates Thailand’s international treaty obligations and, as of 2023, its own domestic law against deporting people to countries where they face a good chance of being abused or tortured. The United States and others have accused Beijing of genocide over its treatment of the Turkic-speaking Muslim minority Uyghurs in China’s western Xinjiang province. The United Nations says their treatment may amount to crimes against humanity. Beijing denies the allegations. The Thai and Chinese governments have said nothing about the eight Uyghurs who were not sent back to China last month. The two governments have ignored VOA requests for comment. But rights groups tell VOA they have confirmed that all eight remain in Thai custody — three in immigration detention without charge, with the other five serving prison sentences since 2020 for robbery and attempted escape from a detention center. They say the five in prison face the greatest risk of being deported once their prison terms end. 'After they complete their sentence, they have to come back to the immigration detention centers. That is … worrisome, because if there [is] the push from the Chinese again, these five people might be the most vulnerable group of people that will be deported again,' Kannavee Suebsang, an opposition lawmaker and deputy chair of the House of Representatives Committee on Legal Affairs, Justice and Human Rights, told VOA. He said their sentences are due to end in 2029. Rights groups, though, say the five could face a forced return to China much earlier than that if they are added to the lists of prisoners pardoned by Thailand’s king on royal holidays each year. ‘We are very concerned’ In a statement addressing the Feb. 27 deportations posted online the day after, the Thai government said China had in fact asked for the return of 45 'Chinese nationals,' referring to the Uyghurs. Krittaporn Semsantad, program director for the Peace Rights Foundation, a Thai rights group, says that number appears to include the five Uyghurs still in prison in Thailand — a sign, she believes, that China wants them returned as well. 'So, yes, we are very … concerned,' she told VOA. 'It could be very high risk and very high chance that these five will be sent back after they finish their sentence.' For the eight Uyghurs still in Thai custody, 'the danger is not passed yet,' agreed Polat Sayim, an ethnic Uyghur living in Australia and the executive committee vice chair of the World Uyghur Congress. Chalida Tajaroensuk, who heads Thailand’s People’s Empowerment Foundation, another local rights group, echoed their concerns. She told VOA she visited the five Uyghurs in prison the day after the 40 were deported and said they were terrified of being forced back to China as well. 'They are afraid, and they also cried. They don’t want to go back,' she said. ‘We need to closely monitor’ The rights groups told VOA that their sources in the Thai government and inside its detained centers have told them the other three Uyghurs also remain in Thailand, in the custody of the Bureau of Immigration. Neither China nor Thailand has explained why they were not deported along with the 40 last month. Unlike the five Uyghurs in prison, Kannavee and the rights groups say these three, who also hail from China, claimed to have come from other countries when they were first caught in Thailand, which may have helped to spare them from being sent back. 'But still we need to also closely monitor about the situation of the three, because they [have] already been disclosed, I mean their information has been disclosed that they are [from] the same group of the Uyghurs,' said Kannavee, who previously worked for the U.N.’s refugee agency in Bangladesh, Myanmar and Thailand. He was referring to the more than 300 Uyghurs Thailand caught entering the country illegally in 2014 as they sought to make their way to Turkey, where some had relatives, and other countries. Of that group, Thailand deported 173 mostly women and children to Turkey in 2015 but sent 109, most of them men, back to China days later. Those sent back to China have not been heard from since. Following the rebukes over last month’s deportations, the Thai government said Beijing had assured it that the Uyghurs would be treated well and that Bangkok could send envoys to check up on them regularly. Rights groups and opposition lawmakers such as Kannavee, though, say they take little comfort in Beijing’s promises and still hope to persuade the Thai government to let the eight Uyghurs who remain in its custody settle elsewhere. ‘We don’t have a country’ Thai officials initially claimed that no other country had offered to take in the Uyghurs but later acknowledged that some had, without naming them, and that Thailand turned them down for fear that China might retaliate. The Reuters news agency has reported that Australia, Canada and the United States all offered to resettle the Uyghurs. A spokesperson for the U.S. State Department told VOA on Sunday it had been working with Thailand for years to avoid their return to China, 'including by consistently and repeatedly offering to resettle the Uyghurs in other countries, including, at times, the United States.' Sayim, of the World Uyghur Congress, said those countries should keep their offers open for the eight Uyghurs Thailand still holds, and continue putting pressure on the Thai government to accept. 'We don’t have [a] country. That’s why we have to ask European countries if they can help. … Always we asking [the] U.S., Canada, U.K., Germany, Australia if they could make a decision and take them,' he said. 'The Thai government shouldn’t give these people back to China. They know it’s not good when they go back.'	https://www.voanews.com/a/fate-of-8-uyghurs-in-thailand-in-limbo-after-40-deported-to-china/8006723.html	2025-03-11T08:21:57-07:00	
Militants attack train, take hostages in Pakistan’s Balochistan	ISLAMABAD — Militants attacked a cross-country passenger train Tuesday in Pakistan’s restive southwestern Balochistan province, taking many hostages. Authorities say the Jaffar Express was traveling north from Quetta, the provincial capital of Balochistan, to Peshawar, the provincial capital of Khyber Pakhtunkhwa, when it came under intense fire hours after departure. The train was carrying roughly 450 passengers, including security personnel. Citing security sources, state broadcaster PTV reported militants were holding passengers hostage in the train, which was trapped inside a tunnel. A clearance operation was ongoing. The Baloch Liberation Army, or BLA, quickly claimed responsibility for the attack. In a statement to media, the banned separatist militant outfit said it had blown up tracks and taken passengers hostage. Emergency situation Earlier, Pakistan Railways officials confirmed to VOA that the train driver had been injured. 'Mobile and wireless signals are not working, and unfortunately we are not able to get in touch with the crew,' railway deputy controller Muhammad Sharifullah in Quetta told VOA. Provincial spokesperson Shahid Rind said security forces, a rescue train and ambulances had been dispatched. Located in barren, mountainous terrain, the scene of the attack is hard to reach. An emergency has been declared at the government hospital in Sibbi to receive the injured. BLA surges According to the Global Terrorism Index 2025 released last week, Pakistan experienced a 45% increase in terrorism deaths last year, compared with 2023. That is the largest year-to-year rise in more than a decade. The BLA emerged as one of the top two militant groups driving the increase. The separatist group has been fighting a deadly insurgency against the Pakistani state, accusing the government of robbing the province of its rich natural resources. The group also opposes Chinese investment in the province. Pakistan and China reject the claims that their joint ventures are depriving ethnic Baloch from economic opportunities and their share of the province's mineral wealth. Recent attacks Since the beginning of the year, the BLA has ramped up attacks on security forces and settlers and workers primarily from the eastern Punjab province. Earlier this month, a female suicide bomber detonated her explosive devices near a military convoy in Balochistan’s Kalat district, killing at least one security personnel and injuring four others. Last month, BLA insurgents ambushed a bus transporting paramilitary forces in Kalat and killed 18 of those on board. Just days later, a roadside bomb blast killed 11 coal miners in the city while the BLA took credit for attacking a military vehicle securing a supply convoy for a mining company operated by China. Pakistani authorities reported that the convoy was passing through Kalat when it came under attack, resulting in injuries to eight security personnel. VOA’s Urdu Service’s Murtaza Zehri in Quetta contributed to this report.	https://www.voanews.com/a/militants-attack-train-take-hostages-in-pakistan-s-balochistan/8006651.html	2025-03-11T07:18:23-07:00	
China misleads on involvement in Panama Canal	Through the Chinese government's Belt and Road Initiative, Chinese companies acquired or built major port facilities in 129 strategic locations, including the Panama Canal.

Protesters block main state Serbian TV building as tensions soar ahead of planned rally	Belgrade, Serbia — Several hundred student protesters have blocked Serbia's public television station building in Belgrade as tensions soar in the Balkan country, days ahead of a large rally planned for the weekend and billed as an endgame in months of anti-government demonstrations. The students first blocked the TV building in central Belgrade, Serbia's capital, late on Monday and several hundred gathered again on Tuesday, after announcing that their blockade will last for at least 22 hours. A similar blockade was organized in the country's second-largest city of Novi Sad. University students in Serbia are behind almost daily rallies that started after a concrete canopy crashed down in November at a railway station in Novi Sad, killing 15 people. The protests have rocked the populist rule of President Aleksandar Vucic and his firm grip on power. During the blockade late Monday, riot police briefly intervened with batons as the crowd tried to block one of the entrances to the TV building with metal security fences. At least one plainclothes police officer was injured in skirmishes after apparently being struck in the head by a uniformed officer, according to a video released on social media. The students blame public TV for biased reporting and for siding with Vucic and the government during the demonstrations. The Serbian president was the guest of the main TV news bulletin on Monday evening. During the interview, Vucic insulted the student-led protests, warning that security forces will use force against participants of the big rally planned for Saturday. He pledged never to step down because of the massive nationwide demonstrations. 'You will have to kill me if you want to replace me,' he said, The TV reporter who interviewed Vucic called the protesting students 'a mob,' which the president appeared to approve of. The station, RTS, issued a statement, denouncing the blockade. 'Forcibly preventing RTS employees from coming to their workplaces represents a dangerous step into open conflicts with unpredictable consequences,' it said. Some of the TV station's employees apparently managed to enter the building through a side entrance that's not publicly known, allowing the program to continue uninterrupted. Meanwhile, Vucic met with U.S. President Donald Trump's eldest son, Donald Trump Jr., who arrived in Belgrade on Tuesday. The purpose of his visit was not immediately known. Pro-Russian Vucic is a vocal supporter of the U.S. president. Many in Serbia believe that the huge concrete construction fell down because of poor renovation work fueled by government corruption. The students have insisted on full accountability in the tragedy, a call that has garnered widespread support among citizens who are largely disillusioned with politicians and have lost trust in state institutions. Student-led rallies have drawn tens of thousands of people, becoming among the biggest ever in Serbia, which has a long history of anti-government protests. Vucic has described the rallies as a Western-orchestrated ploy to oust him from power. The next big rally is planned on Saturday in Belgrade and Vucic has alleged the protesters 'will try to achieve something with violence and that will be the end.' Many demonstrators 'will end up behind bars accused of criminal acts,' he added. All student-led protests in the past months have mostly been peaceful, while incidents were recorded when opponents drove their cars into protest blockades or attacked the protesters. Vucic and his right-wing Serbian Progressive Party have held a firm grip on power in Serbia for over a decade, facing accusations of stifling democratic freedoms despite formally seeking European Union entry for Serbia. Authorities have indicted 16 people over the canopy collapse, but many doubt that the actual culprits will face justice.	https://www.voanews.com/a/protesters-block-main-state-serbian-tv-building-as-tensions-soar-ahead-of-planned-rally/8006639.html	2025-03-11T07:03:10-07:00	
Fact-finding group for Syrian killings says no one above the law	DAMASCUS, SYRIA — A Syrian fact-finding committee investigating sectarian killings during clashes between the army and loyalists of ousted President Bashar al-Assad said on Tuesday that no one was above the law and that it would seek the arrest and prosecution of any perpetrators. Pressure has been growing on Syria's Islamist-led government to investigate after reports by witnesses and a war monitor of the killing of hundreds of civilians in villages where most of the population are members of the ousted president's Alawite sect. 'No one is above the law. The committee will relay all the results to the entity that launched it, the presidency, and the judiciary,' committee spokesperson Yasser Farhan said in a televised press conference. The committee was preparing lists of witnesses and potential perpetrators, and it would refer any suspects with sufficient evidence against them to the judiciary, Farhan said. The U.N human rights office said entire families, including women and children, were killed in the coastal region as part of a series of sectarian slayings by the army against an insurgency by Assad loyalists. Syrian interim President Ahmed al-Sharaa told Reuters in an interview on Monday that he could not yet say whether forces from Syria's Defense Ministry — which has incorporated former rebel factions under one structure — were involved in the sectarian killings. Asked whether the committee would seek international help to document violations, Farhan said it was 'open' to cooperation but would prefer using its own national mechanisms. The violence began to spiral on Thursday, when the authorities said their forces in the coastal region came under attack from fighters aligned with the ousted Assad regime. The Sunni Islamist-led government poured reinforcements into the area to crush what it described as a deadly, well-planned and premeditated assault by remnants of the Assad government. But Sharaa acknowledged to Reuters that some armed groups had entered without prior coordination with the Defense Ministry. The Alawites are the second-largest religious group in Syria after Sunni Muslims. Their faith is an offshoot Shiite Islam.	https://www.voanews.com/a/fact-finding-group-for-syrian-killings-says-no-one-above-the-law/8006599.html	2025-03-11T06:32:33-07:00	
Gunmen storm hotel in central Somalia, siege ongoing	MOGADISHU — Gunmen stormed a hotel in the town of Baladweyne in central Somalia on Tuesday where local elders and government officials were meeting and a siege is ongoing, witnesses and relatives told Reuters. Dahir Amin Jesow, a federal lawmaker from Baladweyne, said so far at least four people had been killed but that 'we are still counting casualties.' Islamist militant group Al-Shabab claimed responsibility for the attack in a statement and said it had killed over 10 people. Al-Shabab frequently launches bombings and gun attacks in the fragile Horn of Africa nation as it tries to topple the government and establish its own rule based on its strict interpretation of Islamic Sharia law. 'We first heard a huge blast followed by gunfire, then another blast was heard,' said Ali Suleiman, a shopkeeper who witnessed the attack. Parts of the Qahira Hotel had been reduced to rubble as government troops and gunmen exchanged fire, Suleiman added. Another witness who lives near the hotel, Halima Nur, said gunfire was ringing out intermittently as the siege continued.	https://www.voanews.com/a/gunmen-storm-hotel-in-central-somalia-siege-ongoing-/8006503.html	2025-03-11T05:36:09-07:00	
Nervous and rushed': Massive Fukushima plant cleanup exposes workers to high radiation and stress	OKUMA, Japan — The Fukushima Daiichi nuclear power plant's radiation levels have significantly dropped since the cataclysmic meltdown 14 years ago Tuesday. Workers walk around in many areas wearing only surgical masks and regular clothes. It's a different story for those who enter the reactor buildings, including the three damaged in the 2011 earthquake and tsunami. They must use maximum protection — full facemasks with filters, multi-layered gloves and socks, shoe covers, hooded hazmat coveralls and a waterproof jacket, and a helmet. As workers remove melted fuel debris from the reactors in a monumental nuclear cleanup effort that could take more than a century, they are facing both huge amounts of psychological stress and dangerous levels of radiation. The Associated Press, which recently visited the plant for a tour and interviews, takes a closer look. Cleaning 880 tons of melted fuel debris A remote-controlled extendable robot with a tong had several mishaps including equipment failures before returning in November with a tiny piece of melted fuel from inside the damaged No. 2 reactor. That first successful test run is a crucial step in what will be a daunting, decades-long decommissioning that must deal with at least 880 tons of melted nuclear fuel that has mixed with broken parts of internal structures and other debris inside the three ruined reactors. Akira Ono, chief decommissioning officer at the Tokyo Electric Power Company Holdings, which manages the plant, says even the tiny sample gives officials a lot of information about the melted fuel. More samples are needed, however, to make the work smoother when bigger efforts to remove the debris begin in the 2030s. A second sample-retrieval mission at the No. 2 reactor is expected in coming weeks. Operators hope to send the extendable robot farther into the reactor to take samples closer to the center, where overheated nuclear fuel fell from the core, utility spokesperson Masakatsu Takata said. He pointed out the target area as he stood inside the inner structure of the No. 5 reactor, which is one of two reactors that survived the tsunami. It has an identical design as No. 2. Hard to see, breathe or move Radiation levels are still dangerously high inside the No. 2 reactor building, where the melted fuel debris is behind a thick concrete containment wall. Earlier decontamination work reduced those radiation levels to a fraction of what they used to be. In late August, small groups took turns doing their work helping the robot in 15- to 30-minute shifts to minimize radiation exposure. They have a remotely controlled robot, but it has to be manually pushed in and out. 'Working under high levels of radiation [during a short] time limit made us feel nervous and rushed,' said Yasunobu Yokokawa, a team leader for the mission. 'It was a difficult assignment.' Full-face masks reduced visibility and made breathing difficult, an extra waterproof jacket made it sweaty and hard to move, and triple-layered gloves made their fingers clumsy, Yokokawa said. To eliminate unnecessary exposure, they taped around gloves and socks and carried a personal dosimeter to measure radiation. Workers also rehearsed the tasks they'd perform to minimize exposure. The mission stalled early on when workers noticed that a set of five 1.5-meter pipes meant to push the robot into the reactor's primary containment vessel had been arranged in the wrong order. A camera on the robot also failed because of high radioactivity and had to be replaced. The workers' highest individual radiation dose was more than the overall average but still far below anything approaching a 100-millisievert five-year dose limit. Even so, a growing number of workers are concerned about safety and radiation at the plant, said Ono, the decommissioning chief, citing an annual survey of about 5,5,00 workers. In 2023, two workers splashed with contaminated sludge at a water treatment facility suffered burns and were hospitalized, though they had no other health problems. Making sure it's safe Yokokawa and a plant colleague, Hiroshi Ide, helped in the 2011 emergency and work as team leaders today. They say they want to make the job safer as workers face high radiation in parts of the plant. On the top floor of the No. 2 reactor, workers are setting up equipment to remove spent fuel units from the cooling pool. That's set to begin within two to three years. At the No. 1 reactor, workers are putting up a giant roof to contain radioactive dust from decontamination work on the top floor ahead of the removal of spent fuel. To minimize exposure and increase efficiency, workers use a remote-controlled crane to attach pre-assembled parts, according to TEPCO. The No. 1 reactor and its surroundings are among the most contaminated parts of the plant. What’s next? Workers are also removing treated radioactive wastewater. They recently started dismantling the emptied water tanks to make room to build facilities needed for the research and storage of melted fuel debris. After a series of small missions by robots to gather samples, experts will determine a larger-scale method for removing melted fuel, first at the No. 3 reactor. Experts say the hard work and huge challenges of decommissioning the plant are just beginning. There are estimations that the work could take more than a century. The government and TEPCO have an initial completion target of 2051, but the retrieval of melted fuel debris is already three years behind, and many big issues remain undecided. Ide, whose home in Namie town, northwest of the plant, is in a no-go zone because of nuclear contamination, still has to put on a hazmat suit, even for brief visits home. 'As a Fukushima citizen, I would like to make sure the decommissioning work is done properly so that people can return home without worries,' he said.	https://www.voanews.com/a/nervous-and-rushed-massive-fukushima-plant-cleanup-exposes-workers-to-high-radiation-and-stress-/8006467.html	2025-03-11T04:29:26-07:00	
Greenland election tests independence ambitions as US interest looms	NUUK, Greenland — Greenland residents vote on Tuesday in a closely watched election brought into the international spotlight by a pledge from U.S. President Donald Trump to take control of the mineral-rich island. Since taking office in January, Trump has vowed to make Greenland, a semi-autonomous territory of Denmark, part of the United States, saying it is vital to U.S. security interests. The island, with a population of just 57,000, has been caught up in a geopolitical race for dominance in the Arctic, where melting ice caps are making its resources more accessible and opening new shipping routes. Both Russia and China have intensified military activity in the region. Greenland, a former colony and a Danish territory since 1953, is three times the size of Texas. It gained some autonomy in 1979 when its first parliament was formed, but Copenhagen controls foreign affairs, defense and monetary policy and provides just under $1 billion a year to the economy. In 2009, it won the right to declare full independence through a referendum, though has not done so, on concern living standards would drop without Denmark's economic support. However, Trump's interest has shaken up the status quo and coupled with the growing pride of the indigenous people in their Inuit culture, put independence front and center in the election. 'The question of independence was put on steroids by Trump,' said Masaana Egede, editor of local newspaper Sermitsiaq. 'It has put a lid on everyday issues.' Polling stations are open for 11 hours on Tuesday. The final result is expected on Wednesday. No polls or exit polls are expected. A January poll suggested a majority of Greenland's inhabitants support independence, but are divided over the timing and potential impact on living standards. Reuters spoke to more than a dozen Greenlanders in the capital Nuuk, all of whom said they favored independence, although many expressed concern that a swift transition could damage the economy and eliminate Nordic welfare services like universal healthcare and free schooling. The island holds substantial natural resources, including critical minerals such as rare earths used in high-tech industries, ranging from electric vehicles to missile systems. However, Greenland has been slow to extract them due to environmental concerns, severe weather, and China's near-total control of the sector, which has made it difficult for companies elsewhere to make a profit or secure buyers. Investment pledges Trump initially declined to rule out military force, alarming many Greenlanders, although he later softened his stance, stating he would respect the will of the local people and was 'ready to invest billions of dollars' if they joined the U.S. Greenland's Prime Minister Mute Egede has stressed the island is not for sale and advocated for a broad coalition government to resist external pressure. In an interview aired on Monday by Danish broadcaster DR, he dismissed Trump's offer as disrespectful, expressing willingness to cooperate with other countries instead. All six main parties, including the ruling Inuit Ataqatigiit and government coalition partner Siumut, support independence but differ on how and when it could be achieved. The pro-independence Naleraq party, the leading opposition force, has gained momentum ahead of the election, bolstered by U.S. interest and fresh accusations of Denmark's historic exploitation of Greenland's mineral wealth. 'This is our independence election,' said Qunanuk Olsen, a Naleraq candidate. The party believes U.S. interest strengthens Greenland's position in secession talks with Denmark and aims to bring a deal with Copenhagen to a vote before the next election in four years.	https://www.voanews.com/a/greenland-election-tests-independence-ambitions-as-us-interest-looms-/8006448.html	2025-03-11T04:05:51-07:00	
Stena Immaculate tanker spills fuel; Solong has toxic chemicals	WITHERNSEA, England — Fires continued to burn on Tuesday after two ships collided off the coast of northeast England a day earlier, adding to concerns the jet fuel carried by one and toxic chemicals aboard the other could cause an environmental disaster. Following the crash, both crews abandoned their ships and 36 people were brought ashore, the coastguard said. Rescue teams on Monday called off a search for a missing crew member from the Portuguese-flagged container ship Solong. The tanker Stena Immaculate, which carries jet fuel for the U.S. military, was at anchor when it was struck by the smaller Solong, releasing fuel into the sea. Equipment to minimize pollution at sea, such as spray dispersants for oil spills and containment booms, were on standby, said the British government, as its agencies prepared for action to protect the North Sea environment and wildlife. The potential environmental impact was being assessed, coordinated by the Maritime and Coastguard Agency and an East of England environmental group, and the situation was being monitored overhead by plane, the government said. Environmental harm? Two maritime security sources said there was no indication that malicious activity or actors were involved in the incident. The Stena Immaculate was carrying 220,000 barrels of jet fuel in 16 segregated cargo tanks, but it was unclear how much of it was spilt after at least one tank was hit, Crowley, the U.S. logistics group which operated the vessel, said on Monday. Onboard the Solong were 15 containers of sodium cyanide, a toxic chemical used mainly in gold mining, and an unknown quantity of alcohol, according to a casualty report from maritime data provider Lloyd's List Intelligence. Those cargoes could pollute the sea, harming large colonies of protected seabirds including puffins and gannets which live on the coast in the area, and the fish on which they feed. The crash occurred on Monday morning in a busy waterway, prompting a significant rescue response from British teams who sent aircraft, lifeboats and other vessels. While Britain's Marine Accident Investigation Branch will gather initial evidence, overall responsibility for investigating the crash lies with the U.S. and Portuguese authorities, the flag states of the vessels.	https://www.voanews.com/a/stena-immaculate-tanker-spills-fuel-solong-has-toxic-chemicals/8006438.html	2025-03-11T03:42:11-07:00	
Nervous and rushed': Massive Fukushima plant cleanup exposes workers to high radiation and stress	OKUMA, Japan — The Fukushima Daiichi nuclear power plant's radiation levels have significantly dropped since the cataclysmic meltdown 14 years ago Tuesday. Workers walk around in many areas wearing only surgical masks and regular clothes. It's a different story for those who enter the reactor buildings, including the three damaged in the 2011 earthquake and tsunami. They must use maximum protection — full facemasks with filters, multi-layered gloves and socks, shoe covers, hooded hazmat coveralls and a waterproof jacket, and a helmet. As workers remove melted fuel debris from the reactors in a monumental nuclear cleanup effort that could take more than a century, they are facing both huge amounts of psychological stress and dangerous levels of radiation. The Associated Press, which recently visited the plant for a tour and interviews, takes a closer look. Cleaning 880 tons of melted fuel debris A remote-controlled extendable robot with a tong had several mishaps including equipment failures before returning in November with a tiny piece of melted fuel from inside the damaged No. 2 reactor. That first successful test run is a crucial step in what will be a daunting, decades-long decommissioning that must deal with at least 880 tons of melted nuclear fuel that has mixed with broken parts of internal structures and other debris inside the three ruined reactors. Akira Ono, chief decommissioning officer at the Tokyo Electric Power Company Holdings, which manages the plant, says even the tiny sample gives officials a lot of information about the melted fuel. More samples are needed, however, to make the work smoother when bigger efforts to remove the debris begin in the 2030s. A second sample-retrieval mission at the No. 2 reactor is expected in coming weeks. Operators hope to send the extendable robot farther into the reactor to take samples closer to the center, where overheated nuclear fuel fell from the core, utility spokesperson Masakatsu Takata said. He pointed out the target area as he stood inside the inner structure of the No. 5 reactor, which is one of two reactors that survived the tsunami. It has an identical design as No. 2. Hard to see, breathe or move Radiation levels are still dangerously high inside the No. 2 reactor building, where the melted fuel debris is behind a thick concrete containment wall. Earlier decontamination work reduced those radiation levels to a fraction of what they used to be. In late August, small groups took turns doing their work helping the robot in 15- to 30-minute shifts to minimize radiation exposure. They have a remotely controlled robot, but it has to be manually pushed in and out. 'Working under high levels of radiation (during a short) time limit made us feel nervous and rushed,' said Yasunobu Yokokawa, a team leader for the mission. 'It was a difficult assignment.' Full-face masks reduced visibility and made breathing difficult, an extra waterproof jacket made it sweaty and hard to move, and triple-layered gloves made their fingers clumsy, Yokokawa said. To eliminate unnecessary exposure, they taped around gloves and socks and carried a personal dosimeter to measure radiation. Workers also rehearsed the tasks they'd perform to minimize exposure. The mission stalled early on when workers noticed that a set of five 1.5-meter pipes meant to push the robot into the reactor's primary containment vessel had been arranged in the wrong order. A camera on the robot also failed because of high radioactivity and had to be replaced. The workers' highest individual radiation dose was more than the overall average but still far below anything approaching a 100-millisievert five-year dose limit. Even so, a growing number of workers are concerned about safety and radiation at the plant, said Ono, the decommissioning chief, citing an annual survey of about 5,5,00 workers. In 2023, two workers splashed with contaminated sludge at a water treatment facility suffered burns and were hospitalized, though they had no other health problems. Making sure it's safe Yokokawa and a plant colleague, Hiroshi Ide, helped in the 2011 emergency and work as team leaders today. They say they want to make the job safer as workers face high radiation in parts of the plant. On the top floor of the No. 2 reactor, workers are setting up equipment to remove spent fuel units from the cooling pool. That's set to begin within two to three years. At the No. 1 reactor, workers are putting up a giant roof to contain radioactive dust from decontamination work on the top floor ahead of the removal of spent fuel. To minimize exposure and increase efficiency, workers use a remote-controlled crane to attach pre-assembled parts, according to TEPCO. The No. 1 reactor and its surroundings are among the most contaminated parts of the plant. What’s next? Workers are also removing treated radioactive wastewater. They recently started dismantling the emptied water tanks to make room to build facilities needed for the research and storage of melted fuel debris. After a series of small missions by robots to gather samples, experts will determine a larger-scale method for removing melted fuel, first at the No. 3 reactor. Experts say the hard work and huge challenges of decommissioning the plant are just beginning. There are estimations that the work could take more than a century. The government and TEPCO have an initial completion target of 2051, but the retrieval of melted fuel debris is already three years behind, and many big issues remain undecided. Ide, whose home in Namie town, northwest of the plant, is in a no-go zone because of nuclear contamination, still has to put on a hazmat suit, even for brief visits home. 'As a Fukushima citizen, I would like to make sure the decommissioning work is done properly so that people can return home without worries,' he said.	https://www.voanews.com/a/nervous-and-rushed-massive-fukushima-plant-cleanup-exposes-workers-to-high-radiation-and-stress/8006373.html	2025-03-11T02:04:42-07:00	
Uganda says special forces deploy in South Sudan capital amid tensions	NAIROBI, KENYA — Uganda's military chief said Tuesday his country had deployed special forces in South Sudan's capital Juba to 'secure it' as tensions between President Salva Kiir and his First Vice President Riek Machar stoke fears of a return to civil war. Tensions have been growing in recent days in South Sudan, an oil producer, after Kiir's government detained two ministers and several senior military officials allied with Machar. One minister has since been released. The arrests in Juba and deadly clashes around the northern town of Nasir are seen as jeopardizing 2018 peace deal that ended a five-year civil war between forces loyal to Kiir and Machar that cost nearly 400,000 lives. 'As of two days ago, our Special Forces units entered Juba to secure it,' Uganda's military chief, Muhoozi Kainerugaba, said in a series of posts on the X platform overnight into Tuesday. 'We the UPDF (Ugandan military), only recognize one President of South Sudan, H.E. Salva Kiir ... any move against him is a declaration of war against Uganda,' he said in another post. South Sudan government information minister and the military spokesperson did not pick up phone calls seeking comment. After the civil war erupted in South Sudan in 2013, Uganda deployed its troops in Juba to bolster Kiir's forces against Machar. They were eventually withdrawn in 2015. Ugandan troops were again deployed in Juba in 2016 after fighting reignited between the two sides but they also were eventually withdrawn. Uganda fears a full-blown conflagration in its northern neighbor could send waves of refugees across the border and potentially create instability. Kainerugaba did not say whether the latest deployment was in response to a request from Kiir's government or how long the troops would remain in South Sudan.	https://www.voanews.com/a/uganda-says-special-forces-deploy-in-south-sudan-capital-amid-tensions/8006369.html	2025-03-11T01:49:52-07:00	
Ukrainian drone attacks target 10 Russian regions, kill 1 person in Moscow	Russian officials said Tuesday that Ukrainian attacks involving more than 90 drones killed at least one person and injured three others in the Moscow region. The assault was part of an overall attack overnight that included more than 300 Ukrainian drones targeting 10 Russian regions stretching from border areas to the Russian capital. Andrei Vorobyov, governor of the Moscow region, said on Telegram that in addition to those hurt, there was also damage to an apartment building from falling drone debris. The attack also forced flight restrictions at Moscow airports and interrupted train services. Russia’s Defense Ministry said it shot down 91 drones in the Moscow area, and a total of 337 across all regions. The ministry said it intercepted 126 drones over the Kursk region, 38 over Bryansk, 25 over Belgorod, 22 over Ryazan and others over Kaluga, Lipetsk, Oryol, Voronezh and Nizhny Novgorod. Belgorod Governor Vyacheslav Gladkov said on Telegram that drone debris knocked out power to some part of his region and damaged multiple residential buildings. Officials in Kaluga also reported damage to several buildings, while one person was reported hurt in Lipetsk. Some information for this story was provided by The Associated Press, Agence France-Presse and Reuters.	https://www.voanews.com/a/ukrainian-drone-attacks-target-10-russian-regions-kill-1-person-in-moscow/8006346.html	2025-03-10T23:53:46-07:00	
Dalai Lama says his successor to be born outside China	NEW DELHI — The Dalai Lama's successor will be born outside China, the spiritual leader of Tibetan Buddhism says in a new book, raising the stakes in a dispute with Beijing over control of the Himalayan region he fled more than six decades ago. Tibetans worldwide want the institution of the Dalai Lama to continue after the 89-year-old's death, he writes in 'Voice for the Voiceless,' which was reviewed by Reuters and is being released on Tuesday. He had previously said the line of spiritual leaders might end with him. His book marks the first time the Dalai Lama has specified that his successor would be born in the 'free world,' which he describes as outside China. He has previously said only that he could reincarnate outside Tibet, possibly in India where he lives in exile. 'Since the purpose of a reincarnation is to carry on the work of the predecessor, the new Dalai Lama will be born in the free world so that the traditional mission of the Dalai Lama - that is, to be the voice for universal compassion, the spiritual leader of Tibetan Buddhism, and the symbol of Tibet embodying the aspirations of the Tibetan people - will continue,' the Dalai Lama writes. Tenzin Gyatso, the 14th Dalai Lama, fled at the age of 23 to India with thousands of other Tibetans in 1959 after a failed uprising against the rule of Mao Zedong's Communists. Beijing insists it will choose his successor, but the Dalai Lama has said any successor named by China would not be respected. China brands the Dalai Lama, who won the Nobel Peace Prize in 1989 for keeping alive the Tibetan cause, as a 'separatist.' When asked about the book at a press briefing on Monday, a spokesperson for China's foreign ministry said the Dalai Lama 'is a political exile who is engaged in anti-China separatist activities under the cloak of religion. 'On the Tibet issue, China's position is consistent and clear. What the Dalai Lama says and does, cannot change the objective fact of Tibet's prosperity and development.' Beijing said last month it hoped the Dalai Lama would 'return to the right path' and that it was open to discussing his future if he met such conditions as recognizing that Tibet and Taiwan are inalienable parts of China, whose sole legal government is that of the People's Republic of China. That proposal has been rejected by the Tibetan parliament-in-exile in India. Supporters of the Dalai Lama and the Tibetan cause include Richard Gere, a follower of Tibetan Buddhism, and Nancy Pelosi, the former speaker of the U.S. House of Representatives. His followers have been worried about his health, especially after knee surgery last year. He told Reuters in December that he might live to be 110. In his book, the Dalai Lama says he has received numerous petitions for more than a decade from a wide spectrum of Tibetan people, including senior monks and Tibetans living in Tibet and outside, 'uniformly asking me to ensure that the Dalai Lama lineage be continued.' Tibetan tradition holds that the soul of a senior Buddhist monk is reincarnated in the body of a child on his death. The current Dalai Lama was identified as the reincarnation of his predecessor when he was two. The book, which the Dalai Lama calls an account of his dealings with Chinese leaders over seven decades, is being published on Tuesday in the U.S. by William Morrow and in Britain by HarperNonFiction, with HarperCollins publications to follow in India and other countries. The Dalai Lama, who has said he will release details about his succession around his 90th birthday in July, writes that his homeland remains 'in the grip of repressive Communist Chinese rule' and that the campaign for the freedom of the Tibetan people will continue 'no matter what,' even after his death. He expressed faith in the Tibetan government and parliament-in-exile, based with him in India's Himalayan city of Dharamshala, to carry on the political work for the Tibetan cause. 'The right of the Tibetan people to be the custodians of their own homeland cannot be indefinitely denied, nor can their aspiration for freedom be crushed forever through oppression,' he writes. 'One clear lesson we know from history is this: if you keep people permanently unhappy, you cannot have a stable society.' Given his advanced age, he writes, his hopes of going back to Tibet look 'increasingly unlikely.'	https://www.voanews.com/a/dalai-lama-says-his-successor-to-be-born-outside-china/8006345.html	2025-03-10T23:51:34-07:00	
Only seven countries met WHO air quality standards in 2024, data shows	SINGAPORE — Only seven countries met World Health Organization air quality standards last year, data showed on Tuesday, as researchers warned that the war on smog would only get harder after the United States shut down its global monitoring efforts. Chad and Bangladesh were the world's most polluted countries in 2024, with average smog levels more than 15 times higher than WHO guidelines, according to figures compiled by Swiss air quality monitoring firm IQAir. Only Australia, New Zealand, the Bahamas, Barbados, Grenada, Estonia and Iceland made the grade, IQAir said. Significant data gaps, especially in Asia and Africa, cloud the worldwide picture, and many developing countries have relied on air quality sensors mounted on U.S. embassy and consulate buildings to track their smog levels. However, the State Department has recently ended the scheme, citing budget constraints, with more than 17 years of data removed last week from the U.S. government's official air quality monitoring site, airnow.gov, including readings collected in Chad. 'Most countries have a few other data sources, but it's going to impact Africa significantly, because often times these are the only sources of publicly available real-time air quality monitoring data,' said Christi Chester-Schroeder, IQAir's air quality science manager. Data concerns meant Chad was excluded from IQAir's 2023 list, but it was also ranked the most polluted country in 2022, plagued by Sahara dust as well as uncontrolled crop burning. Average concentrations of small, hazardous airborne particles known as PM2.5 hit 91.8 micrograms per cubic meter (mg/cu m) last year in the country, slightly higher than 2022. The WHO recommends levels of no more than 5 mg/cu m, a standard met by only 17% of cities last year. India, fifth in the smog rankings behind Chad, Bangladesh, Pakistan and the Democratic Republic of Congo, saw average PM2.5 fall 7% on the year to 50.6 mg/cu m. But it accounted for 12 of the top 20 most polluted cities, with Byrnihat, in a heavily industrialized part of the country's northeast, in first place, registering an average PM2.5 level of 128 mg/cu m. Climate change is playing an increasing role in driving up pollution, Chester-Schroeder warned, with higher temperatures causing fiercer and lengthier forest fires that swept through parts of Southeast Asia and South America. Christa Hasenkopf, director of the Clean Air Program at the University of Chicago's Energy Policy Institute (EPIC), said at least 34 countries will lose access to reliable pollution data after the U.S. program was closed. The State Department scheme improved air quality in the cities where the monitors were placed, boosting life expectancy and even reducing hazard allowances for U.S. diplomats, meaning that it paid for itself, Hasenkopf said. '(It) is a giant blow to air quality efforts worldwide,' she said.	https://www.voanews.com/a/only-seven-countries-met-who-air-quality-standards-in-2024-data-shows/8006336.html	2025-03-10T23:12:46-07:00	
Ukraine to present peace plan in US talks	Jeddah, Saudi Arabia — krainian officials are expected to present a partial ceasefire plan with Russia during talks Tuesday with U.S. officials in Saudi Arabia. The Ukrainian plan includes halting long-range missiles strikes and a truce covering the Black Sea. Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy was not expected to take part in Tuesday’s meetings, with Ukraine represented by his chief of staff Andriy Yermak, Ukrainian Foreign Minister Andrii Sybiha, Defense Minister Rustem Umerov and military commander Pavlo Palisa. Zelenskyy said on X ahead of the talks that Ukraine hopes for 'practical outcomes.' U.S. Secretary of State Marco Rubio and national security adviser Mike Waltz lead the U.S. delegation amid President Donald Trump’s push to broker a swift end to the war that began in early 2022 with Russia’s full-scale invasion of Ukraine. Rubio said Monday the United States hopes to resolve the pause in aid to Ukraine. He said the U.S. is in a listening mode and aims to understand what concessions Ukraine might be willing to make. 'The Ukrainians are already receiving all defensive intelligence information as we speak. I think all the notion of the pause in aid broadly is something I hope we can resolve. Obviously, I think what happens tomorrow will be key to that,' Rubio told reporters aboard a military plane before landing in Jeddah. 'We're not going to be sitting in a room drawing lines on a map, but just get a general sense of what concessions are in the realm of the possible for them [Ukrainians],' Rubio said, adding that there is no military solution to the war, and that both Russia and Ukraine need to 'do difficult things.' Later on Monday, Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman met with Rubio in the Red Sea port city of Jeddah. Salman held a separate meeting with Zelenskyy in Riyadh earlier in the day. Mineral deal? Trump has voiced interest in making continued military aid conditional on access to Ukraine's raw materials. More than four dozen minerals, including several types of rare earths, nickel and lithium, are considered critical to the U.S. economy and national defense. Ukraine has large deposits of uranium, lithium and titanium. But Rubio clarified that securing a deal on Ukraine's mineral resources was not the primary focus of Tuesday’s talks. 'There's still more details to work out, and at this point, we're probably — rather than a memorandum of understanding — just wanting to sign a specific agreement. And that would take a little bit more time,' he told reporters. 'I wouldn't prejudge tomorrow by whether or not we have a minerals deal. ... It's an important topic, but it's not the main topic on the agenda,' Rubio added. Rubio also credited Britain and France for playing a constructive role in talks with Ukraine. He told VOA that there have been no discussions about China playing a role in postwar peacekeeping and reconstruction in Ukraine. This marks Rubio’s second visit to Saudi Arabia since taking office. He and other senior U.S. officials held talks with Russian officials in Riyadh on February 18. He is scheduled to travel to Canada on Wednesday for meetings with G7 foreign ministers.

Former Philippine leader Duterte arrested on an ICC warrant over drug killings	MANILA, PHILIPPINES — Former Philippine President Rodrigo Duterte was arrested by police at Manila's international airport Tuesday on order of the International Criminal Court in connection with a case of crime against humanity filed against him, the Philippine government said. Duterte was arrested after arriving from Hong Kong and police took him into custody on orders of the ICC, which has been investigating the massive killings that happened under the former president's deadly crackdown against illegal drugs, President Ferdinand Marcos' office said in a statement. The Manila office of the International Police received an official copy of the arrest warrant from the global court and the notice for an arrest warrant was served to the former president, the government said. It was not immediately clear where Duterte was taken by the police. The government said the 79-year-old former leader was in good health and was examined by government doctors. 'He's now in the custody of authorities,' the government said. The ICC began investigating drug killings under Duterte from Nov. 1, 2011, when he was still mayor of the southern city of Davao, to March 16, 2019, as possible crimes against humanity. Duterte withdrew the Philippines in 2019 from the Rome Statute in a move human rights activists say was aimed at escaping accountability. The Duterte administration moved to suspend the global court's investigation in late 2021 by arguing that Philippine authorities were already looking into the same allegations, arguing the ICC — a court of last resort — didn't have jurisdiction. Appeals judges at the ICC ruled in 2023 the investigation could resume and rejected the Duterte administration's objections. Based in The Hague, the Netherlands, the ICC can step in when countries are unwilling or unable to prosecute suspects in the most heinous international crimes, including genocide, war crimes and crimes against humanity. President Ferdinand Marcos Jr., who succeeded Duterte in 2022 and became entangled in a bitter political dispute with the former president, has decided not to rejoin the global court. But the Marcos administration has said it would cooperate if the ICC asks international police to take Duterte into custody through a so-called Red Notice, a request for law enforcement agencies worldwide to locate and temporarily arrest a crime suspect.	https://www.voanews.com/a/former-philippine-leader-duterte-arrested-on-an-icc-warrant-over-drug-killings/8006312.html	2025-03-10T21:15:07-07:00

Coffee theft surges in the US as prices for the beans soar	Theft of truck loads of green coffee beans is surging in the United States, the world's largest importer of the commodity, as prices for the beans increased to all-time highs in the last year, according to transportation companies. The issue was discussed by market participants over the weekend in Houston, where the U.S. National Coffee Association held its annual conference. The U.S. is the world's largest consumer of the beverage. Since coffee is only produced in warmer geographies, it has to import nearly 100% of what it uses and transport millions of bags from ports to roasting plants, mostly via trucks. 'There were dozens of thefts in the last year, something that would happen only rarely in the past,' said Todd Costley, logistic sales coordinator for Hartley Transportation, a freight broker in Pembroke, New Hampshire. Theft of coffee has been reported in producing countries such as Brazil and Vietnam, usually in farms where the beans are temporarily stored after the harvest. Those sites are more vulnerable because they are isolated. Armed men took 500 bags of coffee worth around $230,000 from a farm in Brazil's Minas Gerais state in January, according to the local police. In the U.S., the thefts have been done by organized gangs who disguise as transportation companies. Costley said those fake companies are in the market trying to get small contracts from importers by offering better prices or immediate availability of trucks. 'Importers should be careful about who they hire,' he said. 'Once they get the coffee, they disappear.' Each truck load has about 19,958 kg of green beans, which at current market value is worth around $180,000. Some market participants believe the gangs then try to sell the beans to smaller roasters, which are feeling the pain from sky-high prices. Some importers have started attaching tracking devices to the coffee bags, in an effort to protect their shipments.	https://www.voanews.com/a/coffee-theft-surges-in-the-us-as-prices-for-the-beans-soar/8006281.html	2025-03-10T19:13:15-07:00	
Activist's arrest raises questions on US protections for foreign students, green card holders	WASHINGTON — The arrest of a Palestinian activist who helped organize campus protests of the war in Gaza has sparked questions about whether foreign students and green card holders are protected against being deported from the U.S. Mahmoud Khalil was arrested Saturday by Immigration and Customs Enforcement agents. Homeland Security officials and President Donald Trump have indicated that the arrest was directly tied to his role in the protests last spring at Columbia University in New York City. Khalil is being held at an immigration detention center in Jena, Louisiana, while he awaits immigration court proceedings that could eventually lead to his deportation. His arrest has drawn criticism that he's being unfairly and unlawfully targeted for his activism while the federal government has essentially described him as a terrorist sympathizer. Here is a look at what the protections for foreign students and green card holders are and what might be next for Khalil: Can someone with a green card be deported? A green card holder is someone who has lawful permanent residence status in the United States. Jaclyn Kelley-Widmer teaches immigration law at Cornell Law School. She said lawful permanent residents generally have many protections and 'should be the most protected short of a U.S. citizen.' But that protection is not absolute. Green card holders can still be deported for committing certain crimes, failing to notify immigration officials of a change in address, or engaging in marriage fraud, for example. The Department of Homeland Security said Khalil was taken into custody because of Trump's executive orders prohibiting antisemitism. Trump has argued that protesters forfeited their rights to remain in the country by supporting the Palestinian group Hamas, which controls Gaza and has been designated as a terrorist organization by the United States. Khalil and other student leaders of Columbia University Apartheid Divest have rejected claims of antisemitism, saying they are part of a broader anti-war movement that also includes Jewish students and groups. But the protest coalition, at times, has also voiced support for leaders of Hamas and Hezbollah, another Islamist organization designated by the U.S. as a terrorist group. Khalil has not been convicted of any terrorist-related activity or charged with any wrongdoing. But experts say the federal government has fairly broad authority to arrest and try to deport a green card holder on terrorism grounds. Under the Immigration and Nationality Act, green card holders do not need to be convicted of something to be 'removable,' Kelley-Widmer said. They could be deported if the secretary of homeland security or the attorney general have reasonable grounds to believe they engaged in, or are likely to engage in, terrorist activities, she said. But, she said, she has never seen a case where the alleged terrorist activity happened in the U.S., and she questioned whether taking part in protests as Khalil did qualifies. What did ICE say about why they were arresting him? One of the key issues in Khalil's case is what ICE agents said to his lawyer at the time he was arrested. His lawyer, Amy Greer, said the agents who took him into custody at his university-owned home near Columbia initially claimed to be acting on a State Department order to revoke his student visa. But when Greer informed them that Khalil was a permanent resident with a green card, they said they would revoke that documentation instead. What are the next steps in his case? Secretary of State Marco Rubio said in a message posted Sunday on X that the administration will be 'revoking the visas and/or green cards of Hamas supporters in America so they can be deported.' If someone is in the country on a student visa, the State Department does have authority to revoke it if the person violates certain conditions. For example, said Florida immigration attorney John Gihon, it's quite common for the State Department to cancel visas of foreign students who get arrested for drunk driving. But when it comes to someone who's a lawful permanent resident, that generally requires an immigration judge to determine whether they can be deported. Gihon said the next step is that Khalil would receive charging documents explaining why he's being detained and why the government wants to remove him, as well as a notice to appear in immigration court. Generally, he should receive those within 72 hours of being arrested, and then he would make an initial appearance before an immigration judge. That could take from 10 days to a month, Gihon said. But he cautioned that right now he's seeing extensive delays across the immigration court system, with clients often moved around the country to different facilities. 'We are having people who are detained and then they're bounced around to multiple different detention facilities. And then sometimes they're transferred across the country,' he said. Khalil's lawyers have also filed a lawsuit challenging his detention. A federal judge in New York City ordered that Khalil not be deported while the court considered his case. A hearing is scheduled for Wednesday.	https://www.voanews.com/a/activist-s-arrest-raises-questions-on-us-protections-for-foreign-students-green-card-holders/8006257.html	2025-03-10T18:13:19-07:00	
US nonprofit helps former female inmates reintegrate into society, job market	NEW ORLEANS, LOUISIANA — Each year, nearly 54,000 women in the U.S. state of Louisiana are released from prison, according to Operation Restoration, a New Orleans-based nonprofit organization with a mission to support women and girls impacted by incarceration as they attempt to restore their lives. For many women, restoring their lives proves too difficult. Some 30% return to jail within five years. 'The number of barriers a woman faces when she is released from incarceration is unfathomable,' Syrita Steib, Operation Restoration’s founder and president told VOA. 'There are food and housing issues, of course, but that’s just the tip of the iceberg.' 'You are on parole, but you have to pay the state money for that supervision,' Steib continued. 'Where do you get the money for that at first, though? If you’ve been in prison for years or decades, you don’t have the network connections or technology literacy most people lean on to find a job.' As Shenica Jackson, 43, readied for her release last year after more than 13 years in prison, she shared many of these concerns. Jackson was one of two individuals arrested in 2011 when an ongoing feud turned violent. 'I was full of regret, of course,' Jackson said. 'Regret that I took someone’s life, regret that I was leaving my daughter without a mother to take care of her, and regret that I had robbed myself of my future.' 'When you’re incarcerated at 30 years old, you don’t imagine you’re going to have lots of opportunities after that,' she added. 'I thought my life was over.' That changed when she saw Operation Restoration was training women in prison to work as laboratory assistants. That program has licensed 67 formerly incarcerated women, including Jackson. 'It gives me something to be proud of,' Jackson said. 'It feels good to try to improve yourself and learn something new.' Finding second chances Operation Restoration has more than a dozen programs including providing housing, work training, education, food, clothing and legal advocacy. It is the kind of help that founder Steib needed when she was released from prison in 2009. Steib served nearly 10 years for her role in a burglary and arson at a car dealership when she was a teenager. When she was released, she felt overwhelmed and disoriented. 'The world moves on without you,' Steib said, 'and it happens at a rapid pace. When you get out of jail, there are barriers everywhere.' Those barriers include housing and college applications, which often require applicants to declare whether they are felons. Steib’s college application was rejected because she answered honestly about her conviction. When she pivoted to a job search, she was unaccustomed to email, did not know how to use social media and had trouble finding the right clothes for interviews. 'I went in when I was 19 and came out when I was 29,' she said. 'I didn’t know what size I wore. But if I go to buy underwear, nobody knows I was in jail. Nobody knows my story. They just think I’m a 30-year-old who doesn’t know her bra size. And imagine how embarrassing that is. Eventually it’s all too much, and you think, ‘Maybe I’ll just skip my job interview.’' Steib eventually was accepted and graduated from college but found that brought higher restitution payments to the state. 'They said my ability to pay had changed because I had graduated college,' she said, 'but I hadn’t even received a paycheck yet!' Steib saw other women released from prison facing the same challenges with little support. 'I remember watching a presentation about the prison problem in Louisiana, and of the 50 slides, only one mentioned women,' she said. 'It was ridiculous. I decided I needed to do something.' Adding programs One of the first problems Operation Restoration tackled was the one that complicated her going to college. In 2017, Operation Restoration helped write and advocate for the passage of Louisiana Act 276, known as 'Ban the Box,' which prohibits public colleges in the state from asking about criminal history in admissions decisions. Louisiana was the first state to pass that type of law, and seven states have since made similar changes. Steib and her team began a college-in-prison program offering for-credit Bachelor of Arts degrees inside the Louisiana Correctional Institute for Women in partnership with Tulane University. In 2024, 34 incarcerated women were enrolled. Comprehensive solution Operation Restoration last year placed nearly 200 families in safe and secure housing, donated clothing and hygiene products to more than 350 women and girls, and spent more than $111,000 on clients’ childcare, transportation, food, and housing, according to the organization’s 2024 Impact Report. Because 80% of incarcerated women in Louisiana are mothers, Operation Restoration has programs for their daughters, including tennis lessons, yoga and dance classes, and tutoring. There is a discussion group called 'Girl Talk,' in which teenagers meet with a facilitator to learn about financial literacy, positive self-identity, drug awareness, reproductive health, and career and academic preparation. Sixteen-year-old Kace — Operation Restoration requested VOA not share her last name to protect her anonymity — struggled when a parent was incarcerated. Her grandmother suggested she enroll in Girl Talk, and Kace said it has changed her life. 'I learned that I was depressed, and I needed people to open up to,' she said. 'I love our talks and getting to learn about other girls in the program who are also going through challenges like me.' 'Having a group like this has taught me that just because I’m struggling and I think I’m not enough,' Kace added, 'I’m enough in someone’s eyes.' Operation Restoration is sponsored by more than 40 local and national charities, including the United Way of Southeast Louisiana. Steib says federal government funding cuts could threaten the survival of some of its programs. That includes the programs for young girls in which Kace takes part, as well as Operation Restoration’s Lab Assistant Program. While Steib remains hopeful these cuts won’t target organizations like hers, she is pushing to raise money from other sources to ensure those programs remain supported, as well as to build a community center for her clients. 'I want women and girls impacted by incarceration to have a place in the community that feels like theirs,' she said. 'They should be able to come in for their lab assistant class and find childcare for their kids and pick up some clothing for an interview. That’s what we currently need help with.' Jackson says Operation Restoration changes women’s lives. 'To leave jail and know there is something for me out there, it’s hard to explain how important that is.' she said. 'I would have never guessed my life would be going like this. I can’t believe I have choices again.'	https://www.voanews.com/a/us-nonprofit-helps-former-female-inmates-reintegrate-into-society-job-market/8005790.html	2025-03-10T17:47:06-07:00	
Senate confirms Lori Chavez-DeRemer as Trump's labor secretary	The Senate voted Monday to confirm Lori Chavez-DeRemer as U.S. labor secretary, a Cabinet position that puts her in charge of enforcing federally mandated worker rights and protections as the White House is trying to eliminate thousands of government employees. Chavez-DeRemer will oversee the Department of Labor, one of several executive departments named in lawsuits challenging the authority of billionaire Elon Musk and the Department of Government Efficiency to order layoffs and access sensitive government data. The Labor Department had nearly 16,000 full-time employees and a proposed budget of $13.9 billion for fiscal year 2025. Some of its vast responsibilities include reporting the U.S. unemployment rate, regulating workplace health and safety standards, investigating minimum wage, child labor and overtime pay disputes, and applying laws on union organizing and unlawful terminations. Several prominent labor unions, including the International Brotherhood of Teamsters, endorsed Chavez-DeRemer's nomination. The former Republican congresswoman from Oregon is the daughter of a Teamster, and during her one term in the House earned a reputation as pro-labor. The Senate voted to confirm Chavez-DeRemer 67-32, with 17 Democrats voting yes and three Republicans voting no. The Senate has now confirmed all but one of Trump's picks for his Cabinet. Its Committee on Health, Education, Labor & Pensions had voted 14-9 in favor of her nomination last week, with all Republicans except Senator Rand Paul of Kentucky giving Chavez-DeRemer their support. Three Democrats on the committee — Senators John Hickenlooper of Colorado, Tim Kaine of Virginia and Maggie Hassan of New Hampshire — voted with the majority. During her confirmation hearing before the committee, several Republican senators grilled Chavez-DeRemer about her decision to co-sponsor legislation that would have made it easier for workers to unionize and penalized employers who stood in the way of organizing efforts. She declined to explicitly state whether she still backed the Protecting the Right to Organize Act, also known as the PRO Act. Chavez-DeRemer explained she had signed on as a co-sponsor because she wanted a seat at the table to discuss important labor issues. Under further questioning, she walked back some of her support of the bill, saying that she supported state 'right to work' laws, which allow employees to refuse to join a union in their workplace. The PRO Act did not come up for a vote during her time in Congress, but the legislation was reintroduced in the House and Senate last week. 'As we speak, Donald Trump and his billionaire buddies are stealing the American dream away from working families, rigging every lever of society in favor of the billionaire class,' Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer said in a statement. 'That's why we need the PRO Act, to empower hardworking Americans to bargain for better wages, benefits, and safer working conditions.' During her time in Congress, Chavez-DeRemer also co-sponsored legislation to protect public-sector workers from having their Social Security benefits docked because of government pension benefits. That bill also stalled because it didn't have enough Republican support. Chavez-DeRemer walked a fine line during her confirmation hearing, attempting to appeal to both Democrats and Republicans. On the subject of whether the federal minimum wage was overdue for an increase, she said that she recognized it hadn't been raised from $7.25 an hour since 2009 but that she would not want to 'shock the economy.'	https://www.voanews.com/a/senate-confirms-lori-chavez-deremer-as-trump-s-labor-secretary/8006214.html	2025-03-10T17:11:33-07:00

Cargo ship and tanker collide, catch fire off England; one crew member missing	LONDON — A cargo ship hit a tanker transporting jet fuel for the U.S. military off eastern England on Monday, setting both vessels ablaze and sending fuel pouring into the North Sea. All but one of the 37 crew of the two ships were brought safely ashore. One crew member from the cargo ship, Solong, was missing, the vessel's owner Ernst Russ said in a statement. The ship owner said '13 of the 14 Solong crew members have been brought safely (to) shore.' The owner of the fuel tanker said all 23 of its crew members were safe. The two ships were still ablaze 12 hours after the collision, British coast guards said. They said they had ended the search for the missing crew member. They confirmed 36 others had been brought ashore, one of whom was hospitalized. The collision triggered a major rescue operation by lifeboats, coast guard aircraft and commercial vessels in the foggy North Sea. The British government said it was assessing 'any counter-pollution response which may be required over the coming days.' The Marine Accident Investigation Branch was investigating the cause of the collision. The U.S.-flagged chemical and oil products tanker MV Stena Immaculate was at anchor near the port of Grimsby on Monday morning after sailing from Greece, according to ship-tracking site VesselFinder. The Portugal-flagged container ship Solong was sailing from Grangemouth in Scotland to Rotterdam in the Netherlands when it struck the tanker's side. U.S.-based maritime management firm Crowley, which operates the Stena Immaculate, said the tanker 'sustained a ruptured cargo tank containing Jet-A1 fuel,' when the container ship struck it, triggering a fire and 'multiple explosions onboard,' with fuel released into the sea. The Stena Immaculate was operating as part of the U.S. government's Tanker Security Program, a group of commercial vessels that can be contracted to carry fuel for the military when needed. The Solong's cargo included sodium cyanide, which can produce harmful gas when combined with water, according to industry publication Lloyd's List Intelligence. It was unclear if there had been a leak. Britain's Maritime and Coastguard Agency said the alarm was raised at 9:48 a.m. (0948 GMT). Humber Coast Guard asked vessels with firefighting equipment and those who could help with search and rescue to head to the scene about 250 kilometers (155 miles) north of London. Video footage aired by British broadcasters and apparently filmed from a nearby vessel showed thick black smoke pouring from both ships. Prime Minister Keir Starmer's office said details of the collision and its cause 'are still becoming clear.' Abdul Khalique, head of the Maritime Center at Liverpool John Moores University, said it appeared the crew of the cargo ship had not been 'maintaining a proper lookout by radar' as required by international maritime regulations. Greenpeace U.K. said it was too early to assess the extent of any environmental damage from the collision, which took place near busy fishing grounds and major seabird colonies. Scientists said the environmental impact might be less severe than with a spill of heavier crude oil. 'Whilst the images look worrying, from the perspective of the impact to the aquatic environment, it's less of a concern than if this had been crude oil because most of the jet fuel will evaporate very quickly,' said Mark Hartl of the Center for Marine Biodiversity and Biotechnology at Scotland's Heriot-Watt University. Mark Sephton, professor of organic geochemistry at Imperial College London, said jet fuel disintegrates more quickly than crude oil, and warmer temperatures speed biodegradation. 'In the end, it all depends on the rate of introduction of fuel and the rate of destruction by bacteria,' he said. 'Let's hope the latter wins out.'	https://www.voanews.com/a/cargo-ship-and-tanker-collide-catch-fire-off-england-one-crew-member-missing/8005964.html	2025-03-10T16:30:57-07:00	
Music flows in Roberta Flack's 'Celebration of Life' memorial with Stevie Wonder and Al Sharpton	NEW YORK — A public memorial service bursting with choral music and the Berklee College of Music's Nebulous String Quartet, with Stevie Wonder and the Rev. Al Sharpton also on the bill, celebrated the life and legacy of Grammy-winning singer and pianist Roberta Flack. Flack's songs 'The First Time Ever I Saw Your Face' and 'Killing Me Softly with His Song' made her a global star in the 1970s and beyond. She died last month at age 88. Wonder was among the artists scheduled to perform during the service at a historic Harlem church, while Sharpton was to deliver the eulogy, according to the memorial program. Flack was an influential performer with an intimate vocal and musical style that ranged easily between soul, jazz and gospel. Her 'Celebration of Life' memorial was livestreamed at www.RobertaFlack.com and on YouTube. Here are some highlights: For the memory of a singing legend, an historic location Flack's memorial was open to the public at The Abyssinian Baptist Church. Founded in 1808, it is one of the oldest Black Baptist churches in the U.S. The church was decorated for the ceremony with stunning white and yellow bouquets and filled quickly beforehand. At the center, a screen showed a young Flack at the piano and played highlights of her career. It was a fitting location: Flack grew up with church gospel and her mother played organ at the Lomax African Methodist Episcopal Church in Arlington, Virginia. As a teen, she began accompanying the church choir on piano. The program featured a powerful quote from Flack. 'Remember: Always walk in the light,' it read. 'If you feel like you’re not walking in it, go find it. Love the Light.' A celebration of a life in music ... with music 'Many of us are here today because she has touched not just our hearts, but she also touched our souls,' said the Rev. Dr. Kevin R. Johnson, the senior church pastor who led the service. Choir performances including a rousing rendition of 'Amazing Grace' came in between a video recollection of Flack's life and scripture readings. 'That’s what we call church, y’all,' Johnson said at the close of one choral performance. Organ and piano riffs played off and on in the background. 'She just sang the song. She let you hear the lyrics. She let you understand the beauty. But I also want you to understand that this woman was also a pure genius,' Santita Jackson, daughter of the Rev. Jesse Jackson and a friend of Flack, told the near-capacity crowd. Actor Phylicia Rashad remembered first seeing Flack perform when she was a student at Howard University — to an audience that grew rapt by her quiet, steady voice. Flack lived comfortably with her genius and without having to proclaim it to people, Rashad said. 'She wore that like a loose fitting garment and lived her life attending to that which she cared for most: music, love and humanity,' Rashad said. What are some of Flack's best-known songs? Flack leaves behind a rich repertoire of music that avoids categorization. Her debut, 'First Take,' wove soul, jazz, flamenco, gospel and folk into one revelatory package, prescient in its form and measured in its approach. She will likely be remembered for her classics. Those include 'The First Time Ever I Saw Your Face,' her dreamy cover of 'The First Time Ever I Saw Your Face,' written by English folk artist Ewan MacColl for his wife Peggy Seeger. It marked the beginning of Flack's mainstream success when it was used in a love scene between Clint Eastwood and Donna Mills in his 1971 film 'Play Misty for Me.' But most will think of 'Killing Me Softly with His Song' when Flack's name comes up in conversation. She first heard Lori Lieberman’s 'Killing Me Softly with His Song' while on a plane and immediately fell in love with it. While on tour with Quincy Jones, she covered the song, and the audience fell in love with it, too, as they’d continue to for decades.	https://www.voanews.com/a/music-flows-in-roberta-flack-s-celebration-of-life-memorial-with-stevie-wonder-and-al-sharpton/8005968.html	2025-03-10T16:29:06-07:00	
US pulls out of climate damage compensation fund	The Trump administration has told world financial institutions that the U.S is pulling out of the landmark international climate Loss and Damage Fund. Climate analysts Monday were critical of the U.S. Treasury Department's decision to formally pull out from the fund designed as compensation for damage by polluting nations to poor countries especially hurt by the extreme storms, heat and drought caused by the burning of coal, oil and gas. A Treasury official said in a letter last week that the U.S. board members of the fund were resigning. 'Consistent with President Trump's Executive Order on Putting America First in International Environmental Agreements, the United States has withdrawn from the Fund for Responding for Loss and Damage,' a Treasury spokesperson said in an email Monday. 'We have informed all relevant parties of our decision.' In its first 50 days, the Trump administration has eliminated or cut funding for environmental justice domestically, foreign aid, climate change and diversity, equity and inclusion. The president also started the one-year process to once again pull out of the historic 2015 Paris climate agreement. Earlier this month, the U.S. withdrew from a special climate agreement in which rich nations help small poor nations switch to cleaner energy. When the fund was agreed upon in 2022, then-President Joe Biden pledged that the U.S., the world's biggest historic carbon dioxide emitter, would contribute $17.5 million. 'It's a great shame to see the U.S. going back on its promises,' said Mohamed Adow, founder of Power Shift Africa and a veteran of United Nations climate negotiations. 'This decision will result in great suffering for some of the poorest and most vulnerable people in the world. These people have contributed the least to the climate emergency they are now living through.' A dozen countries that have polluted less — Australia, Austria, Denmark, France, Germany, Ireland, Italy, Norway, Spain, Sweden, the United Arab Emirates and the United Kingdom — and the European Union have pledged more than the U.S. The two biggest pledges — $104 million — came from Italy and France. As of January, the Loss and Damage Fund had $741.42 million in pledges, according to the United Nations. Poorer nations, often in the global south, had long framed the fund as one of environmental justice. It was an idea that the U.S. and many rich nations blocked until 2022, when they accepted the creation but insisted it was not reparations. 'Three long decades and we have finally delivered climate justice,' Seve Paeniu, the finance minister of Tuvalu, said when the U.N. climate negotiations established the fund. 'We have finally responded to the call of hundreds of millions of people across the world to help them address loss and damage.'	https://www.voanews.com/a/us-pulls-out-of-climate-damage-compensation-fund-/8005960.html	2025-03-10T16:15:48-07:00	
Trump administration launches new 'self-deportation' app	WASHINGTON — The Trump administration rolled out a new app Monday that will allow immigrants who are in the United States illegally to 'self deport' rather than face possible arrest and detention, building on President Donald Trump's deportation push. The U.S. Customs and Border Protection app, called CBP Home, will offer an option for someone to signal their 'intent to depart,' the agency said. 'The CBP Home app gives aliens the option to leave now and self-deport, so they may still have the opportunity to return legally in the future and live the American dream,' Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem said in a statement. 'If they don’t, we will find them, we will deport them, and they will never return.' Trump, a Republican, has vowed to deport record numbers of migrants in the U.S. illegally. Trump's initial deportation numbers lagged behind the monthly average in fiscal year 2024 under Democrat Joe Biden, although Biden's deportations included many recent border crossers. The Trump administration has taken other steps that could pressure illegal immigrants to leave the United States. A Trump administration regulation set to take effect April 11 would require people lacking legal status to register with the federal government or face fines or jail time. CBP Home replaces an app known as CBP One that was launched under Biden. The Biden-era app included a feature that allowed some 1 million migrants in Mexico to schedule an appointment to request entry at a legal border crossing. Republicans criticized the Biden program, saying it facilitated mass migration to the United States and did not adequately vet migrants. Trump shut down CBP One hours after taking office, leaving migrants with pending appointments stranded and unsure of next steps.	https://www.voanews.com/a/trump-administration-launches-new-self-deportation-app-/8005948.html	2025-03-10T16:13:48-07:00	
Newly elected Canadian prime minister promises quick transition	TORONTO — Canada’s next prime minister met with outgoing Prime Minister Justin Trudeau on Monday and vowed a quick transition. Mark Carney said he had a long meeting with Trudeau in which they discussed U.S.-Canada relations, national security issues and the timing of the handover in power. 'That transition will be seamless and it will be quick,' said Carney, adding there would be an announcement soon. Carney, a two-time central bank chief, will become prime minister after the governing Liberal Party elected him its leader Sunday in a landslide vote with 85.9% support. Carney, 59, replaces Trudeau who announced his resignation in January but remains prime minister until his successor is sworn in. Carney is widely expected to trigger an election in the coming days or weeks amid U.S. President Donald Trump’s sweeping tariff and annexation threats. Or the opposition parties in Parliament could force one with a no-confidence vote later this month. Carney navigated crises when he was the head of the Bank of Canada from 2008, and then in 2013 when he became the first non-citizen to run the Bank of England since it was founded in 1694. His appointment won bipartisan praise in the U.K. after Canada recovered from the 2008 financial crisis faster than many other countries. He helped manage the worst impacts of Brexit in the U.K. The opposition Conservatives had hoped to make the election about Trudeau, whose popularity declined as food and housing prices rose and immigration surged. But Trump’s trade war and his talk of making Canada the 51st U.S. state have infuriated Canadians, who are booing the American anthem at NHL and NBA games. Some are canceling trips south of the border, and many are avoiding buying American goods when they can. The surge in Canadian nationalism has bolstered the Liberal Party’s chances in a parliamentary election, and Liberal showings have been improving in opinion polls. 'There is tremendous energy in the Liberal caucus,' Carney said. 'This is a united party full of energy.' Trump has postponed 25% tariffs on many goods from Canada and Mexico for a month, amid widespread fears of a broader trade war. But he has threatened other tariffs on steel, aluminum, dairy and other products. Carney said Sunday night that Canada will keep its initial retaliatory tariffs in place until 'the Americans show us respect.' He said Canada didn't start the fight but would win. Ontario Premier Doug Ford, the leader of Canada’s most populous province, announced that effective Monday it is charging 25% more for electricity to 1.5 million Americans in response to Trump’s trade war. Ontario provides electricity to Minnesota, New York and Michigan. The new surcharge is in addition to the federal government’s initial $21 billion worth of retaliatory tariffs that have been applied on items like American orange juice, peanut butter, coffee, appliances, footwear, cosmetics, motorcycles and certain pulp and paper products.	https://www.voanews.com/a/newly-elected-canadian-prime-minister-promises-quick-transition/8005930.html	2025-03-10T15:38:13-07:00	
Former US first lady Michelle Obama and her brother to launch podcast	NEW YORK — Michelle Obama and her brother, Craig Robinson, will host a new weekly podcast series starting this month featuring a special guest pulled from the world of entertainment, sports, health or business. 'IMO with Michelle Obama & Craig Robinson' will address 'everyday questions shaping our lives, relationships and the world around us,' according to a press release. IMO is slang for 'in my opinion.' Some of the guests slated to speak to the former first lady and Robinson, the executive director of the National Association of Basketball Coaches, include actors Issa Rae and Keke Palmer and psychologist Dr. Orna Guralnik. Other guests include filmmakers Seth and Lauren Rogan; soccer star Abby Wambach; authors Jay Shetty, Glennon Doyle and Logan Ury; editor Elaine Welteroth; radio personality Angie Martinez; media mogul Tyler Perry; actor Tracee Ellis Ross; husband-and-wife athlete and actor Dwyane Wade and Gabrielle Union; and Airbnb CEO Brian Chesky. The first two episodes — the first is an introductory one and the second features Rae — will premiere on March 12. New episodes will be released weekly and will be available on all audio platforms and YouTube. 'With everything going on in the world, we’re all looking for answers and people to turn to,' Obama said in a statement. 'There is no single way to deal with the challenges we may be facing — whether it’s family, faith, or our personal relationships — but taking the time to open up and talk about these issues can provide hope.' Obama has had two other podcasts — 'The Michelle Obama Podcast' in 2020 and another in 2023, 'The Light We Carry.' Her husband, Barack Obama, offered a series of conversations about American life between him and Bruce Springsteen. The new podcast is a production of Higher Ground, the media company founded in 2018 by the former president and first lady.	https://www.voanews.com/a/former-us-first-lady-michelle-obama-and-her-brother-to-launch-podcast-/8005929.html	2025-03-10T15:36:50-07:00	
UN chief alarmed at sudden spike in violence on Syrian coast	UNITED NATIONS — U.N. Secretary-General Antonio Guterres expressed alarm Monday at the sudden escalation of violence in Syria's coastal region, where security forces have clashed since Thursday with fighters loyal to former President Bashar al-Assad, killing hundreds of civilians. 'The bloodshed in Syria must stop immediately, he said, and perpetrators of violations must be held to account,' Guterres' spokesperson, Stephane Dujarric, told reporters. 'The concerns of Syria's communities must be addressed in a meaningful manner.' Dujarric said the U.N. chief was alarmed by the scope of the violence that included 'widespread summary killings, including of entire families, and the loss of one of our colleagues from UNRWA.' The staffer from the agency that assists Palestine refugees was caught in the crossfire last week on his way home from work during clashes between the cities of Homs and Latakia, UNRWA's commissioner-general said. The fighters are members of the country's Alawite minority, the same religious group the Assad family belongs to. The Syrian authorities said their forces in the sect's coastal region near the port city of Latakia came under a calculated attack from Assad loyalists in an attempted insurrection that has now been put down. Scores of fighters on both sides were also reportedly killed in what was some of the worst fighting since the interim authorities seized power in mid-December. The head of the caretaker government, Ahmed al-Sharaa, a former member of al-Qaida, announced Sunday there would be an independent investigation into all atrocities carried out against civilians and the security forces. Earlier Monday, the U.N. Security Council met in a two-hour closed session requested jointly by the United States and Russia. Diplomats said U.N. Syria envoy Geir Pedersen told them in a video briefing that tensions have been brewing for several weeks between Assad loyalists and the current authorities, erupting in sporadic clashes. But the recent violence, he said, appeared preplanned and coordinated, with fighters reportedly targeting military installations and public facilities such as hospitals. Pedersen warned council members that the situation was dangerous and that violence could spread. He urged international support for a real political transition to prevent Syria from collapsing again. Russian Ambassador Vassily Nebenzia told reporters after the meeting that the 15-nation council is discussing issuing a presidential statement on the situation. Council statements require consensus, and Nebenzia said everyone 'was pretty unanimous' on the gravity of the situation. U.N. humanitarian officials said thousands of Syrians have reportedly been displaced in coastal areas, and thousands have crossed into neighboring Lebanon. Six hospitals and several ambulances have been affected in the fighting, and many hospitals in the coastal area are in urgent need of medical supplies. Syria has been mired in civil war for the past 14 years, after the Assad regime brutally put down peaceful protests during the Arab Spring. Last month, the U.N. Development Program said recovery could take at least a decade and estimated the war had cost the Syrian economy $800 billion in losses since 2011.	https://www.voanews.com/a/un-chief-alarmed-at-sudden-spike-in-violence-on-syrian-coast-/8005914.html	2025-03-10T15:27:43-07:00	
Trump vows crackdown on pro-Palestinian protesters	U.S. President Donald Trump vowed a new crackdown Monday on pro-Palestinian protesters on American college campuses, saying the detention of Mahmoud Khalil, a demonstration leader at Columbia University in New York, is 'the first arrest of many to come.' 'We know there are more students at Columbia and other Universities across the Country who have engaged in pro-terrorist, anti-Semitic, anti-American activity, and the Trump Administration will not tolerate it,' the U.S. leader said on his Truth Social platform. Khalil was arrested by U.S. immigration officials over the weekend. He was one of the most prominent figures during the protest movement that erupted at Columbia and some other campuses a year ago in opposition to Israel's war in Gaza against the U.S.-designated terror group Hamas. But for the most part, the protests died down and did not resume when the new school year opened last fall. The Department of Homeland Security said Khalil’s arrest was taken 'in support of President Trump's executive orders prohibiting anti-Semitism, and in coordination with the Department of State.' Khalil, listed as a Syrian on his detention papers, earned a master’s degree from Columbia’s school of international affairs last semester. He held a permanent U.S. residency green card at the time of his arrest, according to the Student Workers of Columbia union, and is married to an American citizen who is eight months pregnant. He has not been charged with any criminal offenses. Trump wrote in a social media posting, 'If you support terrorism, including the slaughtering of innocent men, women, and children, your presence is contrary to our national and foreign policy interests, and you are not welcome here. We expect every one of America’s Colleges and Universities to comply.' The pro-Palestinian protests a year ago disrupted classes at some U.S. campuses following Hamas’ October 7, 2023, terror attack on southern Israel that killed 1,200 people and led to the capture of about 250 hostages, with about two dozen of them still being held in Gaza by the terror group or its affiliates. Israel’s counteroffensive in Gaza has killed more than 48,000 Palestinians, most of them women and children, according to Gaza health officials. The Israeli military said the death toll includes 17,000 Hamas terrorists. The campus demonstrations ignited accusations of anti-Semitism. The protests — some of which turned violent with the demonstrators occupying campus buildings and disrupting classes — pitted students protesting Israel's conduct against pro-Israel campaigners, many of whom were Jewish. Khalil’s lawyer said the agents who arrested him Saturday at his university-owned home near Columbia said they were revoking his green card. He is being held in an immigration detention center in the Southern state of Louisiana. The Council on American-Islamic Relations, a national Muslim civil rights advocacy group, said Monday it is working with Khalil's lawyer and called for his immediate release. Khalil 'is a lawful permanent resident of our nation who has not been charged with or convicted of a single crime,' the Washington-based group said in a statement. 'The Department of Homeland Security's lawless decision to arrest him solely because of his peaceful anti-genocide activism represents a blatant attack on the First Amendment's guarantee of free speech, immigration laws, and the very humanity of Palestinians.' Secretary of State Marco Rubio said in a message posted Sunday on X that the administration will be 'revoking the visas and/or green cards of Hamas supporters in America so they can be deported.' Khalil’s arrest is the first publicly known deportation effort linked to the Palestinian protests since the Trump administration took office in January. At the time of the protests a year ago, Khalil and other student leaders of the Columbia University Apartheid Divest student group rejected claims of antisemitism, saying they were part of a broader anti-war movement that included Jewish students and other groups. But the divestment group has also expressed support for leaders of both Hamas and Hezbollah, another Islamist organization chiefly in Lebanon that the U.S. has also designated as a terrorist group. It is unclear when Khalil will have a hearing in an immigration court, which is typically the first step in the deportation process. Khalil was one of the most visible activists in last year's protests at Columbia, serving as a negotiator for students who erected a tent encampment on campus. Pro-Israel activists in recent weeks have called on the Trump administration to begin deportation proceedings against him. A new Columbia office that has already brought disciplinary charges against dozens of students for their pro-Palestinian protests has also opened an investigation of Khalil. The Trump administration last week revoked $400 million in federal funding from Columbia because of what it claimed was the Ivy League school's failure to reign in antisemitism on campus. Some material in this report came from Agence France-Presse and The Associated Press.	https://www.voanews.com/a/trump-vows-crackdown-on-pro-palestinian-protesters/8005926.html	2025-03-10T15:26:24-07:00	
Rubio in Saudi Arabia for US-Ukraine talks, hopes to resolve Ukraine aid pause	JEDDAH, SAUDI ARABIA — U.S. Secretary of State Marco Rubio said Monday the United States hopes to resolve the pause in aid to Ukraine during talks Tuesday with Ukrainian officials in Jeddah, Saudi Arabia. Rubio said the U.S. is in a listening mode and aims to understand what concessions Ukraine might be willing to make. 'The Ukrainians are already receiving all defensive intelligence information as we speak. I think all the notion of the pause in aid broadly is something I hope we can resolve. Obviously, I think what happens tomorrow will be key to that,' Rubio told reporters aboard a military plane before landing in Jeddah. 'We're not going to be sitting in a room drawing lines on a map but just get a general sense of what concessions are in the realm of the possible for them [Ukrainians],' Rubio said, adding that there is no military solution to the war, and that both Russia and Ukraine need to 'do difficult things.' Later on Monday, Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman met with Rubio in the Red Sea port city of Jeddah. Salman held a separate meeting with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy in Riyadh earlier in the day. On Tuesday, Rubio will join U.S. national security adviser Mike Waltz for the Jeddah talks with Ukrainian officials as President Donald Trump pushes to broker a swift end to the war. The Ukrainian delegation includes Zelenskyy’s chief of staff Andriy Yermak; Ukrainian Foreign Minister Andrii Sybiha; Defense Minister Rustem Umerov; and military commander Pavlo Palisa. 'Strong positions on the front line and strong diplomacy must work together to achieve a just and lasting peace,' Zelenskyy wrote in a social media posting late Monday. Mineral deal? Trump has voiced interest in making continued military aid conditional on access to Ukraine's raw materials. More than four dozen minerals, including several types of rare earths, nickel and lithium, are considered critical to the U.S. economy and national defense. Ukraine has large deposits of uranium, lithium and titanium. But Rubio clarified that securing a deal on Ukraine's mineral resources was not the primary focus of Tuesday’s talks. 'There's still more details to work out, and at this point, we're probably — rather than a memorandum of understanding — just wanting to sign a specific agreement. And that would take a little bit more time,' he told reporters. 'I wouldn't prejudge tomorrow by whether or not we have a minerals deal. ... It's an important topic, but it's not the main topic on the agenda,' Rubio added. Rubio also credited Britain and France for playing a constructive role in talks with Ukraine. He told VOA that there have been no discussions about China playing a role in postwar peacekeeping and reconstruction in Ukraine. This marks Rubio’s second visit to Saudi Arabia since taking office. He and other senior U.S. officials held talks with Russian officials in Riyadh on Feb. 18. He is scheduled to travel to Canada on Wednesday for meetings with G7 foreign ministers.	https://www.voanews.com/a/rubio-in-saudi-arabia-for-us-ukraine-talks-hopes-to-resolve-ukraine-aid-pause/8005899.html	2025-03-10T14:53:04-07:00	
Macron slams 'Russian attempts at destabilization' in Moldova	French President Emmanuel Macron denounced Monday what he called 'increasingly uninhibited Russian attempts at destabilization' in Moldova as his Moldovan counterpart Maia Sandu visited Paris. Sandu was sworn in for a second term in December, after Russia was accused of interfering in elections in the former Soviet republic that borders Ukraine. 'We have decided to again reinforce our cooperation to increase Moldova's resilience faced with foreign interference,' Macron said as both signed a deal to cooperate on detecting digital disinformation. Sandu said both countries were 'committing to join forces in fighting disinformation. ... Because in today's world, truth is as vital as security.' Sandu accused Russia, which launched its invasion of neighboring Ukraine three years ago, of using the 'tools of a modern imperialist.' Macron's office said VIGINUM, the French government agency set up to detect digital disinformation campaigns, would increase its work with the Moldovan Strategic Communication Center, including to 'protect electoral processes.' Sandu, the country's first woman elected head of state, owed her reelection in large part to a strong turnout from Moldova's large diaspora. But rural areas of the country — sandwiched between NATO member Romania and war-torn Ukraine — and separatist Transnistria, where Russian troops are stationed, remain pro-Moscow, as does the autonomous Gagauzia region. Authorities reported numerous 'attempts at destabilizing' the election, including disinformation, vote buying, death threats, cyberattacks and bussing in voters. The Kremlin accused Moldova of suppressing 'the opposition and independent media, especially Russian-language outlets.'	https://www.voanews.com/a/macron-slams-russian-attempts-at-destabilization-in-moldova-/8005881.html	2025-03-10T14:49:28-07:00	
Residents evacuated as Guatemalan volcano spews lava, rocks	Alotenango, Guatemala — Guatemalan authorities evacuated around a thousand people on Monday after Central America's most active volcano erupted, spewing lava, ash and rocks. Residents with traumatic memories of a deadly eruption in 2018 sought refuge after the Fuego volcano exploded spectacularly 35 kilometers (22 miles) from the capital Guatemala City. 'We heard the rumblings and then a strong eruption,' Manuel Cobox, 46, told AFP after leaving his home with his wife and three daughters. Some 125 families, around 900 people, were moved to safety from the community of El Porvenir, said Juan Laureano, a spokesman for Guatemala's disaster coordination agency, Conred. Residents of another community in Las Lajitas were also evacuated, the official added. Buses brought evacuees carrying belongings to a town hall turned into a temporary shelter, while others stayed with friends or relatives. Around 30,000 people were potentially 'at risk' and should evacuate themselves if necessary, Conred head Claudinne Ogaldes told a news conference. Guatemala lies on the Pacific 'Ring of Fire' and experiences frequent seismic and volcanic activity. In 2018, 215 people were killed and a similar number left missing when an eruption of the Fuego volcano sent rivers of lava pouring down its sides, devastating the village of San Miguel Los Lotes. On that occasion, residents 'did not believe the magnitude and a tragedy struck,' said Cobox, who works on a pig farm. Amanda Santos, a 58-year-old housekeeper, said that memories of that previous eruption came flooding back when she heard the firefighters' sirens. 'That's why we're afraid. Many people died,' she added. Another eruption in 2023 from the 3,763-meter (12,346-foot) Fuego caused the evacuation of around 1,200 people. An alert was issued by the authorities on Sunday to coordinate the response and preventive measures, Conred said. The government suspended local school activities and closed a road through the village that links the south of the country to the colonial city of Antigua, a UNESCO World Heritage Site and Guatemala's most popular tourist destination. Authorities were monitoring pyroclastic flows — fast-moving currents of hot ash, gas and rock fragments that descend the slopes of a volcano, Conred spokesman Laureano said. The state-run Volcanology Institute recommended that air traffic take precautions due to a spreading ash cloud. It later reported that the volcano's activity had decreased in intensity but cautioned that the eruption had not yet ended.	https://www.voanews.com/a/residents-evacuated-as-guatemalan-volcano-spews-lava-rocks-/8005895.html	2025-03-10T14:47:28-07:00	
British plan to cede Chagos Islands sovereignty prompts concerns over China threat	LONDON — Britain is seeking to finalize a deal on handing sovereignty of the Chagos Islands to Mauritius after U.S. President Donald Trump said last month that he was 'inclined' to support the deal. However, critics say the agreement could threaten the security of a joint U.S.-U.K. military base on the islands amid fears of China’s close ties with Mauritius. Many of the original inhabitants of the islands who were forcibly expelled to make way for the base on Diego Garcia in the 1960s and 1970s are also critical of the agreement and say their voices have been ignored. British colony The Chagos Islands, officially known as the 'British Indian Ocean Territory,' are one of the last vestiges of the British Empire. They comprise more than 60 islands in the middle of the Indian Ocean, the largest of which is Diego Garcia. Britain officially took ownership of the archipelago from France after the defeat of French leader and Emperor Napoleon Bonaparte in 1815. The islands were administered from Mauritius, which argues it was illegally forced to give up the Chagos Islands in return for its own independence from Britain in 1968. In an advisory opinion in 2019, the International Court of Justice (ICJ) in The Hague ruled '... the process of decolonization of Mauritius was not lawfully completed when that country acceded to independence.' The judges added that Britain is under an obligation 'to bring to an end its administration of the Chagos Archipelago as rapidly as possible.' Sovereignty negotiations Negotiations between Britain and Mauritius on ceding sovereignty have been going on for several years. British Prime Minister Keir Starmer, a former human rights lawyer, has sought to finalize the agreement since winning power in July last year. Speaking to British lawmakers last month, Starmer said a deal was vital to secure the future of the U.S. military base. 'This is a military base that is vital for our national security. A number of years ago, the legal certainty of that base was thrown into doubt. … Without legal certainty, the base cannot operate in practical terms as it should. That is bad for our national security and it’s a gift to our adversaries,' Starmer said on Feb. 5. British media report that Britain will cede sovereignty of the Chagos Islands and pay Mauritius around $116 million a year for 99 years to lease back Diego Garcia and allow the military base to remain, with an option to extend the lease for another 40 years. However, neither Britain nor Mauritius have confirmed any details, and the agreement is yet to be finalized. Trump approval During a visit by Starmer to the White House last month, Trump said that he was 'inclined' to approve the deal. 'I have a feeling it's going to work out very well. They're talking about a very long-term, powerful lease, a very strong lease, about 140 years actually. That's a long time, and I think we'll be inclined to go along with your country,' Trump told Starmer during the visit on Feb. 27. The proposed deal also has the backing of India, which has close political and security ties to Mauritius. Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi is due to travel to Mauritius on Tuesday as chief guest on the country’s national day, the anniversary of its independence from Britain. Modi is expected to discuss upgrading India’s defense ties with the island nation. China concerns Politicians in Britain and the United States, however, have expressed concerns over potential security implications of handing sovereignty of the Chagos Islands to Mauritius amid a growing threat from China in the region. Robert Jenrick, the shadow justice secretary for Britain’s Conservative opposition party, described the proposed plan as 'a strategic disaster for Britain' that represented 'an appalling betrayal of the British people.' Members of Britain’s Shadow Cabinet are responsible for scrutinizing the policies and actions of the government but have no executive power. U.S. Senator James Risch, a senior member of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, said in October that the proposed deal 'gives in to Chinese lawfare and yields to pressure from unaccountable international institutions like the International Court of Justice at the expense of U.S. and U.K. strategic and military interests.' 'The U.S. and our allies must take a long-term approach when it comes to making decisions that affect our strategic competition with China, or we will all lose,' Risch told Politico. China’s burgeoning economic relationship with Mauritius makes the African island nation vulnerable to influence from Beijing, noted Evan Fowler of the Inter-Parliamentary Alliance on China. 'Given the complexity of the situation there, actually having a deal that secures the base is good. However, having a deal doesn't mean just accepting any deal. China has significant investments. Mauritius owes China quite a lot. China has quite a clear record of using debt … to seek political advantage. 'That area is strategically important to us because it's a way for us to project power,' Fowler told VOA. 'And the Chinese understand this, too. The Chinese have already been active militarily around the Chagos Islands.' Chagossians ‘voiceless’ After their expulsion, many Chagossians settled in Mauritius. Thousands also came to Britain, with many choosing to settle in the town of Crawley, south of London. Frankie Bontemps and Maxwell Evenor are second-generation Chagossians whose parents were forced out of their homeland in the 1960s. They are part of the group 'Chagossian Voices,' which seeks to assert the rights of the exiled population. 'Once again we are ignored,' Bontemps told VOA. 'People are discussing the future of our homeland without us. We feel like history is repeating itself. We feel voiceless, powerless, because we are being abused again — I would say by Mauritius, by the U.K., along with the U.S.' Many Chagossians argue Mauritius has never had a rightful claim to their homeland — and object to Britain’s proposed deal to cede sovereignty. 'We now find ourselves — our very own identity, our very own self — being given to someone else by a made-up policy without asking us,' Evenor told VOA, adding that there could be no historical link between the Chagos Islands and Mauritius 'because it's 2,000 kilometers away.' 'We are still colonized. We are the last colony of Africa,' Evenor said. Diego Garcia The exiled Chagossians have been told that under the terms of the deal with Mauritius, they would be able to return to outer islands in the Chagos archipelago — but not to Diego Garcia, which would remain off-limits. However, infrastructure on the outer islands is almost non-existent, according to Bontemps, who said that most Chagossians would accept living next to the military base on Diego Garcia. 'I think most of us, we don't have anything against that base. We know the geopolitical importance. We know about the China threat, or whoever,' Bontemps told VOA. 'We want to live on our ancestors’ land. As well, the base will be a source of work for us.'	https://www.voanews.com/a/8005869.html	2025-03-10T14:46:09-07:00

Greek lawmaker attacks paintings he said were offensive to Christians	ATHENS — A far-right Greek lawmaker attacked four paintings in an exhibition at the country's National Gallery on Monday, the gallery said, after he had described one as offensive because of its distorted depictions of Christ and the Virgin Mary. The lawmaker, named by the gallery as Nikolaos Papadopoulos, from the ultra-religious Niki party, was temporarily detained, and the gallery said it had had to close for the day due to the incident. The gallery said that with assistance from another person he had violently taken down four paintings included in the exhibition inspired by Spanish master Francisco de Goya. 'The above violently detached them from the wall and threw them on the floor, which resulted in their damage,' the gallery said in a statement. Papadopoulos' lawyer Constantinos Vathiotis told Reuters that he was illegally detained for five hours. Lawmakers are protected from arrest under the constitution and only parliament can lift their immunity. The exhibition, 'The allure of the bizarre,' is by a group of Greek artists, with works corresponding with 80 etchings from Goya's late 18th century Los Caprichos series. It has been on display in Athens since January at the country's main gallery, which is a major draw for Greeks and tourists alike. In a question to the culture ministry submitted to parliament in January, the lawmaker said that one painting, among the group of four he is accused of damaging, was 'clearly offending the Orthodox Christian faith, directly insulting the holy faces of Virgin Mary and Christ, which are depicted distorted.' The culture ministry responded at the time that it 'never engages in censorship.' The Hellenic League for Human Rights condemned the lawmaker's action, saying 'freedom of art and freedom of expression are protected by the constitution and are not subject to the personal taste and religious and ideological beliefs of self-appointed judges and ultimately punishers.'	https://www.voanews.com/a/greek-lawmaker-attacks-paintings-he-said-were-offensive-to-christians/8005862.html	2025-03-10T14:06:22-07:00	
UK charity calls to close gender employment gap for disabled	NAIROBI — A British charity for the disabled, citing World Bank data, says the world could gain trillions annually in Gross Domestic Product if women were employed at the same rate as men. Failure to close gender employment gaps reduces a country’s economic growth by 20% on average, according to the data. In many countries, women face multiple challenges when seeking employment or starting a business. Gender discrimination alone can drive women into poverty, but the risk increases if paired with disabilities. In recognition of International Women’s Day, Sightsavers International, a British nongovernmental agency that aims to prevent avoidable blindness and ensure equality for the visually impaired, cited the World Bank’s figures showing that global GDP would increase from $106 trillion to $127 trillion if women were employed at the same rate as men. Michelle Madau, a 41-year-old beautician from Zimbabwe, is living with osteogenesis imperfecta, a brittle-bone disease. Despite her disorder, she helps people like her learn how to run a business. 'I am mentoring the upcoming beauticians who are disabled and I am availing myself, making sure I am there when needed, speaking to them, helping them build up their own businesses,' Madau said. 'Of course, not all of them are in the beauty industry; whichever line of business I am familiar with, I am always there to assist them because I also want to see them win, just like I am winning right now.' Lydia Rosasi, 29, works at the office of the Kenyan government spokesperson, where she assists people living with blindness, deafness and other disabilities in accessing government communications. She says she bettered herself to stand out in the job market. 'For me, one of the greatest pillars in terms of navigating this double bias has been education and skills development. This has been the crucial thing that has kept me afloat as I go through these challenges,' Rosasi said. 'For example, in 2021, I joined the IT Bridger Academy and at that time the digital skills were gaining a lot of prominence in the job market. So it gave me confidence and the capabilities that opened my doors. And then I have found supportive mentors and leaders who have been very important.' Many African women struggle to get jobs, either because they were married off or became mothers at a young age, leaving them unable to finish their studies. Others encounter discrimination or sexual violence in their workplaces. Experts say empowering girls with education and allowing them to finish school is one way to reduce the gender employment gap. Lianna Jones works on economic empowerment at Sightsavers. She says closing the gender gap requires policy reforms and cultural change. 'In terms of closing the gender gap in employment and entrepreneurship, this requires coordinated interventions at multiple levels,' Jones said. 'At the policy level, we need to eliminate discriminatory laws and regulations that restrict women's economic participation. Women with disabilities need specialized approaches that address both gender- and disability-related barriers simultaneously, and lastly, we need to challenge social norms to engage with community leaders, men, and boys.' According to Equal Measures 2030, a coalition of national, regional and global leaders from feminist networks, civil society and international development, women in at least 77 countries are prohibited from working in the same jobs or sectors as men. In Africa, only five countries have a full set of laws mandating workplace equality for women.	https://www.voanews.com/a/uk-charity-calls-to-close-gender-employment-gap-for-disabled/8005797.html	2025-03-10T13:36:09-07:00	
Syria's government signs breakthrough deal with Kurdish-led authorities in northeast	DAMASCUS, SYRIA — Syria's central government has reached a deal with the Kurdish-led authority that controls the country's northeast, including a ceasefire and the merging of the main U.S.-backed force there into the Syrian army. The deal was signed Monday by interim President Ahmad al-Sharaa and Mazloum Abdi, the commander of the U.S.-backed, Kurdish-led Syrian Democratic Forces. The deal marks a major breakthrough that would bring most of Syria under the control of the government led by the group that led the ousting of President Bashar al-Assad in December. The deal to be implemented by the end of the year would bring all border crossings with Iraq and Turkey in the northeast, airports and oil fields under the control of the central government. Syria's Kurds will gain their rights including teaching and using their language, which were banned for decades under Assad. Earlier, Syria's interim government announced the end of a days-long military operation against insurgents loyal to Assad and his family in the worst fighting since the end of the 13-year civil war in December. The Defense Ministry's announcement comes after a surprise attack by gunmen from the Alawite community on a police patrol near the port city of Lattakia Thursday spiraled into widespread clashes across Syria's coastal region, during which monitoring groups said hundreds of civilians were killed. Syria's new interim Islamist rulers are struggling to exert their authority across the country and reach political settlements with other minority communities, notably the Kurds of the northeast and the Druze in southern Syria. 'To the remaining remnants of the defeated regime and its fleeing officers, our message is clear and explicit,' said Defense Ministry spokesperson Colonel Hassan Abdel-Ghani. 'If you return, we will also return, and you will find before you men who do not know how to retreat and who will not have mercy on those whose hands are stained with the blood of the innocent.' Abdel-Ghani said that security forces will continue searching for sleeper cells and remnants of the insurgency of former government loyalists. Though the government's counter-offensive was able to largely contain the insurgency, footage surfaced of what appeared to be retaliatory attacks targeting the broader minority Alawite community, an offshoot of Shia Islam whose adherents live mainly in Syria's western coastal region. The Syrian Observatory for Human Rights, a Britain-based war monitor, said 1,130 people were killed in the clashes, including 830 civilians. The Associated Press could not independently verify these numbers. The interim government is made up of members of Sunni Islamist group Hayat Tahrir al-Sham, which led a lightning insurgency in December that overthrew Assad, ending over half a century of his family's dictatorial rule. The Assad family are Alawites. Al-Sharaa said the retaliatory attacks against Alawite civilians and mistreatment of prisoners were isolated incidents, and vowed to crack down on the perpetrators as he formed a committee to investigate the incident. Abdel-Ghani says the security forces will allow the committee 'the full opportunity to uncover the circumstances of the events, verify the facts, and rectify wrongdoings.' Still, the footage of houses in several neighborhoods set on fire and bloodied bodies laid on the streets alarmed Western governments, who have been urged by Al-Sharaa to lift economic sanctions on Syria. U.S. Secretary of State Marco Rubio in a statement issued Sunday urged Syrian authorities to 'hold the perpetrators of these massacres' accountable. Rubio said the U.S. 'stands with Syria's religious and ethnic minorities, including its Christian, Druze, Alawite, and Kurdish communities.' Thousands of Syrians from the coastal area fled to neighboring Lebanon, mostly through unofficial crossings. The UN refugee agency said in a statement that according to local authorities, 6,078 people have arrived in about a dozen villages in northern Lebanon's Akkar province fleeing the fighting, while arrivals in other parts of the country were still being verified. Lebanon is hosting more than 755,000 registered Syrian refugees, with hundreds of thousands more believed to be unregistered. Since the fall of Assad, the flow had begun to reverse, with the U.N. reporting that nearly 260,000 Syrian refugees have returned home since November, about half of them coming from Lebanon.	https://www.voanews.com/a/syria-government-signs-breakthrough-deal-with-kurdish-led-authorities-in-northeast-/8005696.html	2025-03-10T12:11:30-07:00	
US stocks drop sharply as Trump hedges on recession	All three major U.S. stock indexes dropped sharply in Monday morning trading, with investors worried about the uncertainty of tariffs imposed by President Donald Trump on key trading partners and then his refusal to rule out the possibility of a U.S. recession in the coming months. The key Dow Jones average of 30 blue chip stocks dropped more than 1%, with the broader S&P 500 index falling 2 percentage points and the tech-heavy Nasdaq barometer off more than 3 percentage points. The S&P 500 finished Friday with a 3.1% weekly drop, its biggest such decline in six months, and the index is down 7.4% from its all-time high set on Feb. 19. Trump imposed new 25% tariffs on Mexican and Canadian exports to the U.S. last week and then days later paused the duties until April 2, leaving it uncertain what might happen then. Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick told NBC News over the weekend, 'There's going to be no recession in America,' but Trump hedged. 'I hate to predict things like that,' the U.S. leader told Fox News. 'There is a period of transition, because what we're doing is very big. We're bringing wealth back to America. That's a big thing.' He then added, 'It takes a little time. It takes a little time.' On Monday, the sell-off of big-tech stocks continued. The stock of electric carmaker Tesla, whose chief executive is billionaire Elon Musk, a key Trump adviser, slid more than 8%. Other key technology stocks such as Apple, Microsoft, Alphabet, Amazon, Nvidia and Meta Platforms all dropped by more than 2%. The U.S. economy, the world’s largest, has already given some signals of weakening, mostly through surveys showing increased pessimism from consumers, whose purchases account for 70% of the country’s economic output. A widely followed collection of real-time indicators compiled by the Federal Reserve Bank of Atlanta suggests the U.S. economy may already be shrinking. Analyst David Mericle at the Goldman Sachs investment company cut his 2025 year-over-year estimate for U.S. economic growth from 2.2% to 1.7%, largely because Trump’s tariffs look like they will be bigger than he was previously forecasting. He said he sees a one-in-five chance of a recession over the next year.	https://www.voanews.com/a/us-stocks-drop-sharply-as-trump-hedges-on-recession-/8005502.html	2025-03-10T10:36:32-07:00	
Tibetans scuffle with police outside the Chinese Embassy in India as they mark uprising anniversary	NEW DELHI — Dozens of Tibetan protesters clashed with police outside the Chinese Embassy in New Delhi on Monday as Tibetans living in exile marked the 66th anniversary of their uprising against China that was crushed by Chinese forces. As in past years, police blocked the protesters from entering the embassy and briefly detained some of them after wrestling them to the ground. Hundreds also marched in the north Indian town of Dharamshala, the seat of the exiled Tibetan government and home of Dalai Lama, their 89-year-old spiritual leader. Separately, about a hundred Tibetan women gathered at Jantar Mantar in New Delhi, an area designated for protests close to Parliament. The protesters shouted anti-China slogans, carried Tibetan flags and played the national anthems of Tibet and India. India considers Tibet to be part of China, although it hosts the Tibetan exiles. The 1959 independence uprising was quelled by the Chinese army, forcing Dalai Lama and his followers into exile in India. Many had their faces painted in colors of the Tibetan national flag. The demonstrators observed a minute of silence to remember Tibetans who lost their lives in the struggle against China. Monks, activists, nuns and schoolchildren marched across the town with banners reading, 'Free Tibet' and 'Remember, Resist, Return.' Penpa Tsering — the president of the Central Tibetan Administration, as the exiled Tibetan government calls itself — accused China's leadership of carrying out a 'deliberate and dangerous strategy to eliminate the very identity of the Tibetan people.' 'This marks the darkest and most critical period in the history of Tibet,' Tsering told the gathering. 'As we commemorate the Tibetan National Uprising Day, we honor our brave martyrs, and express solidarity with our brothers and sisters inside Tibet who continue to languish under the oppressive Chinese government.' The Tibetan government-in-exile in India accuses China of denying the most fundamental human rights to people in Tibet and trying to expunge the Tibetan identity. China claims Tibet has been part of its territory for centuries, but the Tibetans say the Himalayan region was virtually independent until China occupied it in 1950. The Dalai Lama denies China's claim that he is a separatist and says he only advocates substantial autonomy and protection of Tibet's native Buddhist culture.	https://www.voanews.com/a/tibetans-scuffle-with-police-outside-the-chinese-embassy-in-india-as-they-mark-uprising-anniversary-/8005442.html	2025-03-10T09:56:34-07:00	
Crews remove ‘Black Lives Matter’ street mural near White House	WASHINGTON — Construction crews began removing the large painting of the words 'Black Lives Matter' on a street one block from the White House on Monday as Washington Mayor Muriel Bowser struggles to fend off threats of encroachment from both President Donald Trump and the Republican-controlled Congress. Bowser pointed to the change on the social platform X last week, writing: 'The mural inspired millions of people and helped our city through a painful period, but now we can't afford to be distracted by meaningless congressional interference. The devastating impacts of the federal job cuts must be our number one concern.' The move shows Bowser's striking shift in tone toward Trump and congressional Republicans since the president's first term in office. Bowser, a Democrat, ordered the painting and renamed the intersection Black Lives Matter Plaza as a public act of defiance in June 2020. It came after days of chaotic protests at that location over police brutality following the killing of George Floyd by a Minneapolis police officer. Her approach to the protests brought her into direct conflict with Trump. The president at the time accused Bowser of losing control of her city and threatened to invoke his power to take over the Metropolitan Police Department. He didn't follow through but declared his own multiagency lockdown that included helicopters flying at low altitudes to intimidate protesters. In Trump's second stint in the White House, Bowser has worked to avoid conflict and downplay any points of contention. She traveled to Trump's Mar-a-Lago estate to meet with the president after his election and has publicly emphasized their points of agreement, such as a mutual desire to return federal workers back to their offices full time. Trump recently revived a frequent campaign talking point about wanting a federal 'takeover' of the nation's capital, describing Washington as riddled with crime, graffiti and homeless encampments. Bowser has refused to comment on reports that the White House was preparing an executive order targeting Washington; she publicly said that the greatest threat to the so-called Home Rule autonomy was 'some of the people in Congress.' Republicans, who control both chambers of Congress, have repeatedly threatened to interfere in city affairs in large and small ways. A measure currently before Congress, named the Bowser Act, seeks to completely revoke the Home Rule Act of 1973 that grants the capital city limited autonomy. That would be deeply controversial, likely testing the strength of the three-seat GOP House majority. Some representatives have used budget riders to target Washington policies ranging from marijuana legalization to whether right turns on red lights should be legal. And some in Congress have spoken publicly of their disdain for the Black Lives Matter street painting. While Bowser and Trump agreed on returning federal workers to their offices, Trump's push to slash the federal workforce is already roiling city finances. A report last week from the city's chief financial officer predicted a $1 billion budget shortfall over the next three years due to the loss of thousands of workers from the federal government. Bowser publicly siding with Black Lives Matter activists in 2020 didn't earn her much credibility with them at the time. The local Black Lives Matter affiliate dismissed the move as 'performative wokeness' and decried Bowser as overwhelmingly biased toward police. The same activists heaped scorn on Bowser on Tuesday following her reversal. Nee Nee Taylor, a founding member of the D.C. Black Lives Matter affiliate, addressed Bowser on X on Tuesday, saying, 'You never cared about Black Lives Mattering. You painting those words were performative.'	https://www.voanews.com/a/crews-remove-black-lives-matter-street-mural-near-white-house/8005411.html	2025-03-10T09:24:42-07:00	
Supreme Court will take up state bans on conversion therapy for LGBTQ+ children, in Colorado case	WASHINGTON — The Supreme Court agreed Monday in a case from Colorado to decide whether state and local governments can enforce laws banning conversion therapy for LGBTQ+ children. The conservative-led court is taking up the case amid actions by President Donald Trump targeting transgender people, including a ban on military service and an end to federal funding for gender-affirming care for transgender minors. The justices also have heard arguments in a Tennessee case over whether state bans on treating transgender minors violate the Constitution. But they have yet to issue a decision. Colorado is among roughly half the states that prohibit the practice of trying to change a person's sexual orientation or gender identity through counseling. The issue is whether the law violates the speech rights of counselors. Defenders of such laws argue that they regulate the conduct of professionals who are licensed by the state. The 10th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals in Denver upheld the state law. The 11th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals in Atlanta has struck down local bans in Florida. In 2023, the court had turned away a similar challenge, despite a split among federal appeals courts that had weighed state bans and come to differing decisions. At the time, three justices, Samuel Alito, Brett Kavanaugh and Clarence Thomas, said they would have taken on the issue. It takes four justices to grant review. The nine-member court does not typically reveal how justices vote at this stage of a case so it's unclear who might have provided the fourth vote. The case will be argued in the court's new term, which begins in October. The appeal on behalf of Kaley Chiles, a counselor in Colorado Springs, was filed by Alliance Defending Freedom, the conservative legal organization that has appeared frequently at the court in recent years in cases involving high-profile social issues. One of those cases was a 5-4 decision in 2018 in which the justices ruled that California could not force state-licensed anti-abortion crisis pregnancy centers to provide information about abortion. Chiles' lawyers leaned heavily on that decision in asking the court to take up her case. They wrote that Chiles doesn't 'seek to 'cure' clients of same-sex attractions or to 'change' clients' sexual orientation.' In arguing for the court to reject the appeal, lawyers for Colorado wrote that lawmakers acted to regulate professional conduct, 'based on overwhelming evidence that efforts to change a child's sexual orientation or gender identity are unsafe and ineffective.'	https://www.voanews.com/a/supreme-court-will-take-up-state-bans-on-conversion-therapy-for-lgbtq-children-in-colorado-case-/8005354.html	2025-03-10T09:06:40-07:00	
Trial to begin in New York for men accused of planning assassination of VOA host	More than two years have passed since police stopped a man who was loitering outside the New York home of Iranian dissident and journalist Masih Alinejad. Inside his car, they found an assault rifle with an obliterated serial number, 66 rounds of ammunition and a ski mask. The Islamic Revolutionary Guard Crops of Iran had allegedly sent him there to kill Alinejad, a staunch critic of Tehran. On Monday, the men accused of directing the activity — Russian mobsters Rafat Amirov and Polad Omarov — are set to stand trial in Federal District Court in Manhattan. They are charged with murder for hire and conspiracy in a case that experts say underscores how far the Iranian government will go to silence its critics — even those outside its borders. 'We will not tolerate attempts by a foreign power to threaten, silence or harm Americans,' Merrick Garland, the attorney general at the time, said in 2023 when federal officials first detailed the assassination plot against Alinejad. Alinejad worked as a journalist in Iran before she was forced to leave the country in 2009. In exile, she now hosts a show with Voice of America’s Persian Service. When contacted by phone on Monday, Alinejad told VOA she was unable to comment while the trial is ongoing. The 2022 assassination attempt wasn’t the first time Alinejad was targeted. In 2018, Iranian officials offered to pay Alinejad’s relatives in Iran to invite her to Turkey, with the apparent goal of ultimately bringing her to Iran for imprisonment, according to court documents. The relatives refused. Then in 2021, Iranian operatives were accused of planning to kidnap her. An indictment described a plan to bring her from New York to Venezuela, which has close relations with Iran. Since the kidnapping attempt, Alinejad has received U.S. government protection and moved frequently between safe houses. Despite the threats, Alinejad has refused to stop her work. 'I don’t have any guns and bullets — I don’t carry weapons. But this government, they have everything, and they're really scared of me,' Alinejad told VOA in 2023, referring to the Iranian government. 'And that gives me power — that, wow, even with my words, even with my social media, I’m more powerful than them.' The alleged plot to assassinate Alinejad emerged soon after the kidnapping plot failed, according to prosecutors. Prosecutors say the killing plot was initiated by a network in Iran led by Ruhollah Bazghandi, a brigadier general in the Revolutionary Guards. Bazghandi and three other Iranian men who are not in Iranian custody have also been charged in New York with murder for hire. 'This is in the DNA of the Revolutionary Guards,' Alinejad told VOA in October 2024 when Bazghandi and the three others were indicted. At the time, Alinejad also told VOA that it’s important for the U.S. government to hold Iran accountable for the plot and for Tehran’s broader use of transnational repression. 'This is about protecting democracy,' Alinejad said last year. 'The Iranian regime is challenging the U.S. government on U.S. soil, and basically this is targeting freedom of speech, and the national security and safety of America.' Iran’s Foreign Ministry did not immediately reply to VOA’s email requesting comment. In the trial beginning Monday, prosecutors are planning to describe how Amirov and Omarov operated within a Russian criminal organization called the Thieves-in-Law, which originated in Stalinist prison camps. A former member of the criminal group will testify for the government as a cooperating witness. That individual has been identified in court papers only as 'CW-1,' but details of his actions correspond to some by Khalid Mehdiyev, the Azerbaijani man who was arrested outside Alinejad’s house with a gun in 2022. Members of the Bazghandi network turned to Amirov, an Azerbaijani Russian citizen who was living in Iran at the time, according to an indictment. Amirov then contacted Omarov, who was living in Eastern Europe. The duo then gave $30,000 to Mehdiyev, who purchased the assault rifle and staked out Alinejad’s house for about one week, according to an indictment. At one point, Mehdiyev sent a video of the assault rifle to Omarov, accompanied by the message, 'We are ready.' On the day of the attempted killing, Mehdiyev tried to open the front door to Alinejad’s house. The journalist managed to sneak away. At that point, police officers were watching Mehdiyev because Alinejad had reported suspicious activity to the FBI. Mehdiyev drove away not long after trying to open Alinejad’s door. Police pulled him over after he ran a stop sign and arrested him when they realized his license was suspended and he was in possession of a firearm with an obliterated serial number. In jail, Mehdiyev used a contraband phone to notify the Thieves-in-Law that he had been arrested. One member of the criminal group sent Mehdiyev voice messages saying that he 'went to kill the journalist,' but 'they caught him,' prosecutors said. The severe targeting of Alinejad underscores how Iran ranks among the worst perpetrators of transnational repression against journalists, according to Freedom House. In 2022, Iranian operatives allegedly attempted to assassinate two Iranian journalists working at the Iran International TV network in London. Like VOA’s Persian Service, Iran International is a source of independent news directed at populations in Iran. Inside Iran, the government has long repressed independent journalists and other critics. The country ranks 176 out of 180 countries on the World Press Freedom Index, where 180 shows the worst media freedom environment.	https://www.voanews.com/a/trial-to-begin-in-new-york-for-men-accused-of-planning-assassination-of-voa-host/8005312.html	2025-03-10T08:38:16-07:00	
Russia expels 2 British diplomats from embassy in Moscow over espionage claims	Russia said Monday it was expelling two British diplomats based at the embassy in Moscow over spying allegations that the U.K. called 'malicious and baseless.' Russia’s Federal Security Service (FSB) said in a statement quoted by the state news agency RIA Novosti that the two diplomats had provided false personal data while seeking permission to enter the country and had engaged in alleged intelligence and subversive activities that threatened Russia's security. It didn't offer any evidence. According to the RIA Novosti report, a decision has been made to revoke the diplomats' accreditations, and they have been ordered to leave Russia within two weeks. The Russian Foreign Ministry said in a separate statement that it summoned a British Embassy official. 'Moscow will not tolerate the activities of undeclared British intelligence officers on Russian territory,' it said. The Foreign Office in London said in a statement: 'This is not the first time that Russia has made malicious and baseless accusations against our staff.' It did not say whether the U.K. planned any retaliatory moves. The FSB last year accused seven British diplomats of spying. Six expulsions were announced in September, and one more in November. The U.K. called the moves at the time 'baseless.' The expulsions came amid soaring tensions over the war in Ukraine and after London decided to revoke the credentials of an attaché at the Russian Embassy and limit Moscow’s diplomatic activities in Britain. Last month, London expelled a Russian diplomat in response to the November expulsion. In May 2024, the U.K. expelled Russia’s defense attaché in London, alleging he was an undeclared intelligence officer, and it closed several Russian diplomatic properties in Britain that it said were being used for spying. Days later Russia reciprocated and expelled Britain’s defense attaché. Expulsions of diplomats — both Western envoys working in Russia and Russians in the West — have become increasingly common since Moscow launched its full-scale invasion of Ukraine in 2022. In 2023, the Russian news outlet RBC said Western countries and Japan had expelled a total of 670 Russian diplomats between the start of 2022 and October 2023, while Moscow responded by expelling 346 diplomats. According to RBC, that was more than in the previous 20 years combined.	https://www.voanews.com/a/russia-expels-2-british-diplomats-from-embassy-in-moscow-over-espionage-claims/8005284.html	2025-03-10T08:14:20-07:00

Port chief says 32 casualties brought ashore after ships collide and catch fire in North Sea	London — An oil tanker and a cargo ship collided off the coast of eastern England Monday, setting both vessels on fire and triggering a major rescue operation, emergency services said. At least 32 casualties were brought ashore, but their condition was not immediately clear. Martyn Boyers, chief executive of the Port of Grimsby East, said 13 casualties were brought in on a Windcat 33 vessel, followed by another 19 on a harbor pilot boat. Britain's Maritime and Coastguard Agency said several lifeboats and a coast guard rescue helicopter were dispatched to the scene in the North Sea, along with a coast guard plane and nearby vessels with firefighting capability. The RNLI lifeboat agency said, 'there were reports that a number of people had abandoned the vessels following a collision and there were fires on both ships.' It said three lifeboats were working on search and rescue at the scene alongside the coast guard. Video footage aired by the BBC and apparently filmed from a nearby vessel showed thick black smoke pouring from both ships. Boyers, the port chief, said he had been told there was 'a massive fireball.' 'It’s too far out for us to see — about 10 miles — but we have seen the vessels bringing them in,' he said. The tanker, believed to be the U.S.-flagged chemical and oil products carrier MV Stena Immaculate, was at anchor at the time after sailing from Greece, according to ship-tracking site VesselFinder. The cargo vessel, Portugal-flagged container ship Solong, was sailing from Grangemouth in Scotland to Rotterdam in the Netherlands. Coast guard officials said the alarm was raised at 9:48 a.m. local time (0948 GMT). The site of the collision is off the coast of Hull, about 155 miles (250 kilometers) north of London.	https://www.voanews.com/a/port-chief-says-32-casualties-brought-ashore-after-ships-collide-and-catch-fire-in-north-sea-/8005209.html	2025-03-10T07:45:54-07:00

One-day strike at 13 German airports, including main hubs, brings most flights to halt	Berlin — A one-day strike by workers at 13 German airports, including the Frankfurt and Munich hubs and all the country's other main destinations, caused the cancelation of most flights on Monday. The 24-hour walkout, which started at midnight on Sunday, involves public-sector employees at the airports as well as ground and security staff. At Frankfurt Airport, 1,054 of the day's 1,116 scheduled takeoffs and landings had been canceled, German news agency dpa reported, citing airport traffic management. All of Berlin Airport's regular departures and arrivals were canceled, while Hamburg Airport said no departures would be possible. Cologne/Bonn Airport said there was no regular passenger service and Munich Airport advised travelers to expect a 'greatly reduced flight schedule.' The ver.di service workers union's strike also targeted the Bremen, Hannover, Duesseldorf, Dortmund, Leipzig/Halle and Stuttgart airports. At the smaller Weeze and Karlsruhe/Baden-Baden airports, only security workers were called out. The German airports' association, ADV, estimated that more than 3,500 flights in total would be canceled and about 560,000 passengers affected. The union announced the strike last Friday. But at Hamburg Airport, it added a short-notice walkout on Sunday to the strike on Monday, arguing that it must ensure the measure was effective. The so-called 'warning strike,' a common tactic in German wage negotiations, relates to two separate pay disputes: negotiations on a new pay and conditions contract for airport security workers, and a wider dispute over pay for employees of federal and municipal governments. The latter already has led to walkouts at Cologne/Bonn, Duesseldorf, Hamburg and Munich airports. Pay talks in that dispute are due to resume on Friday, while the next round of talks for airport security workers is expected to start on March 26.	https://www.voanews.com/a/one-day-strike-at-13-german-airports-including-the-main-hubs-brings-most-flights-to-a-halt-/8005192.html	2025-03-10T07:07:20-07:00	
Court-martial convenes for Pentagon leaker already facing years behind bars	Bedford, Massachusetts — A military court-martial convened on Monday for Massachusetts Air National Guard member Jack Teixeira, who was sentenced in federal court to 15 years in prison for leaking highly classified military documents after the most consequential national security breach in years. Teixeira pleaded guilty last year to six counts of willful retention and transmission of national defense information under the Espionage Act. He faces additional military charges of disobeying orders and obstructing justice in the court-martial, held at Hanscom Air Force Base in Massachusetts. Military prosecutors said the court-martial is appropriate given that obeying orders is the 'absolute core' of the military. Teixeira's lawyers argued that further action would amount to prosecuting him twice for the same offense. The leaks exposed to the world unvarnished secret assessments of Russia's war in Ukraine, including information about troop movements in Ukraine, and the provision of supplies and equipment to Ukrainian troops. Teixeira also admitted posting information about a U.S. adversary's plans to harm U.S. forces serving overseas. Before he was sentenced in November in U.S. District Court in Boston, Teixeira showed little emotion as he stood in court and apologized for his actions. The 22-year-old previously admitted he illegally collected some of the nation's most sensitive secrets and shared them with other users on the social media platform Discord. 'I wanted to say I'm sorry for all the harm that I brought and caused,' Teixeira said. 'I understand all the responsibility and consequences fall upon my shoulders alone and accept whatever that will bring.' Afterward, Teixeira hugged one of his attorneys, looked toward his family and smiled before being led from court. His family left without commenting to reporters, but his mother and others submitted letters to the court seeking leniency. 'I know Jack deeply regrets his actions and is ready to accept his punishment for his part in this situation,' his mother, Dawn Dufault, wrote. 'While I understand the severity of his charges and the importance of ensuring justice, I implore you, Your Honor, to consider Jack's true nature and his unique challenges, as I have observed over the years.' The security breach raised alarm over the country's ability to protect its most closely guarded secrets and forced the Biden administration to scramble to try to contain the diplomatic and military fallout. The leaks also embarrassed the Pentagon, which tightened controls to safeguard classified information and disciplined members found to have intentionally failed to take required action about Teixeira's suspicious behavior. Teixeira, of North Dighton, Massachusetts, was part of the 102nd Intelligence Wing at Otis Air National Guard Base in Massachusetts. He worked as a cyber transport systems specialist, which is essentially an information technology specialist responsible for military communications networks. He remains in the Air National Guard in an unpaid status, an Air Force official said. Teixeira's lawyers described him as an autistic, isolated individual who spent most of his time online, especially with his Discord community, and never meant to harm the United States. 'His intent was to educate his friends about world events to make certain they were not misled by misinformation,' they wrote. 'He needed someone to share the experience with.' Prosecutors countered that Teixeira did not suffer from any intellectual disability and that his post-arrest diagnosis of 'mild, high-functioning' autism was of 'questionable relevance.' Authorities said he first typed out classified documents he accessed and then began sharing photographs of files that bore SECRET and TOP SECRET markings. Prosecutors also said he tried to cover his tracks before his arrest. Authorities found a smashed tablet, laptop and an Xbox gaming console in a dumpster at his house.	https://www.voanews.com/a/court-martial-convenes-for-pentagon-leaker-already-facing-years-behind-bars/8005159.html	2025-03-10T06:43:13-07:00	
Exclusive: Top US Marine says 'crisis' with amphibious ships causing coverage gaps	PENTAGON — A shortage of amphibious warfare ships for commanders across the globe has reached a breaking point, with defense officials warning VOA the crisis has triggered a monthslong drought in critical firepower from sea-based Marines. 'I have the Marines, and I have the squadrons, and I have the battalions and the batteries … I just don’t have the amphibs,' Marine Corps Commandant Gen. Eric Smith told VOA in an exclusive interview. While the amphibious warfare ships, known as amphibs, make up just 10% of the fleet, they are the go-to alternative to aircraft carriers when commanders need something more precise or expedient. They also are the only ships made for the Marine Corps’ rapid reaction forces, known as Marine Expeditionary Units (MEUs), to get equipment and troops from sea to shore during an assault. 'Amphibs are vital to us. They are an existential part of who we are as Marines,' Smith said. Military’s Swiss Army Knife Once deployed, these units of about 2,000 Marines and sailors are the military’s Swiss Army Knife, providing everything from strike power with F-35 fighter jets, to support in non-combatant evacuation operations and disaster relief, like when the 15th MEU rushed humanitarian aid to the Philippines after deadly floods and landslides last October. It takes three amphibs – one big-deck amphib and two smaller ones – to make an Amphibious Ready Group that transports the Marines, a unit often referred to as an ARG/MEU. Smith says the military needs three of these 3-ship units deployed abroad at all times –one from the East Coast, one from the West Coast, and one from Japan – a plan known as 3.0. 'The INDOPACOM Commander, the EUCOM Commander, the AFRICOM commander have all called for an ARG/MEU, so 3.0 is the requirement.' However, Smith tells VOA he cannot achieve this requirement with the number of amphibs that are ready today. ‘Running ships to ground’ While the U.S. military was busy fighting two wars in the Middle East, its amphib fleet, plagued with maintenance deferments and delays, fell into disrepair, said Shelby Oakley with the Government Accountability Office. Oakley authored a GAO report in December that showed half of the 32 amphibs in the fleet are in poor material condition. 'You're running these ships to ground, not taking care of them,' she told VOA. 'This is kind of equivalent to just driving your car and never changing the oil and expecting it to last 15 years. … Key systems aren’t functioning the way they are supposed to,' Oakley said. In 2022, Congress mandated the Navy keep a minimum of 31 amphibs in its fleet after the service had tried to divest six of these poorly maintained ships in their fiscal year 2023 budget plan. The Marine Corps had said a minimum of 31 amphibs would be enough to complete their missions, so long as the fleet’s readiness rate remained at 80% or higher. 'Your readiness rate is down in the 50-percentile range, and it needs to be 80%, then I would say that’s a crisis,' Smith told VOA. One of the amphibs – USS Tortuga – hasn't sailed in more than a decade. And there are 15 more that the Government Accountability Office says are not on track to make it to the end of their 40-year service lives. 'We're trying to keep an aging force ready and focused on what it needs to do,' Admiral Jim Kilby, the acting chief of naval operations, told VOA in an exclusive interview last month. According to Kilby, the problem extends beyond amphibious ships. 'We're running the whole Navy hard. So, when I started in the Navy, we had almost 600 ships. Now, we’ve got half that, but we are still doing the same mission,' Kilby said. Coverage gaps Kilby says the Navy is trying to tackle the issues dragging down its fleet the same way it fixed issues grounding its fighter jets a few years ago, closely monitoring its processes to adjust long-held practices that are slowing down change. 'The surface committee has doubled the number of ships that completed maintenance on time. It's not where I want to be. I want to get better, so it is not acceptable to have 50%,' he said. Kilby did not have a set date, though, for when the Navy planned to increase the readiness of the amphib fleet from 50% to 80%, an urgent need for the commandant who says the 'gaps in coverage' already have begun. 'There was a non-combatant evacuation operation required to get American citizens out of Sudan when violence was erupting. And because there was no ARG/MEU presence, the AFRICOM commander was forced to use commercial airlines,' Smith said. Even when ARG/MEU units have deployed, they’ve frequently deployed incomplete. The USS America Amphibious Ready Group deployed with two ships instead of three last year because there wasn’t another amphib available. And the USS Boxer Amphibious Ready Group had so many maintenance delays that the Navy had to stagger each ship’s deployment last year, all months later than planned. What was supposed to be a nine-month deployment resulted in just two months with all three ships together. 'When the Boxer wasn't there, they couldn't do F-35 operations, they couldn't support an international partner as they had planned,' Oakley told VOA. ‘Not a Navy requirement’ The 31st MEU just completed their last patrol aboard the USS America Amphibious Ready Group earlier this month. The next ARG/MEU to deploy from the East Coast or Japan is still months away, according to officials who spoke to VOA on condition of anonymity to discuss future planning. Officials say one likely won’t deploy from the West Coast until 2026. One Navy official told VOA the service only budgets to deploy one ARG/MEU at a time for only 10 months in the year. Asked about the discrepancy between the Marine’s needs and the Navy’s amphib availability, Kilby told VOA the Marine Corps’ 3.0 requirement 'is not a Navy requirement.' 'I do not have a plan to get 3.0. I have a plan to maintain 31 ships per law in our shipbuilding plan,' Kilby said. As the Government Accountability Office points out in its report, that plan banks on the Navy keeping six of the amphibs in the fleet for several years beyond their expected 40-year service life, including some of those currently in poor condition. 'There's huge questions about whether or not they will even make it to their service, expected service life,' Oakley said. Amphibious warfare ships have generally not met the Navy’s planned maintenance schedules dating back to 2010, according to Marine Corps documentation. Specifically, from 2010-2021, the Navy extended more than 70% of amphibious warfare ship maintenance beyond its original planned end date. 'This cumulatively resulted in 28.5 years of lost training and deployment time for those ships and their associated Marines,' according to the December Government Accountability Office report. A decade to fix The acting chief of naval operations said the Navy is currently planning the maintenance availabilities needed to do the work necessary to get the amphibs to a life cycle health assessment above poor. Maintenance for seven of the amphibs that were not funded in previous budgets are being funded in the budget being considered by Congress today, Kilby told VOA. 'We're committed to 31 amphibious ships … and when we get a new ship, we'll replace an old ship, because that old ship is more expensive and harder to maintain,' he said. The Government Accountability Office says that even if the planning improves, the Navy and Marine Corps may still need to revisit the overall number of ships required for its missions. 'That's the math, and that's the data that we need them to do to be able to understand how many more of these things do we need to buy, how many more do we need to get online quicker to be able to continue to meet this number,' Oakley said. Gen. Smith said the problem will take at least a decade to fix, which could compound should the United States find itself in a future conflict with China. 'The whole point of having the ARG/MEU out is to prevent conflict,' he said. Kilby says the Navy wants the problem solved by 2027 — year Chinese leader Xi Jinping has ordered the military to be prepared to take democratically ruled Taiwan by force. 'We have the Navy we have. That's the Navy we're going to have largely in 2027, and we just need to operate it more efficiently and effectively,' he said.	https://www.voanews.com/a/exclusive-top-us-marine-says-crisis-with-amphibious-ships-causing-coverage-gaps/8004073.html	2025-03-10T06:29:40-07:00	
Rubio says purge of USAID programs complete, with 83% of agency's programs gone	Washington — Secretary of State Marco Rubio said Monday the Trump administration had finished its six-week purge of programs of the six-decade-old U.S. Agency for International Development, and said he would move the 18% of aid and development programs that survived under the State Department. Rubio made the announcement in a post on X. It marked one of his relatively few public comments on what has been a historic shift away from U.S. foreign aid and development, executed by Trump political appointees at State and Elon Musk's Department of Government Efficiency teams. Rubio in the post thanked DOGE and 'our hardworking staff who worked very long hours to achieve this overdue and historic reform' in foreign aid. President Donald Trump on Jan. 20 issued an executive order directing a freeze of foreign assistance funding and a review of all of the tens of billions of dollars of U.S. aid and development work abroad. Trump charged that much of foreign assistance was wasteful and advanced a liberal agenda. Rubio's social media post Monday said that review was now 'officially ending,' with some 5,200 of USAID's 6,200 programs eliminated. Those programs 'spent tens of billions of dollars in ways that did not serve, (and in some cases even harmed), the core national interests of the United States,' Rubio wrote. 'In consultation with Congress, we intend for the remaining 18% of programs we are keeping ... to be administered more effectively under the State Department,' he said. Democratic lawmakers and others call the shutdown of congressionally-funded programs illegal, saying such a move requires Congress' approval. The State Department in one of multiple lawsuits it is battling over its rapid shutdown of USAID had said earlier this month it was killing more than 90% of USAID programs. Rubio gave no explanation for why his number was lower, and no details of what programs were spared or how the State Department would run them. The dismantling of USAID that followed Trump's order upended decades of policy that humanitarian and development aid abroad advanced U.S. national security by stabilizing regions and economies, strengthening alliances and building goodwill. In the weeks after Trump's order, one of his appointees and transition team members, Pete Marocco, and Musk pulled USAID staff around the world off the job through forced leaves and firings, shut down USAID payments overnight and terminated aid and development contracts by the thousands. Contractors and staffers running efforts ranging from epidemic control to famine prevention to job and democracy training stopped work. Aid groups and other USAID partners laid off tens of thousands of their workers in the U.S. and abroad. Lawsuits brought by some of the nonprofit groups and businesses that had partnered with USAID say the form-letter contract terminations purge eliminated even programs that Rubio had said he wanted to save, violated the contract terms and stiffed aid groups and businesses of billions of dollars. The shutdown has left many USAID staffers and contractors and their families still overseas, many of them awaiting U.S.-paid back payments and travel expenses back home.	https://www.voanews.com/a/rubio-says-purge-of-usaid-programs-complete-with-83-of-agency-s-programs-gone-/8005107.html	2025-03-10T06:10:50-07:00	
Pope following Vatican's spiritual retreat from afar as he recovers from pneumonia in hospital	Rome — Pope Francis is participating in the Vatican’s weeklong spiritual retreat from a Rome hospital as he continued his recovery on Monday from double pneumonia and looks ahead to the 12th anniversary of his election amid questions about what the future of his papacy might look like. Francis followed the opening of the retreat by videoconference on Sunday. He could see and hear the Rev. Roberto Pasolini, preacher of the papal household, but the priests, bishops and cardinals in the Vatican auditorium couldn’t see or hear him. Pasolini delivered a meditation on 'The hope of eternal life,' a theme that was chosen well before Francis was admitted to Rome's Gemelli hospital on Feb. 14 with a complex lung infection. The retreat, which is an annual gathering that kicks off the Catholic Church’s solemn Lenten season leading to Easter, continues through the week. The Vatican has said Francis would participate 'in spiritual communion' with the rest of the hierarchy, from afar. In its early update Monday, the Vatican said Francis was resting after a quiet night. At the time of his hospitalization last month, the 88-year-old pope, who has chronic lung disease and had part of one lung removed as a young man, had what was then just a bad case of bronchitis. The infection progressed into a complex respiratory tract infection and double pneumonia that has sidelined Francis for the longest period of his 12-year papacy and raised questions about the future. He has now remained in stable condition for over a week, with no fever, respiratory crises and good oxygen levels in his blood for several days, doctors reported. The doctors said that such stability was in itself a positive thing and showed he was responding well to therapy. But they kept his prognosis as 'guarded,' meaning that he’s not out of danger. Doctors were expected to provide a medical update later Monday. On Thursday, the Vatican will mark the 12th anniversary of Francis’ election, the first with the pope out of sight but still very much in charge. Francis was elected the 266th pope, the first Jesuit pope and first from Latin America, on March 13, 2013, following the resignation of Pope Benedict XVI. On Sunday, Francis met with Cardinal Pietro Parolin and the chief of staff, Archbishop Edgar Pena Parra, for the third time at the hospital. Such meetings are the routine way the pope governs, and shows Francis is still keeping up with essential business. While Francis has previously praised Benedict for his courage and humility in resigning, he has indicated more recently that he believes the job of pope is for life and said as recently as last year that he had no plans of stepping down. Francis has been using high flows of supplemental oxygen to help him breathe during the day and a noninvasive mechanical ventilation mask at night.	https://www.voanews.com/a/pope-following-vatican-s-spiritual-retreat-from-afar-as-he-recovers-from-pneumonia-in-hospital-/8005039.html	2025-03-10T05:09:11-07:00	
US-Ukraine to hold talks in Saudi Arabia on how to end war with Russia	Even as U.S.-led peace negotiations to end Russia’s war in Ukraine recently faced setbacks, talks between Washington and Kyiv are set to take place this week in Saudi Arabia.

Romanian far-right candidate to challenge presidential bid rejection at top court	BUCHAREST — Romanian far-right pro-Russian presidential contender Calin Georgescu will challenge a decision to bar him from taking part in a rerun of the election in May, one of his advisers told Reuters on Monday. Georgescu submitted his presidential bid on Friday after allegations of Russian interference in his favor prompted Romania's Constitutional Court to cancel the original election in December. Moscow denied the allegations of meddling. On Sunday, Romania's central election authority said it had decided to bar Georgescu's candidacy, saying it was inadmissible after the Constitutional Court's annulment of the December vote. Challenges to decisions by Romania's central election authority must be filed within 24 hours. The Constitutional Court should rule on Georgescu's appeal by Wednesday. Analysts have said it is unlikely that the top court will allow Georgescu to run again for the presidency in Romania, a member state of the European Union and NATO which shares a long border with Ukraine. The court set a precedent in October when it blocked the candidacy of another far-right candidate, arguing that her anti-European, pro-Russian views made her unfit for office. If the court upholds the central election authority's decision, the three ultranationalist parties, which hold 35% of seats in parliament and which backed Georgescu's previous bid for the presidency, risk having no candidate in the May election. George Simion, leader of the opposition Alliance for Uniting Romanians (AUR), the second largest party in Romania's parliament, said he would meet with Georgescu on Monday. Asked if he was considering submitting his own candidacy, Simion told reporters: 'We wait to see what Mr. Georgescu will say. We are not ruling out any options, but we are not speculators.' Georgescu is under criminal investigation on six counts, including membership in a fascist organization and communicating false information about campaign financing. He has denied any wrongdoing.	https://www.voanews.com/a/romanian-far-right-candidate-to-challenge-presidential-bid-rejection-at-the-top-court-/8005007.html	2025-03-10T04:30:52-07:00	
Russia, Ukraine report clashes in Sumy	Russian and Ukrainian officials reported fighting in Ukraine’s Sumy region, with Russian advances in the area creating the potential for cutting off supply lines to Ukraine’s military. The officials said clashes were taking place in the Novenke area. Sumy is located across the border from Russia’s Kursk region, where Ukrainian troops launched an offensive in August. Russian forces occupied parts of Sumy during the early part of their full-scale invasion of Ukraine that began more than three years ago. Ukraine’s military said Monday it shot down 130 Russian drones overnight that targeted areas across the country. Intercepts took place over the Cherkasy, Chernihiv, Dnipropetrovsk, Kharkiv, Kherson, Kirovohrad, Kyiv, Mykolaiv, Odesa, Poltava, Sumy, Vinnytsia and Zaporizhzhia regions, the military said. Officials in Poltava reported damage to several residential buildings. Russia’s Defense Ministry said Monday its air defenses destroyed nine Ukrainian drones over Samara, Voronezh, Oryol, Belgorod and Kursk.

Philippines' Duterte says he will accept arrest if ICC issues warrant	HONG KONG/MANILA — Former Philippines President Rodrigo Duterte said in Hong Kong that he was ready for possible arrest amid reports the International Criminal Court (ICC) was poised to issue a warrant over his years-long 'war on drugs' that killed thousands. The 'war on drugs' was the signature campaign policy that swept Duterte to power in 2016 as a maverick, crime-busting mayor, who delivered on promises he made during vitriolic speeches, to kill thousands of narcotics dealers. The office of the current President Ferdinand Marcos Jr said on Monday no official communication had been received from Interpol yet, but indicated Duterte could be handed over. 'Our law enforcers are ready to follow what law dictates, if the warrant of arrest needs to be served because of a request from Interpol,' Presidential Communications Undersecretary Claire Castro told reporters. It was not immediately clear how long Duterte would stay in China-ruled Hong Kong - which is not a party to the ICC. Duterte was in the city to speak at a campaign rally attended by thousands of Filipino workers, hoping to boost support for his senatorial candidates in upcoming Philippine midterm elections. 'Assuming it's (warrant) true, why did I do it? For myself? For my family? For you and your children, and for our nation,' Duterte told the rally, justifying his brutal anti-narcotics campaign. 'If this is truly my fate in life, it's OK, I will accept it. They can arrest me, imprison me. 'What is my sin? I did everything in my time for peace and a peaceful life for the Filipino people,' he told the cheering crowds in Hong Kong's downtown Southorn Stadium, appearing with his daughter, the Philippines Vice President Sara Duterte. An elite Hong Kong police unit for protecting VIPs was stationed in the vicinity of the hotel where Duterte is staying, according to a Reuters witness. The Hong Kong government's security bureau and police gave no immediate response to a request for comment. The Philippines presidential office dismissed speculation that Duterte might evade the law by visiting Hong Kong, while appealing to Duterte's supporters to allow the legal process to take its course. During a congressional hearing last year into his bloody crackdown on drugs, Duterte said he was not scared of the ICC and told it to 'hurry up' on its investigation. The firebrand Duterte unilaterally withdrew the Philippines from the ICC's founding treaty in 2019 when it started looking into allegations of systematic extrajudicial killings. More recently, the Philippines has signaled it is ready to cooperate with the investigation in certain areas.	https://www.voanews.com/a/philippines-duterte-says-he-will-accept-arrest-if-icc-issues-warrant/8004886.html	2025-03-10T02:17:45-07:00	
China vows utmost efforts for 'peaceful reunification' with Taiwan	BEIJING — China will exert utmost efforts to realize 'peaceful reunification' with Taiwan, but will take all necessary steps to safeguard China's territorial integrity, its foreign ministry said on Monday. China claims democratically governed Taiwan as its own territory despite the objection of the government in Taipei. Taiwanese President Lai Ching-te says only Taiwan's people can decide their future. Last week, on the sidelines of China's annual meeting of parliament, Foreign Minister Wang Yi told reporters that Taiwan would never be a 'country,' and to support 'Taiwan independence' was to interfere in China's internal affairs. China is 'willing to do our utmost to strive for the prospect of peaceful reunification with the greatest sincerity,' said Mao Ning, spokesperson at the foreign ministry, when asked about Wang's remarks on Taiwan. 'At the same time, China will take all necessary measures to safeguard national sovereignty and territorial integrity and resolutely oppose Taiwan independence and external interference,' Mao said. In recent years, Beijing has ramped up its military pressure against the island, including holding several rounds of war games, keeping alive the prospect of the use of force to bring Taiwan under its control. The United States is Taiwan's key arms supplier even in the absence of formal diplomatic ties, but there is no defense treaty, unlike in the case of Japan and South Korea. The United States must cease its arms sales to Taiwan and stop all military contacts with the island, Mao told reporters. 'The Taiwan issue is the core of China's core interests and the first insurmountable red line in Sino-U.S. relations,' she warned.	https://www.voanews.com/a/china-vows-utmost-efforts-for-peaceful-reunification-with-taiwan/8004919.html	2025-03-10T02:14:06-07:00	
Opium farming takes root in Myanmar's war-wracked landscape	Pekon, Myanmar — Scraping opium resin off a seedpod in Myanmar's remote poppy fields, displaced farmer Aung Hla describes the narcotic crop as his only prospect in a country made barren by conflict. The 35-year-old was a rice farmer when the junta seized power in a 2021 coup, adding pro-democracy guerillas to the long-running civil conflict between the military and ethnic armed groups. Four years on, the United Nations has said Myanmar is mired in a 'polycrisis' of mutually compounding conflict, poverty and environmental damage. Aung Hla was forced off his land in Moe Bye village by fighting after the coup. When he resettled, his usual crops were no longer profitable, but the hardy poppy promised 'just enough for a livelihood'. 'Everyone thinks people grow poppy flowers to be rich, but we are just trying hard to get by,' he told AFP in rural Pekon township of eastern Shan state. He says he regrets growing the substance -- the core ingredient in heroin -- but said the income is the only thing separating him from starvation. 'If anyone were in my shoes, they would likely do the same.' Displaced and desperate Myanmar's opium production was previously second only to Afghanistan, where poppy farming flourished following the U.S.-led invasion in the wake of the Sept. 11, 2001 attacks. But after the Taliban government launched a crackdown, Myanmar overtook Afghanistan as the world's biggest producer of opium in 2023, according to the United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime (UNODC). Myanmar's opiate economy -- including the value of domestic consumption as well as exports abroad -- is estimated between $589 million and $1.57 billion, according to the UNODC. Between September and February each year, dozens of workers toil in Pekon's fields, slicing immature poppy seedpods, which ooze a small amount of sticky brown resin. Aung Naing, 48, gently transfers the collected resin from a small trough onto a leaf plate. Before the coup, which ended a brief experiment with democracy, Aung Naing was a reformed opium farmer. But wartime hardship forced him back to the crop. 'There is more poppy cultivation because of difficulties in residents' livelihoods,' he says. 'Most of the farmers who plant poppy are displaced,' he said. 'Residents who can't live in their villages and fled to the jungle are working in poppy fields.' In Myanmar's fringes, ethnic armed groups, border militias and the military all vie for control of local resources and the lucrative drug trade. Aung Naing says poppy earns only a slightly higher profit than food crops like corn, bean curd and potatoes, which are also vulnerable to disease when it rains. Fresh opium was generally sold by Myanmar farmers for just over $300 per kilo in 2024, according to the UNODC, a small fraction of what it fetches on the international black market. And the crop is more costly to produce than rice -- more labor intensive, requiring expensive fertilizers and with small yields. Aung Naing says he makes just shy of a $30 profit for each kilo. 'How can we get rich from that?' he asks. 'Unsafe' The UN Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs estimates there are more than 3.5 million people displaced in Myanmar. But fleeing conflict zones to farm opium does not guarantee safety. 'Military fighter jets are flying over us,' said Aung Naing. 'We are working in poppy fields with anxiety and fear. We feel unsafe.' Opium cultivation and production in Myanmar decreased slightly between 2023 and 2024, according to the UNODC -- in part due to ongoing clashes between armed groups. 'If our country were at peace and there were industries offering many job opportunities in the region, we wouldn't plant any poppy fields even if we were asked to,' says farmer Shwe Khine, 43. Aung Hla agreed. With the war, he said, 'we don't have any choice'.	https://www.voanews.com/a/opium-farming-takes-root-in-myanmar-s-war-wracked-landscape/8004904.html	2025-03-10T01:12:22-07:00	
North Korea fires several ballistic missiles into sea after US, South Korea began military drills	SEOUL, South Korea — North Korea fired several ballistic missiles into the sea on Monday, South Korea’s military said, hours after South Korean and U.S. troops kicked off their large annual combined drills, which the North views as an invasion rehearsal. South Korea’s Joint Chiefs of Staff said the missile firings, North Korea’s fifth missile launch event this year, were detected from the North’s Hwanghae province but gave no further details such as how far they flew. Earlier Monday, the South Korean and U.S. militaries began their annual joint military exercises, which are scheduled to last 11 days. The Freedom Shield command post exercise began after the South Korean and U.S. militaries paused live-fire training while Seoul investigates how two of its fighter jets mistakenly bombed a civilian area during a warm-up drill last week. The drills' start drew the condemnation of nuclear-armed North Korea, which issued a government statement calling the exercises a 'dangerous provocative act' that increases the risks of military conflict. About 30 people were injured, two of them seriously, when two South Korean KF-16 fighter jets mistakenly fired eight MK-82 bombs on a civilian area in Pocheon, a town near the North Korean border, on Thursday. The bombing occurred while South Korean and U.S. forces were engaging in a live-fire drill ahead of the larger Freedom Shield exercise. In a background briefing to domestic reporters on Monday, the South Korean air force repeated its initial assessment last week that one of the KF-16 pilots had entered the wrong coordinates for a bombing site. The unidentified pilot didn’t recognize the error during a pre-takeoff check and, rushing to meet scheduled timing, failed to visually verify the target before proceeding with the bombing. The second pilot had the correct coordinates but focused only on maintaining formation with the other aircraft and dropped the bombs following the first pilot’s instructions, failing to recognize they deviated from the right target, according to the content of the briefing provided to The Associated Press. Gen. Lee Youngsu, chief of staff of the South Korean air force, bowed and apologized Monday over the injuries and property damage caused by the incident, which he said 'should have never happened and must never happen again.' Both the South Korean and U.S. militaries have halted all live-fire exercises in South Korea following the mishap. South Korean military officials say live-fire training will resume after they complete the ongoing investigation on the bombing and formulate preventative steps. The Freedom Shield exercise marks the first large-scale joint exercise since U.S. President Donald Trump began his second term. It comes amid growing tensions with North Korea over its nuclear ambitions and its alignment with Russia in President Vladimir Putin’s war on Ukraine. Trump, who met North Korean leader Kim Jong Un three times during his first term, has expressed his willingness to reach out to Kim again to revive diplomacy, which collapsed due to disagreements over exchanging U.S.-led sanctions against the North and the North's denuclearization steps. But Pyongyang has yet to respond to his overture and has continued its fiery rhetoric against Washington and Seoul over their joint military exercises, which Kim portrays as rehearsals for invasion. In a statement issued through state media Monday, the North Korean Foreign Ministry called the Freedom Shield exercise an 'aggressive and confrontational war rehearsal' that risks triggering 'physical conflict' on the Korean Peninsula. The ministry reiterated Kim’s state goals for a 'radical growth' of his nuclear force to counter what he claims as growing threats posed by the U.S. and its Asian allies.	https://www.voanews.com/a/north-korea-fires-several-ballistic-missiles-into-sea-after-us-south-korea-began-military-drills-/8004903.html	2025-03-10T01:02:06-07:00	
Indian slums get 'cool roofs' to combat extreme heat	AHMEDABAD, India — Hundreds of roofs in the informal settlements of India's western Gujarat state have been painted in a reflective, white coating over the last two months to try to keep their occupants cooler as the hottest time of year approaches. The effort, which involves 400 households in Ahmedabad, is part of a global scientific trial to study how indoor heat impacts people's health and economic outcomes in developing countries - and how 'cool roofs' might help. 'Traditionally, home is where people have come to find shelter and respite against external elements,' said Aditi Bunker, an epidemiologist at the University of Heidelberg in Switzerland who is leading the project, supported by the UK-based Wellcome Trust. 'Now, we're in this position where people are living in precarious housing conditions, where the thing that was supposed to be protecting them is actually increasing their exposure to heat.' As climate change has made India's summers more extreme, Ahmedabad has suffered temperatures in excess of 46 C (115 F) in recent years. In the Vanzara Vas slum in the Narol area of the city, which has more than 2,000 dwellings, most of them airless, one-room homes, residents that are part of the project, such as Nehal Vijaybhai Bhil, say they have already noticed a difference. 'My refrigerator doesn't heat up anymore and the house feels cooler. I sleep so much better and my electricity bill is down,' said Bhil, whose roof was painted in January. Across the world, heatwaves that, prior to the industrial revolution, had a 1-in-10 chance of occurring in any given year are nearly three times as likely, according to a 2022 study in the journal Environmental Research Letters. By painting roofs with a white coating that contains highly reflective pigments such as titanium dioxide, Bunker and her team are sending more of the sun's radiation back to the atmosphere and preventing it from being absorbed. 'In a lot of these low socioeconomic homes, there's nothing to stop the heat transfer coming down - there's no insulation barrier from the roof,' Bunker said. Before joining Bunker's experiment, Arti Chunara said she would cover her roof with plastic sheets and spread grass over them. Some days, she and her family sat outside for most of the day, going into the house only for two to three hours when the heat was bearable. The trial in Ahmedabad will run for one year, and scientists will collect health and indoor environment data from residents living under a cool roof - and from those who do not. Other study sites are in Burkina Faso, Mexico and the island of Niue in the South Pacific, spanning a variety of building materials and climates. Early results from the Burkina Faso trial, Bunker said, show that cool roofs reduced indoor temperature by between 1.2 C in tin- and mud-roofed homes, and 1.7 C in tin-roofed homes over two years, which subsequently lowered residents' heart rates.	https://www.voanews.com/a/indian-slums-get-cool-roofs-to-combat-extreme-heat/8004901.html	2025-03-10T00:58:46-07:00	
India allows exports of broken rice to cut stockpiles	MUMBAI, India — India allowed the export of 100% broken rice, the government said in a notification late on Friday, after inventories reached a record high at the start of February, nearly nine times the government's target. Exports of 100% broken rice could help reduce stocks in the world's biggest exporter and enable poor African countries to secure the grain at lower prices, as well as support Asian animal feed and ethanol producers that rely on the grade. India had banned exports of 100% broken rice in September 2022 and then imposed curbs on exports of all other rice grades in 2023 after poor rainfall raised concerns over production. However, as the supply situation improved after the country harvested a record crop, New Delhi removed curbs on exports of all grades except 100% broken rice. 'Now that broken rice exports are allowed, we anticipate exporting around 2 million tons of this grade in 2025,' said B.V. Krishna Rao, president of the Rice Exporters' Association (REA). India exported 3.9 million metric tons of broken rice in 2022, mainly to China for animal feed and to African countries such as Senegal and Djibouti for human consumption. Broken rice is a byproduct of milling, and African countries prefer this grade because it is cheaper than other grades. Indian broken rice is currently offered at $330 per metric ton, compared to approximately $300 from rival suppliers like Vietnam, Myanmar, and Pakistan, said Himanshu Agrawal, executive director at Satyam Balajee, a leading rice exporter. 'However, these competing countries have limited stocks. As their stocks deplete, buyers will switch to India, and exports will pick up in coming months.'

Philippines says acts in national interest in South China Sea	MANILA, PHILIPPINES — China should recognize that the Philippines is an independent and sovereign state whose actions and decisions are driven entirely by national interest and not at the direction of other countries, Manila's foreign ministry said on Monday. The Philippines' foreign ministry also said the 'real issue is China's refusal to abide by international law' and how its 'illegal, coercive, aggressive and deceptive behavior at sea' have affected Filipino communities. 'We call on countries to be circumspect and to avoid actions and words that only contribute to tensions in the region,' it said in a statement responding to comments from China that Manila was being directed by external forces. At a press conference on March 7, Chinese foreign minister Wang Yi said the Philippines' actions in the South China Sea were not independent but part of a 'screenplay written by external forces,' to smear China. The Chinese embassy in Manila did not immediately respond to a request for comment on the foreign ministry's statement. The Philippines has embarked on what it calls a transparency initiative to shed light on China's actions in the South China Sea, including embedding journalists on maritime patrols and resupply missions. Its approach has resonated with allies, including the United States, who support the 2016 ruling by the Permanent Court of Arbitration that found China's vast South China Sea claims had no legal basis. China rejects that finding.	https://www.voanews.com/a/philippines-says-acts-in-national-interest-in-south-china-sea/8004878.html	2025-03-09T22:46:10-07:00	
Secret Service shoots man near White House	Police in Washington are investigating the shooting of a man Sunday by U.S. Secret Service personnel near the White House. A Secret Service spokesperson said a day before the shooting, police had shared information about 'a suicidal individual' who may have been traveling to Washington from the state of Indiana. Secret Service personnel spotted the person’s car near the White House and someone matching the person’s description walking in the area. The spokesperson said the person brandished a firearm as officers approached, and that Secret Service personnel fired shots during 'an armed confrontation.' Authorities have not identified the person who was taken to a local hospital after being shot. No Secret Service personnel were injured, the agency said. President Donald Trump was in Florida at the time of the shooting. Some information for this story was provided by The Associated Press and Reuters	https://www.voanews.com/a/secret-service-shoots-man-near-white-house/8004874.html	2025-03-09T22:21:34-07:00	
Forced to scam others worldwide, thousands now detained on Myanmar border	MAE SOT, Thailand — Thousands of sick, exhausted and terrified young men and women, from countries all over the world squat in rows, packed shoulder to shoulder, surgical masks covering their mouths and eyes. Their nightmare was supposed to be over. Last month, a dramatic and highly publicized operation by Thai, Chinese and Myanmar authorities led to the release of more than 7,000 people from locked compounds in Myanmar where they were forced to trick Americans and others out of their life savings. But survivors have found themselves trapped once again, this time in overcrowded facilities with no medical care, limited food and no idea when they'll be sent home. One young man from India said about 800 people were being held in the same facility as him, sharing 10 dirty toilets. He said many of the people there were feverish and coughing. Like all former enslaved scammers who talked to The Associated Press, he spoke on condition of anonymity out of concern for his safety. 'If we die here with health issues, who is responsible for that?' he asked. The armed groups who are holding the survivors, as well as Thai officials across the border, say they are awaiting action from the detainees' home governments. It's one of the largest potential rescues of forced laborers in modern history, but advocates say the first major effort to crack down on the cyber scam industry has turned into a growing humanitarian crisis. The people released are just a small fraction of what could be 300,000 people working in similar scam operations across the region, according to an estimate from the United States Institute of Peace. Human rights groups and analysts add that the networks that run these illegal scams will continue to operate unless much broader action is taken against them. A high-profile crackdown The trapped people, some of whom are highly educated and fluent in English, were initially lured to Thailand with promises of lucrative office jobs, only to find themselves locked in buildings where they describe being forced to sit at computers up to 16 hours a day running scams. Refusing to work could bring beatings, starvation and electric shocks. 'Your passport is confiscated, you cannot go outside and everything is like hell, a living hell,' a trapped Pakistani man told The Associated Press. Cyber scams run from compounds have flourished during the pandemic, targeting people around the world. The United Nations Office on Drugs and Crimes estimates that between $18 billion and $37 billion was lost in Asia alone in 2023, with minimal government action against the criminal industry's spread. Beijing began pushing the region's governments to crack down this year after a young Chinese actor was trafficked to Myanmar by people who promised him an acting job in Thailand. His girlfriend spearheaded a viral social media campaign that led to his release. Following that rescue, a senior Chinese government official visited Thailand and Myanmar demanding an end to the scams. In response, Thailand cut electricity, internet and gas supplies to five border towns in Myanmar. Shortly after, the ethnic militia groups that rule this part of Myanmar — the Kayin Border Guard Force and the Democratic Kayin Buddhist Army — asked some of the trapped scammers if they wanted to leave and then escorted them out of their compounds. From forced labor to detention As the number of people released grew into the thousands, formerly enslaved scammers found themselves caught in indefinite detention just across a narrow, slow-moving river's width from freedom. Most are being held either in army camps controlled by the Kayin Border Guard Force, or repurposed scam compounds, where many have been since early February. For weeks, men and women have shared unsanitary conditions, sleeping on the floor and eating what their captors provide. At one point, the Border Guard Force said that over 7,000 people were crammed into these facilities, as China began busing citizens across the border for flights. Exclusive photos obtained by AP underscore the detainees' desperation: Surgical masks, often two per face, cover their eyes, noses and mouths as they huddle under the watchful eyes of armed guards. 'It felt like a blessing that we came out of that trap, but the actual thing is that every person just wants to go back home,' said another Indian man, 24, speaking softly on a contraband phone from inside a makeshift detention center. He asked to not publish his name out of concern for his safety and because the militias guarding them had confiscated their phones. Last week, fights broke out between Chinese citizens waiting to go home and the security forces guarding them, two detainees told the AP. An unconfirmed list provided by authorities in Myanmar says they're holding citizens from 29 countries including Philippines, Kenya and the Czech Republic. Waiting for a $600 plane ticket Authorities in Thailand say they cannot allow foreigners to cross the border from Myanmar unless they can be sent home immediately, leaving many to wait for help from embassies that has been long in coming. China sent a chartered flight Thursday to the tiny Mae Sot airport to pick up a group of its citizens, but few other governments have matched that. There are roughly 130 Ethiopians waiting in a Thai military base, stuck for want of a $600 plane ticket. Dozens of Indonesians were bused out one morning last week, pushing suitcases and carrying plastic bags with their meager possessions as they headed to Bangkok for a flight home. Thai officials held a meeting this week with representatives from foreign embassies, promising to move 'as quickly as possible' to allow them to rescue their trapped citizens. But they warned that Thailand can only manage to receive 300 people per day, down from 500 previously, Monday through Fridays. It also announced it would let embassy staff cross over into Myanmar. 'The ministry attaches very high importance to this and is aware that there are sick people, and that they need to be repatriated,' Nikorndej Balankura, spokesman for Thailand's Ministry of Foreign Affairs said on Thursday. The Indian Embassy in Bangkok did not respond to requests for comment. The Czech Foreign Ministry says it cannot confirm a Czech citizen is among those repatriated. It says it is in touch with the embassies in Bangkok and Yangon over the issue and that the embassies have not been asked for assistance. Amy Miller, the Southeast Asia director of Acts of Mercy International who is based at the Thai-Myanmar border, says it's hard for the world to understand why all of the released workers aren't free. 'You can literally, with your naked eye, stand at the border and see people inside, on their balconies, in these compounds, and yet we cannot reach them,' she said. Pausing a moment, she gestured out a nearby window toward the Friendship Bridge to Myanmar just blocks away. 'I think what people don't understand is that to enter into another country is an act of war. You cannot just go in and receive these people out.' Assistance is scarce Aiding the work on the front lines, especially for those countries with fewer resources, are a handful of small nonprofit groups with very limited funds. In a nondescript Mae Sot home, Miller's organization receives escapees and a trickle of survivors who have made it across the river with comfortable couches, clean water, food and working phones to reach their families. She said today's unprecedented numbers are overwhelming the aid available across the river. 'When we're looking at numbers in the thousands, the ability to get them over to Thailand and process them and house them and feed them would be impossible for most governments,' said Miller. 'It really does require a kind of a global response.' The recent abrupt halt to U.S. foreign aid funding has made it even harder to get help to released scam center workers. The United Nations' International Organization for Migration, for example, previously funded care for victims of trafficking in scam compounds in one shelter in Cambodia, but it was forced to halt that work by the Trump administration's funding freeze announced in January, according to a source with direct knowledge of the situation. The halt to funding has also impacted a network of civil society groups that worked to stop human trafficking and rescue survivors in Thailand. 'It's really heartbreaking to see that there's such an immense amount of people that are in need of assistance,' said Saskia Kok, Head of Protection Unit in Thailand for the IOM. In a statement, U.S. officials acknowledged the high-pressure impasse. 'The United States remains deeply concerned about online scam operations throughout Southeast Asia, which affect thousands of Americans and individuals from many other countries,' said a State Department spokesperson in a statement sent to the AP. A bigger problem While advocates estimate some 50 million people are living in modern slavery, mass rescues of enslaved workers are rare. In 2015, more than 2,000 fishermen were rescued from brutal conditions at sea, liberated after an Associated Press investigation exposed their plight. That same year hundreds of Indians were rescued from brick factories in India. And last year Brazilian prosecutors rescued 163 Chinese nationals working in 'slavery-like' conditions at an electric vehicle factory construction site in northeastern Brazil. 'What we are seeing at the Thai-Myanmar border now is the result of years of inaction on a trafficking crisis that has had a devastating impact on thousands of people, many of whom were simply seeking better economic prospect, but were lured to these compounds on false pretenses,' said Amnesty International Myanmar researcher Joe Freeman. Being forced to commit a crime under threat of violence should not be criminalized, said Freeman. 'However, in general we are aware of countries in the region repatriating their nationals from scam compounds only to then charge them with crimes.' Business as usual It's not clear how much of an effect these releases will have on the criminal groups that run the scam centers. February marked the third time the Thais have cut internet or electricity to towns across the river. Each time, the compounds have managed to work around the cuts. Large compounds have access to diesel-powered generators, as well as access to internet provider Starlink, experts working with law enforcement say. 'The resources is the one thing that they are not lacking, and they've been able to bring them to bear in the past,' said Benedikt Hoffman, acting representative for the United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime in the region. The armed groups that staged the crackdown have also been accused of helping to run scam compounds in Myawaddy. The head of the Kayin Border Guard Force, General Saw Chit Thu, has been sanctioned by the European Union and the United Kingdom for profiting from scam compounds and human trafficking, respectively. Compounds in the DKBA's control are less well-documented in the public record, but activists say they also control a fair number. 'There is clearly a lot of pressure on the Border Guard Force to take action and helping people to leave is one of the most visible ways to do so,' Hoffman said. 'That said, it likely also reflects an adjustment to the business model, reducing the number of people involved — and with less attention, continuing lower key operations.' It will take simultaneous pressure exerted in multiple areas to truly shut down the compounds, said Hoffman. In this crackdown, there have been no major prosecutions or compounds shut down. 'This doesn't affect anything,' said a 23-year-old Pakistani man who had hoped to be freed only to be trapped in an army camp. The bosses, he said, are 'rich as hell' and can buy anything they need to keep the lucrative operations going. Meanwhile, he said, conditions are worsening. 'My friends are in really bad condition, we can't survive here,' he said, requesting anonymity out of fear for retribution from his guards. He asks a question that's been haunting him day in and day out for weeks: 'Is anyone coming for us?'	https://www.voanews.com/a/forced-to-scam-others-worldwide-thousands-now-detained-on-myanmar-border/8004859.html	2025-03-09T20:29:13-07:00	
Who is Mark Carney, the next prime minister of Canada?	TORONTO — Former central banker Mark Carney will become Canada's next prime minister after a Liberal Party leadership vote in a landslide. Carney is 59. He was born in Fort Smith, Northwest Territories, on March 16, 1965, and raised in Edmonton, Alberta. Credentials Carney ran the Bank of Canada from 2008 to 2013 and the Bank of England from 2013 to 2020. After helping Canada manage the worst impacts of the 2008 financial crisis, he was recruited to become the first non-Brit to run the Bank of England since it was founded in 1694. In 2020, he began serving as the United Nations' special envoy for climate action and finance. Carney is a former Goldman Sachs executive. He worked for 13 years in London, Tokyo, New York and Toronto, before being appointed deputy governor of the Bank of Canada in 2003. He has no experience in politics. Education Carney received a bachelor's degree in economics from Harvard University in 1988, and master's and doctoral degrees in economics from Oxford University. Like many Canadians, he played ice hockey, serving as a backup goalie for Harvard. Citizenship Carney has Canadian, U.K. and Irish citizenship. He has moved to eventually have solely Canadian citizenship, which is not required by law but seen as politically wise. Family His wife Diana is British-born and he has four daughters. Polls His chances of remaining prime minister for more than a few weeks seem to be improving. In a mid-January poll by Nanos, the Liberals trailed the opposition Conservatives and their leader Pierre Poilievre 47% to 20%. This week the latest poll has Liberals at 34% and the Conservatives at 37%.	https://www.voanews.com/a/who-is-mark-carney-the-next-prime-minister-of-canada-/8004842.html	2025-03-09T19:04:34-07:00	
Argentina flooding death toll rises to 16, two girls missing	Bahía Blanca, Argentina — Argentine authorities on Sunday raised the death toll from flash flooding in the port city of Bahia Blanca to 16 people, while divers searched for two young girls who were swept away in raging waters. The city, located in the south of Buenos Aires province and home to one of the country's largest ports, saw a year's worth of rain in a matter of hours on Friday, with numerous neighborhoods and roads quickly inundated. Mayor Federico Susbielles said in a press conference Sunday that the flooding had caused $400 million in infrastructure damage. Later, in a post on X, he said 'there are 16 confirmed deaths, but there are likely to be more' as search efforts continue. Meanwhile the disappearance of the two sisters, aged 1 and 5, has shaken the nation, with authorities on Sunday confirming details of the tragedy. Provincial security minister Javier Alonso told local media that the girls were on the roof of a van with their mother when a wave of water ripped them away. Divers were continuing to search the area, where more than a meter of water remained, he told the Radio Mitre outlet. The storm left much of the surrounding coastal area without power. At one point, city officials in Bahia Blanco suspended electricity due to the huge amount of water in the streets. The government has authorized emergency reconstruction aid of $9.2 million. Bahia Blanca has suffered past weather-related disasters, including a storm in December 2023 that claimed 13 lives. It caused houses to collapse and provoked widespread infrastructure damage.	https://www.voanews.com/a/argentina-flooding-death-toll-rises-to-16-two-girls-missing/8004834.html	2025-03-09T18:51:27-07:00	
North Korea warns of 'accidental' war risk from US-South Korea drills	Seoul, South Korea — North Korea on Monday condemned joint U.S.-South Korean military drills as a 'provocative act,' warning of the danger of sparking war with 'an accidental single shot,' days after Seoul's air force mistakenly bombed a village on its own territory. 'This is a dangerous provocative act of leading the acute situation on the Korean peninsula, which may spark off a physical conflict between the two sides by means of an accidental single shot,' said Pyongyang's foreign ministry, as quoted by state media. The joint U.S.-South Korea 'Freedom Shield 2025' exercise was set to kick off on Monday, and will involve 'live, virtual, and field-based training,' according to a U.S. statement. The exercise will run until March 21, the statement said. Military cooperation between Seoul and Washington regularly invites condemnation from Pyongyang, where the government sees such moves as preparation for an invasion, and often carries out missile tests in response. The latest exercise comes after two South Korean Air Force fighter jets accidentally dropped eight bombs on a village during a joint training exercise with U.S. forces on March 6. Fifteen people, including civilians and military personnel, were wounded in that incident, South Korea's National Fire Agency said. Relations between Pyongyang and Seoul have been at one of their lowest points in years, with the North launching a flurry of ballistic missiles last year in violation of UN sanctions. The two Koreas remain technically at war since their 1950-1953 conflict ended in an armistice, not a peace treaty. The United States stations tens of thousands of soldiers in the South, in part to protect Seoul against Pyongyang. The large-scale Freedom Shield exercises are one of the allies' biggest annual joint exercises. In its statement on Monday, North Korea's foreign ministry dubbed the exercises 'an aggressive and confrontational war rehearsal.' Last week, Pyongyang slammed the United States for 'political and military provocations' over the visit of a U.S. Navy aircraft carrier to the South Korean port of Busan.	https://www.voanews.com/a/8004809.html	2025-03-09T17:32:52-07:00	
Single-engine plane crashes near Pennsylvania airport	A single-engine airplane carrying five people crashed and burst into flames Saturday in the parking lot of a retirement community near a small airport in suburban Pennsylvania, and everyone on board survived, officials and witnesses said. The fiery crash happened around 3 p.m. just south of Lancaster Airport in Manheim Township, police Chief Duane Fisher told reporters at an evening briefing. All five victims were taken to hospitals in unknown condition. Nobody on the ground was hurt, the chief said. Brian Pipkin was driving nearby when he noticed the small plane climbing before it suddenly veered to the left. 'And then it went down nose first,' he told The Associated Press. 'There was an immediate fireball.' Pipkin called 911 and then drove to the crash site, where he recorded video of black smoke billowing from the plane’s mangled wreckage and multiple cars engulfed in flames in a parking lot at Brethren Village. He said the plane narrowly missed hitting a three-story building at the sprawling retirement community about 120 km west of Philadelphia. A fire truck from the airport arrived within minutes, and more first responders followed quickly. 'It was so smoky and it was so hot,' Pipkin said. 'They were really struggling to get the fire out.' A dozen parked cars were damaged, Fisher said. The Federal Aviation Administration confirmed there were five people aboard the Beechcraft Bonanza. Air traffic control audio captured the pilot reporting that the aircraft 'has an open door, we need to return for a landing.' An air traffic controller is heard clearing the plane to land, before saying, 'Pull up!' Moments later, someone can be heard saying the aircraft was 'down just behind the terminal in the parking lot street area.' The FAA said it will investigate. The crash comes about a month after seven people were killed when an air ambulance burst into flames after crashing onto a busy Philadelphia street.	https://www.voanews.com/a/single-engine-plane-crashes-near-pennsylvania-airport/8004795.html	2025-03-09T17:10:39-07:00	
Panama releases dozens of detained deportees from US into limbo	Panama City — After weeks of lawsuits and human rights criticism, Panama on Saturday released dozens of migrants who were held for weeks in a remote camp after being deported from the United States, telling them they have 30 days to leave the Central American nation. It thrust many like Hayatullah Omagh, a 29-year-old who fled Afghanistan in 2022 after the Taliban took control, into a legal limbo, scrambling to find a path forward. 'We are refugees. We do not have money. We cannot pay for a hotel in Panama City, we do not have relatives,' Omagh told the Associated Press in an interview. 'I can’t go back to Afghanistan under any circumstances ... It is under the control of the Taliban, and they want to kill me. How can I go back?' Authorities have said deportees will have the option of extending their stay by 60 days if they need it, but after that many like Omagh don’t know what they will do. Omagh climbed off a bus in Panama City alongside 65 migrants from China, Russia, Pakistan, Afghanistan, Iran, Nepal and other nations after spending weeks detained in poor conditions by the Panamanian government, which has said it wants to work with the Trump administration 'to send a signal of deterrence' to people hoping to migrate. Human rights groups and lawyers advocating for the migrants were waiting at the bus terminal, and scrambled to find the released migrants shelter and other resources. Dozens of other people remained in the camp. Among those getting off buses were migrants fleeing violence and repression in Pakistan and Iran, and 27-year-old Nikita Gaponov, who fled Russia due to repression for being part of the LGBTQ+ community and who said he was detained at the U.S. border but not allowed to make an asylum claim. 'Once I get off the bus, I'll be sleeping on the ground tonight,' Gaponov said. Others turned their eyes north once again, saying that even though they had already been deported, they had no other option than to continue after crossing the world to reach the U.S. The deportees, largely from Asian countries, were part of a deal stuck between the Trump administration and Panama and Costa Rica as the U.S. government attempts to speed up deportations. The administration sent hundreds of people, many families with children, to the two Central American countries as a stopover while authorities organize a way to send them back to their countries of origin. Critics described it as a way for the U.S. to export its deportation process. The agreement fueled human rights concerns when hundreds of deportees detained in a hotel in Panama City held up notes to their windows pleading for help and saying they were scared to return to their own countries. Under international refugee law, people have the right to apply for asylum when they are fleeing conflict or persecution. Those that refused to return home were later sent to a remote camp near Panama's border with Colombia, where they spent weeks in poor conditions, were stripped of their phones, unable to access legal council and were not told where they were going next. Lawyers and human rights defenders warned that Panama and Costa Rica were turning into 'black holes' for deportees, and said their release was a way for Panamanian authorities to wash their hands of the deportees amid mounting human rights criticism. Upon being released Saturday night, human rights lawyers identified at least three people who required medical attention. One has been vomiting for over a week, another deportee had diabetes and hadn't had access to insulin in the camp and another person had HIV and also didn't have access to medicine in detention. Those who were released, like Omagh, said they could not return home. As an atheist and member of an ethnic minority group in Afghanistan known as the Hazara, he said returning home under the rule of the Taliban — which swept back into power after the Biden administration pulled out of the country — would mean he would be killed. He only went to the U.S. after trying for years to live in Pakistan, Iran and other countries but being denied visas. Omagh was deported after presenting himself to American authorities and asking to seek asylum in the U.S., which he was denied. 'My hope was freedom. Just freedom,' he said. 'They didn't give me the chance. I asked many times to speak to an asylum officer and they told me ‘No, no, no, no, no.’' Still, he said that leaving the camp was a relief. Omagh and other migrants who spoke to the AP detailed scarce food, sweltering heat with little relief and aggressive Panamanian authorities. In one case, Omagh and others said, a Chinese man went on a weeklong hunger strike. In another, a small riot broke out because guards refused to give a migrant their phone. The riot, they said, was suppressed by armed guards. Panamanian authorities denied accusations about camp conditions, but blocked journalists from accessing the camp and canceled a planned press visit last week. While international aid organizations said they would organize travel to a third country for people who didn’t want to return home, Panamanian authorities said the people released had already refused help. Omagh said he was told in the camp he could be sent to a third country if it gives people from Afghanistan visas. He said that would be incredibly difficult because few nations open their doors to people with an Afghan passport. He said he asked authorities in the camp multiple times if he could seek asylum in Panama, and said he was told that 'we do not accept asylum.' 'None of them wants to stay in Panama. They want to go to the U.S.,' said Carlos Ruiz-Hernandez, Panama’s deputy foreign minister, in an interview with the AP last month. That was the case for some, like one Chinese woman who spoke to the AP on condition of anonymity, fearing repercussions from Panamanian authorities. Upon getting off the bus, the first thing she wanted to do was find a Coca-Cola. Then, she'd find a way back to the U.S. 'I still want to continue to go to the United States and fulfill my American dream,' she said.	https://www.voanews.com/a/panama-releases-dozens-of-detained-deportees-from-us-into-limbo/8004560.html	2025-03-09T16:46:54-07:00	
France readying more than $200 million in military aid for Ukraine, minister says	Paris — France is preparing a new military aid package for Ukraine worth more than $211 million from the interest earned on frozen Russian assets, its defense minister said in an interview published Sunday. Sebastien Lecornu, a close ally of President Emmanuel Macron, in the interview with the Tribune Dimanche newspaper, described the suspension of U.S. weapons deliveries to Ukraine as a 'heavy blow' to Kyiv's fight against the Russian invasion. 'This year we will mobilize, thanks to the interests of frozen Russian assets, a new package of 195 million euros ($211,253,250)' for Ukraine, he said. This will enable the delivery of 155-millimeter shells as well as AASM air to surface weapons that arm the French Mirage 2000 fighter jets that Paris has delivered to Ukraine for the war. Lecornu did not make any comment on whether France would consider using the frozen Russian assets themselves to help Kyiv, a potentially far more significant move supported by its ally the U.K. but over which Paris as so far been wary. But he warned that away from the battlefield, the 'Russians are reinventing war, that is their great strength' by targeting 'our democracy and our economy.' France's next 2027 presidential elections 'could be the subject of massive manipulations as was the case in Romania' where the first round was topped by a far-right outsider, only for the results to be annulled by the Constitutional Court, he said. He sought to play down any rupture in transatlantic relations after Donald Trump won the U.S. presidency and changed Washington's policy on Ukraine, saying: 'For my part, I still consider them as allies, despite their great unpredictability.' Turning to the 'heavy blow' of the U.S. suspension of weapons deliveries to Ukraine, he said: 'They (Ukraine) can hold out for a while, but this suspension must not last.' Lecornu said that French intelligence had no indication that Russia was planning to attack a NATO member in the next five years but did say there is a 'temptation to destabilize Moldova' through its breakaway region of Transnistria. With Macron and others urging EU states to ramp up defense spending as the U.S. wavers, Lecornu pointed to ammunition and electronic warfare as the most urgent issues for France's military in the years to come. 'Second priority, is the drone-ization and robot-ization of armies,' he added, also noting the roles of artificial intelligence and space.	https://www.voanews.com/a/france-readying-more-than-200-million-in-military-aid-for-ukraine-minister-says/8004558.html	2025-03-09T16:27:07-07:00	
US Homeland Security chief replaces ICE leadership over lagging deportations	Washington — Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem appointed new leadership at U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement on Sunday as the agency struggles to meet President Donald Trump's stated goal of massive deportation operations aimed at undocumented immigrants in the U.S. illegally. Trump's administration deported 37,660 people during his first month in office, U.S. Department of Homeland Security data first reported by Reuters last month show, far less than the monthly average of 57,000 removals and returns in the last full year of Joe Biden's administration. Trump made the promise of deporting millions of people from the United States a centerpiece of his campaign. The acting director of U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement, Caleb Vitello, was reassigned last month for failing to meet expectations, Reuters previously reported. Noem said she was promoting Todd Lyons, ICE's acting executive associate director, to be the agency's acting director, and Madison Sheahan, secretary of the Louisiana Department of Wildlife and Fisheries, to serve as deputy director. 'I am appointing new ICE leadership to deliver results that President Trump and the American people rightfully demand,' Noem said in a statement, adding that Lyons and Sheahan would 'lead the men and women of ICE to achieve the American people's mandate to target, arrest and deport illegal aliens.'	https://www.voanews.com/a/us-homeland-security-chief-replaces-ice-leadership-over-lagging-deportations/8004545.html	2025-03-09T15:54:11-07:00	
Palestinian activist who aided Columbia University protests arrested by US immigration agents	New York — Federal immigration authorities arrested a Palestinian graduate student who played a prominent role in last spring's anti-Israel protests at Columbia University, according to his attorney. Mahmoud Khalil was inside his university-owned residence Saturday night near Columbia’s Manhattan campus when several Immigration and Customs Enforcement agents entered the building and took him into custody, his attorney, Amy Greer, told The Associated Press. Greer said she spoke by phone with one of the ICE agents during the arrest, who said they were acting on State Department orders to revoke Khalil’s student visa. Informed by the attorney that Khalil was in the United States as a permanent resident with a green card, the agent said they were revoking that too, according to the lawyer. The arrest appeared to be among the first known actions under President Donald Trump’s pledge to deport international students who joined the protests of Israel's war in Gaza that swept college campuses last spring. His administration has claimed participants forfeited their rights to remain in the country by supporting Hamas, a terror organization. Khalil served as a negotiator for students as they bargained with university officials over an end to the tent encampment erected on campus, a role that made him one of the few student activists willing to share his name and identity. The authorities declined to tell Khalil’s wife, who is eight months pregnant, whether he was accused of committing a crime, Greer said. Khalil has since been transferred to an immigration detention facility in Elizabeth, New Jersey. 'We have not been able to get any more details about why he is being detained,' Greer told the AP. 'This is a clear escalation. The administration is following through on its threats.' A Columbia spokesperson said law enforcement agents must produce a warrant before entering university property but declined to say if the school had received one ahead of Khalil’s arrest. The spokesperson also declined to comment on Khalil's detention. Messages seeking comment were left with the State Department, the Department of Homeland Security and ICE. The Department of Homeland Security can initiate deportation proceedings against green card holders for a broad range of alleged criminal activity, including supporting a terror group. It would ultimately be up to an immigration judge to revoke someone's permanent resident status, according to Camille Mackler, founder of Immigrant ARC, a coalition of legal service providers in New York. 'This has the appearance of a retaliatory action against someone who expressed an opinion the Trump administration didn’t like,' Mackler said. Khalil was among those investigated by a new Columbia University office that has brought disciplinary charges against dozens of students who have expressed criticism of Israel, according to records shared with the AP. Those investigations come as the Trump administration has ramped up scrutiny on Columbia because of what the government describes as the Ivy League school’s failure to squelch antisemitism on campus. On Friday, federal agencies announced they would be cutting $400 million in grants and contracts from the university. The allegation against Khalil focused on his involvement in the Columbia University Apartheid Divest group, claiming he had helped organize an 'unauthorized marching event' that glorified Hamas’ Oct. 7, 2023, terrorist attack and played a 'substantial role' in the circulation of social media posts criticizing Zionism. 'I have around 13 allegations against me, most of them are social media posts that I had nothing to do with,' Khalil told the AP last week. 'They just want to show Congress and rightwing politicians that they’re doing something, regardless of the stakes for students,' he added. 'It’s mainly an office to chill pro-Palestine speech.'	https://www.voanews.com/a/palestinian-activist-who-aided-columbia-university-protests-arrested-by-us-immigration-agents/8004542.html	2025-03-09T15:43:15-07:00	
Canada's Liberal Party voting on PM Trudeau's successor	Ottawa, Canada — Canada's Liberal Party will announce Prime Minister Justin Trudeau's successor Sunday as both party chief and head of the country's government during a trade war with the United States that could cripple the Canadian economy. The next prime minister will have to negotiate with U.S. President Donald Trump as he threatens additional tariffs on Canada and may soon face the opposition Conservatives in a general election. Trudeau announced in January that he would step down after more than nine years in power as his approval rating plummeted, forcing the ruling Liberal Party to run a quick contest to replace him. 'Is it ideal in a circumstance of bilateral crisis for us? I suppose not,' said Drew Fagan, a professor at the University of Toronto's Munk School of Global Affairs and Public Policy. 'But on the other hand, the process is playing out domestically as it should.' Former central banker Mark Carney is the front-runner, with the most endorsements from party members and the most money raised among the four Liberal candidates. Ahead of an event to announce the winner, Liberal Party members were already distributing Carney placards. Former Deputy Prime Minister Chrystia Freeland has touted her experience negotiating with Trump during his first term but has struggled to differentiate herself from Trudeau after being one of his most loyal supporters for years. In a surprise move, she left his government in December after Trudeau tried to replace her, and she criticized his government's spending policies. Around 400,000 Liberal Party members were eligible to vote, and the results will be calculated in a ranked ballot of voters in each of the 343 parliamentary constituencies, also known as ridings. As of 12 p.m. local time (1600 GMT), with three hours of voting left, 150,000 members had voted, the party said. The party is due to announce the first round of results at about 6:30 p.m. (2230 GMT). A victory for Carney, 59, would be the first time an outsider with no real political background has become Canadian prime minister. Carney has said his experience as the first person to serve as the governor of two central banks — Canada and England — meant he was the best candidate to deal with Trump. During the campaign, Carney said he supported dollar-for-dollar retaliatory tariffs against the United States and a coordinated strategy to boost investment. He has repeatedly complained that Canada's growth under Trudeau was not good enough. The prospect of a fresh start for the Liberal Party under Carney, combined with Trump's tariffs and his repeated taunts to annex Canada as the 51st U.S. state, led to a remarkable revival of Liberal fortunes. 'Rally-around-the-flag moment' At the start of 2025, the party trailed by 20 or more points but is now statistically tied with the official opposition Conservatives in several polls. At a protest outside Canada's Parliament building in Ottawa on Sunday, dozens of Canadians held up signs protesting Trump with no reference to domestic politics. 'There is a rallying-around-the-flag moment that we would never have predicted a year ago,' said University of British Columbia politics professor Richard Johnston. 'I think it's probably true as we speak that the Liberals have been saved from oblivion.' Liberals sought to compare Conservative leader Pierre Poilievre to Trump in a recent advertisement. Poilievre in turn ramped up attacks on Carney on Sunday. The Liberals 'are going to pull a sneaky trick tonight,' Poilievre said at a campaign rally. 'They're going to try to get elected for a fourth term by replacing Justin Trudeau with his economic adviser, Mark Carney. ... Donald Trump will have a big smile on his face.' Carney has played down any role in advising Trudeau, noting his many global obligations left him with little time. Carney resigned all commercial posts after he launched his leadership bid in January. Regardless of who wins, the next prime minister has important decisions to make right away. An election must be called no later than October 20. The Globe and Mail newspaper reported Saturday that Carney would call an election before Parliament is due to reconvene at the end of the month, meaning voting could take place either April 28 or May 5. Carney's campaign did not respond to a request for comment. Polls indicate that neither the Liberals nor the Conservatives would be able to form a majority government. Carney could legally serve as prime minister without a seat in the House of Commons but tradition dictates he should seek to win one as soon as possible. In 1984, John Turner was not a legislator when he became prime minister after winning a Liberal leadership race.	https://www.voanews.com/a/canada-s-liberal-party-voting-on-pm-trudeau-successor/8004533.html	2025-03-09T15:14:31-07:00	
Syria's worst violence in months reopens wounds of civil war	An ambush on a Syrian security patrol by gunmen loyal to ousted leader Bashar al-Assad escalated into clashes that a war monitor estimates have killed more than 1,000 people over four days. The attack Thursday near the port city of Latakia reopened the wounds of the country’s 13-year civil war and sparked the worst violence Syria has seen since December, when insurgents led by the Islamist group Hayat Tahrir al-Sham (HTS) overthrew Assad. The counteroffensive against the Assad loyalists in the largely Alawite coastal region brought havoc to several cities and towns. Rights groups reported dozens of revenge killings resulting from Sunni militants targeting the minority Islamic sect, regardless of whether they were involved in the insurgency. Here’s a look at the latest violence in the war-wracked country: What started the violence? Tensions have been on the rise since Assad's downfall following sectarian attacks against Alawites, who ruled Syria for over 50 years under the Assad dynasty. The assaults continued despite promises from Syria’s interim president that the country's new leaders will carve out a political future for Syria that includes and represents all its communities. In their ambush, the pro-Assad Alawite gunmen overwhelmed government security forces and later took control of Qardaha, Assad's hometown, as Damascus scrambled to bring in reinforcements. Defense Ministry spokesperson Col. Hassan Abdel-Ghani said Sunday that security forces have restored control of the region and will continue pursuing leaders of the galvanized insurgency. But despite authorities calling for an end to the sectarian incitement, the clashes turned deadly, and many civilians were killed. Who are the dead? Most of the dead are apparently members of the Alawite community, who live largely in the country's coastal province, including in the cities of Latakia and Tartous. Rights groups estimate that hundreds of civilians were killed. The Alawite sect is an offshoot of Shia Islam, and it once formed the core constituency of Assad's government in the Sunni-majority country. Opponents of Assad saw Syria under the family's rule as granting privileges to the Alawite community. As the civil war intensified, militant groups emerged across the country and treated Alawites as affiliates of Assad and his key military allies, Russia and Iran. Syria's new interim government is under Sunni Islamist rule. Interim President Ahmad Al-Sharaa, a former HTS leader, has promised that the country will transition to a system that includes Syria's mosaic of religious and ethnic groups under fair elections, but skeptics question whether that will happen. Little is currently known about the Alawite insurgency, which is composed of remnants of Assad's web of military and intelligence branches, and who their foreign backers might be. Why were the Alawites targeted? The Syrian Observatory for Human Rights said 745 civilians were killed, mostly in shootings. In addition, 125 members of government security forces and 148 militants with armed groups affiliated with Assad were killed. Electricity and drinking water were cut off in large areas around Latakia, the group added. Meanwhile, the Syria Campaign and the Syrian Network for Human Rights (SNHR), which both advocated against Assad after the civil war began in 2011, said Saturday that both security forces and pro-Assad gunmen were 'carrying out mass executions and systematic killings.' The SNHR estimated that 100 members of the government's security forces were killed Thursday, while 125 of an estimated 140 civilians were slain over the weekend in 'suspected revenge killings.' The Associated Press could not verify those numbers, and conflicting death figures during attacks in Syria over the years have not been uncommon. Two residents in the coastal region said that many homes from Alawite families were looted and set on fire. They spoke from their hideouts on the condition of anonymity, fearing for their lives. Damascus blamed 'individual actions' for the widespread violence against civilians and said government security forces were responding to the gunmen loyal to the former government. Can Damascus restore calm after the clashes? Damascus has struggled to reconcile with skeptics of its Islamist government, as well as with Kurdish-led authorities in the northeast and the Druze minority in the south. Al-Sharaa has lobbied to convince the United States and Europe to lift sanctions to pave the way for economic recovery to pull millions of Syrians out of poverty and make the country viable again. Washington and Europe are concerned that lifting sanctions before Syria transitions into an inclusive political system could pave the way for another chapter of autocratic rule. Al-Sharaa appealed to Syrians and the international community in an address over the weekend, calling for accountability for anyone who harms civilians and mistreats prisoners. Such human rights violations were rampant under Assad. Al-Sharaa also formed a committee composed mostly of judges to investigate the violence. In a statement issued Sunday, U.S. Secretary of State Marco Rubio urged Syrian authorities to 'hold the perpetrators of these massacres' accountable. Rubio said the U.S. 'stands with Syria’s religious and ethnic minorities, including its Christian, Druze, Alawite, and Kurdish communities.'	https://www.voanews.com/a/syria-s-worst-violence-in-months-reopens-wounds-of-civil-war/8004528.html	2025-03-09T14:50:41-07:00	
US Air Force intercepts aircraft flying in restricted zone near Mar-a-Lago	West Palm Beach, Florida — Air Force fighter jets intercepted a civilian aircraft flying in the temporarily restricted airspace near Donald Trump's Florida home Sunday, bringing the number of violations to more than 20 since the president took office on Jan. 20. North American Aerospace Defense Command said in a statement that Sunday's incident, which took place as Trump finished a round of golf at his West Palm Beach golf course, saw F-16s deploy flares to get the attention of the civilian pilot. Jets also conducted an intercept Saturday morning shortly after Trump arrived at the course from his private Mar-a-Lago club and residence. The airspace intrusions in the heavily congested south Florida airspace have prompted fighter jet intercepts but did not alter Trump's schedule or impact his security, officials said. NORAD says the flares may have been visible from the ground but that they burn out quickly and don’t pose danger. Federal officials maintain a permanent flight restriction over Trump's club that expands to a radius of 30 nautical miles when the president is in residence. Violations, and intercepts, are relatively routine, but NORAD is raising alarm over the frequency of the intrusions since Trump's inauguration, saying it has responded to more than 20 incidents and blames civilian pilots for not following regulations requiring them to check for airspace restrictions before taking off. 'Adherence to TFR [Temporary Flight Restrictions] procedures is essential to ensure flight safety, national security, and the security of the President,' General Gregory Guillot, the commander of NORAD and U.S. Northern Command said in a statement. 'The procedures are not optional, and the excessive number of recent TFR violations indicates many civil aviators are not reading Notice to Airmen, or NOTAMS, before each flight as required by the FAA, and has resulted in multiple responses by NORAD fighter aircraft to guide offending aircraft out of the TFR.'	https://www.voanews.com/a/us-air-force-intercepts-aircraft-flying-in-restricted-zone-near-mar-a-lago/8004523.html	2025-03-09T14:37:29-07:00	
After Poland spat, Musk vows Ukraine can keep Starlink	Billionaire industrialist and senior White House adviser Elon Musk vowed Sunday to maintain Ukraine's access to his Starlink satellite network, after a fierce online clash with Poland's outspoken foreign minister. The United States has suspended military aid and intelligence sharing with Ukraine after a disastrous Feb. 28 meeting between President Donald Trump and his Ukrainian counterpart Volodymyr Zelenskyy in the White House. This has led to fears that Musk, a close Trump ally, might cut off Ukrainian access to his private Starlink communications system, which is used extensively by Kyiv's front-line troops for battlefield communication. On Sunday, during exchanges on his own X social media platform, Musk promised that this would not be the case, after an online clash with the Polish foreign minister, Radoslaw Sikorski, that drew in U.S. Secretary of State Marco Rubio. 'To be extremely clear, no matter how much I disagree with the Ukraine policy, Starlink will never turn off its terminals,' Musk wrote. 'I am simply stating that, without Starlink, the Ukrainian lines would collapse, as the Russians can jam all other communications! We would never do such a thing or use it as a bargaining chip.' Trump's administration is pressuring Zelenskyy to sign over much of Ukraine's mineral wealth to the United States and to agree to a ceasefire with Russia without clear security guarantees as a prelude to a peace deal. Musk supports this position and warned Sunday that Ukraine's 'entire front line would collapse' if he turned off Starlink for Kyiv's forces, which have been battling a full-scale Russian invasion since February 2022. This prompted Sikorski, in a post on X, to warn: 'Starlinks for Ukraine are paid for by the Polish Digitization Ministry at the cost of about $50 million per year. 'The ethics of threatening the victim of aggression apart, if SpaceX proves to be an unreliable provider we will be forced to look for other suppliers.' Musk responded with scorn, telling the Polish minister: 'Be quiet, small man. You pay a tiny fraction of the cost. And there is no substitute for Starlink.' Washington's top diplomat, U.S. Secretary of State Rubio, was also drawn in to the exchange, accusing Sikorski of 'just making things up.' 'No one has made any threats about cutting Ukraine off from Starlink. And say, 'thank you' because without Starlink Ukraine would have lost this war long ago and Russians would be on the border with Poland right now,' he said.	https://www.voanews.com/a/after-poland-spat-musk-vows-ukraine-can-keep-starlink/8004518.html	2025-03-09T14:18:26-07:00

Israel says it is cutting off its electricity supply to Gaza	JERUSALEM — Israel announced Sunday it is cutting off its electricity supply to Gaza. The full effects were not immediately clear, but the arid territory's desalination plants receive power for producing drinking water. Hamas, a U.S.-designated terror group, called it part of Israel's 'starvation policy.' Israel last week cut off supplies of goods to the territory of over 2 million Palestinians, an echo of the siege it imposed in the earliest days of its war with Hamas. It's pressing Hamas to accept an extension of the first phase of their ceasefire. That phase ended last weekend. Israel wants Hamas to release half of the remaining hostages in return for a promise to negotiate a lasting truce. Hamas instead wants to start negotiations on the ceasefire's more difficult second phase, which would see the release of remaining hostages from Gaza, the withdrawal of Israeli forces and a lasting peace. Hamas is believed to have 24 living hostages and the bodies of 35 others. Hamas — which has warned that cutting off supplies would affect the hostages — said Sunday it wrapped up the latest round of ceasefire talks with Egyptian mediators without changes to its position, calling for an immediate start of the ceasefire's second phase. Israel has said it would send a delegation to Qatar on Monday 'in an effort to advance the negotiations.' Israel had warned when it stopped all supplies that water and electricity could be next. The letter from Israel's energy minister to the Israel Electric Corporation tells it to stop selling power to Gaza. The territory and its infrastructure have been largely devastated, and most facilities, including hospitals, now use generators. The electricity cut could affect water pumps and sanitation. A spokesperson for the Israel Electric Corporation said as far as they know, the cutoff affected only a wastewater treatment plant. Hamas spokesman Hazem Qassam called it part of Israel's 'starvation policy, in clear disregard for all international laws and norms.' He said Israel has 'practically' cut off electricity since the war began. Israel has faced sharp criticism over cutting off supplies. 'Any denial of the entry of the necessities of life for civilians may amount to collective punishment,' the United Nations human rights office said Friday. The International Criminal Court said there was reason to believe Israel had used 'starvation as a method of warfare' when it issued an arrest warrant for Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu last year. The allegation is central to South Africa's case at the International Court of Justice accusing Israel of genocide. Israel has denied the accusations, saying it has allowed in enough aid and blaming shortages on what it called the U.N.'s inability to distribute it. It also accused Hamas of siphoning off aid. The leader of the Iran-backed Houthi rebels in Yemen, Abdul Malik al-Houthi, warned Friday that attacks against Israel-linked vessels off Yemen would resume within four days if aid doesn't resume to Gaza. The Houthis described their earlier attacks as solidarity with Palestinians there. The ceasefire has paused the deadliest and most destructive fighting ever between Israel and Hamas, sparked by the Hamas-led attack on southern Israel on Oct. 7, 2023. The first phase allowed the return of 25 living hostages and the remains of eight others in exchange for the release of nearly 2,000 Palestinian prisoners. Israeli forces have withdrawn to buffer zones inside Gaza, hundreds of thousands of displaced Palestinians have returned to northern Gaza for the first time since early in the war and hundreds of trucks of aid entered per day until Israel suspended supplies. U.S. envoy describes talks with Hamas The White House on Wednesday made the surprise confirmation of direct U.S. talks with Hamas. On Sunday, envoy Adam Boehler told Israeli broadcaster Kan that Hamas has suggested a truce of five to 10 years while it would disarm. The terror group has previously called disarming unacceptable. Boehler told CNN that 'I think you could see something like a long-term truce, where we forgive prisoners, where Hamas lays down their arms, where they agree they're not part of the political party going forward. I think that's a reality. It's real close.' When asked if he would speak with Hamas again, Boehler replied, 'You never know.' He added, 'I think something could come together within weeks,' and expressed hope for a deal that would see all hostages released, not only American ones. Boehler has said four of the five American hostages in Gaza are dead, with Edan Alexander alive. Hamas on Sunday didn't mention the talks, but reiterated its support for a proposal for the establishment of an independent committee of technocrats to run Gaza until Palestinians hold presidential and legislative elections. Hamas' attack in October 2023 killed around 1,200 people, mostly civilians, inside Israel and took 251 people hostage. Most have been released in ceasefire agreements or other arrangements. Israel's military offensive has killed more than 48,000 Palestinians in Gaza, mostly women and children, according to Gaza's Health Ministry. With the cutoff of supplies to Gaza, Palestinians are reporting sharp price increases for dwindling items during the Muslim holy month of Ramadan. 'Since the ceasefire began, the situation has improved a little. But before that, the situation was very bad,' said Fares al-Qeisi in the southern city of Khan Younis. 'I swear to God, one could not satisfy their hunger.'	https://www.voanews.com/a/israel-says-it-is-cutting-off-its-electricity-supply-to-gaza/8004498.html	2025-03-09T13:18:29-07:00

Selma marks 60th anniversary of 'Bloody Sunday' protest attack	SELMA, Ala. — Charles Mauldin was near the front of a line of voting rights marchers walking in pairs across the Edmund Pettus Bridge in Selma, Alabama on March 7, 1965. The marchers were protesting white officials’ refusal to allow Black Alabamians to register to vote, as well as the killing days earlier of Jimmie Lee Jackson, a minister and voting rights organizer who was shot by a state trooper in nearby Marion. At the apex of the span over the Alabama River, they saw what awaited them: a line of state troopers, deputies and men on horseback. After they approached, law enforcement gave a warning to disperse and then unleashed violence. 'Within about a minute or a half, they took their billy clubs, holding it on both ends, began to push us back, to back us in, and then they began to beat men, women and children, and tear gas men, women and children, and cattle prod men, women and children viciously,' said Mauldin, who was 17 at the time. Selma on Sunday marked the 60th anniversary of the clash that became known as Bloody Sunday. The attack shocked the nation and galvanized support for the U.S. Voting Rights Act of 1965. The annual commemoration paid homage to those who fought to secure voting rights for Black Americans and brought calls to recommit to the fight for equality. For foot soldiers of the movement, the celebration comes amid concerns about new voting restrictions and the Trump administration’s effort to remake federal agencies they said helped make America a democracy for all. 'This country was not a democracy for Black folks until that happened,' Mauldin said of voting rights. 'And we’re still constantly fighting to make that a more concrete reality for ourselves.' Speaking at the pulpit of the city’s historic Tabernacle Baptist Church, the site of the first mass meeting of the voting rights movement, House Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries said what happened in Selma changed the nation. But he said the 60th anniversary comes at a time when there is 'trouble all around' and some 'want to whitewash our history.' But he said like the marchers of Bloody Sunday, they must keep going. 'At this moment, faced with trouble on every side, we’ve got to press on,' Jeffries said to the crowd that included the Rev. Jesse Jackson, multiple members of Congress and others gathered for the commemoration. U.S. Rep. Terri Sewell of Alabama said they are gathering in Selma for the 60th anniversary 'at a time when the vote is in peril.' Sewell noted the number of voting restrictions introduced since the U.S. Supreme Court effectively abolished a key part of the Voting Rights Act that required jurisdictions with a history of racial discrimination to pre-clear new voting laws with the Justice Department. Sewell this week reintroduced legislation to restore the requirement. The proposal has repeatedly stalled in Congress. The legislation is named for John Lewis, the late Georgia congressman who was at the lead of the Bloody Sunday march. The annual celebration will conclude with a ceremony and march across the Edmund Pettus Bridge. At the time, the Bloody Sunday marchers walked in pairs across the Selma bridge. Mauldin was in the third pair of the line led by Lewis and Hosea Williams. 'We had steeled our nerves to a point where we were so determined that we were willing to confront. It was past being courageous. We were determined, and we were indignant,' Mauldin recalled in an interview with The Associated Press. Mauldin, who took a blow to the head, said he believes law enforcement officers were trying to incite a riot as they attacked marchers. Kirk Carrington was just 13 on Bloody Sunday. As the violence erupted, a white man on a horse wielding a stick chased him all the way back to the public housing projects where his family lived. Carrington said he started marching after witnessing his father get belittled by his white employers when his father returned from service in World War II. Standing in Tabernacle Baptist Church where he was trained in non-violent protest tactics 60 years earlier, he was brought to tears thinking about what the people of his city achieved. 'When we started marching, we did not know the impact we would have in America. We knew after we got older and got grown that the impact it not only had in Selma, but the impact it had in the entire world,' Carrington said. Dr. Verdell Lett Dawson, who grew up in Selma, remembers a time when she was expected to lower her gaze if she passed a white person on the street to avoid making eye contact. Dawson and Mauldin said they are concerned about the potential dismantling of the Department of Education and other changes to federal agencies. Trump has pushed to end diversity, equity and inclusion programs within the federal government. Support from the federal government 'is how Black Americans have been able to get justice, to get some semblance of equality, because left to states’ rights, it is going to be the white majority that’s going to rule,' Dawson said. 'That that’s a tragedy of 60 years later: what we are looking at now is a return to the 1950s,' Dawson said.	https://www.voanews.com/a/selma-marks-60th-anniversary-of-bloody-sunday-protest-attack/8004487.html	2025-03-09T12:48:03-07:00	
Romanian far-right candidate barred from May presidential vote	BUCHAREST — Romania's central election authority on Sunday barred far-right pro-Russian candidate Calin Georgescu from running in May's presidential election re-run. The rejection of his candidacy, which was condemned by far-right party leaders as undemocratic, can be challenged at the constitutional court. Dozens of supporters of the populist Georgescu gathered outside the election bureau shouting 'Freedom' and briefly tried to force their way through the security cordon. Georgescu submitted his candidacy for the May ballot re-run on Friday amid doubts that he would be allowed to run. Romania's highest court annulled the ballot two days before the second round of voting in December, citing allegations of Russian interference in Georgescu's favor, which Moscow has denied. Members of U.S. President Donald Trump's administration called Romania's canceled election an example of European governments suppressing freedom of speech and political opponents. Tech billionaire and Trump adviser Elon Musk called the election authority's decision 'crazy' on his social media platform X. Georgescu is under criminal investigation on six counts, including membership in a fascist organization and communicating false information about campaign financing. He has denied all wrongdoing.	https://www.voanews.com/a/romanian-far-right-candidate-barred-from-may-presidential-vote/8004473.html	2025-03-09T12:20:44-07:00	
Clashes continue in eastern DRC days after attack on civilians left many dead	Fighting between M23 rebels and pro-Congo militias was underway Sunday in Nyabiondo, about 100 km north of Goma in eastern Congo, residents said, days after a nearby attack left a heavy civilian death toll, according to the United Nations and an NGO. The M23 rebel group has seized swathes of mineral-rich eastern Congo since the start of the year. 'M23 has taken Nyabiondo since 11 a.m. [local time] (0900 GMT), following clashes,' Kipanda Biiri, an official from the local administrative authority who was fleeing the area, told Reuters. 'The enemy opened a large-scale assault on Nyabiondo this morning,' said Telesphore Mitondeke, a civil society rapporteur in Masisi, the area where Nyabiondo is located, referring to the M23 rebels. 'For the moment there is shooting from every direction in the center of Nyabiondo, where the clashes are taking place.' The fighting follows clashes last week between M23 and a pro-Congolese government militia in the village of Tambi, about 18 km northeast of the town of Masisi, which culminated in an attack overnight on March 5 leaving many civilian casualties, according to the head of a local NGO. An internal United Nations memo seen by Reuters said Sunday that between 13 and 40 civilians were believed to have been killed in that attack. Separately, a spokesperson for the rebel alliance that includes M23 said Sunday on X that one of the pro-government militias that operates in eastern Congo had switched sides and joined its alliance. The spokesperson for the group that militia had been a part of said in a statement that the rest of the group remained loyal to the Congolese government and its army. M23 rebels say that they intend to seize power in Congo's capital Kinshasa. They also accuse Congo's government of not living up to previous peace deals and fully integrating Congolese Tutsis into the army and administration. The group's spread into new mineral-rich territories this year also gives it scope to acquire more mining revenue, analysts say. The Democratic Republic of Congo government has repeatedly accused Rwanda of supporting the M23 rebel group, a claim that Rwanda denies. Kigali, in turn, alleges that Kinshasa collaborates with the Democratic Forces for the Liberation of Rwanda, or the FDLR, a Hutu armed group with ties to the perpetrators of the 1994 Rwandan genocide, an allegation the DRC rejects. The DRC has officially designated the M23 rebel group as a terrorist organization, while the United Nations and the United States classify it as an armed rebel group.	https://www.voanews.com/a/clashes-continue-in-eastern-drc-days-after-attack-on-civilians-left-many-dead/8004470.html	2025-03-09T12:12:41-07:00	
In tense relations with India, Pakistani TV dramas build bridges	KARACHI, PAKISTAN — Two Pakistani women sit together on a couch, rehearsing their lines while a director scrutinizes them. Waiting off camera for his scene is the male lead, an actor blessed with Bachelor hair and fine bone structure. Also out of sight: the Islamabad homeowners, who are holed up in a separate room and whose furniture and knickknacks will be seen by millions of viewers — many from the society that has been their country's neighbor and uneasy sparring partner for much of the past century. This is the set of the Pakistani drama Adhi Bewafai, or Half Infidelity — one of what some in other nations would call 'soap operas.' But these dramas, it turns out, are not just for Pakistanis. Realistic settings, natural dialogue and almost workaday plots about families and marriages make Pakistani dramas a hit with viewers at home and abroad — especially in the neighboring country that split with Pakistan in 1947 and is its nuclear archrival today: India. Television, it seems, is succeeding where diplomacy sometimes can't. A glimpse into life across the border Several thousand people work in Pakistan's drama industry; the country produces between 80 to 120 shows a year, each one a source of escapism and intrigue. They offer Indians a tantalizing glimpse into life across the border — and manage to break through decades of enmity between the two governments. Maheen Shafeeq, a research associate at the Institute of Strategic Studies in Islamabad, says there is effectively no relationship between the two governments. Each government is fixed on a single issue it cannot move past — for India, it's terrorism; for Pakistan, the disputed territory of Jammu and Kashmir. 'The governments are very much opposed to each other,' she says. 'They don't agree what they should talk about.' Although it's difficult for Indians to visit Pakistan, where these shows are filmed, they faithfully follow the plot twists and turns through platforms like YouTube, ZEE5, and MX Player. For those of a certain generation, however, it wasn't always so easy to keep up. Kaveri Sharma, a writer in the Indian city of Patna, recalls her mother-in-law and aunt jiggling antennas in the 1980s and 1990s in hopes of catching a signal from Pakistan's state broadcaster, PTV. It's how Sharma first realized that the country next door was a drama powerhouse. It inspired her to discover the shows for herself years later, even going on to watch them with her own daughter. 'They feel familiar, but they are also a break from our own lives,' Sharma says. 'I don't see any differences between the two countries. Everything is relatable. I see Karachi and think that it could be Lucknow or Patna. What happens on the shows could happen to me or my friends.' She had heard only negative things about Pakistan since childhood — that it was the enemy that would take everything from India. The TV dramas have added subtlety and detail to this image for her. She would love to visit, but is unlikely to get the opportunity. So she explores Pakistan through the locations, malls, offices, streets and restaurants depicted on the small screen. The names of popular Karachi neighborhoods roll off her tongue. Sharma, like Bibi Hafeez in the southern Indian city of Hyderabad and Punita Kumar in the central Indian city of Raipur, raves about the dramas' universality of themes, the strong characterization and the emotional range. 'Pakistani characters are not only heroes or villains. They have shades to them, and that is very human,' says Kumar, who chanced upon a Pakistani drama through a chunky videocassette when she was a teenager living in the northern Indian city of Aligarh. It was love at first watch. 'They captivated me. We got a cable connection that offered PTV. Then YouTube came and I realized I could search for whatever drama I wanted. I haven't taken a stop,' she said. 'We get exposure to Pakistani life in the scenes, but the struggles the characters have with their relatives are ones I would have with my own.' Pakistani TV veteran Khaled Anam is delighted by Indians' enthusiasm for the country's serials and the barriers they help erode. 'What Bollywood is to India, dramas are to Pakistan,' says Anam, who is based in Karachi and has worked as an actor since the 1980s. He has appeared in many dramas, including the ratings smash Humsafar (Life Partner). India's productions go big, while Pakistan's are more low key India dominates the movie market in South Asia and beyond, with big stars and bigger budgets. Pakistanis have been exposed to Bollywood films for decades, although the prevailing hostile political climate means they can't watch them in movie theaters. The bans are mutual, though. India, like Pakistan, restricts content from across the border in movie theaters and TV channels. And while India is no slouch when it comes to TV production, it doesn't offer viewers what Pakistan does, according to Anam: simplicity, depth of writing and a limited number of episodes. 'There are 15-minute flashbacks in Indian serials. (The characters) are decked out and dolled up. It's a fantasy world. The shows go on forever. Everything is 'DUN dun dun!'' says Anam, mimicking a dramatic musical riff and shaking his hands. The actors on the couch in Islamabad are rehearsing lines about a woman who is disrespectful and so, according to one of them, is an unsuitable marriage prospect. The delivery and grammar could be heard in virtually any South Asian household. 'Pakistanis are generally emotional people, and that is in their dramas also,' says Islamabad-based director Saife Hassan. 'It would take me less than two minutes to explain the plot of the super-duper hit Kabhi Main, Kabhi Tum (Sometimes Me, Sometimes You). It's about the emotions between a husband and wife.' Hassan, who began his TV career in the 1990s, says Indians frequently comment on his social media pages and send him direct messages about his work. He even recalls Indian viewers praying for the recovery of a character who was in a coma. Hassan would love to see more homegrown dramas make it onto platforms like Netflix, as some Indian shows have with great success. But he wonders whether international audiences would understand and connect with Pakistani stories or lives: 'The way we think is different from the West. Our shows are not driven by events. They are driven by emotions.' There is also a lack of raunch in Pakistani dramas, which are family-friendly with little to no vulgarity, violence, or even action. Indians, therefore, are a natural audience for Pakistani dramas, Hassan says. 'They are our people. They are like us. They eat like us,' he says. 'I love India, and I love Indians. They have grown out of this animosity.'	https://www.voanews.com/a/in-tense-relations-with-india-pakistani-tv-dramas-build-bridges-/8003424.html	2025-03-09T11:25:20-07:00	
Sci-fi film 'Mickey 17' tops box office, but profitability long way off	Parasite' filmmaker Bong Joon Ho’s original science fiction film 'Mickey 17' opened in first place on the North American box office charts. According to studio estimates Sunday, the Robert Pattinson-led film earned $19.1 million in its first weekend in theaters, which was enough to dethrone 'Captain America: Brave New World' after a three-week reign. Overseas, 'Mickey 17' has already made $34.2 million, bringing its worldwide total to $53.3 million. But profitability for the film is a long way off: It cost a reported $118 million to produce, which does not account for millions spent on marketing and promotion. A week following the Oscars, where 'Anora' filmmaker Sean Baker made an impassioned speech about the importance of the theatrical experience – for filmmakers to keep making movies for the big screens, for distributors to focus on theatrical releases and for audiences to keep going — 'Mickey 17' is perhaps the perfect representation of this moment in the business, or at least an interesting case study. It’s an original film from an Oscar-winning director led by a big star that was afforded a blockbuster budget and given a robust theatrical release by Warner Bros., one of the few major studios remaining. But despite all of that, and reviews that were mostly positive (79% on RottenTomatoes), audiences did not treat it as an event movie, and it may ultimately struggle to break even. Originally set for release in March 2024, Bong Joon Ho’s follow-up to the Oscar-winning 'Parasite' faced several delays, which he has attributed to extenuating circumstances around the Hollywood strikes. Based on the novel 'Mickey7' by Edward Ashton, Pattinson plays an expendable employee who dies on missions and is re-printed time and time again. Steven Yeun, Naomi Ackie, Toni Collette and Mark Ruffalo also star. It opened in 3,807 locations domestically where it performed best in New York and Los Angeles. Premium large format showings, including IMAX screens, also accounted for nearly half of its opening weekend. Internationally, it did especially well in Korea, where it made an estimated $14.6 million. Second place went to 'Captain America: Brave New World,' which added $8.5 million from 3,480 locations in North America and $9.2 million internationally. Its global total currently rests at $370.8 million. Walt Disney Studios is on track to become the first studio to cross $1 billion in 2025 sometime this week. Holdovers 'Last Breath,' 'The Monkey' and 'Paddington in Peru' rounded out the top five. The weekend also had several other newcomers in 'In the Lost Lands,' a fantasy film from Paul W.S. Anderson starring Milla Jovovich and Dave Bautista, and Angel Studios' 'Rule Breakers,' about Afghani girls on a robotics team. Neon upped the theater count for 'Anora' to nearly 2,000 screens after it won five Oscars on Sunday, including best picture, best director and best actress. It earned an estimated $1.9 million (up 595% from last weekend), bringing its total grosses to $18.4 million. According to data from Comscore, the 2025 box office is up 1% from where it was last year as of this weekend and down 34.2% from the last pre-pandemic box office year of 2019. 'That is the rollercoaster that is the box office,' said Paul Dergarabedian, the senior media analyst for Comscore. 'You have two or three down weeks; it can profoundly impact the bottom line and the percentage advantage. But it will come back again.' Estimated ticket sales for Friday through Sunday at U.S. and Canadian theaters, according to Comscore. Final domestic figures will be released Monday. 1. 'Mickey 17,' $19.1 million. 2. 'Captain America: Brave New World,' $8.5 million. 3. 'Last Breath,' $4.2 million. 4. 'The Monkey,' $3.9 million. 5. 'Paddington in Peru,' $3.9 million. 6. 'Dog Man,' $3.5 million. 7. 'Anora,' $1.9 million. 8. 'Mufasa: The Lion King,' $1.7 million. 9. 'Rule Breakers,' $1.6 million. 10. 'In the Lost Land,' $1 million.	https://www.voanews.com/a/sci-fi-film-mickey-17-tops-box-office-but-profitability-long-way-off/8004440.html	2025-03-09T11:22:21-07:00	
Ailing pope thanks doctors as condition improves	Vatican City, Holy See — Pope Francis, who is responding well to treatment for pneumonia, thanked his doctors and health care workers Sunday as he missed delivering a fourth straight Angelus prayer in person. The 88-year-old, in Rome's Gemelli hospital since February 14, issued a written Angelus in which he thanked those who volunteer to help others in need, praising their 'closeness and tenderness.' 'I too experience the thoughtfulness of service and the tenderness of care, in particular from the doctors and health care workers, whom I thank from the bottom of my heart,' he said. 'We need this, the 'miracle of tenderness' which accompanies those who are in adversity, bringing a little light into the night of pain,' he said in the text published by the Vatican. The leader of the world's 1.4 billion Catholics has spent time at the Gemelli before, notably for colon surgery in 2021 and a hernia operation in 2023. This hospitalization has been more serious, however, with Francis suffering several respiratory crises, prompting fears the road to recovery would be long, or might force the elderly pontiff to resign. On Saturday, the Vatican said the pope appeared finally to be responding well to treatment and had seen 'a gradual, slight improvement,' marking several days without crises. Although the pope does not have a fever, his doctors want to see the more positive results 'in the coming days' before giving a prognosis, an evening medical bulletin said. The next bulletin is expected Monday afternoon. 'Given so much' Francis has been alternating rest, prayer and bits of work when he feels up to it. On Sunday morning, he received Italian Cardinal Pietro Parolin, the Vatican's secretary of state, and Edgar Pena Parra, a Venezuelan archbishop who is also a senior Vatican official. People who gathered in St Peter's Square on Sunday, where Francis would usually stand at a Vatican window to read the Angelus to crowds below, said his presence was sorely missed. 'He is a wonderful person who has given so much and I hope that he can return as soon as possible,' said Diana Desiderio, who volunteers with the civil protection agency in Pescara. She and fellow volunteers are praying that Francis will 'return to the window again and bring peace and serenity to everyone, because we need it,' she told AFP. The pope ended the Angelus with his traditional call for peace in conflicts, 'in particular in tormented Ukraine, Palestine, Israel, Lebanon, Myanmar, Sudan and the Democratic Republic of Congo.' He said he had 'learned with concern of the resumption of violence in some areas of Syria: I hope that they cease definitively, with full respect for all ethnic and religious components of society.' Catholics have also been gathering at the Gemelli hospital to pray for Francis or leave flowers, candles and cards. Giuseppe Antonio Perazzo, 74, was at the hospital for the second Sunday in a row, dressed smartly in a suit and tie in the hope that the pontiff might appear at the window. A sign he propped up in sight of the windows of the pope's rooms urged the Argentine pontiff -- a notoriously headstrong patient -- to 'keep doing what the doctors and nurses tell you to do.'	https://www.voanews.com/a/ailing-pope-thanks-doctors-as-condition-improves/8004441.html	2025-03-09T11:18:50-07:00	
US envoy says Gaza hostage deal possible 'within weeks'	A Trump administration hostage negotiator called his recent meetings with representatives of U.S.-designated terror group Hamas 'helpful.' Discussions focused on the release of an American-Israeli hostage held by Hamas. This, as Israel says it plans to deploy a delegation this week to discuss ceasefire talks. VOA’s Arash Arabasadi has the story.	https://www.voanews.com/a/us-envoy-says-gaza-hostage-deal-possible-within-weeks-/8004418.html	2025-03-09T10:48:18-07:00	
Iran-US talks on nuclear program possible if limited in focus: UN mission	Dubai, United Arab Emirates — Iran would consider negotiations with the U.S. if the aim of the talks was to address concerns regarding any potential militarization of its nuclear program, Iran's U.N. mission said Sunday in a post on X. The comment came a day after the country's Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei said Iran will not negotiate under U.S. 'bullying.' In the post on X the mission said: 'If the objective of negotiations is to address concerns vis-à-vis any potential militarization of Iran’s nuclear program, such discussions may be subject to consideration.' 'However, should the aim be the dismantlement of Iran’s peaceful nuclear program ... such negotiations will never take place,' the post added. Khamenei was quoted by state media as saying on Saturday: 'They are bringing up new demands that certainly will not be accepted by Iran, like our defense capabilities, missile range and international influence.' U.S. President Donald Trump said in an interview with Fox Business Network, broadcast Friday, that he wants to negotiate a nuclear deal with Iran and had sent a letter to its leadership suggesting talks with the Islamic Republic, which the West fears is rapidly nearing the capability to make atomic weapons. Iran denies seeking nuclear weapons. While expressing openness to a deal with Tehran, Trump has reinstated a 'maximum pressure' campaign that was applied during his first term as president to isolate Iran from the global economy and drive its oil exports to zero. During his 2017-2021 term, Trump withdrew the United States from a landmark deal between Iran and major powers that had placed strict limits on Tehran's nuclear activities in exchange for sanctions relief. After Trump pulled out in 2018 and re-imposed sanctions, Iran breached and far surpassed those limits. U.N. nuclear watchdog chief Rafael Grossi has said that time is running out for diplomacy to impose new restrictions on Iran's activities, as Tehran continues to accelerate its enrichment of uranium to near weapons-grade. Tehran says its nuclear work is solely for peaceful purposes.	https://www.voanews.com/a/iran-us-talks-on-nuclear-program-possible-if-limited-in-focus-un-mission/8004413.html	2025-03-09T10:28:20-07:00	
Tropical low tracks west across Australian east coast leaving 1 dead and several injured	BRISBANE, Australia — Flooding rains lashed the Australian east coast even though it avoided the destructive winds of its first tropical cyclone in 51 years, officials said Saturday. One person was confirmed dead and several were injured. Tropical Cyclone Alfred had been expected to become the first cyclone to cross the Australian coast near the Queensland state capital of Brisbane, Australia’s third-most populous city, since 1974. But it weakened Saturday to a tropical low, which is defined as carrying sustained winds of less than 63 kph. The cyclone’s remnants crossed the coast late Saturday 55 kilometers north of Brisbane and will continue to track west across the inland bringing heavy rain, the Bureau of Meteorology said in a statement. 'The real threat now is from that locally heavy-to-intense rainfall, which may lead to flash and riverine flooding,' bureau manager Matt Collopy said. Cyclones are common in Queensland’s tropical north but are rare in the state’s temperate and densely populated southeast corner that borders New South Wales state. A 61-year-old man who disappeared in a flooded river near the New South Wales town of Dorrigo was confirmed as the first casualty of the crisis when his body was recovered on Saturday, police said. Two military trucks involved in the emergency response rolled over in the town of Tregeagle in New South Wales on Saturday, injuring 13 defense personnel, Prime Minister Anthony Albanese said Sunday. One truck left the road and rolled several times into a paddock and the other truck tipped on its side while swerving to avoid a collision. Of the 32 Brisbane-based military personnel in the trucks, six sustained serious injuries, he said. The injured were taken to hospitals and all were expected to recover, Defense Minister Richard Marles said. A woman sustained minor injuries when an apartment building lost its roof in the Queensland border city of Gold Coast on Friday, police said. The woman was one of 21 people who were evacuated from the building. A couple sustained minor injuries when a tree crashed through the ceiling of their Gold Coast bedroom during strong winds and rain on Thursday night, officials said. Queensland Premier David Crisafulli said 330,000 homes and businesses had lost power due to the storm since Thursday. No other natural disaster had created a bigger blackout in the state’s history. New South Wales reported as many as 45,000 premises without electricity on Saturday. But tens of thousands had been reconnected by late in the day, officials said. Rivers were flooding in Queensland and New South Wales after days of heavy rain, the meteorology bureau said. The dead man recovered on Saturday was the only fatality among 36 flood rescues carried out by emergency teams in northern New South Wales in recent days, most involving vehicles attempting to cross floodwaters, police said.	https://www.voanews.com/a/tropical-low-tracks-west-across-australian-east-coast-leaving-1-dead-and-several-injured-/8004401.html	2025-03-09T10:21:06-07:00	
Trump to keep tariffs to pressure Mexico, Canada, China on fentanyl, aides say	U.S. President Donald Trump is keeping new tariffs in place on Mexico, Canada and China to pressure them to block the flow of the deadly opioid fentanyl into the United States, top White House economic officials said Sunday. 'If fentanyl ends, I think these [tariffs] will come off,' Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick told NBC’s 'Meet the Press' show. 'But if fentanyl does not end, or he's uncertain about it, he will stay this way until he is comfortable,' he said. 'This is black and white. You got to save American lives.' Trump last week issued a string of whip-sawing tariff decisions that plunged the three major U.S. stock market indexes and roiled relations with Canada and Mexico, which are long-time U.S. allies and its closest neighbors, as well as its two biggest trading partners. Trump at first imposed 25% tariffs on Canadian and Mexican exports to the U.S., then exempted the duties on Mexican- and Canadian-made vehicles being transported into the U.S. and later by week’s end delayed the tariffs on almost all items for four weeks until April 2. But Lutnick said 25% U.S. tariffs on steel and aluminum imports will take effect Wednesday as scheduled. Canada and Mexico are both top exporters of the metals to U.S. markets, with Canada accounting for most aluminum imports. The Commerce chief also rebuffed fears that Trump's global tariffs would cause a recession in the United States. 'Absolutely not,' he said. 'There's going to be no recession in America.' But Lutnick acknowledged that the tariffs would lead to higher prices for U.S. consumers on foreign-made goods. 'Some products that are made foreign might be more expensive, but American products will get cheaper, and that's the point,' Lutnick said. It was not clear how U.S.-produced goods would become cheaper, except in comparison to foreign-manufactured products. Trump, in a taped interview with Fox News’ 'Sunday Morning Futures' show, dodged a question about a possible recession because of his tariff boosts, but said, 'There is a period of transition because what we're doing is very big.' 'There could be a little disruption,' he said about stock market losses last week. 'Look, what I have to do is build a strong country. You can't really watch the stock market. If you look at China, they have a 100-year perspective. We go by quarters. And you can't go by that.' Trump has at various times said his new tariffs are aimed at raising government revenue, protecting U.S. jobs and pressuring foreign manufacturers to relocate their operations to the U.S., and to curb the flow of fentanyl. Like Lutnick, Kevin Hassett, director of the White House National Economic Council, emphasized the fentanyl issue in an interview on ABC News’ 'This Week' program. He said Trump’s tariffs targeting Canada and Mexico, along with doubling a previous 10% duty on Chinese exports to 20%, are aimed at cutting the tens thousands of fentanyl deaths that have occurred in recent years. 'We launched a drug war, not a trade war,' he said. 'We hope we’ll round up the cartels' while there is a pause in the tariffs on Mexico and Canada. 'It is a big problem,' he said. 'Get the drug cartels out of Canada and Mexico.' Both Mexican President Claudia Sheinbaum and outgoing Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau told Trump in phone conversations last week they have made strides in curbing the flow of fentanyl into the U.S. Sheinbaum sent 10,000 troops to Mexico’s northern border with the U.S. to try to curb the flow of drugs and undocumented migrants while Trudeau also ramped up border enforcement. But it is unclear whether Trump will be satisfied enough with the Mexican and Canadian efforts to drop the tariff increases next month. Even with the White House effort targeting fentanyl, Hassett said Trump’s economic concerns remain as important. 'He’s trying to make it so when we produce something, we produce it at home,' not in another country, Hassett said. 'Bring the jobs home, bring the wealth home. If you want to increase the welfare of Americans, then produce the jobs here.'	https://www.voanews.com/a/trump-to-keep-tariffs-to-pressure-mexico-canada-china-on-fentanyl-aides-say/8004380.html	2025-03-09T10:02:44-07:00	
Honduras holds primaries as voter frustration simmers over security and the economy	TEGUCIGALPA, Honduras — Voters in Honduras will select candidates from the three main parties Sunday to compete in November’s general election for the presidency in a country that remains deeply polarized, but skeptical of leaders from the left and right who have failed to deliver on improving security and the economy. The election comes at a time when President Xiomara Castro — Honduras' first female leader — of the leftist LIBRE party has a tense relationship with the United States. She had raised the possibility of ending U.S. access to an air base the U.S. military uses for regional operations and said that she would withdraw from the extradition treaty that sent her predecessor to the U.S. on drug trafficking charges, before eventually backtracking. Her own extended family has been dogged by allegations of ties to drug traffickers. U.S. Secretary of State Marco Rubio notably left Honduras off his itinerary when he made his first overseas trip to Central America last month since taking up the post. Sunday’s election will offer voters choices of continuation in the form of Castro’s defense minister, Rixi Moncada, who has the president's support. Moncada's refusal to resign her position to run for office has been criticized, in part because the military is charged with guarding the ballots. Former first lady Ana García offers the possibility of a return to the recent past as she seeks the nomination of the National Party of Honduras. Her husband, ex-President Juan Orlando Hernández, belongs to the party. Hernández is serving a 45-year prison sentence in the United States for drug trafficking. At her closing campaign event, she played an audio recording of her husband saying, 'a vote for Ana is a vote for me, a vote for a better life.' The conservative Liberal Party of Honduras features a face-off between two people who once supported Castro, but became opponents. One of them, Salvador Nasralla, helped Castro win the presidency in the 2021 election by ending his independent candidacy to join her coalition. He served as vice president, before leaving the administration, saying he had been marginalized. The other is Jorge Cálix, a young lawyer and politician, who was once a member of LIBRE, but left after Castro failed to support his bid to lead Congress. Nasralla has expressed admiration for Argentina’s libertarian president, Javier Milei, while Cálix says he wants to emulate popular El Salvador President Nayib Bukele’s heavy-handed security policies. 'If a millennial did it in El Salvador, why can’t another millennial like me do it here,' Cálix has said. In total, 10 candidates will compete for the nominations of the three parties. Eleven smaller parties will choose their candidates through their own internal processes at other times. Voters will also choose in ballot races for seats in Congress and mayorships. About 5.8 million Hondurans are eligible to vote. Participation in the open primaries has historically been low, owing in large part to fears that being identified with one party could limit chances of employment if another party’s candidate wins in November. Political analyst Miguel Cálix said that he hopes the primaries are transparent and without problems, but that hasn't always been the case. 'The primary votes historically have been the worst electoral exercises in Honduran democracy,' he said, noting that they've been full of irregularities. Hondurans are looking for clear proposals on security, jobs, corruption and a faltering health care system. Low levels of foreign investment in recent years have fueled high unemployment, which continues to drive Hondurans to migrate in search of opportunities. Persistent violence is another factor pushing Hondurans out of their homes. Street gangs run extortion rackets through fear, and drug traffickers take advantage of Honduras’ geographic location to profit from drugs moving north toward the United States. Political analyst Luis León said that the primary is just as important as the general election, because if the parties don’t put forward their best candidates, voters will have poor choices in November. 'Three candidates for the presidency will come out of them and one of them has the potential to be president,' León said. 'So that’s why the best man or best woman with a plan for resolving the country’s problems has to emerge.'	https://www.voanews.com/a/honduras-holds-primaries-as-voter-frustration-simmers-over-security-and-the-economy-/8004338.html	2025-03-09T09:20:24-07:00	
Flight cancellations at Germany's Hamburg Airport affect more than 40,000 passengers after strike	Berlin — Flight cancellations at Hamburg Airport after a surprise strike by workers affected more than 40,000 passengers on Sunday, a day before a planned wider protest across Germany amid new contract negotiations. Only 10 of more than 280 scheduled flights went as planned early Sunday, the airport said. Many service desks sat empty as would-be passengers lined up to seek information about the cancellations. One big electronic departure board overhead had 'canceled' in red next to the list of all flights. The surprise walkout, which reportedly took place with only about a half-hour notice, came before a broader series of preannounced strikes across 13 airports in Germany on Monday, organized by the ver.di union. The union, whose members work in areas including passenger services and cargo and goods screening, called for Sunday's strike by security control staff to put pressure on company representatives amid collective bargaining talks. 'The behavior of the trade union ver.di is dishonorable: The strike without notice hits Hamburg Airport at the start of the vacation season,' airport spokeswoman Katja Bromm said in a statement. She said that on Monday, arrivals would be possible, and that 'considerable disruptions and cancellations' were expected. Bromm said that Sunday's walkouts were 'excessive and unfair to tens of thousands of travelers who have nothing to do with the disputes.' For months, ver.di has been negotiating a new agreement that aims to improve occupational health and safety, provide more vacation days, an increase in the annual bonus to 50% and the freedom to choose a doctor for employees’ regular, mandatory medical exams, among other things. Lars Stubbe, a trade union official, said that 'a strike must cause economic damage.' 'We know that it is a massive burden for passengers. Our colleagues know that too. But they have said we have to go on strike. It must be effective, so that we have a reasonable offer to negotiate,' he said. Some would-be passengers didn't hide their frustration. 'I also wonder why it’s like this, because it was supposed to be a big strike tomorrow [Monday] — and why is it today?' said Alva Wetzel, who had hoped to travel. 'It’s just stupid.'	https://www.voanews.com/a/flight-cancellations-at-germany-s-hamburg-airport-affect-more-than-40-000-passengers-after-strike-/8004356.html	2025-03-09T09:19:19-07:00	
US orders nonemergency government staff to leave South Sudan as tension grows over fighting	NAIROBI, Kenya — The U.S. State Department on Sunday ordered nonemergency government personnel to leave South Sudan's capital as tension escalates because of fighting in the north. The travel advisory issued on Sunday stated that fighting was ongoing and that 'weapons are readily available to the population.' An armed group clashed with the country's army on Tuesday, leading to the arrests of two government ministers and a deputy army chief allied to former rebel turned Vice President Riek Machar. Machar's home was surrounded by the army as his supporters said that the arrests were threatening the country's peace agreement. South Sudan descended into a civil war from 2013 to 2018, during which more than 400,000 people were killed. President Salva Kiir and Machar, his rival, signed a peace agreement in 2018 that is still in the process of implementation. On Friday, an attack on a U.N helicopter that was on an evacuation mission in the north complicated the security situation and a U.N rights body said that it was 'considered a war crime.' The U.N Commission on Human Rights in South Sudan on Saturday said that the violence in the north and tension in Juba, the capital, was 'threatening to derail' South Sudan's peace agreement. 'We are witnessing an alarming regression that could erase years of hard-won progress. Rather than fueling division and conflict, leaders must urgently refocus on the peace process, uphold the human rights of South Sudanese citizens, and ensure a smooth transition to democracy,' said the chairperson, Yasmin Sooka.	https://www.voanews.com/a/us-orders-nonemergency-government-staff-to-leave-south-sudan-as-tension-grows-over-fighting-/8004344.html	2025-03-09T09:06:25-07:00	
Thousands in Nepal want monarchy back as public frustration with politics grows	KATHMANDU — Thousands of supporters greeted Nepal's former king in capital Kathmandu on Sunday and demanded his abolished monarchy be reinstated and Hinduism brought back as a state religion. An estimated 10,000 supporters of Gyanendra Shah blocked the main entrance to Kathmandu's Tribhuvan International Airport as he arrived from a tour of western Nepal. 'Vacate the royal palace for the king. Come back king, save the country. Long live our beloved king. We want monarchy,' the crowds chanted. Passengers were forced to walk to and from the airport. Hundreds of riot police blocked the protesters from entering the airport and there was no violence. Massive street protests in 2006 forced Gyanendra to give up his authoritarian rule, and two years later the parliament voted to abolish the monarchy as Gyanendra left the Royal Palace to live the life of a commoner. But many Nepalis have grown frustrated with the republic, saying it has failed to bring about political stability and blaming it for a struggling economy and widespread corruption. Nepal has had 13 governments since the monarchy was abolished in 2008. Rally participants said they were hoping for a change in the political system to stop the country from further deteriorating. 'We are here to give the king our full support and to rally behind him all the way to reinstating him in the royal throne,' said Thir Bahadur Bhandari, 72. Among the thousands was 50-year-old carpenter Kulraj Shrestha, who had taken part in the 2006 protests against the king but has changed his mind and now supports the monarchy. 'The worst thing that is happening to the country is massive corruption and all politicians in power are not doing anything for the country,' Shrestha said. 'I was in the protests that took away monarchy hoping it would help the country, but I was mistaken and the nation has further plunged so I have changed my mind.' Gyanendra has not commented on the calls for the return of monarchy. Despite growing support for the former king, Gyanendra has slim chances of immediately returning to power. He became the king in 2002, after his brother and family were massacred in the palace. He ruled as the constitutional head of state without executive or political powers until 2005, when he seized absolute power. He disbanded the government and parliament, jailed politicians and journalists and cut off communications, declaring a state of emergency and using the army to rule the country.	https://www.voanews.com/a/thousands-in-nepal-want-monarchy-back-as-public-frustration-with-politics-grows/8004339.html	2025-03-09T08:53:06-07:00	
Firefighters knock down brush fire on Long Island, risk remains with high winds	New York — Firefighters in New York knocked down a dwindling brush fire in a wooded stretch of Long Island on Sunday as officials warned that high wind gusts could leave the region vulnerable to additional blazes. Gov. Kathy Hochul declared a state of emergency a day earlier after four separate fires broke out across large swaths of Long Island's Pine Barrens region, prompting closures to the highway and evacuations of a military base. As of Sunday, all visible flames had been knocked down, including the last remaining fire burning in the hamlet of Westhampton, according to Suffolk County Fire Coordinator Rudy Sunderman. He said at a Sunday news conference that crews were working on containment lines around the fire to prevent further spread. Authorities said the fire had not grown since early Sunday. Still, officials were cautious as wind gusts of up to 48 kph were expected Sunday, according to the National Weather Service. 'We're concerned because the winds are still blowing, that might spark up again,' said Suffolk County Executive Ed Romaine. Romaine thanked firefighters who worked through the night, adding that more than 80 volunteer fire departments battled the blaze, which burned about 243 hectares. Two firefighters were hospitalized for injuries and released, according to Sunderman. The cause of the fire remained under investigation. Dozens of detectives were interviewing 911 callers and using drones. Suffolk County officials said earlier that the police department's arson squad had initiated an investigation into the blaze, though there was no immediate evidence to suggest arson. 'We're going to get to the bottom of what happened,' said Suffolk County Police Commissioner Kevin Catalina. 'At this time it's too early to tell whether or not this fire started naturally or there's some nefarious origin.' At least two commercial structures were damaged. Roughly 24 kilometers west, officials were monitoring a small brush fire along Sunrise Highway early Sunday, Brookhaven Town Supervisor Daniel J. Panico said. But there were no visible flames as of Sunday morning.	https://www.voanews.com/a/firefighters-knock-down-brush-fire-on-long-island-risk-remains-with-high-winds/8004283.html	2025-03-09T07:53:35-07:00	
New York governor declares state of emergency for wind-driven brush fire on Long Island	New York — Fast-moving brush fires fanned by high winds burned through a large swath of land on New York's Long Island on Saturday, spewing thick gray smoke into the sky and prompting the evacuation of a military base and the closure of a major highway. Gov. Kathy Hochul declared a state of emergency and said state agencies were responding to the fires around the Pine Barrens, a wooded area that is home to commuter towns east of New York City. She said homes, a chemical factory and an Amazon warehouse were at risk and more evacuations may be needed. 'This is still out of control at this moment,' Hochul told Long Island TV station News 12. 'We’re seeing people having to be evacuated from the Westhampton area.' Officials said three of the four fires were fully contained, with the fire in Westhampton 50% contained. Two commercial buildings were partially burned, but officials said homes were not in the line of fire. One firefighter was flown to a hospital to be treated for burns to the face. 'Our biggest problem is the wind,' Suffolk County Executive Ed Romaine said. 'It is driving this fire.' Videos posted to social media showed flames shooting into the air and columns of black smoke rising above roads. Air National Guard helicopters dropped water on the flames. The Town of Southampton issued a warning in the afternoon against starting recreational fires due to the wildfire risk. That came around the time that the videos began appearing. In a statement, Hochul said the National Guard was providing support by helicopter and working with local law enforcement. 'Public safety is my top priority, and I’m committed to doing everything possible to keep Long Islanders safe,' she said. In her comments to News 12, Hochul declined to estimate the extent of the flames, saying only that they were growing rapidly. Rough satellite data indicated that fire and smoke stretched roughly 3 kilometers along Sunrise Highway, according to NASA’s Fire Information for Resource Management System. Police closed a section of the highway, which is a thoroughfare to the East End of Long Island. The fires raged near the Francis S. Gabreski Airport, from which the National Guard launched at least one helicopter. One of the commercial buildings that partially burned was near the airport. Personnel at the base evacuated as a precautionary measure starting around 1:45 p.m., spokesman Cheran Cambell said in a statement.	https://www.voanews.com/a/8004283.html	2025-03-09T07:53:35-07:00	
Rubio says Syria must hold accountable 'perpetrators of massacres'	Washington — U..S Secretary of State Marco Rubio on Sunday condemned the 'radical Islamist terrorists' behind 'massacres' of minorities in Syria and demanded that the interim administration hold those responsible to account. 'The United States condemns the radical Islamist terrorists, including foreign jihadis, that murdered people in western Syria in recent days,' Rubio said in a statement. 'The United States stands with Syria's religious and ethnic minorities, including its Christian, Druze, Alawite, and Kurdish communities, and offers its condolences to the victims and their families,' he said. 'Syria's interim authorities must hold the perpetrators of these massacres against Syria's minority communities accountable.' The violence against minorities erupted after gunmen loyal to ousted leader Bashar al-Assad, a member of the Alawite minority, attacked the new security forces. War monitor the Syrian Observatory for Human Rights later reported that security forces and allied groups killed at least 745 Alawite civilians in Latakia and Tartus provinces. Interim President Ahmad al-Sharaa, who led the Sunni Islamist group Hayat Tahrir al-Sham that spearheaded the lightning offensive that toppled Assad, called for national coexistence after the killings. The United States under former president Joe Biden engaged with Sharaa after he came to power but said that any greater normalization would depend on meeting conditions including the protection of minorities. Donald Trump, then president-elect, said at the time that the United States had little interest in Syria and should stay out, and he has previously spoken of removing U.S. troops in the country to fight the Islamic State movement. Since taking office, the Trump administration has said little about Syria but has severely slashed assistance to groups assisting civilians in the war-ravaged country. The United States did not join Britain on Thursday in announcing an easing of Assad-era sanctions on Syria.	https://www.voanews.com/a/rubio-says-syria-must-hold-accountable-perpetrators-of-massacres-/8004267.html	2025-03-09T07:32:26-07:00	
Iraq fears power cuts as US ends sanctions waiver for electricity purchases from Iran	The United States has declined to renew a waiver that had allowed Iraq to buy electricity from Iran without running afoul of sanctions, a U.S. official said Sunday. The previous waiver expired Saturday and the U.S. Department of State did not renew it, the U.S. embassy in Baghdad said in a statement. The decision came as part of President Donald Trump's 'maximum pressure campaign' on Iran, which is 'designed to end Iran's nuclear threat, curtail its ballistic missile program and stop it from supporting terrorist groups,' the statement said. 'We urge the Iraqi government to eliminate its dependence on Iranian sources of energy as soon as possible, and welcome the Iraqi Prime Minister's commitment to achieve energy independence,' the statement said. Despite its oil and gas wealth, Iraq has suffered from decades of electricity shortages because of war, corruption and mismanagement and has become heavily reliant on imported Iranian gas as well as electricity imported directly from Iran to meet its electricity needs. Power outages are common, especially in the scorching summer months. Many Iraqis have to rely on diesel generators or suffer through temperatures that exceed 50 degrees Celsius (122 degrees Fahrenheit). The waiver that expired applied to direct electricity imports. It remains unclear whether Iraq will be able to continue to import gas from Iran for its power plants. The U.S. embassy statement asserted that electricity imports from Iran were only 4% of electricity consumption in Iraq. But a spokesperson for Iraq's Ministry of Electricity, Ahmad Moussa, said that should gas imports also be forbidden it 'would cause Iraq to lose more than 30% of its electricity energy' and that the government is looking for alternatives. Already, Moussa said, Iranian gas had stopped supplying power plants in Baghdad and the central Euphrates region for the past two months, and the supply to southern power plants had been unstable. A senior official in the electricity ministry, who spoke on condition of anonymity because he was not authorized to speak publicly, said the ministry had not yet been officially notified of the U.S. decision regarding gas imports. He said Iraq could lose about 8,000 megawatts of energy from power stations operating on Iranian gas and another 500 megawatts of electricity supplied directly by Iran. There are some 7.5 billion euros in an Iraqi bank account set aside as payment for Iranian gas and about 6.5 billion euros have already been disbursed since the beginning of the year, the official said. The funds are limited in how they can be used and are only released when Iran needs to purchase food, medicine or other humanitarian supplies.	https://www.voanews.com/a/iraq-fears-power-cuts-as-us-ends-sanctions-waiver-for-electricity-purchases-from-iran/8004258.html	2025-03-09T07:20:31-07:00	
Armed man shot by Secret Service near White House while Trump out of town	An armed man believed to be traveling from Indiana was shot by U.S. Secret Service agents near the White House after a confrontation early Sunday, according to authorities. No one else was injured in the shooting that happened around midnight about a block from the White House, according to a Secret Service statement. President Donald Trump was in Florida at the time of the shooting. The Secret Service received information from local police about an alleged 'suicidal individual' who was traveling from Indiana and found the man's car and a person matching his description nearby. 'As officers approached, the individual brandished a firearm and an armed confrontation ensued, during which shots were fired by our personnel,' the Secret Service said in a statement. The man was hospitalized. The Secret Service said his condition was 'unknown.' The Metropolitan Police Department will investigate because the shooting involved law enforcement officers. A message left Sunday for the police department wasn't immediately returned.	https://www.voanews.com/a/armed-man-shot-by-secret-service-near-white-house-while-trump-out-of-town-/8004195.html	2025-03-09T06:05:09-07:00	
Rubio heads to Saudi Arabia for US-Ukraine talks, then Canada for G7	State Department — U.S. Secretary of State Marco Rubio will arrive in Jeddah, Saudi Arabia, on Monday for U.S.-Ukraine talks as President Donald Trump pushes to broker a swift end to the Russia-Ukraine war. While in Jeddah, Rubio will also meet with Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman Al Saud to discuss ways to advance shared interests in the region and strengthen the U.S.-Saudi relationship, said State Department spokesperson Tammy Bruce. According to the State Department, Rubio has 'underscored President Trump's determination to end the war as soon as possible and emphasized that all sides must take steps to secure a sustainable peace' in a Friday call with Ukrainian Foreign Minister Andrii Sybiha. On Monday, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy will visit the Gulf kingdom for a meeting with Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman. Afterward, a Ukrainian diplomatic and military delegation led by Zelenskyy’s chief of staff, Andriy Yermak, will remain in Saudi Arabia for talks with U.S. officials. The Ukrainian team will also include Sybiha, Defense Minister Rustem Umerov, and military commander Pavlo Palisa. Rubio will join U.S. National Security Adviser Mike Waltz and Trump’s special envoy, Steve Witkoff, for the Jeddah talks with Ukrainian officials. Witkoff has told reporters that 'the idea is to get down a framework for a peace agreement and an initial ceasefire as well.' The U.S.-Ukraine talks will take place three weeks after senior U.S. officials held talks with Russian officials in Riyadh. Ukraine said it is 'fully committed' to constructive dialogue with the U.S. and hopes to 'discuss and agree on the necessary decisions and steps.' 'Ukraine has been seeking peace from the very first second of this war. Realistic proposals are on the table. The key is to move quickly and effectively,' Zelenskyy wrote in a post on X on Saturday. G7 foreign ministers Following his visit to Saudi Arabia, Rubio will travel to Charlevoix, Canada, for the Group of Seven (G7) foreign ministers' meeting from March 12 to 14. In a joint statement following talks on the sidelines of the Munich Security Conference in February, G7 foreign ministers underscored their commitment to helping 'achieve a durable peace' and 'reaffirmed the need to develop robust security guarantees' for Ukraine. 'Any new, additional sanctions after February should be linked to whether the Russian Federation enters into real, good-faith efforts to bring an enduring end to the war against Ukraine,' the joint statement added.	https://www.voanews.com/a/8004187.html	2025-03-09T05:46:50-07:00	
China far outpacing US in military, commercial ship numbers	When President Donald Trump announced Tuesday that he had created a new White House office to 'resurrect' American military and commercial shipbuilding, he elevated long-standing calls to fix the struggling industry that he said is vital to national security. His clarion call to build more ships 'very fast and very soon' comes at a time of rising strategic competition with China. 'Our shipbuilding industry is shrunk down to bare minimum right now,' Marine Corps Commandant General Eric Smith told VOA in an exclusive interview at the Pentagon late last year. The anemic state of American shipbuilding and ship maintenance, and the risks they raise for the military, was shared with VOA through more than a dozen interviews with U.S. military and industry officials spanning several months and conducted ahead of Trump's announcement. The U.S. Navy is still considered the most powerful in the world when it comes to firepower and tonnage, but the number of Navy ships has fallen behind China’s. The United States has 296 ships in its fleet, while China’s is on pace to surpass 400 ships this year. Shrinking fleet Despite the U.S. Navy’s goal of increasing the size of its fleet, in recent years the number of ships has been shrinking. Last year’s budget funded just six new Navy ships, while decommissioning 15 from the fleet, for a net loss of nine. The fiscal 2025 budget plan funds six new ships while decommissioning 19, for a net loss of 13. The lifeblood for maritime industry titans like British-based BAE, U.S.-based Huntington Ingalls Industries (HII) and Fairbanks Morse Defense runs almost exclusively through the U.S. military. Industry leaders say they have the space to build and repair more ships but that Navy contracts have been scarce. 'We’re operating at half-capacity,' said Brad Moyer, vice president of BAE Systems Ship Repair. Although the company is one of the largest for ship repair in the United States, when VOA toured BAE’s Norfolk yard in Virginia in November, most of the docking spaces for ships were empty. Shipbuilding demand has fluctuated wildly based on Navy budgeting strategies, creating an industry atmosphere of feast or famine that is shrinking the supply chain. 'There's thousands and thousands of suppliers that have gone out of business, and it's a real risk,' George Whittier, the CEO of Fairbanks Morse Defense, told VOA. The company is the largest engine manufacturer in North and South America and the sole company supplying the biggest engines used in the military’s amphibious warfare ships. Each engine is about the size of a small school bus. 'We should have two engine suppliers. But the reality is, if the Navy is only going to build six ships a year, it's a struggle to keep one engine supplier in business, let alone two. We're going to have to grow our way out of this, and that’s the only way we're going to do it,' Whittier said. He is not alone. VOA found multiple examples of companies that were the only supplier of specific ship parts. The U.S. military and other industry leaders say they are worried there will not be a backup for parts should more industry businesses go under. And those suppliers who have survived say when business is not steady, it takes longer to provide the parts, and it costs more to procure the materials. Acting Vice Chief of Naval Operations Admiral Jim Kilby, while advocating for a bigger fleet, says he has not had the budget to replace all of his aging ships and submarines, much less grow the force. 'When we get a new ship, we'll replace an old ship, because that old ship is more expensive and harder to maintain,' he said in a recent interview. Maintenance delays, layoffs Military contracting delays and project cancellations have led to layoffs. Even though BAE is one the largest companies in the industry, its West Coast shipyard laid off nearly 300 employees in 2023 due to a shortage of work. In the city of Norfolk, on America’s East Coast, the number of Navy ships available for repair work dropped from 44 ships about a decade ago to fewer than 30 today. About 60% of the workforce was furloughed in that time, officials said. The result, General Smith says, is a hollowed-out workforce that is not centered on shipbuilding. 'There's no one who grew up as a shipbuilder. There's welders and steam fitters and electricians, but if there's not steady work for them, they'll go to work for Harley-Davidson or Ford Motor Company or Chevy or whoever,' he said. Whittier and Moyer blame the budgeting process in Congress, along with the way the Navy structures its ship maintenance. 'The system is broken,' Whittier says. Congress has not passed a budget on time since 2019. When continuing resolutions (CRs) are used to fund the government, new projects cannot be started. In the case of the fiscal 2024 budget, Congress funded government with CRs for half a year, which Whittier says gave companies six months to do 12 months of work. 'It ends up being not just a big challenge in how to run a company, but it's a big challenge for the Navy in trying to figure out how are they getting their maintenance done. … It's frustrating all around for everybody,' the Fairbanks Morse Defense CEO told VOA. Senator Mark Kelly, a member of the Senate Armed Services Committee, agrees that CRs are bad, adding that the only thing worse would be shutting down the government. 'People are always going to try to blame somebody else, but I’d just say collectively, we’ve taken our eye off the ball here,' he added. Shipbuilding struggles There is also a shortage of skilled workers needed to keep the shipbuilding industry afloat. Huntington Ingalls Industries’ shipyard in Pascagoula, Mississippi, along the coast of the Gulf of America is the only yard in the United States that builds the Navy’s two types of amphibious warfare ships: Landing Helicopter Assault ships (LHAs) that look like mini-aircraft carriers, and smaller landing platform docks (LPDs). HII also builds Navy destroyers and Coast Guard cutters. Kari Wilkinson, executive vice president at HII, says that keeping staffing levels around the more than 11,000 workers needed to build cutters, destroyers and amphibious ships is getting more difficult, particularly in the post-pandemic economy. Just a few years ago, the shipyard was able to offer wages much higher than other jobs in the area that do not require a college degree. Now, Wilkinson says they are competing with everyone from coffee providers to fast food restaurants. 'The wage circumstance has changed. There is not that big gap anymore,' she told VOA. As a result, Wilkinson says, HII now loses workers at roughly double the rate of its pre-pandemic levels. To save money on materials, Congress authorized the military to buy four amphibs from HII at once, a move known as a multi-ship block buy. Buying them in bulk saved the Pentagon $900 million. 'That was a huge win for us,' General Smith said. Now, HII must figure out how to better retain its workforce. To make the worksite more attractive, HII has invested in air conditioning and giant shades to shield workers from the elements like the hot Mississippi sun. The Pascagoula shipyard hired 7,000 people in the last two years, Wilkinson says, but it will need about 1,000-2,000 more hires each year to complete the new ship orders. 'We've got to find ways to pay people competitive wages that are in accordance with the type of work they're doing,' Kelly told VOA. Commercial shipping Congress is expected to increase the military’s budget to surge resources for its shipbuilding shortfalls. But Kelly tells VOA the U.S. commercial shipping is also in need of saving. 'We went from 10,000 ships during World War II to 85 today. So, in case of an emergency, in case of a conflict with a near peer adversary, we're quite limited to getting all those supplies and equipment and troops across the ocean,' he said. The United States builds about five commercial ships each year. China builds more than 1,000. 'They have one shipyard, just one shipyard, that's bigger than all of our shipyards put together,' the senator told VOA. Kelly in December introduced bipartisan legislation called the Ships for America Act. The bill aims to increase the U.S. commercial fleet by 250 ships in 10 years, which will also increase the supply chain for military ships. 'You wouldn’t really think those two things are connected. But they are very closely connected,' he said. 'A lot of the parts that go into a U.S. aircraft carrier, some of those same parts for those systems go in merchant ships.' The bill calls for tax incentives, along with fees on cargo coming into the country, to help shipbuilders increase their capacity. The provisions of the bill are 'fully paid for,' Kelly said, without adding to the annual deficit.	https://www.voanews.com/a/trump-pledges-to-resurrect-shipbuilding-as-china-seen-outpacing-us-/8004070.html	2025-03-09T04:35:15-07:00	
Russia uses a gas pipeline to strike at Ukrainian troops from the rear in Kursk	KYIV — Russian special forces walked kilometers inside of a gas pipeline to strike Ukrainian units from the rear in the Kursk region, Ukraine’s military and Russian war bloggers reported, as Moscow moves to recapture parts of its border province that Kyiv seized in a shock offensive. Ukraine launched a daring cross-border incursion into Kursk in August, in what marked the largest attack on Russian territory since World War II. Within days, Ukrainian units had captured 1,000 square kilometers of territory, including the strategic border town of Sudzha, and taken hundreds of Russian prisoners of war. According to Kyiv, the operation aimed to gain a bargaining chip in future peace talks, and force Russia to divert troops away from its grinding offensive in eastern Ukraine. But months after Ukraine’s thunder run, its soldiers in Kursk are weary and bloodied by relentless assaults of more than 50,000 troops, including some from Russia's ally North Korea. Tens of thousands of Ukrainian soldiers run the risk of being encircled, open source maps of the battlefield show. According to Telegram posts by a Ukrainian-born, pro-Kremlin blogger, Russian operatives walked about 15 kilometers inside the pipeline, which Moscow had until recently used to send gas to Europe. Some Russian troops had spent several days in the pipe before striking Ukrainian units from the rear near the town of Sudzha, blogger Yuri Podolyaka claimed. The town had some 5,000 residents before the February 2022 Russian invasion of Ukraine, and houses major gas transfer and measuring stations along the pipeline, once a major outlet for Russian natural gas exports through Ukrainian territory. Another war blogger, who uses the alias Two Majors, said fierce fighting was underway for Sudzha, and that Russian forces managed to enter the town through a gas pipeline. Russian Telegram channels showed photos of what they said were special forces operatives, wearing gas masks and moving along what looked like the inside of a large pipe. Ukraine’s General Staff confirmed on Saturday evening that Russian 'sabotage and assault groups' used the pipeline in a bid to gain a foothold outside Sudzha. In a Telegram post, it said the Russian troops were 'detected in a timely manner' and that Ukraine responded with rockets and artillery. 'At present, Russian special forces are being detected, blocked and destroyed. The enemy’s losses in Sudzha are very high,' the General Staff reported.	https://www.voanews.com/a/russia-uses-a-gas-pipeline-to-strike-at-ukrainian-troops-from-the-rear-in-kursk-/8004143.html	2025-03-09T04:01:19-07:00	
Iran, Russia, China to hold joint military exercises	TEHRAN, IRAN — The navies of Iran, Russia and China will hold military drills off the coast of Iran this week in a bid to boost cooperation, Iranian media reported Sunday. The three countries, which share a common desire to counter what they characterize as American hegemony, have held similar exercises in the region in recent years. The drills 'will begin on Tuesday in the port of Chabahar,' located in southeast Iran on the Gulf of Oman, the Tasnim news agency said, without specifying their duration. 'Warships and combat and support vessels of the Chinese and Russian naval forces, as well as the warships of Iran's naval forces of the army and the Revolutionary Guards,' the ideological arm of Iran's military, are expected to participate, according to Tasnim. The exercises will take place 'in the northern Indian Ocean' and aim to 'strengthen security in the region, and expand multilateral cooperation between participating countries,' Tasnim said. Azerbaijan, South Africa, Oman, Kazakhstan, Pakistan, Qatar, Iraq, the United Arab Emirates and Sri Lanka will attend as observers. China will deploy 'a destroyer and a supply ship,' Beijing's defense ministry said on the WeChat social media network. The Iranian army conducted drills in the same area in February to 'strengthen defense capabilities against any threat.'	https://www.voanews.com/a/iran-russia-china-to-hold-joint-military-exercises/8004134.html	2025-03-09T03:03:16-07:00	
Syria president calls for unity after reports of mass killings	DAMASCUS, SYRIA — Syrian President Ahmed al-Sharaa called for national unity and peace on Sunday, after more than 1,000 people were reportedly killed in coastal Syria in the worst clashes since the overthrow of Bashar al-Assad. The violence erupted Thursday between the new security forces and loyalists of the former government along the Mediterranean coast in the heartland of the Alawite minority to which Assad belonged. It has since escalated into the largest challenge to the new government's forces since Sharaa's Islamist-led coalition toppled Assad in December. 'We must preserve national unity [and] civil peace as much as possible and, God willing, we will be able to live together in this country,' Sharaa said from a mosque in Damascus. The Syrian Observatory for Human Rights war monitor has reported that 745 Alawite civilians were killed in Latakia and Tartus provinces. The Britain-based Observatory said they were killed in 'executions' carried out by security personnel or pro-government fighters, accompanied by the 'looting of homes and properties.' The fighting has also killed 125 members of the security forces and 148 pro-Assad fighters, according to the Observatory, taking the overall death toll to 1,018. The official SANA news agency reported on Saturday that security forces had deployed to Latakia, as well as Jableh and Baniyas further south, to restore order. Baniyas resident Samir Haidar, 67, told AFP two of his brothers and his niece were killed by 'armed groups' that entered people's homes, adding that there were 'foreigners among them.' Though himself an Alawite, Haidar was part of the leftist opposition to the Assads and was imprisoned for more than a decade under their rule. Defense Ministry spokesperson Hassan Abdul Ghani said the security forces had 'reimposed control' over areas that had seen attacks by Assad loyalists. 'It is strictly forbidden to approach any home or attack anyone inside their homes,' he added in a video posted by SANA. Roads blocked Education Minister Nazir al-Qadri announced that schools would remain shut on Sunday and Monday in both Latakia and Tartus provinces due to the 'unstable security conditions.' SANA reported a power outage throughout Latakia province due to attacks on the grid by Assad loyalists. The killings followed clashes sparked by the arrest of a wanted suspect in a predominantly Alawite village, the Observatory reported. The monitor said there had been a 'relative return to calm' in the region on Saturday, as the security forces deployed reinforcements. A Defense Ministry source told SANA that troops had blocked roads leading to the coast to prevent 'violations,' without specifying who was committing them. Latakia province security director Mustafa Kneifati told the news agency: 'We will not allow for sedition or the targeting of any component of the Syrian people.' Sharaa's Islamist group Hayat Tahrir al-Sham (HTS), which led the lightning offensive that toppled Assad in December, has its roots in the Syrian branch of al-Qaida and remains proscribed as a terrorist organization by many governments including the United States. Since the rebel victory, it has moderated its rhetoric and vowed to protect Syria's religious and ethnic minorities. Fear of reprisals The Alawite heartland has been gripped by fear of reprisals for the Assad family's brutal rule, which included widespread torture and disappearances. Social media users have shared posts documenting the killing of Alawite friends and relatives. The Observatory, which relies on a network of sources in Syria, has reported multiple 'massacres' in recent days, with women and children among the dead. The Observatory and activists released footage showing dozens of bodies in civilian clothing piled outside a house, with bloodstains nearby and women wailing. Other videos appeared to show men in military garb shooting people at close range. AFP could not independently verify the images or accounts. The leaders of Syria's three main Christian churches as well as the spiritual leader of Syria's Druze minority issued statements calling for an end to the violence. Aron Lund of the Century International think tank said the violence was 'a bad omen.' The new government lacks the tools, incentives and local support base to engage with disgruntled Alawites, he said. 'All they have is repressive power, and a lot of that ... is made up of jihadist zealots who think Alawites are enemies of God.'	https://www.voanews.com/a/syria-president-calls-for-unity-after-reports-of-mass-killings/8004130.html	2025-03-09T01:53:32-08:00	
Trump administration ends Iraq's waiver to buy Iranian electricity	WASHINGTON — The Trump administration rescinded a waiver on Saturday that had allowed Iraq to pay Iran for electricity, as part of President Donald Trump's 'maximum pressure' campaign against Tehran, a State Department spokesperson said. The decision to let Iraq's waiver lapse upon its expiration 'ensures we do not allow Iran any degree of economic or financial relief,' the spokesperson said, adding that Trump's campaign on Iran aims 'to end its nuclear threat, curtail its ballistic missile program and stop it from supporting terrorist groups.' Trump restored 'maximum pressure' on Iran in one of his first acts after returning to office in January. In his first term, he pulled the U.S. out of the Iran nuclear deal, a multinational agreement to prevent Iran from developing nuclear weapons. The U.S. government has said it wants to isolate Iran from the global economy and eliminate its oil export revenues in order to slow Tehran's development of a nuclear weapon. Iran denies pursuing nuclear weapons and says its program is peaceful. For Iraq, the end of the waiver 'presents temporary operational challenges,' said Farhad Alaaeldin, foreign affairs adviser to Prime Minister Mohammed Shia al-Sudani. 'The government is actively working on alternatives to sustain electricity supply and mitigate any potential disruptions,' Alaaeldin told Reuters. 'Strengthening energy security remains a national priority, and efforts to enhance domestic production, improve grid efficiency and invest in new technologies will continue at full pace.' Washington has imposed a range of sanctions on Tehran over its nuclear program and support for terrorist organizations, effectively banning countries that do business with Iran from doing business with the U.S. 'President Trump has been clear that the Iranian Regime must cease its ambitions for a nuclear weapon or face Maximum Pressure,' said national security spokesperson James Hewitt. 'We hope the regime will put the interests of its people and the region ahead of its destabilizing policies.' Pressure on Baghdad Trump initially granted waivers to several buyers to meet consumer energy needs when he reimposed sanctions on Iran's energy exports in 2018, citing its nuclear program and what the U.S. calls its meddling in the Middle East. His administration and that of Joe Biden repeatedly renewed Iraq's waiver while urging Baghdad to reduce its dependence on Iranian electricity. The State Department spokesperson reiterated that call on Saturday. 'We urge the Iraqi government to eliminate its dependence on Iranian sources of energy as soon as possible,' the spokesperson said. 'Iran is an unreliable energy supplier.' The U.S. has used the waiver review in part to increase pressure on Baghdad to allow Kurdish crude oil exports via Turkey, sources have told Reuters. The aim is to boost supply to the global market and keep prices in check, giving the U.S. more room to pursue efforts to choke off Iranian oil exports. Iraq’s negotiations with the semiautonomous Kurdish region over the oil export resumption have been fraught so far. 'Iraq’s energy transition provides opportunities for U.S. companies, which are world-leading experts in increasing the productivity of power plants, improving electricity grids, and developing electricity interconnections with reliable partners,' the State Department spokesperson said. The spokesperson played down the impact of Iranian electricity imports on Iraq's power grid, saying, 'In 2023, electricity imports from Iran were only 4% of electricity consumption in Iraq.'	https://www.voanews.com/a/trump-administration-ends-iraq-s-waiver-to-buy-iranian-electricity/8004122.html	2025-03-09T01:13:44-08:00	
Pope rests as Vatican marks another Holy Year event without him	ROME — Pope Francis continued his recovery from double pneumonia Sunday after doctors reported some positive news: After more than three weeks in the hospital, the 88-year-old pope is responding well to treatment and has shown a 'gradual, slight improvement' in recent days. In the early Sunday update, the Vatican said Francis was resting after a quiet night. For the fourth Sunday in a row, the pope will not appear for his weekly noon blessing, though the Vatican planned to distribute the text he would have delivered if he were well enough. The Argentine pope, who has chronic lung disease and had part of one lung removed as a young man, has remained stable, with no fever and good oxygen levels in his blood for several days, doctors reported in a Vatican statement Saturday. The doctors said that such stability 'as a consequence testifies to a good response to therapy.' It was the first time the doctors had reported that Francis was responding positively to the treatment for the complex lung infection that was diagnosed after he was hospitalized on Feb. 14. But they kept his prognosis as 'guarded,' meaning he's not out of danger. In his absence, the Vatican’s day-to-day operations continued alongside celebrations of its Holy Year, the once-every-quarter-century Jubilee that brings millions of pilgrims to Rome. On Sunday, Canadian Cardinal Michael Czerny, who is close to Francis, celebrates the Holy Year Mass for volunteers that Francis was supposed to have celebrated. Francis has been using high flows of supplemental oxygen to help him breathe during the day and a noninvasive mechanical ventilation mask at night. Francis was hospitalized Feb. 14 for what was then just a bad case of bronchitis. The infection progressed into a complex respiratory tract infection and double pneumonia that has sidelined Francis for the longest period of his 12-year papacy and raised questions about the future.	https://www.voanews.com/a/pope-rests-as-vatican-marks-another-holy-year-event-without-him-/8004119.html	2025-03-09T01:02:24-08:00	
China says it will tighten 'noose' around Taiwan if separatism escalates	BEIJING — China's military vowed Sunday to tighten its 'noose' around Taiwan if separatism on the island escalated, warning independence proponents to step back from the 'precipice.' Beijing considers the self-ruled island of Taiwan to be part of its territory and has not ruled out using military force to claim it. China has increased pressure on Taiwan's authorities in recent years with military drills and frequent dispatches of fighter jets and naval vessels around the island. 'The more rampant 'Taiwan independence' separatists become, the tighter the noose around their necks and the sharper the sword hanging over their heads will be,' army spokesperson Wu Qian said in an interview published by state broadcaster CCTV. 'The PLA is a force of action in countering separatism and promoting reunification,' said Wu, using an acronym for China's military. 'You've ridden your steed to a precipice of a cliff, but behind you lies land -- if you persist in taking the wrong course, you will meet a dead end,' he warned. The comments, made during China's 'Two Sessions' annual political gathering, come days after Beijing announced a 7.2% increase to its defense budget in 2025. The increase, the same percentage as in 2024, will drive the rapid modernization of China's armed forces as strategic competition with the United States intensifies. It is above the government's annual gross domestic product growth target of around 5%. Calling the increase 'limited ... reasonable and stable,' Wu said the extra cash would be used to develop 'combat forces in new fields and with new qualities,' and to enhance reconnaissance, joint strike and battlefield support capabilities. Second to the US China's military spending has been on the rise for decades, broadly in line with economic growth. The country has the world's second-largest defense budget, but lags well behind the United States, its primary strategic rival. Beijing's $245.7 billion budget for this year is still less than a third of Washington's. Military spending last year made up 1.6% of its GDP, far less than the United States or Russia, according to the Stockholm International Peace Research Institute. But its defense expansion is viewed with suspicion by Washington, as well as other powers in the region. China has increasingly flexed its muscles in the region, including in the South China Sea, which it claims almost entirely despite an international arbitration ruling that declared its stance baseless. China describes its military stance as 'defensive' and aimed at preserving its sovereignty. China faces 'one of the most complex neighboring security situations in the world,' army spokesperson Wu said, adding that it had to deal with 'severe challenges' in defending its sovereignty and territorial integrity. But its sweeping territorial claims over areas controlled by other governments have raised fears of a regional clash. Taiwan is a potential flashpoint for a war between China and the United States, which is the island's most important backer and biggest arms supplier. On Friday, China's Foreign Minister Wang Yi told a news conference that Taiwan coming under China's control was the 'shared hope of all Chinese people, the general trend of the time, and a righteous cause.' 'Using Taiwan to control China is just like trying to stop a car with the arm of a mantis,' he said. Last month, Taiwan's Ministry of Defense condemned China for holding 'live-fire' exercises to the island's south. Beijing defended the drills as 'routine.'	https://www.voanews.com/a/china-says-it-will-tighten-noose-around-taiwan-if-separatism-escalates/8004116.html	2025-03-09T00:47:46-08:00

Wild ancient version of football is still being played today	ASHBOURNE, ENGLAND — This ancient form of football has a rule forbidding players from murdering each other. Every year, thousands of people descend on a small town in the English countryside to watch a two-day game of mass street football that, to the casual observer, could easily be mistaken for a riot. This is Royal Shrovetide — a centuries-old ball game played in Ashbourne, Derbyshire, that, frankly, looks nothing like the world's most popular sport. Or any other game for that matter. 'It's like tug of war without the rope,' says Natalie Wakefield, 43, who lives locally and has marshaled the event in the past. 'It's mad in the best possible way.' Hundreds of players Played between two teams of hundreds of players, the aim is to 'goal' at either end of a 5-kilometer sector that could take the match through rivers, hedgerows, high streets and just about anything or anywhere except for churchyards, cemeteries and places of worship. The ball is thrown into a crowd that moves like a giant herd, as each team tries to carry it toward their desired goal. Rules are limited but 'no murder' was an early stipulation for the game that dates back to at least the 1600s. Good players need to be 'hard, aggressive and authoritative,' says Mark Harrison, who 'goaled' in 1986 and is one of multiple generations of scorers in his family. 'You can't practice,' the 62-year-old Harrison adds. He stopped competing seven years ago and now serves up burgers to throngs of spectators from a street food truck. 'You've just got to get in there and be rough. I am a rugby player ... I'm also an ex-boxer so that helps.' Royal approval Harrison had the honor of carrying the then-Prince Charles on his shoulder when in 2003 the now-King of England opened that year's game. 'He loved it!' Harrison says. Played over Shrove Tuesday and Ash Wednesday each year, the event is a source of immense pride for the people of Ashbourne in Derbyshire's Peak District. Yet, such a unifying tradition is actually based upon splitting the town into two halves between the 'Up'ards' and the 'Down'ards,' determined by whether players are born on the north or south of the River Henmore. Don't park there On any other days, Ashbourne, around a three-hour drive from London, is quiet and picturesque with a high street lined by antique shops, cafes and traditional pubs. Visitors include hikers, cyclists and campers. For two days that all changes. Large timber boardings are nailed up to protect shop fronts. Doorways are barricaded. 'Play Zone' signs are strapped to lampposts, warning motorists not to park there for fear of damage to vehicles, which can be shoved out of the way by the force of the hoards of players trying to move the ball. In contrast, colorful bunting is strewn high above from building to building and revelers congregate, eating and drinking as if it is a street party. Parents with babies in strollers watch on from a safe distance. School holidays in the area have long since been moved to coincide with the festival. 'There are people who come and they have a drink and they're just like, 'This is a bit of a crazy thing and it's a spectacle, and now I've seen it, box ticked off,'' says Wakefield, who also used to report on Royal Shrovetide for the local newspaper. 'And there are people who are absolutely enthralled by it all, and they get the beauty and complexity of the game and those people follow it year on year.' Where's the ball? Play begins with an opening ceremony in a car park, no less, in the center of town. The national anthem and Auld Lang Syne are sung. Competitors are reminded, 'You play the game at your own risk.' A leather ball, the size of a large pumpkin, filled with cork and ornately painted, is thrown into what is called a 'hug' of players. And they're off. As a spectator sport, it can be confusing. There can be little to see for long periods during the eight hours of play each day from 2 p.m. local time. Players wear their own clothes — such as random football or rugby jerseys — rather than matching uniforms. On Tuesday, it took more than 45 minutes to move the ball out of the car park. Onlookers stand on bins, walls and park benches, craning their necks to look down alleyways to try to get a better view. 'Can you see the ball?' someone will ask. The answer is often 'No.' One person thinks it might be in line with a tree over to the right of the car park, but can't be sure. Later that day there had been no sight of the ball for almost two hours until rumors started to circulate that the Down'ards scored what turned out to be the only goal over the two days of play for a 1-0 victory. Deception and cunning With so many players, the hug can be difficult to maneuver but gathers pace quickly, prompting crowds of spectators who'd previously been trying to get a closer look to suddenly run away from the action. The ball can be handled and kicked. Play can be frantic, with players racing after a loose ball wherever it may take them, diving into the river and up and out the other side. While strength is needed in the hug, speed is required from runners if the ball breaks free. Royal Shrovetide, however, can be as much about deception and cunning as speed and strength, it seems. 'There's a bit of strategy involved in that somebody's pretending they've still got the ball in the middle of the hug,' Wakefield says. 'And they're quietly passing it back out to the edge to get it to a runner who has to sneak away in a kind of, I imagine, very nonchalant manner and then leg it down an alleyway.' A famous goal in 2019 came as a result of the hug not realizing it didn't have the ball until it was too late. Hidden by two schoolboys standing meters away, the ball was passed to a player who ran, largely unimpeded, for 2 1/2 kilometers before scoring. A ball is goaled when it is hit three times against one of the millstones at either end of the town in Clifton or Sturston. The beautiful game Scorers have likened the achievement to winning Olympic gold. They are carried on shoulders, paraded through the town and celebrated like heroes. 'If you can imagine playing for Manchester United in their heyday and they're at Wembley in a cup final. You score the winner. You're there,' Harrison says. Scorers also get to keep the balls, which are repainted and become treasured family possessions. It is the game, however, that is treasured most of all. 'I just live and breathe it,' says Janet Richardson, 75, from Ashbourne, who has been going to Royal Shrovetide since she was a 1-year-old. 'I can't sleep because I'm excited. It's so lovely to think that all these people still want to come here and watch this beautiful game that we've got in our town.'	https://www.voanews.com/a/wild-ancient-version-of-football-is-still-being-played-today/8003407.html	2025-03-08T22:43:54-08:00

Women's rights advocates warn UN to confront backlash against progress	UNITED NATIONS — Female activists raised their voices at the United Nations on Friday as they marked International Women's Day amid a global trend of backsliding on hard-won rights. 'International Women's Day is a powerful moment, and this year, more than ever, the call of gender equality has never been more urgent, nor the obstacles in our way more apparent, but our determination has never been more unshakable,' said Sima Bahous, executive director of U.N. Women. Bahous called on women everywhere to confront the backlash, emphasizing that their movement is powerful and growing. 'Equality is not to be feared, but instead to be embraced,' she said. 'Because an equal world is a better world.' Women in all parts of the world are facing challenges to their reproductive rights, personal safety, education, equal pay and political participation. This year marks the 30th anniversary of a women's conference in Beijing that recognized women's rights as human rights, producing an action platform that has helped drive policy and progress. The United Nations says more girls are in school and more women hold positions of power today than before, but they still face violence, discrimination and financial inequality. 'We cannot stand by as progress is reversed,' U.N. Secretary-General Antonio Guterres told the gathering. 'We must fight back.' At the current pace, he said, eradicating extreme poverty for women and girls will take 130 years. 'The fight for gender equality is not just about fairness,' Guterres emphasized. 'It is about power — who gets a seat at the table and who is locked out.' U.N. goodwill ambassador for Africa Jaha Dukureh endured female genital mutilation (FGM) as an infant. At age 15, she was forced into marriage with a much older man in her homeland, Gambia. Her organization, Safe Hands for Girls, works to end the practice of FGM and address the physical and psychological toll on its victims. Dukureh told the gathering that governments have a duty to invest in social protection and education for women and girls. 'For all women and girls, economic independence is the foundation of freedom,' she said. 'A woman who can provide for herself can make choices. A girl who has an education can build her own future.' Commission on the Status of Women On Monday, hundreds of women's advocates and activists will descend upon U.N. headquarters to hold their annual meeting known as the Commission on the Status of Women (CSW). The 10-day gathering is dedicated to the promotion of gender equality and the rights and empowerment of women. Sarah Hendriks, director of policy for U.N. Women, told reporters on Thursday that anti-women's rights actors are increasingly well-funded and coordinated. 'Where they cannot roll back legal or policy gains altogether, they seek to either block or slow down their implementation,' she said. Thirty years after Beijing, Hendriks said, progress is still too slow, too fragile, too uneven and not guaranteed. She said U.N. Women is proposing an action agenda to accelerate progress on the sustainable development goals, of which goal number five focuses on achieving gender equality. 'It is our ambition that 2025 will be remembered as a pivotal year,' she said. 'That it will be remembered as a year that history looks back and says, 'This was the year that we refused to back down, that we held ground, that we refused to step back, that we indeed actually stood our ground.'' CSW is expected to approve a political declaration by consensus on the first day. Negotiations on the document have been going on for about two weeks. But how strong it will be and what will be missing from it — for instance, reproductive rights — remains to be seen.	https://www.voanews.com/a/women-s-rights-advocates-warn-un-to-confront-backlash-against-progress-/8003103.html	2025-03-08T22:39:36-08:00	
Daughters scale Argentine peak, retrieve dead mountaineer dad's photos	MENDOZA, ARGENTINA — Two daughters of an Argentine mountaineer who died on an icy peak 40 years ago, have retrieved his backpack from the spot -- finding camera film inside that allowed them a glimpse of some of his final experiences. Guillermo Vieiro was 44 when he died in 1985 while descending Argentina's Tupungato lava dome, one of the highest peaks in the Americas. Then last year, his backpack was spotted on a slope by mountaineer Gabriela Cavallaro, who examined it and contacted Vieiro's daughters Guadalupe, 40, and Azul, 44. In February this year, the three set out with four other guides and two filmmakers on an 11-day journey to recover the bag from an altitude of about 6,100 meters -- close to the summit of the 6,600-meter volcanic peak. 'In my family, the word 'mountain' was always forbidden. My mother wants nothing to do with the discovery of this backpack. It's a family that has been broken by grief, by the void,' Azul, who was just 4 years old when her father died, told AFP. 'It all seemed crazy to me, and I didn't want to go back to the volcano where he had died. But as the months went by ... I started to loosen up, and began thinking: 'Why not?'' Inside the backpack, the women found a jacket, a sleeping bag, a water bottle, aspirin, vitamin C tablets, a set of knives and two rolls of film that had belonged to their father. 'Spiritually, it felt like a greeting, like: 'I'm still here, I exist. You're not alone,'' Azul recounted. Mountaineering history The experience also allowed her to learn more about a man she never got a chance to know. 'My mother never really told us who he was. We knew he had died in the mountains and that he was a mountaineer, but not much more than that. So, it was like rediscovering his story, like saying, wait ... we have a father who had a life, a history. So it was like discovering him all over again.' Photos taken from other film found inside the same backpack by Cavallaro a year earlier, showed that Vieiro and his partner Leonardo Rabal, 20, had been the first climbers to reach the top of Tupungato from its eastern side -- the most challenging route. 'That slope has never been scaled again,' Cavallaro, who lives at the foot of Tupungato in the city of the same name, told AFP. 'What they (Vieiro and Rabal) accomplished has real historical value in Argentine and international mountaineering,' she added. The bodies of Vieiro and Rabal were recovered shortly after they died. Azul and her sister said they would donate their father's belongings in an attempt to share a 'piece of Argentine mountaineering history' with others.	https://www.voanews.com/a/daughters-scale-argentine-peak-retrieve-dead-mountaineer-dad-s-photos/8002068.html	2025-03-08T22:38:59-08:00	
Drop the US penny? Hold on, souvenir sellers say	new york — President Donald Trump talks of big change in his second term of office. But he's not forgetting small change, either. Trump said on Feb. 10 via his social media account that the Treasury Department should stop making pennies. For years, critics of the penny have pointed out that putting a copper-coated zinc disc in your pocket costs the government more than a cent — almost 4 cents today. Will Trump's order make the penny disappear? There is no sign that the U.S. Mint will stop pressing pennies in Denver and Philadelphia, and Mint officials did not respond to requests for clarification this week. But the presidential penny pledge is already being felt in a little-known part of the business world that depends on buying pennies wholesale, loading them into machines at fairs or entertainment venues, and luring customers to pay to have the coins stamped with designs — Paw Patrol, for instance, or Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles — as they are stretched between metal rollers. Groups of collectors and craftsmen have developed around these souvenirs. Without the penny, the whole enterprise faces an uncertain future. The last pennies? New copper pennies vanished from circulation in 1982 — 73 years after the first Lincoln penny was minted. They were replaced by coins of mostly zinc thinly coated with copper. The solid copper old ones were more pliable and easier to stamp, making them hot items for kids at fairs. When pressed and elongated, the older pennies maintain 'a ghost image of the printed head of Lincoln,' said Brian Peters, general manager of Minnesota-based Penny Press Machine Co. Jeweler Angelo Rosato worked in the 1960s and '70s hand-printing pennies with images of New Milford, Conn., as well as historical and sentimental scenes. Everything was obsessively cataloged, including more than 4,000 penny photographs. 'We're big fans of the penny. Keep the penny,' said Aaron Zablow of Roseland, N.J., who was with two of his sons on a recent day at the American Dream Mall. 'I like the pennies,' his son Mason, 9, said. Critics say the rise of electronic commerce and the billions of pennies in circulation mean the U.S. could stop printing the copper coins tomorrow and see little widespread effect for decades. But some people are watching fearfully to see if Trump's public critique of the penny will affect their businesses. Alan Fleming, of Scotland, is the owner of Penny Press Factory, one of a number of companies around the world that manufacture machines that flatten and stamp coins. 'A lovely retired gentleman in Boston sold me over 100,000 uncirculated cents a couple of years ago, but he doesn't have any more,' Fleming wrote. 'I will need to purchase new uncirculated cents within the next 12 months to keep my machines supplied and working.' Regardless of what happens to niche businesses like Fleming's, penny defenders say they're an important tool for lubricating the economy even if they're a money-losing proposition. Small change Since the invention of money, humankind has wrangled with the question of small change, how to denominate amounts so small that the metal coin itself is actually worth more. In 2003, Thomas J. Sargent and another economist wrote The Big Problem of Small Change, billed as 'the first credible and analytically sound explanation' of why governments had a hard time maintaining a steady supply of small change because of the high costs of production. But in a digital world with the line blurring between the real and the virtual, tactile coins have been reassuring. 'What this all tells you about the United States as a country is that it's an incredibly conservative country when it comes to money,' said Ute Wartenberg, executive director of the American Numismatic Society. Pennies, nickels, dimes and quarters are sometimes designed by artists laser-sculpting tiny portraits of leaders and landmarks using special software. 'It's pretty cool because when I tell people what I do, I just say my initials are on the penny,' Joseph Menna, the 14th chief engraver of the U.S. Mint, said in the 2019 film 'Heads-Up: Will We Stop Making Cents?' Fleming is hoping some lobbying may help: 'Maybe we should take a trip to Washington and ask to speak to President Trump and [Trump adviser] Elon Musk and see if we can cut a deal on buying millions of pennies from them.'	https://www.voanews.com/a/drop-the-penny-hold-on-souvenir-sellers-say/8002027.html	2025-03-08T22:38:17-08:00

13 die in Argentina after 1 year's worth of rain falls in 8 hours	BUENOS AIRES, ARGENTINA — Argentina's port city of Bahia Blanca has been 'destroyed' after being pummeled by a year's worth of rain in a matter of hours, killing 13 and driving hundreds from their homes, authorities said Saturday. Two young girls — who local media said are aged four and one — were missing after possibly being swept away by floodwaters from Friday's storm. The deluge left hospital rooms underwater, turned neighborhoods into islands, and cut electricity to swaths of the city. National Security Minister Patricia Bullrich said Bahia Blanca was 'destroyed.' The death toll rose to 13 Saturday, up from 10 on Friday, authorities said. The mayor's office said more casualties were possible in this city of 350,000 residents, located 600 kilometers (370 miles) southwest of the capital Buenos Aires. The missing girls 'may have been carried away by the water,' Bullrich told Radio Mitre. At least five of the victims died on flooded roadways, possibly after being trapped in their cars by fast-rising water. The storm forced the evacuation of Jose Penna hospital, with news footage and video shared on social media showing nurses and other medical staff carrying babies to safety. They were later assisted by the army. The downpour, which began Friday morning, dumped more than 400 millimeters (15.7 inches) of rain in the area in just eight hours, 'practically what Bahia Blanca gets in an entire year,' provincial security minister Javier Alonso said. 'This is unprecedented,' he said. Scenes of desolation Local media showed images of flooded shops and reported overnight looting. The government has authorized emergency reconstruction aid of $9.2 million. The storm left much of the surrounding coastal area without power. At one point, city officials in Bahia Blanco suspended electricity due to the huge amount of water in the streets. The number of evacuees on Saturday stood at 850, down from a peak of 1,321, according to the mayor's office. Bahia Blanca has suffered past weather-related disasters, including a 2023 storm that claimed 13 lives, caused houses to collapse, and provoked widespread infrastructure damage.

Wind-driven brush fire in New York 50% contained	NEW YORK — Fast-moving brush fires burned through a large swath of land on New York's Long Island on Saturday fanned by high winds, spewing gray smoke and prompting the evacuation of a military base and the closure of a major highway. Officials said three of the four fires were fully contained while the other one, in Westhampton, was 50% contained. Two commercial buildings were partially burned, but officials said homes were not in the line of fire. One firefighter was flown to a hospital to be treated for burns to the face. 'Our biggest problem is the wind,' Suffolk County Executive Ed Romaine said. 'It is driving this fire.' New York Governor Kathy Hochul declared a state of emergency and said state agencies were responding to the fires around the Pine Barrens, a wooded area that is home to commuter towns east of New York City. 'This is still out of control at this moment,' Hochul told Long Island TV station News 12. 'We're seeing people having to be evacuated from the Westhampton area,' she said, adding that more evacuations may be needed. Hochul said homes, a chemical factory and an Amazon warehouse were at risk. Videos posted to social media showed flames shooting into the air and columns of black smoke rising above roads. Air National Guard helicopters dropped water on the flames. The Town of Southampton issued a warning in the afternoon against starting recreational fires due to the wildfire risk. That came around the time that the videos began appearing. In a statement, Hochul said the National Guard was providing support by helicopter and working with local law enforcement. 'Public safety is my top priority, and I'm committed to doing everything possible to keep Long Islanders safe,' she said. In her comments to News 12, Hochul declined to estimate the extent of the flames, saying only that they were growing rapidly. Rough satellite data indicated that fire and smoke stretched roughly 3 kilometers (2.5 miles) along Sunrise Highway, according to NASA's Fire Information for Resource Management System. Police closed a section of the highway, which is a thoroughfare to the East End of Long Island. The fires raged near the Francis S. Gabreski Airport, from which the National Guard launched at least one helicopter. One of the commercial buildings that partially burned was near the airport. Personnel at the base evacuated as a precautionary measure starting around 1:45 p.m., spokesman Cheran Cambell said in a statement.	https://www.voanews.com/a/wind-driven-brush-fire-in-new-york-50-contained-/8004069.html	2025-03-08T18:18:33-08:00	
Somali activists mark International Women's Day with eye toward future	WASHINGTON — As the world commemorates International Women's Day, the stories of courageous women like Zahra Mohamed Ahmad highlight their resilience amid ongoing conflict and struggles for equality. From advocating for human rights to supporting their communities, these women continue to shape the future of Somalia. Somali human rights defender Zahra Mohamed Ahmad is one of an extraordinary group of women who made sacrifices for her country. She fled from the country, following the 1991 collapse of the central government of Somalia. Mama Zahra, as she is affectionately known, returned to Somalia in 2000 and has fought since then for 'justice, equality, and Somali unity.' Her biggest loss, she said, came when her only son was killed by unknown men who stopped him as he was walking along one of the streets of Mogadishu. Despite that tragedy, she and her colleagues at the organization she founded, the Somali Women Development Center (SWDC), continue to support the voiceless and marginalized. In 2021, the U.S. State Department recognized her exceptional bravery in defending the rights of the most vulnerable and awarded her the International Women of Courage Award. This year, Ahmed was among several Somali women who shared their feelings with VOA Somali to commemorate International Women's Day. 'The gloomy ugly days that followed the ouster of the former Siad Barre regime, the days our children were dying for starvation and famine, the days mothers, children, and the old people dying on the streets fleeing from their homes, are still fresh in my memory,' Ahmed said. 'And every year March 8 reminds many Somali women of the plight conditions they have gone through, in which many of them still live,' said Ahmad. Duniyo Mohamed Ali, a Somali woman activist in Mogadishu, remembers the role of Somali women for the survival of family in a nation devastated by civil war. 'After the civil war broke out in 1991, the Somali women were the saviors of their families. They built schools and smaller clinics; mediated peace talks between clans; and became entrepreneurs to get bread on the tables of their families,' Ali said. In the country's northeastern state of Puntland, women turned their celebration for Women's Day this year into campaigns of preparing food for Puntland security forces, who are at the front lines fighting with Islamic State terrorists. The chairperson of the Bari Region Women's Organization, Kafi Ali Jire, said they could not celebrate the day with music and events because of the ongoing Puntland war with ISIS. 'Many women are mourning for the deaths of their husbands in the battle; others are sad because their husbands were injured, and many others whose husbands, sons and brothers are on the front lines are worrying about the safety of their loved ones, so instead of celebrating with colored events, [annual celebrations of the day that used to be held with arts, food and politicians], we have decided to dedicate the day to support our brave soldiers,' said Jire. In politics, as it has been the case for years, Somali women do not have much to celebrate this International Women's Day because they are still struggling to reach a 30% quota set for women lawmakers in the country and other decision-making political offices. 'As of today, female candidates have secured only half the needed seats to reach the quota,' said Lul Mohamed Sheikh, a women's rights activist in Mogadishu who has a doctorate. 'Our dream was that each community with three or more seats should have allocated one seat for the women. It sadly did not happen.' Sheikh said the social and cultural norms that prevented women from getting constitutionally allocated seats are still in place. 'Clan elders, who play a key role in selecting potential lawmakers, have been blocking women from seeking office,' she said. 'Other challenges include that the country's leaders do not nominate a good number of women into the top political offices and lack of unity among women,' Sheikh added. Out of the 275 seats for Somalia's Lower House, clans have so far selected only 52 women. As Somalia's women continue to navigate the challenges posed by conflict and societal norms, their stories of resilience and determination serve as a powerful reminder of their essential role in shaping the nation's future. Humanitarian crisis This year International Women's Day comes as Somali women suffer from displacement caused by the ongoing war against al-Shabab and Islamic State in the country's Northeast and Central regions. Somalia, an aid-dependent nation that averted famine in 2022 through increased humanitarian assistance, is now witnessing a resurgence of food insecurity. Currently, 3.4 million people are acutely food insecure, and this number is projected to rise to 4.4 million between April and June — nearly a quarter of the population, Somali officials and the United Nation's humanitarian agencies said this week. The World Food Program (WFP) estimates that approximately 1.7 million children under the age of five require immediate support, with 466,000 likely to be severely acutely malnourished and at risk of death this year. 'We have learned in Somalia from past experience that delays can be deadly, and we need resources to provide support to these very vulnerable groups,' said WFP spokesperson Jean-Martin Bauer from Rome. He urged donors and partners to increase funding for the country of 19 million people as it faces this escalating crisis.

Colombian guerillas release 29 hostages: AFP	EL PLATEADO, COLOMBIA — Twenty-eight police officers and one soldier held hostage in southwest Colombia were released Saturday, according to an Agence France-Presse team on the ground. At around noon Saturday, residents of the community of La Hacienda in the department of Cauca told the detainees they were free to go. The men, held since Thursday, collected their riot gear and left along a dirt road, escorted by residents, AFP saw. They headed toward the nearby town of El Plateado, where a commission from the state Ombudsman's Office was waiting for them. Upon arriving at El Plateado, the caravan stopped at a gas station where United Nations officials and a group of about 20 soldiers were stationed. The 29 men were detained Thursday after a day of clashes between residents and security forces, part of a government military operation aimed at ending drug-related violence in a region with one of the highest concentrations of coca crops in Colombia. The government said the officers were being held by a dissident FARC guerrilla group, the Estado Mayor Central (EMC), for whom the Canon del Micay region is a stronghold. As he left La Hacienda, Major Nilson Bedoya, the soldier in the group, said that throughout the ordeal he could not help but think of his family. 'My family, my wife, my son, who are waiting for me at home,' he said, in a pained voice, as he carried his gear on his shoulder. Legitimate force? In an interview with W Radio earlier Saturday, Defense Minister Pedro Sanchez threatened to use 'the legitimate force of the state' to have the troops released. Sanchez and other representatives of the leftist government of President Gustavo Petro were to meet with residents of the departmental capital, Popayan, to listen to local concerns. Officials said that guerillas and members of the public confronted and overwhelmed security services Thursday who were trying to reestablish state control in two municipalities. Government images showed gangs pelting a flaming armored vehicle with rocks, and riot police detonating smoke grenades amid a running gun battle. 'Stiven was set on fire alive,' said one of the men who was detained, referring to a colleague who had to jump into a pool of water to save himself. Petro accused the EMC of 'using the civilian population' to attack troops. The kidnappings were a major embarrassment — and a stern challenge — for Colombia's government, which is struggling with its worst unrest in a decade involving spasms of violence in several parts of the country. Since October, Bogota has been trying to retake control of parts of Cauca from the EMC. Petro's government is proposing an ambitious crop substitution program to combat the drug trafficking economy, a strategy that locals have denounced as a campaign of 'forced eradication' of coca crops. 'There is not going to be eradication of crops by force,' said Interior Minister Armando Benedetti, accusing cartels of trying to deceive the local population. 'We will continue to work for these lands so that people can have a better future,' said Bedoya, the soldier. 'The peasants were sold the idea that we are their enemies, but we are their best allies.'	https://www.voanews.com/a/colombian-guerillas-release-29-hostages-afp-/8004054.html	2025-03-08T17:01:12-08:00	
Israel says it will send delegation to Qatar for ceasefire talks	DEIR AL-BALAH, GAZA STRIP — Israel said it would send a delegation to Qatar on Monday 'in an effort to advance the negotiations' around the ceasefire in Gaza, while Hamas, a U.S.-designated terrorist organization, reported 'positive signals' in talks with Egyptian and Qatari mediators on starting negotiations on the truce's delayed second phase. The statement from Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's office gave no details except to say it had 'accepted the invitation of U.S.-backed mediators.' Hamas spokesperson Abdel-Latif al-Qanoua also gave no details. Talks on the second phase should have started a month ago. There was no immediate comment from the White House, which made the surprise confirmation Wednesday of direct U.S. talks with Hamas. Over the past week, Israel has pressed Hamas to release half of the remaining hostages in return for an extension of the first phase, which ended last weekend, and a promise to negotiate a lasting truce. Hamas is believed to have 24 living hostages and the bodies of 34 others. Israel last weekend cut off all supplies to Gaza and its more than 2 million people as it pressed Hamas to agree. Hamas has said that the move would affect the remaining hostages as well. The ceasefire has paused the deadliest and most destructive fighting ever between Israel and Hamas, sparked by the Hamas-led terrorist attack on southern Israel on Oct. 7, 2023. The first phase allowed the return of 25 living hostages and the remains of eight others in exchange for the release of nearly 2,000 Palestinian prisoners. Israeli forces have withdrawn to buffer zones inside Gaza, hundreds of thousands of displaced Palestinians have returned to northern Gaza for the first time since early in the war, and hundreds of trucks of aid entered per day until Israel suspended supplies. Before their weekly rally in Tel Aviv, relatives of hostages appealed to U.S. President Donald Trump, who met with eight former hostages Wednesday. 'Mr. President, a return to war means a death sentence for the living hostages left behind. Please, sir, do not allow Netanyahu to sacrifice them.' Muslim countries reject moving Palestinians Foreign ministers from Muslim nations rejected Trump's calls to empty the Gaza Strip of its Palestinian population Saturday and backed a plan for an administrative committee to govern the territory to allow reconstruction to proceed. The foreign ministers gathered in Saudi Arabia for a special session of the Organization of Islamic Cooperation to address the situation in Gaza. The OIC has 57 nations with largely Muslim populations. They supported a plan to rebuild Gaza put forward by Egypt and backed by Arab states, including Saudi Arabia and Jordan. Without mentioning Trump, the ministers' statement said that they rejected 'plans aimed at displacing the Palestinian people individually or collectively … as ethnic cleansing, a grave violation of international law and a crime against humanity.' They also condemned 'policies of starvation' they said aim to push Palestinians to leave, a reference to Israel's cutting off all supplies to Gaza. Trump has called for Gaza's population to be resettled elsewhere permanently, so that the United States can take over the territory and develop it for others. Palestinians have rejected calls to leave. The ministers at the OIC gathering supported a proposal that an administrative committee replace Hamas in governing Gaza. The committee would work 'under the umbrella' of the Palestinian Authority, based in the occupied West Bank. Israel has rejected the PA having any role in Gaza but hasn't put forward an alternative for postwar rule. The foreign ministers of France, Germany, Italy and the United Kingdom said in a joint statement that they welcome the Arab initiative for a Gaza reconstruction plan, calling it 'a realistic path.' They added that 'Hamas must neither govern Gaza nor be a threat to Israel anymore,' and they support the central role for the PA. Israeli strikes continue Early Saturday, an Israeli strike killed two Palestinians in the southernmost city of Rafah, the Health Ministry there said. The Israeli military said that it struck several men who appeared to be flying a drone that entered Israel. Israel's military offensive has killed more than 48,000 Palestinians in Gaza, mostly women and children, according to Gaza's Health Ministry, which doesn't say how many of the dead were fighters. Israel says about 18,000 were Hamas terrorists. Hamas' attack in October 2023 killed around 1,200 people, mostly civilians, inside Israel and took 251 people hostage. Most have been released in ceasefire agreements or other arrangements.	https://www.voanews.com/a/israel-says-it-will-send-delegation-to-qatar-for-ceasefire-talks/8003881.html	2025-03-08T16:19:11-08:00

Russia claims advances in Kursk; Zelenskyy says he's 'committed' to talks	KYIV, UKRAINE — Russia said Saturday its troops had retaken three villages seized by Ukraine in its Kursk border region, in a fresh setback for Kyiv ahead of talks to try to end the war. Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy on Saturday named a high-level delegation including ministers to meet U.S. negotiators in Saudi Arabia on Tuesday, seeking to repair ties with U.S. President Donald Trump's administration. U.S. envoy Steve Witkoff said Thursday that Washington wanted to discuss a 'framework for a peace agreement.' 'We hope to discuss and agree on the necessary decisions and steps,' Zelenskyy said, stressing that Ukraine was 'fully committed to constructive dialogue.' But he condemned the 'brutal' deadly strikes on eastern Ukraine, saying they proved that Russia was 'not thinking about how to end the war.' Trump on Friday threatened new sanctions and tariffs against Russia over its bombardment of Ukraine. The three-year-long war is now at a critical juncture for Kyiv after Trump suspended U.S. military aid following his public falling-out with Zelenskyy last week. Ukraine still controls some 400-square kilometers in the Kursk region after launching an offensive last August. Zelenskyy sees this as a possible bargaining chip in peace talks. But Ukraine's troops in Kursk have seen their position worsen in recent weeks with Russia's army pushing back. Russia claims gains Russia's defense ministry announced Saturday the recapture of three more villages: Viktorovka, Nikolaevka and Staraya Sorochina. According to DeepState, an online military tracker linked to the Ukrainian army, the Russian move followed a 'breach' in the Ukrainian defense lines near the town of Sudzha, which is under Kyiv's control. The advance appears to have cut off the logistics route needed by Ukraine to supply its troops, although Kyiv has not confirmed this. Russia has already taken back some two-thirds of the territory in Kursk initially seized by Ukraine. The Ukrainian military General Staff said Saturday that clashes were ongoing amid heavy bombardment with artillery and guided aerial bombs. Small groups of Russian troops have also mounted attacks in recent weeks into Ukraine's Sumy region bordering Kursk. But Ukraine's Center for Countering Disinformation denied reports Saturday of a 'massive breakthrough,' saying its forces were destroying small groups trying to cross. Meeting in Saudi Arabia Full peace negotiations remain a distant prospect, with Kyiv and Moscow making starkly opposed demands. Trump has made settling the conflict a priority since his return to the White House. But by reaching out to Russian President Vladimir Putin while criticizing Zelenskyy, he has raised fears in Kyiv — and among its European allies — that Trump may try to force Ukraine to accept a settlement that favors Russia. Senior U.S. and Ukrainian officials are set to meet for talks on the war in Saudi Arabia on Tuesday. Zelenskyy also will visit Monday for talks with Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman. For the U.S., Witkoff has said he wants to discuss an 'initial ceasefire' with Russia and a 'framework' for a longer agreement. Zelenskyy said Ukraine would be represented by officials including foreign minister Andriy Sybiha and Defense Minister Rustem Umerov. In his evening address, he told Ukrainians he was 'confident that the meeting will be productive.' Zelenskyy also urged allies to 'increase sanctions against Russia' after heavy overnight bombardment in the east and northeast. A Russian barrage hit the center of Dobropillya in the eastern Donetsk region late Friday, killing 11 people and wounding 40, according to the emergency services. 'Russia is proving literally every day with its cruelty that nothing has changed for them,' Zelenskyy said. He accused Moscow of wanting to 'destroy and capture more as long as the world allows them to wage this war.' On Saturday, a strike on the embattled city of Pokrovsk killed a man in his 40s and wounded 2 others, and at least 10 people were killed in multiple strikes on Ukraine's embattled eastern Donetsk region, the Donetsk Governor Vadym Filashkin said. He added that seven others were killed in multiple drone and missile strikes in towns close to the front lines. Three people died when a Russian drone hit a workshop in the northeastern Kharkiv region, the head of its military administration, Oleh Syniehubov, said. And one additional man was killed by shelling in the region. More bombs The latest strikes came after EU leaders, shaken by the prospect of U.S. disengagement, agreed to boost the bloc's defenses. Putin 'has no interest in peace,' the European Union's foreign policy chief Kaja Kallas said Saturday, reacting to the latest attacks. 'We must step up our military support — otherwise, even more Ukrainian civilians will pay the highest price,' she added. Zelenskyy said Saturday that Ukrainian and British diplomats had held 'highly productive' talks in Kyiv. Polish Prime Minister Donald Tusk said the latest Russian attacks were 'what happens when someone appeases barbarians,' resulting in 'more bombs, more aggression.'	https://www.voanews.com/a/russia-claims-advances-in-kursk-as-zelenskyy-says-committed-to-talks-/8003845.html	2025-03-08T14:12:50-08:00	
House Republicans unveil spending bill, avoid shutdown	WASHINGTON — House Republicans unveiled a spending bill Saturday that would keep federal agencies funded through Sept. 30, pushing ahead with a go-it-alone strategy that seems certain to spark a major confrontation with Democrats over the contours of government spending. The 99-page bill would provide a slight boost to defense programs while trimming non-defense programs below 2024 budget year levels. That approach is likely to be a nonstarter for most Democrats who have long insisted that defense and non-defense spending move in the same direction. Congress must act by midnight Friday to avoid a partial government shutdown. Speaker Mike Johnson, a Republican, is teeing up the bill for a vote on Tuesday despite the lack of buy-in from Democrats, essentially daring them to vote against it and risk a shutdown. He also is betting that Republicans can muscle the legislation through the House largely by themselves. Normally, when it comes to keeping the government fully open for business, Republicans have had to work with Democrats to craft a bipartisan measure that both sides can support. That's because Republicans almost always lack the votes to pass spending bills on their own. Crucially, the strategy has the backing of President Donald Trump, who has shown an ability so far in his term to hold Republicans in line. Trump praised the bill, writing on X that Republicans have to 'remain UNITED — NO DISSENT — Fight for another day when the timing is right.' 'Great things are coming for America, and I am asking you all to give us a few months to get us through to September so we can continue to put the Country's 'financial house' in order,' he said. House Republicans' leadership staff outlined the contours of the measure, saying it would allow for about $892.5 billion in defense spending and about $708 billion in non-defense spending. The defense spending is slightly above the prior year's level, but the non-defense spending, the aides said, was about $13 billion below last year. The measure also will not include funding requested by individual lawmakers for thousands of community projects around the country, often referred to as earmarks. The bill does not cover the majority of government spending, including programs such as Social Security and Medicare. Funding for those two programs are on auto pilot and are not regularly reviewed by Congress. The top Democrats on the House and Senate Appropriations Committees, Connecticut Representative Rosa DeLauro and Washington Senator Patty Murray, both issued statements blasting the legislation. 'I strongly oppose this full-year continuing resolution,' DeLauro said. Murray said the legislation would 'give Donald Trump and Elon Musk more power over federal spending — and more power to pick winners and losers, which threatens families in blue and red states alike.' Maine Senator Susan Collins, who heads the Senate Appropriations Committee, said the focus must be on preventing a shutdown because closures have negative consequences all across government. 'They require certain essential government employees, such as Border Patrol agents, members of our military and Coast Guard, TSA screeners, and air traffic controllers, to report to work with no certainty on when they will receive their next paycheck,' Collins said. 'We cannot allow that to occur.' Trump's request for unity appears to be having an effect. Some conservatives who almost never vote for continuing resolutions expressed much openness to one last week. Representative Ralph Norman said he has never voted for a continuing resolution — what lawmakers often call a CR — but he is on board with Johnson's effort. He said he has confidence in Trump and the Department of Government Efficiency, a team led by Elon Musk, to make a difference on the nation's debt. 'I don't like CRs,' Norman said. 'But what's the alternative? Negotiate with Democrats? No.' 'I freeze spending for six months to go identify more cuts? Somebody tell me how that's not a win in Washington,' added Republican Representative Chip Roy, another lawmaker who has frequently voted against spending bills but supports the six-month continuing resolution. Republicans are also hoping that resolving this year's spending will allow them to devote their full attention to extending the individual tax cuts passed during Trump's first term and raising the nation's debt limit to avoid a catastrophic federal default. Democratic leaders are warning that the decision to move ahead without consulting them increases the prospects for a shutdown. One of their biggest concerns is the flexibility the legislation would give the Trump administration on spending. The Democratic leadership in both chambers has stressed that Republicans have the majority and are responsible for funding the government. But leaders also have been wary of saying how Democrats would vote on a continuing resolution. 'We have to wait to see what their plan is,' said Senate Democratic leader Chuck Schumer of New York. 'We've always believed the only solution is a bipartisan solution, no matter what.' House Democratic leader Hakeem Jeffries of New York said earlier this week that the Democratic caucus would meet and discuss the legislation at the 'appropriate moment.' But he struck a more forceful tone Friday. Jeffries said Democrats are ready to negotiate a 'meaningful, bipartisan spending agreement that puts working people first.' But he said the 'partisan continuing resolution' threatens to cut funding for key programs, such as veterans benefits and nutritional assistance for low-income families. 'That is not acceptable,' Jeffries said. Trump has been meeting with House Republicans in an effort to win their votes on the legislation. Republicans have a 218-214 majority in the House, so if all lawmakers vote, they can afford only one defection if Democrats unite in opposition. The math gets even harder in the Senate, where at least seven Democrats would have to vote for the legislation to overcome a filibuster. And that's assuming all 53 Republicans vote for it.	https://www.voanews.com/a/house-republicans-unveil-spending-bill-avoid-shutdown-/8003827.html	2025-03-08T13:26:27-08:00	
Pope Francis responds well to treatment for double pneumonia	ROME — Pope Francis is responding well to the treatment for double pneumonia and has shown a 'gradual, slight improvement' in recent days, the Vatican said Saturday. But his doctors have decided to keep his prognosis as guarded, meaning that he's not out of danger yet. The 88-year-old pope, who has chronic lung disease and had part of one lung removed as a young man, has remained stable, with no fever and good oxygen levels in his blood for several days, doctors reported in a Vatican statement. The doctors said that such stability 'as a consequence testifies to a good response to therapy.' It was the first time the doctors had reported that Francis was responding positively to the treatment for the complex lung infection that was diagnosed after he was hospitalized on Feb. 14. Francis worked and rested during the day Saturday, as he entered his fourth week at Rome's Gemelli hospital with his condition stabilized following a few bouts of acute respiratory crises last week. 'In order to record these initial improvements in the coming days as well, his doctors have prudently maintained the prognosis as guarded,' the statement said. In his absence, the Vatican's day-to-day operations continued, with Cardinal Pietro Parolin celebrating Mass for an anti-abortion group in St. Peter's Basilica. At the start, Parolin delivered a message from the pope from the hospital on the need to protect life, from birth to natural death. In the message, dated March 5 and addressed to the Movement for Life, which seeks to provide women with alternatives to abortion, Francis encouraged the faithful to promote anti-abortion activities not just for the unborn, but 'for the elderly, no longer independent or the incurably ill.' Later Saturday, another cardinal closely associated with Francis' papacy, Canadian Cardinal Michael Czerny, presides over the nightly recitation of prayers for Francis. Czerny then returns Sunday to celebrate the Holy Year Mass for volunteers that Francis was supposed to have celebrated. Francis has been using high flows of supplemental oxygen to help him breathe during the day and a noninvasive mechanical ventilation mask at night. Francis was hospitalized Feb. 14 for what was then a bad case of bronchitis. The infection progressed into a complex respiratory tract infection and double pneumonia that sidelined Francis for the longest period of his 12-year papacy and raised questions about the future.	https://www.voanews.com/a/pope-francis-responds-well-to-treatment-for-double-pneumonia/8003819.html	2025-03-08T12:22:45-08:00	
Swiss police rescue 2 dogs stolen for more than $1 million ransom	ZURICH, SWITZERLAND — Swiss police said Saturday they had solved a kidnapping involving two dogs and a demand for ransom of 1 million Swiss francs (about $1.135 million). Zurich police said that two Bolonka dogs were stolen from the home of a 59-year-old man in Schlieren near Zurich last week, while the dog owner was away. When the man returned, the dogs were gone, and he found a letter demanding money to release the small dogs. Instead of paying the ransom, the man, who was not identified by name in line with Swiss privacy rules, called the police. During the investigation, police arrested a 30-year-old Norwegian man Thursday at Zurich Airport. Police said he was strongly suspected of being involved in the theft. Following further leads and cross-European cooperation, police in Poland then detained a 38-year-old suspect and discovered the kidnapped Bolonkas, which they returned safely to their owner Friday. Swiss police said the Norwegian is in custody in Switzerland and authorities in Poland are further investigating the Polish suspect. A Bolonka is a toy breed of dogs bred in Russia and sold for up to a couple of thousand dollars.	https://www.voanews.com/a/swiss-police-rescue-2-dogs-stolen-for-more-than-1-million-ransom/8003803.html	2025-03-08T11:53:42-08:00	
UN urges Taliban to end restrictions on girls on International Women’s Day	WASHINGTON — Four years ago, Yalda never imagined that she would not be able to continue her education or achieve her dream of graduating from school. 'My parents would often talk about the Taliban’s first rule [in the 1990s],' recalled Yalda, who requested that her full name not be used for security reasons. 'I used to think it was fortunate I wasn’t born during those days. Sadly, we ended up experiencing the same fate.' Yalda, who was in 10th grade when the Taliban took over Afghanistan in August 2021, is one of the 1.5 million girls deprived of an education in Afghanistan. Like most school-age girls, she is now confined to her home. 'I think I live in a prison. I am so hopeless, and wish I had not been born a girl,' Yalda said. In addition to banning girls from secondary and university education, the Taliban have barred them from working with government and nongovernment organizations, traveling long distances without a close male relative, and going to parks, public baths and salons. The U.N. Assistance Mission in Afghanistan, in a statement issued on March 8, condemned the 'progressive erasure of women and girls from public life' and called on the Taliban to lift restrictions on Afghan women. 'These restrictions are not only violations of human rights but also barriers to Afghanistan’s progress, deepening poverty and isolation for millions,' said UNAMA’s statement. The Taliban rejected the U.N. call, saying that women in Afghanistan are given their due rights 'in accordance with Islamic Sharia law.' 'At present, Afghan women reside in a state of complete physical and psychological security,' they said. An Afghan teacher, who did not want her identity to be disclosed for fear of reprisal, told VOA that Afghan women do not feel safe in the country. 'We don’t have safety. I can’t teach anymore. We don’t have any future,' said the teacher. 'We are not considered as equal human beings in this country.' Afghanistan is listed last — 177th out of 177 countries — on Georgetown University's global Women Peace and Security Index of inclusion, justice and security for women. The teacher said that women in Afghanistan are filled with despair, saying that 'any change by the group is unlikely.' Hoda Jaberian, the UNESCO program coordinator for education emergencies in Paris, called the Taliban’s restriction 'a war against women.' She told VOA that women’s rights in Afghanistan should remain a top priority for the international community. 'This is the responsibility of the international community to ensure that the rights of Afghan women and girls are restored without any delay,' Jaberian said. No country has yet formally recognized the Taliban as the legitimate government of Afghanistan. Adela Raz, a former Afghan ambassador to the United States, told VOA that one of the main reasons for not recognizing the Taliban’s government is the group’s failure to grant women their rights. She added that, alongside the United Nations, Muslim-majority nations and neighboring countries should pressure the Taliban to respect women’s rights in Afghanistan. 'The neighboring countries, to an extent, have ties with the Taliban and their position is important' to apply pressure on the Taliban to uphold women’s rights. Yalda says that she and other girls in Afghanistan, however, are losing hope. 'They [the Taliban] haven’t changed in the past 3½ years. I don’t think they will,' said Yalda.	https://www.voanews.com/a/un-urges-taliban-to-end-restrictions-on-girls-on-international-women-s-day/8003773.html	2025-03-08T10:54:58-08:00	
Female students lead protests against corruption in Serbia	BELGRADE, SERBIA — Female students Saturday marked International Women's Day in Serbia by leading the daily street protests against corruption and sending a message decrying widespread violence against women in the Balkan country. University students in Serbia are behind almost-daily rallies that started after a concrete canopy crashed down in November at a railway station in the northern city of Novi Sad, killing 15 people. Many in Serbia believe that the huge concrete construction fell because of poor renovation work fueled by government corruption. Street demonstrations have become a challenge to the populist President Aleksandar Vucic. The students carried a banner reading: 'Women in front rows,' heading the marching column that passed through central streets in Belgrade and by the building hosting the state prosecutor's office. The protesters held 19 minutes of silence, instead of the 15 held normally for the 15 victims of the canopy crash. The additional four minutes were dedicated to the four women killed in domestic violence in Serbia this year. 'I am here to support all women around the world, all mothers and fighters, and students of course,' said Slavica Djajic, a resident of Belgrade. The protesting university students have insisted on full accountability in the canopy fall, a call that has garnered widespread support among citizens who are largely disillusioned with politicians and have lost trust in state institutions. Student-led rallies have drawn tens of thousands of people, becoming among the biggest ever in Serbia which has a long history of anti-government protests. Vucic has described the rallies as a Western-orchestrated ploy to oust him from power. The next big rally is planned for March 15 in Belgrade, and Vucic alleged that 'they will try to achieve something with violence and that will be the end.' He added that 'many [demonstrators] will end up behind bars accused of criminal acts.' All student-led protests in the past months have been peaceful, while incidents were recorded when opponents drove their cars into protest blockades or attacked the protesters. The populist leader and his right-wing Serbian Progressive Party have held a firm grip on power in Serbia for over a decade, facing accusations of stifling democratic freedoms despite formally seeking European Union entry for Serbia. Authorities have indicted 16 people over the canopy collapse, but many doubt that the actual culprits will face justice.	https://www.voanews.com/a/female-students-lead-protests-against-corruption-in-serbia/8003766.html	2025-03-08T10:40:17-08:00	
Iran’s top leader rejects talks with US after Trump makes overture	TEHRAN, IRAN — Iranian Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei said he rejects a U.S. push for talks between the two countries because they would be aimed at imposing restrictions on Iranian missile range and its influence in the region. Speaking to a group of officials on Saturday, Khamenei did not identify the United States by name but said a 'bullying government' was being persistent in its push for talks. 'Their talks are not aimed at solving problems, it is for ... let’s talk to impose what we want on the other party that is sitting on the opposite side of the table,' he said. Khamenei’s remarks came a day after President Donald Trump acknowledged sending a letter to Khamenei seeking a new deal with Tehran to restrain its rapidly advancing nuclear program and replace the nuclear deal he withdrew America from during his first term in office. Khamenei said U.S. demands would be military and related to the regional influence of Iran. 'They will be about defense capabilities, about international capabilities of the country,' he said. They will urge Iran 'not to do things, not to meet some certain people, not to go to a certain place, not to produce some items, your missile range should not be more than a certain distance. Is it possible for anybody to accept these?' Khamenei, who has final say on all state matters, said such talks would not address solving problems between Iran and the West. Although Khamenei did not name any person or country, he said the push for talks creates pressure on Iran in public opinion. 'It is not negotiation. It is commanding and imposition,' he said. Trump, in comments to reporters in the Oval Office on Friday, did not mention the letter directly. But he made a veiled reference to possible military action, saying, 'We have a situation with Iran that, something’s going to happen very soon. Very, very soon.' Trump’s overture comes as Israel and the United States have warned they will never let Iran acquire a nuclear weapon, leading to fears of a military confrontation as Tehran enriches uranium at near-weapons-grade levels — something done only by atomic-armed nations. Tehran has long maintained its program is for peaceful purposes, even as its officials increasingly threaten to pursue the bomb as tensions are high with the U.S. over its sanctions and with Israel as a shaky ceasefire holds in its war against Hamas in the Gaza Strip. Iran’s accelerated production of near-weapons-grade uranium puts more pressure on Trump. He has repeatedly said he’s open to negotiations with the Islamic Republic while also increasingly targeting Iran’s oil sales with sanctions as part of his reimposed 'maximum pressure' policy. Late in August, Khamenei in a speech opened the door to possible talks with the U.S., saying there is 'no harm' in engaging with the 'enemy.' However, more recently the supreme leader tempered that, saying that negotiations with America 'are not intelligent, wise or honorable,' after Trump floated the possibility of nuclear talks with Tehran.	https://www.voanews.com/a/iran-s-top-leader-rejects-talks-with-us-after-trump-makes-overture/8003752.html	2025-03-08T10:31:48-08:00	
Clashes, revenge killings in Syria leave more than 600 dead	BEIRUT — The death toll from two days of clashes between security forces and loyalists of ousted Syrian President Bashar al-Assad and revenge killings that followed has risen to more than 600, a war monitoring group said Saturday, making it one of the deadliest acts of violence since Syria’s conflict began 14 years ago. The clashes, which erupted Thursday, marked a major escalation in the challenge to the new government in Damascus, three months after insurgents took authority after removing Assad from power. The government has said it was responding to attacks from remnants of Assad's forces and blamed 'individual actions' for the rampant violence. Retribution killings The revenge killings that started Friday by Sunni Muslim gunmen loyal to the government against members of Assad’s minority Alawite sect are a major blow to Hayat Tahrir al-Sham, the faction that led the overthrow of the former government. Alawites made up a large part of Assad’s support base for decades. Residents of Alawite villages and towns spoke to The Associated Press about killings during which gunmen shot Alawites, most of them men, in the streets or at the gates of their homes. Many homes of Alawites were looted and then set on fire in different areas, two residents of Syria’s coastal region told the AP from their hideouts. They asked that their names not be made public out of fear of being killed, adding that thousands of people have fled to nearby mountains for safety. Atrocities in one town Residents of Baniyas, one of the towns worst hit by the violence, said bodies were strewn on the streets or left unburied in homes and on the roofs of buildings, and nobody was able to collect them. One resident said that the gunmen prevented residents for hours from removing the bodies of five of their neighbors killed Friday at close range. Ali Sheha, a 57-year-old resident of Baniyas who fled with his family and neighbors hours after the violence broke out Friday, said that at least 20 of his neighbors and colleagues in one neighborhood where Alawites lived were killed in their shops or homes. Sheha called the attacks 'revenge killings' of the Alawite minority for the crimes committed by Assad's government. Other residents said the gunmen included foreign fighters and militants from neighboring villages and towns. 'It was very, very bad. Bodies were on the streets,' Sheha said as he was fleeing, speaking by phone nearly 20 kilometers from the city. He said the gunmen were gathering less than 100 meters from his apartment building, firing randomly at homes and residents and, in at least one incident he knows of, asked residents for their IDs to check their religion and their sect before killing them. He said the gunmen also burned some homes and stole cars and robbed homes. Death toll triples The Britain-based Syrian Observatory for Human Rights, a war monitor, said that 428 Alawites have been killed in revenge attacks in addition to 120 pro-Assad fighters and 89 from security forces. Observatory chief Rami Abdurrahman said that revenge killings stopped early Saturday. 'This was one of the biggest massacres during the Syrian conflict,' Abdurrahman said about the killings of Alawite civilians. The previous figure given by the group was more than 200 dead. No official figures have been released. A funeral was held Saturday afternoon for four Syrian security force members in the northwestern village of Al-Janoudiya after they were killed in the clashes along Syria's coast. Scores of people attended the funeral. Syrian forces surging Syria’s state news agency quoted an unnamed Defense Ministry official as saying that government forces have regained control of much of the areas from Assad loyalists. It added that authorities have closed all roads leading to the coastal region 'to prevent violations and gradually restore stability.' On Saturday morning, the bodies of 31 people killed in revenge attacks the day before in the central village of Tuwaym were laid to rest in a mass grave, residents said. Those killed included nine children and four women, the residents said, sending the AP photos of the bodies draped in white cloth as they were lined in the mass grave. Lebanese legislator Haidar Nasser, who holds one of the two seats allocated to the Alawite sect in parliament, said that people were fleeing from Syria for safety in Lebanon. He said he didn't have exact numbers. Nasser said that many people were sheltering at the Russian air base in Hmeimim, Syria, adding that the international community should protect Alawites who are Syrian citizens loyal to their country. He said that since Assad’s fall, many Alawites were fired from their jobs and some former soldiers who reconciled with the new authorities were killed. Under Assad, Alawites held top posts in the army and security agencies. The new government has blamed his loyalists for attacks against the country’s new security forces over the past several weeks. The most recent clashes started when government forces tried to detain a wanted person near the coastal city of Jableh and were ambushed by Assad loyalists, according to the Observatory.	https://www.voanews.com/a/clashes-revenge-killings-in-syria-leave-more-than-600-dead/8003743.html	2025-03-08T10:15:49-08:00	
In his own words: Pope’s views on resigning changed over time	ROME — Pope Francis entered his fourth week in the hospital with double pneumonia, increasingly handing off his day-to-day duties to cardinals as questions swirl about the near- and long-term future of his papacy. On Saturday, the Vatican secretary of state, Cardinal Pietro Parolin, took Francis' place to celebrate Mass for a group. On Sunday, another Vatican official, Cardinal Michael Czerny, is stepping in for the pope to celebrate a Holy Year Mass for volunteers. There is no reason why such delegation of papal obligations cannot continue, especially since Francis remains conscious and working from the hospital. But the 88-year-old pope has spoken about the possibility of resignation, although his position has changed over time, especially after the death of Pope Benedict XVI. Here's what Francis has said about pope's retiring, in his own words: On Benedict’s resignation In his 2024 memoir, 'Life,' Francis recounted how he first learned about Benedict’s resignation, the first in 600 years. He said a Vatican journalist had called him in Buenos Aires on Feb. 11, 2013, and told him the news as it was breaking. 'For a moment I was paralyzed. I could hardly believe what I was hearing,' Francis wrote in 'Life.' 'This was news I had never expected to receive in my lifetime: the resignation of a pope was unimaginable, although it was provided for in canon law. In the first few moments I said to myself, ‘I must have misunderstood, it’s not possible.’ But then I understood that Benedict had surely meditated and prayed for a long time before making this brave and historic decision. Faced with his declining strength, he had evidently realized that the only irreplaceable element in the Church is the Holy Spirit, and the only Lord is Jesus Christ. This is why he was a great pope, humble and sincere, who loved the church until the end.' During the 10 years they lived together in the Vatican as a reigning and retired pope, Francis repeatedly praised Benedict’s courage and humility for resigning and said he had 'opened the door' to future popes also stepping down. On the chance he might follow In a 2022 interview with Spain's ABC daily newspaper, Francis revealed that he had written a letter of resignation soon after he was elected pontiff. The letter laid out his resignation if medical problems impeded him from carrying out his duties or from freely announcing a resignation. The text of the letter has not been released, and it’s not known what sort of medical impairment or lack of consciousness might trigger a resignation. Canon law has no provision for what to do if a pope is permanently impaired and canonists are divided on whether a prewritten letter of resignation would be valid. Canon 332.2 says that for a pope to resign his office, 'it is required for validity that the resignation is made freely and properly manifested but not that it is accepted by anyone.' Francis has repeated the existence of his resignation letter as recently as last year. But in 'Life,' which was published a year ago this month, Francis said he had no plans to resign and was at least at that time enjoying good health. 'But this is, I repeat, a distant possibility, because I truly do not have any cause serious enough to make me think of resigning,' he said. 'Some people may have hoped that sooner or later, perhaps after a stay in the hospital, I might make an announcement of that kind, but there is no risk of it: Thanks be to God, I enjoy good health, and as I have said, there are many projects to bring to fruition, God willing.' What changed after Benedict died Benedict died Dec. 31, 2022, at the age of 95. There were not a few problems during those 10 years of cohabitation, with traditionalists and conservatives looking to Benedict as their nostalgic point of reference. In his first interview with The Associated Press after the death, Francis again repeated that Benedict had opened the possibility of future retired popes. He repeated that if he were to follow, he would live outside the Vatican in a home for retired priests in the diocese of Rome and be referred to as the 'emeritus bishop of Rome' as opposed to 'emeritus pope.' Francis said that Benedict’s decision to live in a converted monastery in the Vatican Gardens was a 'good intermediate solution,' but that future retired popes might want to do things differently. But a few weeks later, speaking to Congolese and South Sudanese priests, Francis changed tune. Freed from Benedict's presence, Francis pointed out the risks that papal resignations become the norm. He repeated that he had written a letter of resignation, but made clear the papacy was for life. 'I did it in case I have some health problem that prevents me from exercising my ministry and I am not fully conscious in order to resign,' he said, according to the closed-door comments reported by the Jesuit journal La Civilta Cattolica. 'However, this doesn’t mean that resigning popes should become, let’s say, a ‘fashion,’ or a normal thing. Benedict had the courage to do it because he didn’t feel like going on because of his health. I for the moment do not have that on my agenda. I believe that the pope’s ministry is ad vitam [for life]. I see no reason why it shouldn’t be so. The ministry of the great patriarchs is always for life. And historical tradition is important. 'If, on the other hand, we listen to the gossip well, then we should change popes every six months!'	https://www.voanews.com/a/in-his-own-words-pope-s-views-on-resigning-changed-over-time/8003697.html	2025-03-08T09:11:02-08:00	
Myanmar junta chief announces election for December or January	Myanmar's military government will hold a general election in December 2025 or January 2026, state media said Saturday, citing the junta chief, who provided the first specific time frame for the long-promised polls in the war-torn nation. Myanmar has been in turmoil since early 2021, when the military ousted an elected civilian government led by Nobel Peace Prize laureate Aung San Suu Kyi, triggering a protest movement that morphed into an armed rebellion against the junta across the Southeast Asian country. The junta leader, Senior General Min Aung Hlaing, vowed to hold an election, but his administration repeatedly extended a state of emergency, even as the military was battered by a collection of anti-junta opposition groups. Critics have widely derided the promised polls as a sham to keep the generals in power through proxies, given that dozens of political parties have been banned, and the junta has lost its grip over large parts of Myanmar. 'We plan to hold a free and fair election soon,' Min Aung Hlaing said during a visit to Belarus, where he announced the time frame, the Global New Light of Myanmar newspaper reported. 'Fifty-three political parties have already submitted their lists to participate in the election,' he said. The junta was able to conduct a full, on-the-ground census in only 145 of the country's 330 townships to prepare voter lists for the elections, according to a census report published in December. The election also brings the risk of more violence as the junta and its opponents push to increase their control of territory in Myanmar, where the widening conflict has left the economy in tatters and displaced over 3.5 million people.	https://www.voanews.com/a/myanmar-junta-chief-announces-election-for-december-or-january/8003665.html	2025-03-08T08:31:29-08:00	
India says it is working to cut tariffs as it eyes US trade deal	NEW DELHI — India said Friday it is working to lower trade barriers with the United States as it tries to reach a bilateral trade deal with Washington this year. The two countries said after a February White House meeting between U.S. President Donald Trump and Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi that they will try to reach a deal by fall, aiming to increase bilateral trade to $500 billion by 2030. External Affairs Ministry spokesperson Randhir Jaiswal told reporters Friday the objective of the bilateral trade agreement would be 'to strengthen and deepen India-U.S. two-way trade in the goods and services sector, increase market access, reduce tariff and nontariff barriers, and deepen supply chain integration between the two countries.' Trump has accused Delhi of imposing unfair trade barriers through high tariffs and has been putting pressure on India to cut duties on U.S. imports. India, for example, imposes tariffs of up to 110% on all car imports. 'India charges us massive tariffs. Massive. You cannot even sell anything in India,' Trump said Friday at the White House. 'They have agreed. By the way, they want to cut their tariffs way down now because somebody is finally exposing them for what they have done.' There was no immediate comment from Indian officials. Conciliatory approach Analysts say India has adopted a conciliatory approach on tariffs, opting to engage the U.S. in talks as it looks to avoid friction. India already has lowered duties on some imports that will benefit American companies, such as high-end motorcycles and bourbon. 'The U.S. is, first of all, India’s largest export market, so we do not want to upset that,' said New Delhi-based trade analyst Biswajit Dhar. 'Then there are other considerations at play. There is a sense that the U.S. is a valued strategic partner, so we don’t want trade tensions to upset that equilibrium, also.' While India has been spared tariffs so far from the Trump administration, reciprocal tariffs that Trump has said he will be announcing early next month could affect Indian exports to the U.S. in areas from pharmaceuticals and drugs to auto components. Two-way trade in goods between the countries was more than $129 billion last year, with Indian exports surpassing $87 billion. Indian Commerce Minister Piyush Goyal visited Washington this week to discuss trade issues with American officials, including Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick. During remarks to an Indian television network, Lutnick called on India to reconsider its tariffs in light of the 'special relationship' with the United States. 'It’s time to do something big, something grand, something that connects India and the United States together, but does it on a broad scale, not product-by-product, but rather the whole thing,' he said speaking Friday from Washington to India Today TV. Defense purchases He also said India must shift defense equipment purchases away from Russia and buy more from the U.S. Analysts say purchasing more military hardware from the U.S. could help bridge India’s trade surplus with the U.S., which stood at more than $40 billion last year. Lutnick also said he wanted India to open its market to U.S. farm exports, which New Delhi has long resisted for fear it will hurt tens of millions of India’s small farmers. In New Delhi, trade analysts said there is room for India to lower tariffs in several areas outside of agriculture. 'I think we can lower tariffs to zero level on most industrial goods, but agriculture we don’t want to touch. It is very sensitive,' said Ajay Srivastava, founder of the Global Trade Research Initiative think tank in New Delhi. 'For us, that is not a trade issue but a livelihood issue, with more than 700 million farmers depending on it for their incomes.' Other analysts agree that tariffs on imports of farm products, a key area in which the U.S. wants access, could pose a hurdle for the two countries during negotiations. 'Agricultural products are a strict ‘no’ for India. This will cause unease here and could become a sticking point as they try to clinch a trade deal,' trade analyst Dhar said.	https://www.voanews.com/a/india-says-it-is-working-to-cut-tariffs-as-it-eyes-us-trade-deal/8003634.html	2025-03-08T07:51:43-08:00	
Protests in Turkey demand protection from domestic violence	ISTANBUL — Thousands of women demonstrated in the streets of Turkish cities Saturday to mark International Women’s Day, protesting inequality and violence against women. On the Asian side of Istanbul, a rally in Kadikoy saw members of dozens of women’s groups listen to speeches, dance and sing in the spring sunshine. The colorful protest was overseen by a large police presence, including officers in riot gear and a water cannon truck. The government of President Recep Tayyip Erdogan declared 2025 the Year of the Family. Protesters pushed back against the idea of women’s role being confined to marriage and motherhood, carrying banners reading 'Family will not bind us to life' and 'We will not be sacrificed to the family.' Critics have accused the government of overseeing restrictions on women’s rights and not doing enough to tackle violence against women. Erdogan in 2021 withdrew Turkey from a European treaty, dubbed the Istanbul Convention, that protects women from domestic violence. Turkey’s We Will Stop Femicides Platform says 394 women were killed by men in 2024. 'There is bullying at work, pressure from husbands and fathers at home and pressure from patriarchal society. We demand that this pressure be reduced even further,' Yaz Gulgun, 52, said. The women’s day events were the first planned public demonstrations since the Kurdistan Workers’ Party, or PKK, announced a ceasefire last week, bringing hope for an end to a 40-year conflict with the Turkish state. Crowds in Diyarbakir, the largest city in Turkey’s Kurdish-majority southeast, heard a message from the group’s imprisoned leader Abdullah Ocalan in which he said the 'women’s issue is bigger than the Kurdish issue.' Gultan Kisanak, a Kurdish politician who was released from prison last year after being convicted of terrorism charges, addressed a rally near the city center. 'A democratic society that does not accept women’s will cannot be built. Therefore, women’s struggle for freedom is the cornerstone of our people’s struggle for freedom and peace,' she said. Many women were expected to gather in the evening on the European side of Istanbul for a Feminist Night March despite a ban. In recent years, authorities have blocked efforts by women to demonstrate in Taksim Square, Istanbul’s traditional gathering point for rallies. Nearby metro stations were closed from the early afternoon, and streets, including one of the city’s main shopping thoroughfares, were sealed off with barriers. The Beyoglu district governor’s office said the ban was enforced to prevent 'actions that may disrupt public order and social peace.'	https://www.voanews.com/a/protests-in-turkey-demand-protection-from-domestic-violence/8003553.html	2025-03-08T05:24:57-08:00	
Cyclone Alfred, downgraded to tropical low, nears Australia	LABRADOR, AUSTRALIA — Cyclone Alfred weakened into a tropical low Saturday as it neared the rain- and wind-lashed eastern coast of Australia where hundreds of thousands of properties were without power. The former tropical cyclone lay about 65 kilometers off the coast of the Queensland capital, Brisbane, government forecasters said in a final update. Now without gale-force winds, the storm was slowly moving toward the coast and delivering intense rain before it was expected to cross over the mainland later in the day. 'Despite its weakening, heavy rainfall is likely to continue over southeast Queensland and northeast New South Wales during the weekend,' the bureau of meteorology said. The rains could still lead to 'dangerous and life-threatening' flash flooding along the 400-kilometer stretch of coastline straddling the two states. One man was still missing after his four-wheel-drive vehicle was swept off a bridge into a rain-swollen river the previous day in northern New South Wales. He clambered out of the vehicle and tried in vain to cling to a branch in the river. 'The man was swept from the tree and seen to go beneath the water where he has not been sighted since,' police said in a statement. Prime Minister Anthony Albanese said there were 'grave concerns' for the man. 'While it has been downgraded, very serious risks remain, so it is important that people do not take this downgrading as a reason for complacency,' Albanese said at a news conference. 'Its impact will be serious and will intensify over coming hours and indeed over coming days,' he said. Rain still posed a threat to engorged rivers across the region, bureau meteorologist Daniel Hayes told AFP, with some rivers approaching major flood levels. In Lismore — a northern New South Wales city hit by deadly floods in 2022 — the Wilsons River might threaten a 10.6-meter protective levee, he said. 'It is still quite possible that it will reach the levee and then go over the top,' he said. A 'staggering' number of more than 239,000 properties in southeast Queensland were without power on Saturday morning after winds toppled power lines or blew trees and debris into them, utility group Energex said. It had been too dangerous for crews to work in some blacked-out areas, Energex Brisbane area manager Chris Graham told national broadcaster ABC. Another 39,000 homes and businesses were without power in northern New South Wales, regional provider Essential Energy said, warning that floods could complicate repair operations.	https://www.voanews.com/a/cyclone-alfred-downgraded-to-tropical-low-nears-australia/8003543.html	2025-03-08T04:48:16-08:00
