China's economy softens in August as Beijing grapples with lagging demand	BEIJING — China's economy softened in August, extending a slowdown in industrial activity and real estate prices as Beijing faces pressure to ramp up spending to stimulate demand. Data published by the National Bureau of Statistics Saturday showed weakening activity across industrial production, retail sales and real estate this month compared to July. 'We should be aware that the adverse impacts arising from the changes in the external environment are increasing,' said Liu Aihua, the bureau's chief economist in a news conference. Liu said that demand remained insufficient at home, and the sustained economic recovery still confronts multiple difficulties and challenges. China has been grappling with a lagging economy post-COVID, with weak consumer demand, persistent deflationary pressures and a contraction in factory activity. Chinese leaders have ramped up investment in manufacturing to rev up an economy that stalled during the pandemic and is still growing slower than hoped. Beijing also has to deal with increasing pressure to implement large-scale stimulus measures to boost economic growth. While industrial production rose by 4.5% in August compared to a year ago, it declined from July's 5.1% growth, according to the bureau's data released. Retail sales grew 2.1% from the same time last year, slower than the 2.7% increase last month. Fixed asset investment rose by 3.4% from January to August, down from 3.6% in the first seven months. Meanwhile, investment in real estate declined by 10.2% from January to August, compared to last year. The figures released Saturday come after trade data for August saw imports grow just 0.5% compared to a year ago. The consumer price index rose 0.6% in August, missing forecasts according to data released Monday. Officials attributed the higher CPI to an increase in food prices due to bad weather. But the core CPI, which excludes food and energy prices, rose by just 0.3% in August, the slowest in over three years.	https://www.voanews.com/a/china-s-economy-softens-in-august-as-beijing-grapples-with-lagging-demand/7784816.html	2024-09-14T17:12:33-07:00

Nigerian army rescues 13 hostages from extremist group	ABUJA, Nigeria — Nigerian troops have rescued 13 hostages who were kidnapped by an extremist group in the northwestern state of Kaduna, the country's army said on Saturday. The army said in a statement that 'the troops successfully overwhelmed the terrorists, forcing them to abandon their captives.' Several kidnappers were killed, and others were captured, the military added. It didn't specify which armed group the kidnappers belonged to. The rescued hostages were taken to a military facility for a medical assessment before being reunited with their families. Weapons, ammunition, solar panels and cash were also discovered during the rescue operation. Kidnappings have become common in parts of northern Nigeria, where dozens of armed groups take advantage of a limited security presence to carry out attacks in villages and along major roads. Most victims are released only after the payment of ransoms that sometimes run into the thousands of dollars. At least 1,400 students have been taken from Nigerian schools since the 2014 kidnapping of 276 schoolgirls by Boko Haram militants in the village of Chibok in Borno state shocked the world. Boko Haram, Nigeria's homegrown jihadi rebels, launched its insurgency in 2009 to establish Islamic Shariah law in the country. At least 35,000 people have been killed and 2.1 million people displaced due to the extremist violence, according to United Nations agencies in Nigeria.	https://www.voanews.com/a/nigerian-army-rescues-13-hostages-from-extremist-group-/7784577.html	2024-09-14T16:41:52-07:00

Ukraine: N. Korea's military aid to Russia presents battlefield problem	kyiv, ukraine — Ukraine's spy chief said Saturday that Russia's increased production of guided bombs as well as artillery ammunition deliveries from North Korea present major problems for Ukrainian forces on the battlefield. The head of Ukraine's military intelligence agency GUR, Kyrylo Budanov, said North Korean military aid to Russia presented the biggest concern compared to support provided by Moscow's other allies. 'They supply huge amounts of artillery ammunition, which is critical for Russia,' he said, pointing to the ramp up in the battlefield hostilities following such deliveries. Ukraine and the United States, among other countries and independent analysts, say North Korean leader Kim Jong Un is helping Russia in the war against Ukraine by supplying missiles and ammunition in return for economic and other military assistance from Moscow. Russia's boost in the production of guided bombs also presented a 'huge problem for the front line,' Budanov said at the Yalta European Strategy conference organized by the Victor Pinchuk Foundation in Kyiv. Ukraine's forces are stretched thin more than 30 months into the full-scale invasion, working to stave off Russian advance toward key towns in the country's east. Ukrainian forces have also made an incursion into the western Russian region of Kursk. A ramp up in the production of the Iskander-type missiles has resulted in Russia's 'massive use' of weapons to attack Ukraine, Budanov said. This year's strikes on Ukraine's critical infrastructure have caused significant damage to the country's power grid, leading to power cuts. President Volodymyr Zelenskyy has renewed pleas for air defense support from Ukraine's allies. Budanov said Russian internal planning showed that Moscow will face a recruitment crunch in the middle of next year. 'During this period (summer 2025) they will face a dilemma: either to declare mobilization or to somehow reduce the intensity of hostilities, which may ultimately be critical for them,' Budanov said.	https://www.voanews.com/a/ukraine-n-korean-military-aid-to-russia-present-major-battlefield-problem-/7784566.html	2024-09-14T16:10:17-07:00	
Biden to use rest of term putting Ukraine in 'best position,' says adviser	Kyiv, Ukraine — U.S. President Joe Biden will use the remaining four months of his term 'to put Ukraine in the best possible position to prevail,' a senior adviser said Saturday. Speaking remotely to a forum in Kyiv, Ukraine, Jake Sullivan, the U.S. national security adviser, also said Biden will meet Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy in late September at the U.N. General Assembly in New York to discuss aid to Ukraine. 'President Zelenskyy has said that ultimately this war has to end through negotiations, and we need them to be strong in those negotiations,' Sullivan said, adding Ukraine would decide when to enter talks with Russia. Biden will be replaced next January either by Vice President Kamala Harris, who has indicated she will continue his policies of backing Ukraine, or by former President Donald Trump, who would not say at a debate earlier this week whether he wanted Kyiv to win the war. The announcement of the upcoming Biden-Zelenskyy meeting came after Moscow and Kyiv earlier Saturday swapped 103 prisoners of war each in a UAE-brokered deal, and as Russian forces continue to gain ground in their grinding offensive in east Ukraine. Sullivan, in his comments by video link to the forum in Kyiv, said 'difficult and complicated' logistics — rather than unwillingness — was delaying aid to Ukraine. 'It's not a matter of political will,' Sullivan said. 'But given what Ukraine is up against, we've got to do more, and we've got to do better.'	https://www.voanews.com/a/biden-to-use-rest-of-term-putting-ukraine-in-best-position-says-adviser-/7784556.html	2024-09-14T15:16:35-07:00	
American, 2 Spaniards suspected of link to plan to destabilize Venezuela	Caracas, Venezuela — An American citizen and two Spaniards have been detained in Venezuela on suspicion of links to an alleged plan to destabilize the country, Interior Minister Diosdado Cabello said Saturday, adding that hundreds of weapons were seized. The two Spanish nationals were recently detained in Puerto Ayacucho, Cabello told a press conference, adding that an American was also in custody on suspicion of planning to 'generate violence' and 'destabilize' Venezuela. He added that around 400 rifles originating in the United States had also been seized. The arrests come amid heightened tensions between Venezuela and both the U.S. and Spain over the disputed Venezuelan presidential election, which the country's opposition accuses incumbent strongman Nicolas Maduro of stealing. Earlier this week Caracas recalled its ambassador to Madrid for consultations and summoned Spain's envoy to Venezuela for talks after a Spanish minister accused Maduro of running a 'dictatorship.' Venezuela was also angered by the decision of Spanish Prime Minister Pedro Sanchez to meet with Venezuelan opposition candidate Edmundo Gonzalez Urrutia, who went into exile in Spain after being threatened with arrest by Maduro's regime. Caracas also has been engaged in a war of words with the United States, which recognized Gonzalez Urrutia as the winner of the July 28 poll. Maduro insists he won a third term but has failed to release detailed voting tallies to back his claim. Washington on Thursday announced new sanctions against 16 Venezuelan officials, including some from the electoral authority, for impeding 'a transparent electoral process' and not publishing accurate results. Venezuela denounced the measures as a 'crime of aggression' and Maduro decorated four military officers among those targeted by the sanctions.	https://www.voanews.com/a/7784547.html	2024-09-14T14:40:16-07:00	
Fuel truck explodes in Haiti, killing at least 16, seriously wounding 40	PORT-AU-PRINCE, haiti — A fuel truck exploded on a road in Haiti's southern peninsula Saturday, killing at least 16 people and leaving 40 survivors with serious burns, officials said. Haiti Prime Minister Garry Conille said emergency teams were working to 'save the lives of the seriously injured' after the incident, which occurred in the morning near the coastal city of Miragoane in the department of Nippes. 'The government stands in solidarity with all the victims and their families,' Conille said in a social media post. Authorities in Nippes said 16 bodies were completely charred and unrecognizable. A witness to the incident said the truck's gas tank had been punctured by another vehicle, and people rushed to the site to collect fuel. 'There were a lot of people. Those who were close to the truck got pulverized,' said the man, who did not give his name, in a video interview with local outlet Echo Haiti Media. When asked how many people might have been killed in the blast, he said it was difficult to say. 'You can't know, because there were a lot of people, bystanders and those collecting oil. There were a lot of people,' he said. Fuel deliveries to the Miragoane area have slowed in recent weeks as trucks were transported via ferry to avoid gang-controlled highways surrounding the capital of Port-au-Prince. The spread of gangs in the capital and surrounding areas has fueled a humanitarian crisis with mass displacements, sexual violence, child recruitment and widespread hunger. A state of emergency is now in place nationwide. Haiti's civil protection agency reported the identities of a 31-year-old man and two 23-year-old men who suffered burns over 89% of their bodies, and were being treated in a hospital in Les Cayes, in southern Haiti. Two of them sustained second-degree burns, the agency said. A similar incident in 2021 in the city of Cap-Haitien killed at least 60 people, after people were also thought to have been attempting to take fuel from a tanker truck.	https://www.voanews.com/a/fuel-truck-explodes-in-haiti-killing-at-least-16-seriously-wounding-40-/7784544.html	2024-09-14T13:59:34-07:00

Japan, US face ‘shared challenge’ from China steel, PM hopeful says	TOKYO — Japan and the United States should avoid confrontation about the steel industry and work together amid competition from China, the world's top steelmaker, leading prime ministerial candidate Shinjiro Koizumi said Saturday. Sources told Reuters Friday that a powerful U.S. national security panel reviewing Nippon Steel's $14.9 billion bid for U.S. Steel faces a September 23 deadline to recommend whether the White House should block the deal. Koizumi, Japan's former environment minister, said at a debate Saturday that Japan and the U.S. should not confront each other when it comes to the steel industry but to face together the 'shared challenge' coming from China's steel industry. 'If China, producing cheap steel without renewable or clean energy, floods the global market, it will most adversely affect us, the democratic countries playing by fair market rules,' Koizumi said. Nippon Steel's key negotiator on the deal, Vice Chairman Takahiro Mori, said last month that his company and other Japanese steelmakers were urging Tokyo to consider curbing cheap steel imports coming from China to protect the local market. On Sunday, Nippon Steel and U.S. Steel sent a letter to U.S. President Joe Biden about their deal, as Biden, Democratic presidential nominee Kamala Harris and Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump have all opposed the merger. 'We are also in the midst of elections, just like the U.S., and during elections, various ideas may arise. Overreacting to each of these would, in my view, call into question diplomatic judgment,' Koizumi said when asked about the deal. Sanae Takaichi, Japan's minister in charge of economic security and another prime ministerial candidate, also defended the deal during the same debate attended by eight other Liberal Democratic Party's, or LDP, leadership contenders Saturday. 'It appears they are using CFIUS to frame this as an economic security issue,' she said, referring to the Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States. 'However, Japan and the U.S. are allies, and the steel industry is about strengthening our combined resilience.' The 43-year-old son of former Prime Minister Junichiro Koizumi, the junior Koizumi, is seen as a leading contender in the September 27 race to pick the LDP's new leader, who will become the next prime minister due to the party's control of parliament. Koizumi said Saturday that he would seek a dialog with the North Korean leadership to resolve the issue over the abduction of Japanese citizens kidnapped by North Korean agents in the 1970s and 1980s. The purported primary goal was to train North Korean agents to impersonate Japanese people. 'We want to explore new opportunities for dialog between people of the same generation, without being bound by conventional approaches, and without preconditions,' Koizumi said. After admitting in 2002 that it had abducted 13 Japanese, North Korea apologized and allowed five to return home. It said eight others had died and denied that an additional four entered its territory. It promised to reinvestigate but has never announced the results. Japan says North Korea has refused to send the others home because of concern that they might reveal inconvenient information about the country.	https://www.voanews.com/a/japan-us-face-shared-challenge-from-china-steel-pm-hopeful-says/7784444.html	2024-09-14T10:53:01-07:00	
Thousands attend rally organized by Poland's nationalist opposition party	WARSAW, Poland — Thousands of people attended an antigovernment rally organized by Poland's nationalist conservative opposition party to boost support before next year's presidential election. Law and Justice leader Jaroslaw Kaczynski called on supporters to be active at social and political levels and to back the party’s candidate in next year’s presidential election. He hasn't yet named the candidate. Kaczynski also accused the pro-European Union government of acting against the nation’s interests and violating its laws and cited recently opened investigations into allegations of mismanagement and corruption of the Law and Justice government. Up to 4,000 people with national white-and-red flags gathered for the rally held in windy weather outside the Justice Ministry in Warsaw, which has become a symbol of years of deep rifts between the backers of Kaczynski and Donald Tusk, now the prime minister and leader of the center-right Civic Platform party. Law and Justice, which governed Poland for from 2015 until 2023, drew criticism from Brussels and Tusk alike for making changes to Poland’s judicial system that were deemed undemocratic. Many in the nation of 38 million people were also tired of the aggressive and divisive language that Kaczynski, who dictated the government's policies from the sidelines, used to energize support. The party lost power in the 2023 election, but is still exerting control through President Andrzej Duda, who is allied with Law and Justice. Duda, whose second and last term runs out in August, has been blocking many of the government's draft laws.	https://www.voanews.com/a/thousands-attend-rally-organized-by-poland-s-nationalist-opposition-party/7784439.html	2024-09-14T10:38:42-07:00	
Sudanese city pounded as analysts report 'unprecedented' combat	Port Sudan, Sudan — Heavy fighting on Saturday shook a Sudanese city besieged by paramilitaries, witnesses told AFP, as U.S. researchers reported unprecedented and escalating combat in the North Darfur state capital. El-Fasher is one of five state capitals in Sudan's western Darfur region and the only one not in the hands of the Rapid Support Forces, or RSF, who have been battling the regular army since April 2023. The United Nations says the war across much of Sudan has created the world's largest displacement crisis, with millions uprooted, and has led to famine at a displacement camp near El-Fasher. Darfur has seen some of the war's worst atrocities, and the RSF has besieged El-Fasher since May. 'Neighborhoods are completely deserted and all you can hear are explosions and missiles,' Ibrahim Ishaq, 52, told AFP. 'The central market area has become unlivable because of the intensity of the explosions,' said Ishaq, who fled westward from the city on Friday. Witnesses reported army bombardment south and east of the city on Saturday and said they heard air-defense batteries firing. The Yale School of Public Health's Humanitarian Research Lab said in a report Friday that its analysis confirmed 'unprecedented large-scale combat operations' in El-Fasher within the previous 10 days, 'with significant escalation in the past 36 hours' involving the army and the paramilitaries. It cited reports that describe 'a major multidirectional RSF attack from the northern, eastern, and southern directions' on Thursday. Reduced to rubble Darfur Governor Mini Minawi had on Thursday said on social media platform X that the army had repelled 'a large attack' by the RSF. The paramilitaries, however, said they seized military sites in El-Fasher. Using satellite imagery and other data, the Yale researchers said they found munition impacts 'likely related to high-tempo aerial bombardment' from the regular army, but they said other structural damage resulted from 'RSF bombardment' and combat activity by both sides. Whatever the battle's ultimate outcome, current levels of fighting 'are likely to effectively reduce what is left of El-Fasher to rubble,' the Yale study said. The United States special envoy for Sudan, Tom Perriello, on Saturday said on social media platform X: 'We are extremely concerned about the RSF's renewed attacks.' He urged the RSF 'to stop its assault.' It was not immediately possible to determine the number of victims. Sudan's war has already killed tens of thousands of people, with some estimates as high as 150,000, according to Perriello. Strikes near Khartoum In the capital, Khartoum, on Saturday, about 800 kilometers from El-Fasher, witnesses reported heavy explosions and strikes to the city's south. Independent United Nations experts earlier this month appealed for deployment of an 'impartial force' to be urgently deployed in Sudan for civilian protection. Sudan's foreign ministry, loyal to the army, rejected the idea.	https://www.voanews.com/a/sudanese-city-pounded-as-analysts-report-unprecedented-combat/7784432.html	2024-09-14T10:27:31-07:00	
Ballerina DePrince, whose career inspired many after she was born into war, dies at 29	FORT LAUDERDALE, Florida — Ballet dancer Michaela Mabinty DePrince, who came to the United States from an orphanage in war-ravaged Sierra Leone and performed on some of the world's biggest stages, has died, her family said in a statement. She was 29. 'Michaela touched so many lives across the world, including ours. She was an unforgettable inspiration to everyone who knew her or heard her story,' her family said in a statement posted Friday on DePrince's social media accounts. 'From her early life in war-torn Africa, to stages and screens across the world, she achieved her dreams and so much more.' A cause of death was not provided. DePrince was adopted by an American couple and by age 17 she had been featured in a documentary film and had performed on the TV show 'Dancing with the Stars.' After graduating from high school and the American Ballet Theatre’s Jacqueline Kennedy Onassis School, she became a principal dancer with the Dance Theatre of Harlem. She then went to the Netherlands, where she danced with the Dutch National Ballet. She later returned to the U.S. and joined the Boston Ballet in 2021. 'We’re sending our love and support to the family of Michaela Mabinty DePrince at this time of loss,' the Boston Ballet said in a statement to The Associated Press on Saturday. 'We were so fortunate to know her; she was a beautiful person, a wonderful dancer, and she will be greatly missed by us all.' In her memoir, Taking Flight: From War Orphan to Star Ballerina, she shared her journey from the orphanage to the stage. She also wrote a children's book, Ballerina Dreams. DePrince suffered from a skin pigmentation disorder that had her labeled 'the devil’s child' at the orphanage. 'I lost both my parents, so I was there [the orphanage] for about a year, and I wasn’t treated very well because I had vitiligo,' DePrince told the AP in a 2012 interview. 'We were ranked as numbers, and number 27 was the least favorite and that was my number, so I got the least amount of food, the least amount of clothes and whatnot.' She added that she remembered seeing a photo of an American ballet dancer on a magazine page that had blown against the gate of the orphanage during Sierra Leone's civil war. 'All I remember is she looked really, really happy,' DePrince told the AP, adding that she wished 'to become this exact person.' She said she saw hope in that photo, 'and I ripped the page out and I stuck it in my underwear because I didn’t have any place to put it,' she said. Her passion helped inspire young Black dancers to pursue their dreams, her family said. 'We will miss her and her gorgeous smile forever and we know you will, too,' their statement said. Her sister, Mia Mabinty DePrince, recalled in the statement that they slept on a shared mat in the orphanage and used to make up their own musical theater plays and ballets. 'When we got adopted, our parents quickly poured into our dreams and arose the beautiful, gracefully strong ballerina that so many of you knew her as today. She was an inspiration,' Mia DePrince wrote. 'Whether she was leaping across the stage or getting on a plane and flying to third-world countries to provide orphans and children with dance classes, she was determined to conquer all her dreams in the arts and dance.'	https://www.voanews.com/a/ballerina-deprince-whose-career-inspired-many-after-she-was-born-into-war-dies-at-29/7784422.html	2024-09-14T10:15:48-07:00	
Syria's president asks former minister to form new government	BEIRUT — Syrian President Bashar Assad issued a decree Saturday in which he named former Communications Minister Mohammed Ghazi Jalali as the head of the new government following July’s parliamentary election, state media reported. Jalali, 55, has been under European Union sanctions since October 2014 over the government crackdown during Syria’s conflict that has left nearly half a million people dead since 2011. As a government minister, he was 'collectively responsible for the regime’s violent repression against the civilian population,' the EU said at the time of announcing the sanctions. Jalali was communications minister for nearly two years starting in August 2014, according to the state news agency SANA. Syria’s outgoing government has been in a caretaker capacity since the mid-July parliamentary election. It's not clear how long it will take Jalali to form a new Cabinet. The EU first started imposing sanctions on Syria in 2011. The measures also include a ban on oil imports, investment restrictions, a freeze on central bank assets held in the EU, and export limits on equipment and technology that could be used to crack down on civilians or to monitor their phones and internet.	https://www.voanews.com/a/syria-s-president-asks-former-minister-to-form-new-government/7784416.html	2024-09-14T10:04:24-07:00	
Iran says it is open to talks but rejects pressure from US, EU	DUBAI — Iran's foreign minister said that Tehran was open to diplomacy to solve disputes but not 'threats and pressure,' state media reported on Saturday, after the U.S. and three European powers imposed sanctions against the country's aviation sector. Abbas Araqchi's comments come a day after the European Union's chief diplomat said the bloc is considering new sanctions targeting Iran's aviation sector, in reaction to reports Tehran supplied Russia with ballistic missiles in its war against Ukraine. 'Iran continues on its own path with strength, although we have always been open to talks to resolve disputes ... but dialogue should be based on mutual respect, not on threats and pressure,' Araqchi said, according to the official news agency IRNA. Araqchi said on Wednesday that Tehran had not delivered any ballistic missiles to Russia and that sanctions imposed on Iran by the United States and three European powers would not solve any problems between them. The United States, Germany, Britain and France on Tuesday imposed new sanctions on Iran, including measures against its national airline, Iran Air.	https://www.voanews.com/a/iran-says-it-is-open-to-talks-but-rejects-pressure-from-us-eu/7784405.html	2024-09-14T09:56:36-07:00	
Algerian court certifies Tebboune's landslide reelection win	ALGIERS, Algeria — Algeria's constitutional court on Saturday certified the landslide victory of President Abdelmadjid Tebboune in last weekend's election after retabulating vote counts that he and his two opponents had called into question. The court said that it had reviewed local voting data to settle questions about irregularities that Tebboune’s opponents had alleged in two appeals Monday. 'After verification of the minutes of the regions and correction of the errors noted in the counting of the votes,' it had lowered Tebboune's vote share and determined that his two opponents had won hundreds of thousands more votes than previously reported, said Omar Belhadj, the constitutional court's president. The court's decision makes Tebboune the official winner of the September 7 election. His government will next decide when to inaugurate him for a second term. The court's retabulated figures showed Tebboune leading Islamist challenger Abdellali Hassan Cherif by around 75 percentage points. With 7.7 million votes, the first-term president won 84.3% of the vote, surpassing the 2019 win by millions of votes and a double-digit margin. Cherif, running with the Movement of Society for Peace, won nearly 950,000 votes, or roughly 9.6%. The Socialist Forces Front's Youcef Aouchiche won more than 580,000 votes, or roughly 6.1%. Notably, both challengers surpassed the threshold required to receive reimbursement for campaign expenses. Under its election laws, Algeria pays for political campaigns that receive more than a 5% vote share. The results announced by the election authority last week showed Cherif and Aouchiche with 3.2% and 2.2% of the vote, respectively. Both were criticized for participating in an election that government critics denounced as a way for Algeria's political elite to make a show of democracy amid broader political repression. Throughout the campaign, each of the three campaigns emphasized participation, calling on voters and youth to participate and defy calls to boycott the ballot. The court announced nationwide turnout was 46.1%, surpassing the 2019 presidential election, when 39.9% of the electorate participated.	https://www.voanews.com/a/algerian-court-certifies-tebboune-s-landslide-reelection-win/7784401.html	2024-09-14T09:47:50-07:00	
US historian leads Kyiv charity run highlighting plight of Ukrainian POWs	KYIV, Ukraine — U.S. historian and author Timothy Snyder led a charity run in Kyiv Saturday to raise awareness of the conditions under which Ukrainian prisoners of war are held in Russia as the conflict approaches a third winter. The race came following a recent escalation in Russian missile and drone attacks, largely aimed at Ukraine's electricity infrastructure. People clapped and cheered after Snyder, a 55-year-old Yale University professor who has written extensively on eastern Europe and the global resurgence of authoritarian regimes and is much admired in Ukraine, addressed the nearly thousand runners. He then joined a workout and participated in the run. 'Thousands of Ukrainian civilians and soldiers are illegally held in captivity during an illegal war,' Snyder told The Associated Press just ahead of the run. 'This race is about reminding everyone of that and expressing solidarity with Ukrainians and giving Ukrainians a chance to do something together.' The 5K and 10-kilometer runs took place around a sprawling park in the Ukrainian capital created out of a renovated Soviet-era exhibition center. The runners included members of the public, service people and veterans, as well as wives of the POWs. Among them was 27-year-old Anastasia Ofyl, whose husband Oleksandr was captured by the Russians. 'We have to fight for him,' she said. 'That’s why I’m running.' Ukrainian soldiers often give harrowing accounts of their conditions in Russian captivity when they return home as part of regular prisoner exchanges. In a report issued in July, a United Nations human rights agency said it 'continued to document the widespread use of torture and ill-treatment, including sexual violence, against civilians and Ukrainian prisoners of war held by the Russian Federation.' Snyder, who has organized fundraisers as part of the country’s war-relief effort, enjoys near-celebrity status in Ukraine. On Tuesday, he visited President Volodymyr Zelenskyy, who thanked him for his charity work. The Ukrainian head of state also received former U.K. Prime Minister Boris Johnson, former U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo, and the American actor Michael Douglas this week. After Saturday’s race, Snyder was surrounded by admirers, many of whom waited in line for autographs and selfies. Some asked the historian to sign translated copies of his widely read books on Ukraine, 'Bloodlands: Europe between Hitler and Stalin' and 'The Road to Unfreedom: Russia, Europe, America.' Saturday’s race was organized by the Kyiv School of Economics’ charity foundation which, according to its website, has been raising funds for charitable assistance for Ukrainians since the start of the Russian invasion.	https://www.voanews.com/a/us-historian-leads-kyiv-charity-run-highlighting-plight-of-ukrainian-pows-/7784364.html	2024-09-14T09:06:58-07:00	
Salvagers again attempt to tow tanker damaged by Houthi rebels	DUBAI, United Arab Emirates — A new attempt has begun to try to salvage an oil tanker burning in the Red Sea after attacks by Yemen’s Houthi rebels, a European Union naval mission said Saturday. The EU’s Operation Aspides published images dated Saturday of its vessels escorting three ships heading to the Greek-flagged oil tanker Sounion. The mission has 'been actively involved in this complex endeavor, by creating a secure environment, which is necessary for the tugboats to conduct the towing operation,' the EU said. A phone number for the mission rang unanswered Saturday. However, satellite images taken Saturday morning by Planet Labs PBC and later analyzed by The Associated Press showed what appeared to be the three salvage vessels close to the Sounion. A warship could be seen nearby. The Sounion came under attack from the Houthis beginning Aug. 21. The vessel had been staffed by a crew of 25 Filipinos and Russians, as well as four private security personnel, who were taken by a French destroyer to nearby Djibouti. The Houthis later planted explosives aboard the ship and detonated them. That’s led to fears the ship’s 1 million barrels of crude oil could spill into the Red Sea. The Houthis have targeted more than 80 vessels with missiles and drones since the war in Gaza started in October. They seized one vessel and sank two in the campaign that also killed four sailors. One of the sunken vessels, the Tutor, went down after the Houthis planted explosives aboard it and after its crew abandoned it due to an earlier attack, the rebel group later acknowledged. Other missiles and drones have either been intercepted by a U.S.-led coalition in the Red Sea or failed to reach their targets. The rebels maintain that they target ships linked to Israel, the U.S. or the U.K. to force an end to Israel’s campaign against Hamas in Gaza. However, many of the ships attacked have little or no connection to the conflict, including some bound for Iran.	https://www.voanews.com/a/salvagers-again-attempt-to-tow-tanker-damaged-by-houthi-rebels/7784361.html	2024-09-14T08:56:40-07:00

5 dead in Romania as central Europe braces for severe flooding	BUCHAREST, Romania — Five people in eastern Romania were found dead after torrential rainstorms dumped unprecedented rain, leaving hundreds stranded in flooded areas, emergency authorities said Saturday. Rescue services scrambled to save people in the hard-hit eastern counties of Galati and Vaslui. The bodies of three elderly women and two men were found in the localities of Pechea, Draguseni, Costache Negri and Corod, the Department for Emergency Situations said. Authorities later added that one of the victims had been dead for two days and 'did not die due to the effects of the weather' but from other causes. Emergency authorities released video footage showing teams of rescuers evacuating people using small lifeboats through muddy waters and carrying some elderly people to safety. Some of the most significant flood damage was concentrated in Galati, where 5,000 households were affected. A Black Hawk helicopter was also deployed there to help with the search and rescue. The storms battered 19 localities in eight counties in Romania, with strong winds downing dozens of trees that damaged cars and blocked roads and traffic. Authorities sent text message alerts to residents to warn them of adverse weather as emergency services rushed to remove floodwaters from homes. By 1 p.m. Saturday, more than 250 people had been evacuated with the help of 700 Interior Ministry personnel deployed to affected communities, authorities said. Romania’s environment minister, Mircea Fechet, told The Associated Press that in some of the badly flooded areas, more than 160 liters of rain fell per one square meter, which he said is a rare occurrence. 'What we are trying to do right now is save as many lives as possible,' said the minister, who was on his way to Galati to assess the situation. Romanian President Klaus Iohannis offered his condolences to the victims' families, writing on Facebook: 'We must continue to strengthen our capacity to anticipate extreme weather phenomena. 'Severe floods that have affected a large part of the country have led to loss of lives and significant damage,' Iohannis said. 'We are again dealing with the effects of climate change, which are increasingly present throughout the European continent, with dramatic consequences on people.' Central Europe braces for intense flooding The stormy weather comes as several central European nations anticipate severe flooding to hit the Czech Republic, Poland, Austria, Germany, Slovakia and Hungary over the weekend. In the Czech Republic, river waters reached dangerous levels in dozens of areas across the country Saturday morning, flooding houses and roads in several towns and villages. Heavy rain and high winds left more than 63,000 households without power, the Czech power company CEZ said. A hospital in the country's second-largest city of Brno was forced to evacuate as dozens of citizens moved to safer grounds. Fallen trees and floodwaters caused a dozen railways across the country to also shutter. In neighboring Austria, authorities declared 24 villages in the northeast Lower Austria province disaster zones Saturday afternoon and began evacuating residents from those areas. 'The coming hours will be the hours of truth for flood protection, for our emergency forces and numerous compatriots,' State Governor Johanna Mikl-Leitner said, adding that in one area, 'we expect challenges of historical dimensions.' The torrential downpours have also caused a sharp rise in water levels on the Danube River in Austria's capital, Vienna, where special flood relief channels were built in the 1970s and ’80s and are likely to be tested over the weekend. The River Kamp, a tributary of the Danube, is also swelling due to the unprecedented weather. Heavy rain also hit Moldova on Saturday, where emergency workers pumped floodwater from dozens of peoples’ homes in several localities, authorities said. Meteorologists say a low-pressure system from northern Italy was predicted to dump much rain in most parts of the Czech Republic, including the capital and border regions with Austria and Germany in the south, and Poland in the north. 'We have to be ready for worst-case scenarios,' Czech Prime Minister Petr Fiala said after the government’s central crisis committee met. 'A tough weekend is ahead of us.' In Poland, dozens of people were evacuated as a precautionary measure Saturday from two villages near the town of Nysa, in the Nysa River basin, after meteorologists warned of unprecedented rainfall, and water levels on some rivers in the area sharply rose, according to Interior Minister Tomasz Siemoniak. 'The worst is yet to come,' he warned. Polish authorities appealed to residents Friday to stock up on food and to prepare for power outages by charging power banks. The weather change arrived following a hot start to September in the region. Scientists have documented Earth’s hottest summer, breaking a record set just one year ago. A hotter atmosphere, driven by human-caused climate change, can lead to more intense rainfall.	https://www.voanews.com/a/dead-in-romania-as-central-europe-braces-for-severe-flooding/7784322.html	2024-09-14T08:03:31-07:00	
Immigration takes center stage in debate, but no major proposals from candidates	When Kamala Harris and Donald Trump faced each other on the debate stage less than two months before Election Day, the two candidates were at odds on issues ranging from the economy to tariffs and Ukraine. But on immigration, their positions were especially different.

Prince Harry turns 40 as the royal scamp moves to middle age	LONDON — Prince Harry was always something different. From the moment he first appeared in public, snuggled in Princess Diana’s arms outside the London hospital where he was born in 1984, Harry was the ginger-haired scamp who stuck his tongue out at photographers. He grew to be a boisterous adolescent who was roundly criticized for wearing a Nazi uniform to a costume party, and then a young man who gave up the trappings of royal life and moved to Southern California with his American wife. Through it all, there was a sense that Harry was rebelling against an accident of birth that made him, in the harsh calculus of the House of Windsor, just 'the spare.' As the second son of the man who is now King Charles III, he was raised as a prince but wouldn’t inherit the throne unless brother William came to harm. Now the angry young man is turning 40, the halfway point in many lives, providing a chance to either dwell on the past or look forward to what might still be achieved. For the past four years, Harry has focused mainly on the past, making millions of dollars by airing his grievances in a wildly successful memoir and a Netflix docu-series. But he faces the likelihood that the royal aura so critical to his image may be fading, said Sally Bedell Smith, author of 'Charles: The Passions and Paradoxes of an Improbable Life.' 'He is at a sort of crossroads,’’ Smith told The Associated Press. 'And he appears to be struggling with how he wants to proceed.’’ How did we get here? It wasn’t always this way. Six years ago, Harry and his wife were among the most popular royals, a glamorous young couple who reflected the multicultural face of modern Britain and were expected to help revitalize the monarchy. Their wedding on May 19, 2018, united a grandson of Queen Elizabeth II with the former Meghan Markle, a biracial American actress who had starred for seven years in the U.S. television drama 'Suits.' George Clooney, Serena Williams and Elton John attended their wedding at Windsor Castle, after which the couple were formally known as the Duke and Duchess of Sussex. But the optimism quickly faded amid allegations that Britain’s tabloid media and even members of the royal household treated Meghan unfairly because of racism. By January 2020, the pressures of life in the gilded cage had become too much, and the couple announced they were giving up royal duties and moving to America, where they hoped to become 'financially independent.' They signed lucrative deals with Netflix and Spotify as they settled into the wealthy enclave of Montecito, near Santa Barbara, California. Since then, Harry has missed few opportunities to bare his soul, most famously in his memoir, aptly titled 'Spare.' In the ghostwritten book, Harry recounted his grief at the death of Princess Diana, a fight with Prince William and his unease with life in the royal shadow of his elder brother. From accounts of cocaine use and losing his virginity to raw family rifts, the book was rife with damning allegations about the royal family. Among the most toxic was Harry’s description of how some family members leaked unflattering information about other royals in exchange for positive coverage of themselves. The prince singled out his father’s second wife, Queen Camilla, accusing her of feeding private conversations to the media as she sought to rehabilitate an image tarnished by her role in the breakup of Charles’ marriage to Diana. The allegations were so venomous that there is little chance of a return to public duty, Smith said. 'He criticized the royal family in such a powerful and damaging way. You can’t un-say those things,' she said. 'And you can’t unsee things like Meghan in that Netflix series doing a mock curtsey. It’s such a demeaning gesture to the queen.’’ Harry, who agreed not to use the honorific HRH, or 'his royal highness,' after he stepped away from front-line royal duties, is now fifth in line to the British throne, behind his brother and William’s three children. While he grew up in a palace and is said to be in line to inherit millions of dollars on his 40th birthday from a trust set up by his great-grandmother, applied developmental psychologist Deborah Heiser thinks that, in many ways, Harry is just like the rest of us. Like anyone turning 40, he is likely to have learned a few lessons and has a good idea of who his real friends are, and that will help him chart the next phase of his life, said Heiser, who writes a blog called 'The Right Side of 40' for Psychology Today. 'He has had a very public display of what a lot of people have gone through,' Heiser said. 'I mean, most people are not princes, but … they have all kinds of issues within their families. He’s not alone. That’s why he’s so relatable.’’ Harry's next chapter Of course, Harry’s story isn’t just about the drama within the House of Windsor. If he wants to write a new chapter, Harry can build on his 10 years of service in the British Army. Before retiring as a captain in 2015, the prince earned his wings as a helicopter pilot, served two tours in Afghanistan and shed the hard-partying reputation of his youth. Harry also won accolades for establishing the Invictus Games in 2014, a Paralympic-style competition to inspire and aid in the rehabilitation of sick and wounded servicemembers and veterans. Harry and Meghan made headlines this year with their two international trips to promote mental health and internet safety. While some in British media criticized them for accepting royal treatment in Nigeria and Colombia, the couple said they visited at the invitation of local officials. Will Charles see the grandkids? The prospects of reconciliation are unclear, although Harry did race home to see his father after Charles' cancer diagnosis. And in what may be seen as a tentative olive branch, the paperback edition of 'Spare' slated for October has no additions — so nothing new to stir the pot. But plainly at this point, Harry is thinking about his family in California. He told the BBC about the importance of his two young children, Archie and Lilibet. 'Being a dad is one of life’s greatest joys and has only made me more driven and more committed to making this world a better place,' the prince said in a statement released by his spokesperson.	https://www.voanews.com/a/prince-harry-turns-40-as-the-royal-scamp-moves-to-middle-age/7784290.html	2024-09-14T07:31:55-07:00	
Russia, Ukraine exchange 206 prisoners in second swap in two days	KYIV, UKRAINE — Russia and Ukraine conducted a major exchange of prisoners Saturday, 206 in all, in their second such swap in two days, following negotiations mediated by the United Arab Emirates, officials said. President Volodymyr Zelenskyy said that all 103 Ukrainians returned were from the military — 82 soldiers and privates and 21 officers. The Russian Defense Ministry said that the 103 Russian soldiers exchanged had been taken prisoner in the Kursk border region where Ukrainian forces launched a surprise incursion in August. 'Our people are home,' Zelenskyy said on the Telegram messaging app. 'We have successfully brought back another 103 warriors from Russian captivity to Ukraine.' Zelenskyy posted pictures of servicemen wrapped in the national blue and yellow flag, hugging each other, talking on mobile phones and posing for group photographs at an undisclosed location. The exchange was mediated by the UAE, Emirati state news agency WAM said. It was the country's eighth such mediation since the start of 2024, it said. Kyiv and Moscow have frequently exchanged prisoners since Russia's full-scale invasion in February 2022, and Saturday's swap was the third since Ukraine began its incursion into the Kursk region. Ukrainian officials have previously said its troops had captured at least 600 Russian soldiers during the incursion, and that this would help it secure the return of captured Ukrainians. Dmytro Lubinets, Ukraine's ombudsman, said most of the freed Ukrainians had been in Russian captivity since the early days of the invasion. He posted a short video on the Telegram messaging app showing the servicemen standing in front of a bus and shouting 'Glory to Ukraine.' Lubinets said that Kyiv had so far secured the return of 3,672 Ukrainians in 57 exchanges.	https://www.voanews.com/a/russia-ukraine-exchange-206-prisoners-in-second-swap-in-two-days/7784271.html	2024-09-14T07:04:43-07:00	
Israel strikes Gaza as American activist killed by Israeli fire is buried	DEIR AL-BALAH, Gaza Strip — Israeli airstrikes hit central and southern Gaza overnight into Saturday, killing at least 14 people as friends and family members of a Turkish-American activist killed by an Israeli soldier honored her in a funeral. The airstrikes in Gaza City hit one home housing 11 people, including three women and four children, and another strike hit a tent in Khan Younis with Palestinians displaced by the Israel-Hamas war, Gaza's Civil Defense said Saturday. They followed airstrikes earlier this week that hit a tent camp on Tuesday and a United Nations school sheltering displaced people on Wednesday. Polio vaccination campaign A campaign to inoculate children in Gaza against polio drew down, and the World Health Organization said about 559,000 people under the age of 10 — seven out of every eight children the campaign aimed to vaccinate — have recovered from their first dose. The second doses are expected to begin later this month as part of an effort in which the WHO said parties had already agreed to. 'As we prepare for the next round in four weeks, we’re hopeful these pauses will hold, because this campaign has clearly shown the world what’s possible when peace is given a chance,' Richard Peeperkorn, WHO’s representative in Gaza and the West Bank, said in a statement on Saturday. Turkish-American activist buried In Turkey, activist Aysenur Ezgi Eygi, the 26-year-old from Seattle who held U.S. and Turkish citizenships, was laid to rest in her hometown of Didim on the Aegean Sea. The Israeli military has said that Eygi was likely shot 'indirectly and unintentionally' by Israeli forces in the occupied West Bank on September 6. Turkey announced it will conduct its own investigation into her death. An Israeli protester who witnessed the shooting said she was killed after a demonstration against Israeli settlements. 'We are not going to leave our daughter’s blood on the ground, and we demand responsibility and accountability for this murder,' Numan Kurtulus, the speaker of Turkey's parliament, told mourners. Eygi's body had been earlier brought from a hospital to her family home and Didim's Central Mosque. Thousands of people bid her farewell in the town's streets, which were lined with Turkish flags. Her death was condemned by U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken as the United States, Egypt and Qatar push for a cease-fire and the release of the remaining hostages held by Hamas. Talks have repeatedly bogged down as Israel and Hamas accuse each other of making new and unacceptable demands. The war began when Hamas-led fighters killed some 1,200 people, mostly civilians, in an October 7 terror attack on southern Israel. They abducted 250 people and are still holding about 100 hostages after releasing most of the rest in exchange for Palestinians imprisoned by Israel during a weeklong cease-fire in November. About a third of the remaining hostages are believed to be dead. The United States, the U.K. and other Western countries designate Hamas as a terror group. The war has caused vast destruction and displaced roughly 90% of Gaza’s population of 2.3 million, often multiple times, and plunged the territory into a severe humanitarian crisis. Gaza’s Health Ministry says upwards of 41,000 Palestinians have been killed since the war began. The ministry does not distinguish between civilians and militants in its count, but says women and children make up just over half of the dead. Israel says it has killed more than 17,000 militants in the war.	https://www.voanews.com/a/israel-strikes-gaza-as-american-activist-killed-by-israeli-fire-is-buried/7784260.html	2024-09-14T06:44:29-07:00	
Comoros president 'out of danger' after knife attack, minister says	MORONI, COMOROS — Comoros President Azali Assoumani is 'out of danger' after he was injured on Friday in a knife attack by a 24-year-old police officer who was found dead in his cell a day later, officials said Saturday. The attack occurred around 2 p.m. Friday in Salimani Itsandra, a town just north of the capital, Moroni. 'The president is doing well. He has no health problems; he is out of danger. A few stitches were given,' Energy Minister Aboubacar Said Anli said at a press conference in Moroni on Saturday. Azali was attacked as he attended a funeral, according to the presidency. The motive for the attack has not yet been determined. The attacker, Ahmed Abdou, went on leave Wednesday before orchestrating the attack on Friday. Abdou was placed in a cell after he was taken into custody. However, 'this Saturday morning, when investigators went to see him, they found him lying on the ground, his body was lifeless,' Ali Mohamed Djounaid, Comoros' public prosecutor, said at a separate press conference. He added that an investigation was being conducted to determine the motive of the attack and the cause of his death. In May, Assoumani was sworn in for a fourth term in office following a tense January election, which his opponents claim was tainted by voter fraud. Officials deny the allegations.	https://www.voanews.com/a/comoros-president-out-of-danger-after-knife-attack-minister-says/7784241.html	2024-09-14T06:19:34-07:00	
Tropical storm brings heavy rains over southern Gulf of California	MEXICO CITY — Mexico issued a tropical storm warning Saturday along the coast, from Altata to Huatabampito, and has discontinued all watches and warnings for Baja California Sur after rain from Storm Ileana pounded the resort-studded Los Cabos a day before. Ileana moved northward over the southern Gulf of California at 11 kph, according to the U.S. National Hurricane Center. The storm was about 110 kilometers east of La Paz, Mexico, with maximum sustained winds of 65 kph, the center said. Tropical storm warnings have been issued for the coasts of northern Sinaloa and extreme southern Sonola. On Friday, a warning was in effect for portions of the Baja California Peninsula, including Cabo San Lucas and San Jose del Cabo. Juan Manuel Arce Ortega of Los Cabos Civil Protection said the municipalities of La Paz and Los Cabos were on red alert at the time and urged residents to avoid crossing rivers, streams and low areas where they can be swept away by water. All schools in Los Cabos were suspended Friday due to the storm. Oscar Cruces Rodriguez of Mexico’s federal Civil Protection said in a statement that residents should avoid leaving their homes until the storm passes and if residents are in an area at risk of flooding, to find temporary shelters. Authorities prepared 20 temporary shelters in San Jose del Cabo and Cabo San Lucas, according to Los Cabos Civil Protection. At the Hacienda Beach Club and Residences in Cabo San Lucas, valet worker Alan Galvan said the rain arrived late Thursday and has been constant. 'The rain isn’t very strong right now, but the waves are choppy,' he said. 'The guests are very calm and already came down for coffee,' Galvan said. 'There’s some flights canceled, but everything is OK at the moment.' Galvan said they are awaiting further advisories from authorities. The rain remained consistent through Los Cabos Friday afternoon, with several roads flooded and some resorts stacking up sandbags on their perimeters. Some people were still walking around boat docks with their umbrellas. 'The priority has to be safety, starting with the workers. We always have to check on our colleagues who live in risk areas,' said Lyzzette Liceaga, a tour operator at Los Cabos. 'We give them the information shared by the authorities — firefighters in risk areas — so that they can go to the shelters, if necessary.'	https://www.voanews.com/a/tropical-storm-brings-heavy-rains-over-southern-gulf-of-california/7784228.html	2024-09-14T06:00:51-07:00	
Mourners pay respects to Ugandan athlete who died after partner set her on fire	BUKWO, Uganda — Dozens of mourners in Uganda paid respects to Rebecca Cheptegei, the Olympic athlete who died last week in Kenya after her partner set her on fire. Local leaders and others gathered at the local administration hall Saturday as they awaited her burial at her ancestral home in a village near the Kenya border. Cheptegei died after her body suffered 80% burns in the attack by Dickson Ndiema, who doused her in gasoline at her home in western Kenya’s Trans-Nzoia County on September 3. Ndiema sustained 30% burns on his body and later died. According to a report filed by the local chief, they quarreled over a piece of land the athlete bought in Kenya. The horrific gasoline attack shocked many and strengthened calls for the protection of female runners facing exploitation and abuse in the East African country. Cheptegei’s body was returned to Uganda Friday in a somber procession following a street march by dozens of activists in the western Kenyan town of Eldoret who demanded an end to physical violence against female athletes. Cheptegei, who was 33, is the fourth female athlete to have been killed by her partner in Kenya in a pattern of gender-based violence in recent years. Kenya’s high rate of violence against women has prompted several marches this year. Ugandan officials have condemned the attack, demanding justice for Cheptegei. Janet Museveni, who serves as Uganda’s education and sports minister, described the attack as 'deeply disturbing.' Don Rukare, chair of the National Council of Sports of Uganda, said in a statement on X that the attack was 'a cowardly and senseless act that has led to the loss of a great athlete.' Four in 10 dating or married Kenyan women have experienced physical or sexual violence perpetrated by their current or most recent partner, according to the 2022 Kenya Demographic and Health Survey. Many Ugandan athletes train across the border in Kenya, an athletics powerhouse with better facilities. Some of the region’s best runners train together at a high-altitude center in Kenya’s west. Cheptegei competed in the women’s marathon at the Paris Olympics, finishing in 44th place, less than a month before the attack. She had represented Uganda at other competitions.	https://www.voanews.com/a/mourners-pay-respects-to-ugandan-athlete-who-died-after-partner-set-her-on-fire/7784220.html	2024-09-14T05:48:10-07:00	
Bomb blast in southwest Pakistan kills two police officers	ISLAMABAD — A bomb explosion in Pakistan’s violence-hit southwestern Baluchistan province ripped through a police vehicle Saturday, killing at least two officers and wounding as many others. Abdul Hameed, an area police officer, told VOA by phone that the attack occurred on a main highway passing through Kuchlak near the provincial capital of Quetta. He said that a homemade bomb targeted a police mobile unit and that an investigation into the incident was underway. There were no immediate claims of responsibility for the deadly bombing in the natural resources-rich Pakistani province, where separatist ethnic Baluch groups routinely target security forces. Pakistani Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif condemned Saturday’s attack on the police as a terrorist act, his office said in a statement in Islamabad. A daylong series of insurgent attacks rattled Baluchistan last month, killing more than 50 civilians and security personnel. The outlawed Baluch Liberation Army, the largest of all the separatist groups active in the province, claimed responsibility for orchestrating the violence, which targeted security installations and passenger vehicles. The BLA, designated as a global terrorist group by the United States, has lately intensified its attacks in Baluchistan. The province shares Pakistan’s border with Afghanistan and Iran and hosts major China-funded infrastructure projects.	https://www.voanews.com/a/bomb-blast-in-southwest-pakistan-kills-two-police-officers/7784207.html	2024-09-14T05:02:21-07:00	
Iran says it successfully launched a satellite	TEHRAN, Iran — Iran launched a satellite into space Saturday with a rocket built by the country's paramilitary Revolutionary Guard, state-run media reported, the latest for a program the West fears helps Tehran advance its ballistic missile program. Iran described the launch as a success, which would be the second such launch to put a satellite into orbit with the rocket. There was no immediate independent confirmation of the launch's success, nor did Iranian authorities immediately provide footage or other details. The launch comes amid heightened tensions gripping the wider Middle East over the ongoing Israel-Hamas war in the Gaza Strip, during which Tehran launched an unprecedented direct missile-and-drone attack on Israel. Meanwhile, Iran continues to enrich uranium to nearly weapons-grade levels, raising concerns among nonproliferation experts about Tehran's program. Iran identified the satellite-carrying rocket as the Qaem-100, which the Guard used in January for another successful launch. Qaem means 'upright' in Iran's Farsi language. The solid-fuel rocket put the Chamran-1 satellite, weighing 60 kilograms, into a 550-kilometer orbit, state media reported. The U.S. State Department and the American military did not immediately respond to requests for comment over the Iranian launch. The United States had previously said Iran's satellite launches defy a U.N. Security Council resolution and called on Tehran to undertake no activity involving ballistic missiles capable of delivering nuclear weapons. U.N. sanctions related to Iran's ballistic missile program expired last October. Under Iran's relatively moderate former President Hassan Rouhani, the Islamic Republic slowed its space program for fear of raising tensions with the West. Hard-line President Ebrahim Raisi, a protege of Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei who came to power in 2021, has pushed the program forward. Raisi died in a helicopter crash in May. It's unclear what Iran's new president, the reformist Masoud Pezeshkian, wants for the program as he was silent on the issue while campaigning. The U.S. intelligence community's worldwide threat assessment this year said Iran's development of satellite launch vehicles 'would shorten the timeline' for Iran to develop an intercontinental ballistic missile because it uses similar technology. Intercontinental ballistic missiles can be used to deliver nuclear weapons. Iran is now producing uranium close to weapons-grade levels after the collapse of its nuclear deal with world powers. Tehran has enough enriched uranium for 'several' nuclear weapons, if it chooses to produce them, the head of the International Atomic Energy Agency repeatedly has warned. Iran has always denied seeking nuclear weapons and says its space program, like its nuclear activities, is for purely civilian purposes. However, U.S. intelligence agencies and the IAEA say Iran had an organized military nuclear program up until 2003. The launch also came ahead of the second anniversary of the death of 22-year-old Mahsa Amini, which sparked nationwide protests against Iran's mandatory headscarf, or hijab, law and the country's Shiite theocracy.	https://www.voanews.com/a/iran-says-it-successfully-launched-a-satellite-/7784161.html	2024-09-14T02:04:03-07:00	
Women in Iran are going without hijabs as the 2nd anniversary of Amini's death nears	DUBAI, United Arab Emirates — On the streets of Iranian cities, it's becoming more common to see a woman passing by without a mandatory headscarf, or hijab, as the second anniversary of the death of Mahsa Amini and the mass protests it sparked approaches. There's no government official or study acknowledging the phenomenon, which began as Iran entered its hot summer months and power cuts in its overburdened electrical system became common. But across social media, videos of people filming neighborhood streets or just talking about a normal day in their life, women and girls can be seen walking past with their long hair out over their shoulders, particularly after sunset. This defiance comes despite what United Nations investigators describe as 'expanded repressive measures and policies' by Iran's theocracy to punish them — though there's been no recent catalyzing event like Amini's death to galvanize demonstrators. The country's new reformist President Masoud Pezeshkian campaigned on a promise to halt the harassment of women by morality police. But the country's ultimate authority remains the 85-year-old Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, who in the past said 'unveiling is both religiously forbidden and politically forbidden.' For some observant Muslim women, the head covering is a sign of piety before God and modesty in front of men outside their families. In Iran, the hijab — and the all-encompassing black chador worn by some — has long been a political symbol as well. 'Meaningful institutional changes and accountability for gross human rights violations and crimes under international law, and crimes against humanity, remains elusive for victims and survivors, especially for women and children,' warned a U.N. fact-finding mission on Iran on Friday. Amini, 22, died on September 16, 2022, in a hospital after her arrest by the country's morality police over not wearing her hijab to the liking of the authorities. The protests that followed Amini's death started first with the chant 'Women, Life, Freedom.' However, the protesters' cries soon grew into open calls of revolt against Khamenei. A monthslong security crackdown that followed killed more than 500 people and saw over 22,000 detained. Today, passersby on the streets of Tehran, whether its tony northern suburbs for the wealthy or the working-class neighborhoods of the capital's southern reaches, now routinely see women without the hijab. It particularly starts at dusk, though even during the daylight on weekends women can be seen with their hair uncovered at major parks. Online videos — specifically a sub-genre showing walking tours of city streets for those in rural areas or abroad who want to see life in the bustling neighborhoods of Tehran — include women without the hijab. Something that would have stopped a person in their tracks in the decades following the 1979 Islamic Revolution now goes unacknowledged. 'My quasi-courage for not wearing scarves is a legacy of Mahsa Amini and we have to protect this as an achievement,' said a 25-year-old student at Tehran Sharif University, who gave only her first name Azadeh out of fear of reprisal. 'She could be at my current age if she did not pass away.' The disobedience still comes with risk. Months after the protests halted, Iranian morality police returned to the streets. There have been scattered videos of women and young girls being roughed up by officers in the time since. In 2023, a teenage Iranian girl was injured in a mysterious incident on Tehran's Metro while not wearing a headscarf and later died in hospital. In July, activists say police opened fire on a woman fleeing a checkpoint in an attempt to avoid her car being impounded for her not wearing the hijab. Meanwhile, the government has targeted private businesses where women are seen without their headscarves. Surveillance cameras search for women uncovered in vehicles to fine and impound their cars. The government has gone as far as use aerial drones to monitor the 2024 Tehran International Book Fair and Kish Island for uncovered women, the U.N. said. Yet some feel the election of Pezeshkian in July, after a helicopter crash killed Iranian hard-line President Ebrahim Raisi in May, is helping ease tensions over the hijab. 'I think the current peaceful environment is part of the status after Pezeshkian took office,' said Hamid Zarrinjouei, a 38-year-old bookseller. 'In some way, Pezeshkian could convince powerful people that more restrictions do not necessarily make women more faithful to the hijab.' On Wednesday, Iran's Prosecutor General Mohammad Movahedi Azad warned security forces about starting physical altercations over the hijab. 'We prosecuted violators, and we will,' Movahedi Azad said, according to Iranian media. 'Nobody has right to have improper attitude even though an individual commits an offense.' While the government isn't directly addressing the increase in women not wearing hijabs, there are other signs of a recognition the political landscape has shifted. In August, authorities dismissed a university teacher a day after he appeared on state television and dismissively referred to Amini as having 'croaked.' Meanwhile, the pre-reform newspaper Ham Mihan reported in August on an unpublished survey conducted under the supervision of Iran's Ministry of Culture and Islamic Guidance that found the hijab had become one of the most important issues in the country — something it hadn't seen previously. 'This issue has been on people's minds more than ever before,' sociologist Simin Kazemi told the newspaper.	https://www.voanews.com/a/women-in-iran-are-going-without-hijabs-as-the-2nd-anniversary-of-amini-s-death-nears/7784156.html	2024-09-14T00:56:38-07:00	
On the streets of a Colorado city, pregnant migrants struggle to survive	AURORA, Colorado — She was eight months pregnant when she was forced to leave her Denver homeless shelter. It was November. Ivanni Herrera took her 4-year-old son, Dylan, by the hand and led him into the chilly night, dragging a suitcase containing donated clothes and blankets away from the Microtel Inn & Suites. It was one of 10 hotels where Denver has housed more than 30,000 migrants, many of them Venezuelan, over the last two years. First, they walked to Walmart. There, with money she and her husband earned begging on the street, they bought a tent. They chose for their new home a grassy median along a busy thoroughfare in Aurora, the next town over, a suburb known for its immigrant population. 'We wanted to go somewhere where there were people,' Herrera, 28, said in Spanish. 'It feels safer.' That night, temperatures dipped to 32 degrees. And as she wrapped her body around her son's, Ivanni Herrera cried. Over the past two years, a record number of Venezuelans have come to the United States seeking a better life. Instead, they’ve found themselves in communities roiling over how much to help the newcomers — or whether to help at all. Unable to legally work without filing expensive and complicated paperwork, some have found themselves sleeping on the streets — even those who are pregnant. Herrera had found inspiration for her journey to the U.S. on social media. On Facebook and TikTok, young, smiling Venezuelan migrants in nice clothes stood in front of new cars. Some 320,000 Venezuelans have tried to cross the U.S. border since October 2022, according to U.S. Border Patrol reports — more than in the previous nine years combined. Just weeks after arriving in Denver, Herrera began to wonder if the success she had seen was real. She was seeing doctors and social workers at a Denver hospital where she planned to give birth because they served everyone, even those without insurance. They were alarmed their pregnant patient was now sleeping outside in the cold. In Colorado's third-largest city, Aurora, officials have turned down requests to help migrants. In February, the City Council passed a resolution telling other cities and nonprofits not to bring migrants into the community because it 'does not currently have the financial capacity to fund new services.' Yet still they come, because of its lower cost of living and Spanish-speaking community. Former President Donald Trump last week called attention to the city, suggesting a Venezuelan gang had taken over an apartment complex. Authorities say that hasn’t happened. The doctors urged Herrera to sleep at the hospital. It wouldn’t cost anything, they assured her, just as her birth would be covered by emergency Medicaid. Herrera refused. 'How,' she asked, 'could I sleep in a warm place when my son is cold on the street?' Denver struggled to keep up with the rush of migrants, many arriving on buses chartered by Texas to draw attention to the impact of immigration. All told, Denver officials say they have helped some 42,700 migrants since last year, either by giving them shelter or a bus fare to another city. Initially, the city offered migrants with families six weeks in a hotel. But any migrants arriving since May have received only three days in a hotel. After that, some have found transportation to other cities, scrounged for a place to sleep or wandered into nearby towns like Aurora. Today, fewer migrants are coming to the Denver area. But Candice Marley, founder of a nonprofit called All Souls, still receives dozens of outreaches per week from social service agencies looking to help homeless migrants. All Souls had run encampments for migrants, but Denver shut them down because they lacked a permit. 'It’s so frustrating that we can’t help them,' Marley said. 'That leaves families camping on their own, unsupported, living in their cars. Kids can’t get into school. There’s no stability.' When Herrera started feeling labor pains in early December, she waited until she couldn’t bear the pain anymore and could feel the baby getting close. She called an ambulance. The paramedics didn’t speak Spanish but called an interpreter. They told Herrera they had to take her to the closest hospital, instead of the one in Denver, since her contractions were so close together. Her son was born healthy at 7 pounds, 8 ounces. She took him to the tent the next day. A few days later the whole family, including the baby, had contracted chicken pox. 'The baby was in a bad state,' said Emily Rodriguez, a close friend living with her family in a tent next to Herrera’s. Herrera took him to the hospital, then returned to the tent before being offered a way out. An Aurora woman originally from Mexico invited the family to live with her — at first, for free. After a couple weeks, the family moved to a small room in the garage for $800 a month. To earn rent and pay expenses, Herrera and Rodriguez have cleaned homes, painted houses and shoveled snow while their children waited in a car by themselves. Finding regular work and actually getting paid for it has been difficult. While their husbands can get semi-regular work in construction, the women’s most consistent income comes from standing outside with their children and begging. On a good day, each earns about $50. Herrera and her husband recently became eligible to apply for work permits and legal residency for Venezuelans who arrived in the United States last year. But it will cost $800 each for a lawyer to file the paperwork, along with hundreds of dollars in government fees. They don't have the money. What's worse, they're deeply in debt. Despite what the hospital had said when she was pregnant, Herrera was never signed up for emergency Medicaid. She says she owes $18,000 for the ambulance ride and delivery of her baby. Now, she avoids going to the doctor or taking her children because she’s afraid her large debt will jeopardize her chances of staying in the U.S. 'I’m afraid they’re going to deport me,' she says. Herrera and Rodriguez now hold cardboard signs along a busy street in Denver and then knock on the doors of private homes, never returning to the same address. They type up their request for clothes, food or money on their phones and translate it to English using Google. They hand their phones to whoever answers the door. Herrera recently sent $500 to her sister to make the monthslong trip from Venezuela to Aurora with Herrera’s 8-year-old daughter. 'I’ll have my family back together,' she says. And she believes her sister will be able to watch her kids so Herrera can look for work. The problem is, Herrera hasn’t told her family back in Venezuela how she spends her time. 'They think I’m fixing up homes and selling chocolate and flowers,' she says. 'I’m living a lie.' Finally, her sister and daughter are waiting across the border in Mexico. When we come to America, her sister asks, could we fly to Denver? The tickets are $600. Herrera has to come clean. Life is far more difficult than she has let on. She texts back: No.	https://www.voanews.com/a/on-the-streets-of-a-colorado-city-pregnant-migrants-struggle-to-survive/7780514.html	2024-09-14T00:00:00-07:00	
Ohio city reshaped by Haitian immigrants lands in unwelcome spotlight	SPRINGFIELD, Ohio — Many cities have been reshaped by immigrants in the last few years without attracting much notice. Not Springfield, Ohio. Its story of economic renewal and related growing pains has been thrust into the national conversation in a presidential election year — and maliciously distorted by false rumors that Haitian immigrants are eating their neighbors' pets. Donald Trump amplified those lies during Tuesday's nationally televised debate, exacerbating some residents' fears about growing divisiveness in the predominantly white, blue-collar city of about 60,000. At the city's Haitian Community Help and Support Center on Wednesday, Rose-Thamar Joseph said many of the roughly 15,000 immigrants who arrived in the past few years were drawn by good jobs and the city's relative affordability. But a rising sense of unease has crept in as longtime residents increasingly bristle at newcomers taking jobs at factories, driving up housing costs, worsening traffic and straining city services. 'Some of them are talking about living in fear. Some of them are scared for their life,' Joseph said. A 'Welcome To Our City' sign hangs from a parking garage downtown, where a coffee shop, bakery and boutique line Springfield's main drag, North Fountain Street. A flag advertising 'CultureFest,' the city's annual celebration of unity through diversity, waves from a pole nearby. Melanie Flax Wilt, a Republican commissioner in the county where Springfield is located, said she has been pushing for community and political leaders to 'stop feeding the fear.' 'After the election and everybody's done using Springfield, Ohio, as a talking point for immigration reform, we are going to be the ones here still living through the challenges and coming up with the solutions,' she said. Ariel Dominique, executive director of the Haitian American Foundation for Democracy, said she laughed at first at the absurdity of the false claims. But seeing the comments repeated on national television by the former president was painful. 'It is so unfair and unjust and completely contrary to what we have contributed to the world, what we have contributed to this nation for so long,' Dominique said. The falsehoods about Springfield's Haitian immigrants were spread online by Trump's running mate, JD Vance, on the eve of Tuesday's debate between Trump and Vice President Kamala Harris. It's part of a timeworn American political tradition of casting immigrants as outsiders. 'This is what's happening in our country. And it's a shame,' Trump said at the debate after repeating the falsehoods. When challenged by ABC News moderator David Muir over the false claims, Trump held firm, saying 'people on television' said their dogs were eaten, but he offered no evidence. Officials in Springfield have tried to tamp down the misinformation by saying there have been no credible or detailed reports of any pets being abducted or eaten. State leaders are trying to help address some of the real challenges facing the city. Ohio Gov. Mike DeWine, a Republican, said Tuesday he would add more law enforcement and health care resources to an aid package the state has already provided to Springfield. Many Haitians have come to the U.S. to flee poverty and violence. They have embraced President Joe Biden's new and expanded legal pathways to enter, and have shunned illegal crossings, accounting for only 92 border arrests out of more than 56,000 in July, the latest data available. The Biden administration recently announced an estimated 300,000 Haitians in the U.S. could remain in the country at least through February 2026, with eligibility for work authorization, under a law called Temporary Protected Status. The goal is to spare people from being deported to countries in turmoil. Springfield, about 72 kilometers from the state capital of Columbus, suffered a steep decline in its manufacturing sector toward the end of the last century, and its population shrank as a result. But its downtown has been revitalized in recent years as more Haitians arrived and helped meet the rising demand for labor as the economy emerged from the pandemic. Officials say Haitians now account for about 15% of the population. The city was shaken last year when a minivan slammed into a school bus, killing an 11-year-old boy. The driver was a Haitian man who recently settled in the area and was driving without a valid license. During a city commission meeting on Tuesday, the boy's parents condemned politicians' use of their son's death to stoke hatred. Last week, a post on the social media platform X shared what looked like a screengrab of a social media post apparently out of Springfield. The post claimed without evidence that the person's 'neighbor's daughter's friend' saw a cat hanging from a tree to be butchered and eaten, outside a house where it claimed Haitians lived. It was accompanied by a photo of a Black man carrying what appeared to be a goose by its feet. On Monday, Vance posted on X: 'Reports now show that people have had their pets abducted and eaten by people who shouldn't be in this country.' The next day, he posted again, saying his office had received inquiries from Springfield residents who said 'their neighbors' pets or local wildlife were abducted by Haitian migrants.' Longtime Springfield resident Chris Hazel, who knows the park and neighborhood where the pet and goose abductions were purported to have happened, called the claims 'preposterous.' 'It reminds me of when people used to accuse others and outsiders as cannibals. It's dehumanizing a community,' he said of the accusations against the city's Haitian residents. Sophia Pierrilus, the daughter of a former Haitian diplomat who moved to the Ohio capital of Columbus 15 years ago and is now an immigrant advocate, agreed, calling it all political. 'My view is that's their way to use Haitians as a scapegoat to bring some kind of chaos in America,' she said. With its rising population of immigrants, Springfield is hardly an outlier. So far this decade, immigration has accounted for almost three-quarters of U.S. population growth, with 2.5 million immigrants arriving in the United States between 2020 and 2023, according to the U.S. Census Bureau. Population growth is an important driver of economic growth. 'The Haitian immigrants who started moving to Springfield the last few years are the reason why the economy and the labor force has been revitalized there,' said Guerline Jozef, executive director of the Haitian Bridge Alliance, which provides legal and social services to immigrants across the U.S. Now, she said, Haitians in Springfield have told her that, out of fear, they are considering leaving the city.	https://www.voanews.com/a/ohio-city-reshaped-by-haitian-immigrants-lands-in-unwelcome-spotlight/7781154.html	2024-09-14T00:00:00-07:00

Share of foreign-born people in US is at highest rate in over a century, survey says	miami — The percentage of U.S. residents who were foreign-born last year grew to its highest level in more than a century, according to figures released Thursday from the most comprehensive survey of American life. The share of people born outside the United States increased in 2023 to 14.3% from 13.9% in 2022, according to estimates from the U.S. Census Bureau's annual American Community Survey, which tracks commuting times, internet access, family life, income, education levels, disabilities, military service and employment, among other topics. International migrants have become a primary driver of population growth this decade, increasing their share of the overall population as fewer children are being born in the U.S. compared with numbers from years past. The rate of the foreign-born population in the United States hasn't been this high since 1910, when it was 14.7%, driven by waves of people emigrating in search of a better life. 'We knew that here you can have savings, live well. Here you can have normal services such as water and electricity,' said Luciana Bracho, who moved legally to Miami from Venezuela as part of a humanitarian parole program with her boyfriend, parents and brother in April 2023. 'I like Miami and the opportunities that I have had.' In 2023, international migrants accounted for more than two-thirds of the population growth in the United States, and so far this decade they have made up almost three-quarters of U.S. growth. The growth appears to have been driven by people coming from Latin America, whose share of the foreign-born population increased year-over-year to 51.2% from 50.3%, according to the estimates. Latin America was the only world region of origin to experience an increase among those U.S. residents born in another country, as the share of foreign-born residents from Europe and Asia dropped slightly. Nicole Díaz, a Venezuelan opposition activist, left after receiving threats to her life and lived in Peru and Ecuador before moving to the Miami area legally in February 2023 with her husband and 9-year-old daughter. Díaz described herself as '100% happy' living in South Florida, where they pay $2,300 a month for a two-bedroom apartment. 'After being in different countries, working here is relaxed, despite the language,' Díaz said. 'But housing is very expensive, and we have been evaluating moving to another state because here all the salary goes for the rent.' Among the states with the largest year-over-year bumps in the foreign-born population was Delaware, going to 11.2% from 9.9%; Georgia, to 11.6% from 10.7%; and New Mexico, to 10.2% from 9.3% The share of the foreign-born population dropped slightly in Washington, D.C., Idaho, Iowa, Maine, Minnesota, Montana, North Dakota and Oregon. The Census Bureau figures don't distinguish whether people are in the United States legally or illegally. Illegal immigration has become a top issue in the 2024 presidential race, even as illegal border crossings from Mexico plunged this summer after reaching a record last December. The share of U.S. residents who identify as Hispanic, no matter what race, rose last year to 19.4% from 19.1% in the previous year, according to the survey. At the same time, those who identify as non-Hispanic white alone dropped from 57.7% to 57.1%. The share of U.S. residents who identify as Black alone dropped slightly, from 12.2% to 12.1%, and it increased slightly for those who identify as Asian alone from 5.9% to 6%. Residents in the United States continued to get older, with the median age increasing from 39 in 2022 to 39.2 in 2023. The nation's aging is taking place as a majority of baby boomers have become senior citizens and millennials are entering middle age. While the share of children under age 18 remained steady at 21.7% year-over-year, the share of senior citizens age 65 and over increased to 17.7% from 17.3%. Meanwhile, a post-pandemic bump in working from home continued its slide back to pre-COVID-19 times, as the share of employees working from home dropped last year to 13.8% from 15.2% in the previous year. In 2021, the first full year after the pandemic's start, almost 18% of employees were working from home, up from 5.7% in 2019. But return-to-office mandates in the past two years have reversed that trend and caused commute times to bump up slightly last year, growing on average to 26.8 minutes from 26.4 minutes. The survey also showed that the median cost of renting, plus utilities and related expenses, grew faster than median home values in 2023 for the first time in a decade. The 3.8% jump in rental costs was the largest annual increase since at least 2011. Despite the spike in rental costs, the share of renter income spent on rent and utilities remained unchanged at 31% in 2023, suggesting that incomes kept pace with rent hikes, the Census Bureau said.	https://www.voanews.com/a/share-of-foreign-born-people-in-us-is-at-highest-rate-in-over-a-century-survey-says-/7782615.html	2024-09-14T00:00:00-07:00	
New York City lawmakers approve bill to study slavery and reparations	NEW YORK — New York City lawmakers approved legislation Thursday to study the city's significant role in slavery and consider reparations to descendants of enslaved people. If signed into law, the package of bills passed by the City Council would follow in the footsteps of several other municipalities across the U.S. that have sought ways to address the country's dark history, as well as a separate New York state commission that began working this year. New York fully abolished slavery in 1827. But businesses, including the predecessors of some modern banks, continued to benefit financially from the slave trade — likely up until 1866. The lawmakers behind the proposals noted that the harms caused by the institution are still felt by Black Americans today. 'The reparations movement is often misunderstood as merely a call for compensation,' Council Member Farah Louis, a Democrat who sponsored one of the bills, told the City Council on Thursday. She explained that systemic forms of oppression are still impacting people through redlining, environmental racism and services in predominantly Black neighborhoods that are underfunded. The bills still need to be signed by Democratic Mayor Eric Adams. City Hall signaled his support in a statement calling the legislation 'another crucial step towards addressing systemic inequities, fostering reconciliation, and creating a more just and equitable future for all New Yorkers.' The bills would direct the city's Commission on Racial Equity to suggest remedies to the legacy of slavery, including reparations. It would also create a truth and reconciliation process to establish historical facts about slavery in the state. One of the proposals would also require that the city install an informational sign on Wall Street in Manhattan to mark the site of New York's first slave market, which operated between 1711 and 1762. A sign was placed nearby in 2015, but Public Advocate Jumaane D. Williams, a Democrat who sponsored the legislation, said its location is inaccurate. The commission would work with the existing state commission, which is also considering the possibility of reparations. A report from the state panel, which held its first public meeting in late July, is expected in early 2025. The city effort wouldn't need to produce recommendations until 2027. The city's commission was created out of a 2021 racial justice initiative during then-Mayor Bill de Blasio's administration, which also recommended the city track data on the cost of living and add a commitment to remedy 'past and continuing harms' to the city charter's preamble. 'Your call and your ancestors' call for reparations had not gone unheard,' Linda Tigani, executive director of the racial equity commission, said at a news conference ahead of the council vote. A financial impact analysis of the bills estimated that the studies would cost $2.5 million. New York is the latest city to study reparations. Tulsa, Oklahoma, where a notorious massacre of Black residents took place in 1921, announced a similar commission last month. Evanston, Illinois, became the first city to offer reparations to Black residents and their descendants in 2021, including distributing some payments of $25,000 in 2023, according to PBS. The eligibility was based on harm suffered as a result of the city's discriminatory housing policies or practices. San Francisco approved reparations in February, but the mayor later cut the funds, saying that reparations should instead be carried out by the federal government. California budgeted $12 million for a reparations program that included helping Black residents research their ancestry, but it was defeated in the state's Legislature this month.	https://www.voanews.com/a/new-york-city-lawmakers-approve-bill-to-study-slavery-and-reparations/7784062.html	2024-09-14T00:00:00-07:00	
Animal rights groups object to Buckingham Palace guards' bearskin caps	london — An animal rights group trying to get real fur out of the bearskin caps worn by King's Guards at Buckingham Palace took aim Thursday at the cost of the ceremonial garb. The price of the caps soared 30% in a year to more than 2,000 pounds ($2,600) apiece for the hats made of black bear fur, the Ministry of Defense said in response to a freedom of information request by People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals. 'Stop wasting taxpayer pounds on caps made from slaughtered wildlife and switch to faux fur today,' the group said in a statement. A luxury fake fur maker has offered to supply the army with free faux bear fur for 10 years, PETA said. Military willing to consider alternatives The military said it was open to exploring alternatives if they pass muster in durability, water protection and appearance. But 'no alternative has met all those criteria to date,' a ministry spokesperson said in a statement. The distinctive tall black hats, worn by guards in bright scarlet tunics, are seen by millions who watch the regular changing of the guard ceremony at the palace. They also appear at other royal events including the annual Trooping the Color ceremony honoring the monarch's birthday in June. The cost of the caps rose from 1,560 pounds ($2,035) each in 2022 to 2,040 pounds ($2,660) in 2023, the ministry said. More than 1 million pounds ($1.3 million) was spent on them in the past decade. The price went up because of a contract change for fur that comes from bears killed in licensed hunts in Canada, the military said. PETA, which has been pushing for more than two decades to scrap the fur hats, said each cap requires one bear pelt. The group claimed that the defense department is propping up the 'cruel' Canadian bear-hunting industry. The ministry denied that charge and said if it stopped buying the pelts, it would not reduce the numbers of bears being killed. Petition calls for fake fur Parliament debated the issue in July 2022 after an online petition with more than 100,000 signatures called for using fake fur in the caps. 'This hunting involves the violent killing of bears, with many bears being shot several times,' Martyn Day, then a Scottish National Party member of Parliament, said at the time. 'It seems undeniable, therefore, that by continuing to purchase hats made from the fur of black bears the MOD is funding the suffering of bears in Canada by making the baiting and killing of those animals and the sale of their pelts a profitable pursuit for the hunters.' Day said a poll at the time found 75% of the U.K. population found real bearskins were a bad use of taxpayer money and supported replacing the hats. He noted that the late Queen Elizabeth II had ceased buying fur for her wardrobe. Earlier this year, Queen Camilla, wife of King Charles III, pledged to buy no more fur products.	https://www.voanews.com/a/animal-rights-groups-object-to-buckingham-palace-guard-s-distinctive-bearskin-caps-/7784068.html	2024-09-14T00:00:00-07:00	
Limited role for US Navy SEAL Team in defense of Taiwan	Washington — The United States Navy's elite SEAL Team Six would likely have a limited role in defending Taiwan should China invade the self-governing and democratic island, say analysts responding to a Financial Times report that the unit has been training for it for more than one year. Lyle J. Morris, senior fellow for foreign policy and national security at the Asia Society Policy Institute’s Center for China Analysis, tells VOA Mandarin if the unit is indeed preparing for an attack by Beijing, it may indicate that the U.S. is more deeply involved in defending Taiwan than previously thought. However, he stressed that the secret and precise combat characteristics of SEAL Team Six mean its role in resisting China's invasion of Taiwan would be very limited, and the focus would be on carrying out special tasks. 'As far as their sheer capability to repel an invasion. I think that's more limited,' he says. 'I think it's in a very discreet, narrow way of coming in for a specific task that Taiwan might need, whether it's helping to protect, let's say, an airfield in Taiwan or protect a communication asset in Taiwan, in Taipei, they could come in and out very discreetly and very lethally to protect that asset.' SEAL Team Six specializes in performing sensitive, highly difficult missions. In 2009, the unit rescued Richard Phillips, captain of the MV Maersk Alabama, who was taken hostage by Somali pirates. The elite unit gained an international reputation after the successful raid on al-Qaida leader Osama bin Laden’s compound in Pakistan in 2011. It is one of the most highly regarded U.S. military units, along with the United States Army's Delta Force, the 75th Ranger Regiment's Regimental Reconnaissance Company, the Intelligence Support Activity, and the Air Force's 24th Special Tactics Squadron, and part of the Joint Special Operations Command. 'Navy SEALs usually deployed from submarines or, most likely, small ships. And are useful for targeting vulnerabilities in enemies’ presentation,' Richard D. Fisher Jr., senior fellow with the International Assessment and Strategy Center, tells VOA. Analysts say the U.S. military likely revealed the SEAL Team Six training program to the Financial Times to send a warning to Beijing amid China’s increasingly assertive moves in the region. 'This is one way the U.S. is bolstering deterrence towards China, towards preventing a Chinese invasion of Taiwan,' says Morris. 'So, I think this is just an added factor getting China to second guess or to reconsider what it will face if it were to invade Taiwan.' Dennis Wilder, a senior fellow for the Initiative for U.S.-China Dialogue on Global Issues at Georgetown University and a former Central Intelligence Agency military analyst, posted on social media platform X, 'It is sure to get under Beijing's skin.' In a written response to VOA Mandarin, Liu Pengyu, the spokesperson of the Chinese Embassy in Washington, D.C., said, 'The Taiwan question is the very core of China’s core interests and the first red line that must not be crossed in the China-U.S. relationship.' He urged 'the U.S. to earnestly abide by the one-China principle and the three China-U.S. joint communiqués, stop enhancing military contact with the Taiwan region or arming it by any means or under whatever pretext, stop creating factors that could heighten tensions in the Taiwan Strait, and stop conniving at and supporting the separatists’ attempt to seek ‘Taiwan independence’ by force.' Taiwan split from China during the civil war that saw the Communist Party seize power in Beijing in 1949 and the Nationalist Party flee to the island, which developed into a flourishing democracy. But China’s one-party, authoritarian state never gave up its claim to Taiwan and considers it a renegade province that must one day reunite with the mainland, by force if necessary. Admiral Philips Davidson, former commander of the U.S. Indo-Pacific Command, warned in 2021 that China could attack Taiwan within six years. President Joe Biden has repeatedly stressed that if China invades Taiwan, the U.S. will intervene militarily to defend it. The U.S. Department of Defense declined to confirm or deny the Financial Times report. Pentagon spokesperson John Supple said in an email to VOA, 'The DoD and our service members prepare and train for a wide range of contingencies. We will not comment on specifics, but will restate that we are committed to our longstanding one China policy, guided by the Taiwan Relations Act, the Three Joint Communiques, and the Six Assurances. As we have said before, conflict is neither imminent nor inevitable.' America’s one-China policy is a strategically ambiguous agreement it made in 1972 to establish relations with China that recognizes Beijing as the only government of China and acknowledges, but does not endorse, Beijing’s claim that Taiwan is part of China. Washington has unofficial relations with Taiwan defined through the Taiwan Relations Act, the Three Joint Communiques with Beijing, and the Six Assurances with Taipei, which underscore U.S. opposition to attempts to unilaterally alter the status quo and determination to help Taiwan defend itself through weapons sales. There has been previous U.S. military training for Taiwan’s defense, both on the island and in the United States. Reuters reported last year the U.S. was set to expand the number of troops helping train Taiwanese forces on the island and Taiwanese officials confirmed more of their troops would be training in the U.S.	https://www.voanews.com/a/limited-role-for-us-navy-seal-team-in-defense-of-taiwan/7784108.html	2024-09-14T00:00:00-07:00	
US-Russia battle for influence in Africa plays out in Central African Republic	BANGUI, Central African Republic — Hours after Russian mercenary leader Yevgeny Prigozhin rebelled against his country's top military leaders, his private army's biggest client in Africa panicked, turning for help to his foe in the West. Officials from Central African Republic, where some 1,500 of Prigozhin's Wagner Group mercenaries were stationed, wrote a letter that day, requesting to 'rapidly' arrange a meeting with a private U.S. security firm to discuss collaboration. Dated June 23, 2023, the day Prigozhin launched the armed rebellion, the letter sparked a series of meetings, culminating in a deal with the central African nation and Bancroft Global Development. That sparked backlash from Russian mercenaries, according to a dozen diplomats, locals, and analysts. The tensions in Central African Republic are a window into a larger battle playing out across the continent as Moscow and Washington vie for influence. The Russian mercenaries — using success in staving off rebels in this impoverished nation as a model for expansion — have long been accused by locals and rights groups of stripping natural resources such as minerals and timber and are linked to the torture and death of civilians. In the wake of Prigozhin's rebellion and suspicious death in a plane crash, the Russians are recalibrating their Africa operations. The United States, which has been largely disengaged from the region for years, is attempting to maintain a presence and stymie Russian gains as it pushes African countries to distance themselves from the mercenaries. U.S. officials blame Russia for anti-American sentiment in the region and say they're trying to shift the narrative. 'If the U.S. can't regain a foothold, it could give Russia greater economic and political leverage,' said Samuel Ramani of the Royal United Services Institute, a defense and security think tank. 'If Russia loses Central African Republic, its flagship model on the continent, there could be a domino effect in other countries.' Russia's influence In recent years, Russia has emerged as the security partner of choice for a growing number of governments in the region, displacing traditional allies such as France and the U.S. Moscow expanded its military cooperation by using mercenaries like Wagner, which since around 2017 has operated in at least half a dozen countries by protecting African leaders and in some cases helping fight rebels and extremists. They're also plagued by their human rights record. Two years ago in Mali, Wagner and the army were accused of executing about 300 men — some suspected of being Islamist extremists, but most civilians — in what Human Rights Watch called the worst single atrocity reported in the country's decade-long armed conflict. And in Central African Republic, mercenaries train the army on torture tactics, including how to tburn people alive, according to watchdog The Sentry. Central African Republic Central African Republic was one of the first places the mercenaries entered. The country has been in conflict since 2013, when predominantly Muslim rebels seized power and forced the president from office. Six of the 14 armed groups that signed a 2019 peace deal later left the agreement. Locals and the government credited Wagner with fighting back rebels who tried to overtake Bangui, the capital, in 2021. The Russians soon expanded to Burkina Faso and Niger, and have ambitions for further growth. Russia is refurbishing a military base some 80 kilometers from Bangui. Alexander Bikantov, Russia's ambassador to Central African Republic, said the base will improve the country's security. Fidele Gouandjika, adviser to President Faustin-Archange Touadera, said the base aims to have 10,000 fighters by 2030 to engage with more African nations. Touadera's office didn't reply to written requests for comment for this story. His adviser to the country's spy agency declined to be interviewed. Pressure from United States The U.S. had been pushing Central African Republic to find an alternative to Wagner for years. A more assertive U.S. approach came as it faced new setbacks and tried to rework agreements in the region. Its troops left Chad and Niger, where they were no longer welcome. Still, the State Department said in a statement this year that it wasn't involved in the decision to establish Bancroft Global Development's presence in Central African Republic. But Washington could deny such contracts if it wanted, said Sean McFate, a former contractor in Africa and author of 'The New Rules of War.' The U.S. has used private military companies to reduce American 'boots on the ground' in Africa, McFate said, and companies like Bancroft have to play by Washington's rules if they want future government work. In response to AP questions, the U.S. official who spoke on condition of anonymity said it uses private contractors in Africa to help countries operate more effectively, with U.S. government oversight to ensure accountability. The official said the State Department has overseen Bancroft's work in Somalia but not Central African Republic or elsewhere. Bancroft's background Washington-based Bancroft is a nonprofit working in nine countries — five in Africa. Its involvement in Central African Republic has been shrouded in secrecy since signs emerged of its presence last fall. During an AP visit months later, rumors swirled about Bancroft's activities, fueling speculation the U.S was bringing its own Wagner to oust Russia. But according to Bancroft founder Michael Stock, the group entered at Bangui's behest. Stock received the letter from the presidency within a day of Prigozhin's mutiny, and the two signed a deal in September, he said. Fewer than 30 Bancroft personnel work there, Stock said, helping Central African Republic with intelligence systems, interagency cooperation and law enforcement. Bancroft has invested some $1.4 million there, Stock said. Much of Bancroft's funding has come from U.S. and United Nations grants. From 2018 to 2020, it received more than $43 million from the U.S., according to audits required as part of tax forms. Amal Ali, a former U.S. intelligence analyst, is among critics who say that despite its yearslong presence in Somalia, Bancroft hasn't contributed to any eradication of terrorism. Stock dismissed such comments as uninformed and said the Somali and U.S. governments 'agree Bancroft has done a great deal to damaging illegal armed groups and developing the capacity of the government to perform its national defense functions professionally.' Backlash on the ground Rights groups say a lack of transparency about Bancroft's operations has fostered an atmosphere of distrust in a country already rampant with armed actors. Wagner, a U.N. peacekeeping mission and Rwandan troops are all on the ground to try to quell violence. 'Operating in a vague and nontransparent way in the Central African Republic only leads to suspicion,' said Lewis Mudge, of Human Rights Watch. Stock defended Bancroft's work and policies. 'It is perfectly normal for a government not to publicize how it is defending the people and the state,' he told AP. Unclear future As the U.S. and Russia jockey for power, African governments say they want to make their own choices. Central African Republic officials approached Bancroft, which shows that these governments haven't become Russian puppets, said Jack Margolin, an expert on private military companies. But, he added, Russia's reaction to Bancroft could hurt Moscow's standing with other nations. After Prigozhin's death, Russia moved quickly to take control of Wagner's assets, and the defense ministry told countries where Wagner operated that it would take over. The country and its military intelligence arm have taken a more direct role in Africa operations, deploying more official detachments from its army. In Central African Republic, it's unclear how much sway the Russian state has with the mercenaries, who are beloved by many. For most people here, there's little interest in squabbles among foreign nations. 'There are problems between the Americans and Russians, but that doesn't matter to us,' said Jean Louis Yet, who works at Bangui's market. 'We are here working, trying our best to make a living. All we want is security.'	https://www.voanews.com/a/the-us-russia-battle-for-influence-in-africa-plays-out-in-central-african-republic-/7782634.html	2024-09-14T00:00:00-07:00	
As warming threatens polar bear tourism, a Canadian town adapts and thrives	CHURCHILL, Manitoba — Change has broken, remade and continues to reshape this remote town where tundra meets forest on the shore of Hudson Bay. The economic base collapsed when the military left town. Rail service and cargo ships — the lifeblood of supplies for a town not connected to the rest of the world by roads — blinked out. The weather is warming, signature animals are dwindling and even the ground is shifting. Through it all, Churchill has adapted. The town turned to tourism, luring people eager to see its plentiful polar bears. Leaders figured out ways to revitalize its port and railway. As climate change has edged into the picture, they've begun designing more flexible buildings and seeking to entice more varied visitors if, as scientists fear, shrinking sea ice crashes the bear population. Residents, government officials and experts say the town is a model for coping with dramatic shifts and attribute it to the rural mindset that focuses on fixing, not whining. Churchill sits about 1,700 kilometers north of Winnipeg. The town had thousands of people before the military base and a rocket research launch site shut down decades ago. Those sites fell into decay, and what had been a bustling port closed. Train service stopped for more than a year as weather shattered poorly maintained tracks. As the town dwindled, bears began coming to town more often, no longer frightened away by noise from the base and rocket launches and made desperate as climate change shrank the Hudson Bay ice they depend on as a base for hunting. A local mechanic built a fat-tired, souped-up recreational vehicle to see bears safely. Photos and documentaries attracted tourists, who spend $5,000 a visit on average and millions of dollars overall. Churchill now bills itself as the polar bear capital of the world, and though it has no stoplights, it features upscale restaurants and plenty of mom-and-pop hotels. If that comes to an end, Churchill hopes to be ready. The town is promoting tourism for beluga whales, although those too may be harmed as the entire Hudson Bay ecosystem, including the food the belugas eat, shifts to one usually seen further south. It's also highlighting visitors' prospects for seeing the northern lights, spotting birds they can't see at home, and even trying dogsledding. 'In time you're going to lose bear season. And we know that. Anyway, it's just a matter of we're going to have to adapt to that change,' said Mike Spence, mayor since 1995. 'You can't stew over it. That's not going to get you any points.' Spence grew up with the military installation 'and all of a sudden it closes and then all of a sudden you get the tourists, the abundance of wildlife and the aurora. That's where you take advantage of it. You sort of tweak things and you improve life.' The shuttered port and the damaged train tracks? The town took them over and got both running again. Ground sinking because the weather is getting rainier and permafrost is thawing? New buildings like the ones at Polar Bears International, a nonprofit conservation organization with headquarters in the city, have metal jacks that can be adjusted when a corner sinks nearly half a foot in five years. Lauren Sorkin, executive director of the Resilient Cities Network, said every city should have a plan to adapt to climate change's effect on economy and tourism. 'Churchill is a standout example of a city that is planning ahead to protect communities and preserve our natural environment and its biodiversity,' she said. Spence, who is Cree, grew up with no electricity or running water in 'the flats' on the outskirts of town, which was run by a white minority. Churchill is about two-thirds Indigenous with Cree, Metis, Inuit and Dene. Spence recalls his father saying that if only he spoke better English he could tell officials how to fix the town. 'I think I'm doing that for him,' Spence said. 'You don't just say 'I got a problem.' You go there with the fix.' You can't drive to Churchill. Food, people, cargo, everything gets there by rail, boats or plane. Rail is the cheapest, and most residents travel by taking the overnight train to Thompson, then driving south from there. Until a few years ago the train tracks, which had been leased to a private company, were not being maintained properly and the wet, stormy spring of 2017 created 22 washouts of the line between Churchill and points south, Spence said. The company couldn't afford to fix them. Big storms in Churchill are as much as 30% rainier than 80 years ago because of human-caused climate change, said Cornell University climate scientist Angie Pendergrass. 'Service stopped dead' for 18 months, Spence said. 'It was just devastating.' Meanwhile, there weren't enough goods coming into the aging port. Spence said that shipping hub and rail lines needed to operate as an integrated system, and not be run by an absentee U.S. owner, so the town negotiated with the federal and provincial governments for local control and federal financial help. In 2018, Arctic Gateway Group, a partnership of 41 First Nations and northern communities, took ownership of the port and rail line. Rail service returned on Halloween that year. Manitoba officials said that in the last two years 610 kilometers of track have been upgraded and 10 bridges repaired. Shipping in the port has more than tripled since 2021, including the return of its first cruise ship in decade, they said. Earlier this year, officials announced another $60 million in port and rail funding. Local ownership is key in Churchill, said former Chamber of Commerce president Dave Daley, who left town in the 1980s but returned after five years because he and his wife missed it. Big hotel chains poked around once and said they could fix up the town's infrastructure and build something big. 'We all stood and said 'no',' Daley said. 'We're a tight-knit group. We have our different opinions and everything else but we know how we want Churchill to be.' As Churchill evolves, its forgotten past has surfaced at times as tourists ask about residents and their history, said longtime resident Georgina Berg, who like Spence lived on the flats as a child. That past includes 'not-so-happy stories' about forced relocation, missing women, poverty, subsistence hunting, being ignored, deaths and abuse, said Berg, who is Cree. Daley, a dogsled racer and president of Indigenous Tourism Manitoba, tells of how the Metis people were especially ignored, abused and punished, yet he ends the history lesson with an abrupt shift. 'We can't change five minutes ago, but we can change five minutes from now,' Daley said. 'So that's what I teach my kids. You know it's nice to know the history and all the atrocities and everything that happened, but if we're going to get better from that we have to look forward and look five minutes from now and what we can do to change that.' Meanwhile, Daley and Spence notice the changes in the weather — not only warmer, but they're getting thunder here, something once unimaginable. The Arctic is warming four times faster than the rest of the world. While Churchill isn't quite as bad off because it's south of the Arctic Circle, 'it's something we take seriously,' Spence said. 'It's a matter of finding the right blend in how you adapt to climate change,' Spence said. 'And work with it.'	https://www.voanews.com/a/as-warming-threatens-polar-bear-tourism-a-canadian-town-adapts-and-thrives/7781156.html	2024-09-14T00:00:00-07:00	
Brazil officially welcomes return of sacred Indigenous cloak from Denmark	RIO DE JANEIRO — Brazil formally received on Thursday the return from Denmark of an Indigenous cloak made with 4,000 red feathers of the scarlet ibis bird, a sacred mantle that was taken by Europeans during the 17th century colonial era. President Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva attended the ceremony outside Brazil's National Museum in Rio de Janeiro, marking the importance that Brazil gives to the item's repatriation. The cloak, a feathered ceremonial cape used in religious rituals of the Tupinamba people of Bahia in northeastern Brazil, was removed during the Dutch occupation of the area. Its first mention comes in a Danish inventory in 1689, although it is thought to have been taken from Brazil some 50 years before. By the 21st century it was held in the ethnographic collection of Denmark's National Museum, the Nationalmuseet. In 2000, the museum lent the cloak out for an exhibition in Sao Paulo. A Tupinamba leader saw it there and demanded its return. Last year, after lengthy diplomatic negotiations, the Danish museum announced it would donate the cloak to Brazil's National Museum, and it was repatriated in July. Some 170 Tupinamba traveled from southern Bahia to Rio to celebrate its return. 'It is crucial they return what isn't theirs and rightfully belongs to us. Our heritage strengthens our identity,' said cacique, or chief, Jamopoty Tupinamba to Agencia Brasil on Wednesday. From the first Portuguese voyages to Brazil in the early 16th century, Indigenous cultural items were taken to Europe as evidence of the 'discovery' of new territories and then entered museums or private collections. A fresco painted in 1674 on the ceiling of the Apollo Salon at the Palace of Versailles, the king's throne room, depicts newly found America as a woman wearing a Tupinamba cloak as if it were a headdress. According to cultural heritage activist Gliceria Tupinamba, there are another 10 such cloaks in Europe, held in museums and libraries in Italy, France, Belgium, Switzerland and Denmark, where the National Museum still has one large and three partial ones. 'It took more than 20 years to get the cloak back. Its return is a symbol of the protection of our cultural and land rights that are under threat today in Brazil,' she said.	https://www.voanews.com/a/brazil-officially-welcomes-return-of-sacred-indigenous-cloak-from-denmark/7782592.html	2024-09-14T00:00:00-07:00	
Brazil's Lula pledges to finish paving road experts say could worsen Amazon deforestation	brasilia — In a visit to see the damage caused by drought and fire in the Amazon, President Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva pledged to pave a road that environmentalists and some in his own government say threatens to vastly increase destruction of the world's largest tropical forest — and contribute to climate change. The BR-319 roadway is a mostly dirt road through the rainforest that connects the states of Amazonas and Roraima to the rest of the country. It ends in Manaus, the Amazon's largest city with over 2 million people, and runs parallel to the Madeira River, a major tributary of the Amazon River. The Madeira is at its lowest recorded level, disrupting cargo navigation, with most of its riverbed now endless sand dunes under a sky thick with smoke. 'We are aware that, while the river was navigable and full, the highway didn't have the importance it has now, while the Madeira River was alive. We can't leave two capitals isolated. But we will do it with the utmost responsibility,' Lula said Tuesday during a visit to an Indigenous community in Manaquiri, in Amazonas state. He didn't specify what steps the government would take to try to prevent deforestation from increasing after paving. Hours later, he oversaw the signing of a contract to pave 52 kilometers (32 miles) of the road, and promised to begin work before his term ends in 2026 on the most controversial section of the road — a 400-kilometer (249-mile) stretch through old-growth forest. A permit for the longer stretch was issued under Lula's far-right predecessor, Jair Bolsonaro, who favored development in the Amazon and weakened environmental protections. In July, a federal court suspended the permit in a lawsuit brought by the Climate Observatory, a network of 119 environmental, civil society and academic groups. Lula's government had appealed the suspension, but it wasn't until his visit on Tuesday that Lula made clear his plan to move ahead with paving. The Climate Observatory lamented the move. 'Without the forest, there is no water, it's interconnected,' said Suely Araujo, a public policy coordinator with the group. 'The paving of the middle section of BR-319, without ensuring environmental governance and the presence of the government in the region, will lead to historic deforestation, as pointed out by many specialists and by Brazil's federal environmental agency in the licensing process.' Lula has sought to portray himself as an environmental protector, and deforestation has slowed significantly since he took over for Bolsonaro. But he has also struck out at times against pressure from richer nations on preserving the Amazon, an invaluable resource for the planet in storing the carbon driving atmospheric warming, and did so again on Tuesday. 'The world that buys our food is demanding that we preserve the Amazon,' he said. 'And why? Because they want us to take care of the air they breathe. They didn't preserve their own lands in the last century during the Industrial Revolution.' Brazil is enduring its worst drought ever recorded, with 59% of the country under stress — an area about half the size of the U.S. In the Amazon, rivers' low levels have stranded hundreds of riverine communities, with shortage of potable water and food. Lula announced a wide distribution of water filters and other measures during his visit to the region. Meanwhile, most of Brazil has been under a thick layer of smoke from wildfires in the Amazon, affecting millions of people in faraway cities such as Sao Paulo, Brasilia and Curitiba and reaching as far south as Argentina and Paraguay. At Lula's event, Environment Minister Marina Silva blamed the extreme drought brought by climate change for the widespread fires in a rainforest usually resistant to fire, calling it 'a phenomenon we don't even know how to handle.' Silva has been more cautious than Lula about paving the roadway. At a congressional hearing earlier, she called the Bolsonaro era's permit a 'sham' and praised the judicial ruling that suspended it. Brazil is the world's fifth-largest emitter of greenhouse gases, contributing nearly 3% of global emissions, according to Climate Watch, an online platform managed by the World Resources Institute. Almost half these emissions stem from destruction of trees in the Amazon rainforest.	https://www.voanews.com/a/brazil-s-lula-pledges-to-finish-paving-road-that-experts-say-could-worsen-amazon-deforestation-/7782627.html	2024-09-14T00:00:00-07:00	
China condemns German navy's transit of Taiwan Strait	BEIJING — China's military on Saturday condemned the transit of two German navy ships through the Taiwan Strait, saying it increased security risks and sent the 'wrong' signal, adding that Chinese forces monitored and warned the vessels. China, which claims democratically governed Taiwan as its own, says it alone exercises sovereignty and jurisdiction over the strait. Both the United States and Taiwan say the strait -- a major trade route through which about half of global container ships pass -- is an international waterway. The People's Liberation Army's Eastern Theater Command said the passage of the two ships -- a frigate and a supply vessel -- was 'public hyping,' and that its navy and air forces monitored and warned them throughout. 'The German side's behavior increases security risks and sends the wrong signal. Troops in the theater are on high alert at all times and will resolutely counter all threats and provocations,' it said in a statement. China's embassy in Germany said in a separate statement it had lodged 'representations' with Berlin, saying Taiwan belonged to China, a position the democratically elected government in Taipei strongly rejects. 'The question of Taiwan is not a matter of 'freedom of navigation,' but of China's sovereignty and territorial integrity,' it said. The Taiwan Strait is Chinese waters 'and there are no so-called 'international waters' at all,' the embassy added. China urges Germany to avoid any 'interference' that would jeopardize the healthy and stable development of bilateral relations, it added. Taiwan's government says only the island's people can decide their future. U.S. warships sail through the strait around once every two months, drawing the ire of Beijing, and some U.S. allies like Canada and Britain have also made occasional transits. China, which has never renounced the use of force to bring Taiwan under its control, has over the past five years stepped up military activities around the island, including staging war games.	https://www.voanews.com/a/china-condemns-german-navy-s-transit-of-taiwan-strait/7784135.html	2024-09-13T23:01:55-07:00	
In Belarus, the native language is vanishing as Russian takes prominence	TALLINN, Estonia — When school started this year for Mikalay in Belarus, the 15-year-old discovered that his teachers and administrators no longer called him by that name. Instead, they referred to him as Nikolai, its Russian equivalent. What's more, classes at his school — one of the country's best — are now taught in Russian, not Belarusian, which he has spoken for most of his life. Belarusians like Mikalay are experiencing a new wave of Russification as Moscow expands its economic, political and cultural dominance to overtake the identity of its neighbor. It's not the first time. Russia under the czars and in the era of the Soviet Union imposed its language, symbols and cultural institutions on Belarus. But with the demise of the USSR in 1991, the country began to assert its identity, and Belarusian briefly became the official language, with the white-red-white national flag replacing a version of the red hammer and sickle. But all that changed in 1994, after Alexander Lukashenko, a former Soviet collective farm official, came to power. The authoritarian leader made Russian an official language, alongside Belarusian, and did away with the nationalist symbols. Now, with Lukashenko in control of the country for over three decades, he has allowed Russia to dominate all aspects of life in Belarus, a country of 9.5 million people. Belarusian, which like Russian uses the Cyrillic alphabet, is hardly heard on the streets of Minsk and other large cities anymore. Official business is conducted in Russian, which dominates the majority of the media. Lukashenko speaks only Russian, and government officials often don't use their native tongue. The country depends on Russian loans and cheap energy and has created a political and military alliance with Moscow, allowing President Vladimir Putin to deploy troops and missiles on its soil, which was used as a staging area for the war in Ukraine. 'I understand that our Belarus is occupied. … And who is the president there? Not Lukashenko. The president is Putin,' said Svetlana Alexievich, who won the 2015 Nobel Prize for literature and lives in Germany in effective exile. 'The nation has been humiliated and it will be very difficult for Belarusians to recover from this.' Belarusian cultural figures have been persecuted and hundreds of its nationalist organizations have been closed. Experts say Moscow is seeking to implement in Belarus what the Kremlin intended to do in neighboring Ukraine when the war there began in 2022. 'It is obvious that our children are being deliberately deprived of their native language, history and Belarusian identity, but parents have been strongly advised not to ask questions about Russification,' said Mikalay's father, Anatoly, who spoke to The Associated Press on condition his last name not be used, for fear of retribution. 'We were informed about the synchronization of the curriculum with Russia this year and were shown a propaganda film about how the Ukrainian special services are allegedly recruiting our teenagers and forcing them to commit sabotage in Belarus,' he said. Mikalay's school was one of the few where paperwork and some courses were conducted in Belarusian. In recent years, however, dozens of teachers were fired and the Belarusian-language section of its website vanished. Human rights advocate Ales Bialiatski, convicted in 2023 on charges stemming from his Nobel Peace Prize-winning work, demanded his trial be conducted in Belarusian. The court rejected it and sentenced him to 10 years. Lukashenko derides his native language, saying 'nothing great can be expressed in Belarusian. … There are only two great languages in the world: Russian and English.' Speaking to Russian state media, Lukashenko recounted how Putin once thanked him for making Russian the dominant language in Belarus. 'I said, 'Wait, what are you thanking me for? ... The Russian language is my language, we were part of one empire, and we're taking part in [helping] that language develop,'' Lukashenko said. Belarus was part of the Russian empire for centuries and became one of 15 Soviet republics after the 1917 Bolshevik Revolution. Daily use of the Belarusian language decreased and continued only in the country's west and north and in rural areas. In 1994, about 40% of students were taught in Belarusian; it's now down to under 9%. Although Belarusian, like Russian, is an eastern Slavic language, its vocabulary is considerably different. In 1517, Belarusian publisher Francysk Skaryna was one of the first in Eastern Europe to translate the Bible into his native language. Even speaking Belarusian is seen as a show of opposition to Lukashenko and a declaration of national identity. That played a key role in the mass protests after the disputed 2020 election gave the authoritarian leader a sixth term. In the harsh crackdown that followed, a half-million people fled the country. 'The Belarusian language is increasingly perceived as a sign of political disloyalty and is being abandoned in favor of Russian in the public administration, education, culture and the mass media, upon orders from the hierarchy or out of fear of discrimination,' said Anaïs Marin, the United Nations special rapporteur for human rights in Belarus. At the same time, 'more people want to speak Belarusian, which has become one of the symbols of freedom, but they're afraid to do it in public,' said Alina Nahornaja, author of Language 404, a book about Belarusians who experienced discrimination for speaking their native language. Like Ukraine, Belarusians had a desire for rapprochement with Europe that accompanied their nationalist sentiment, said Belarusian analyst Valery Karbalevich. 'But the Kremlin quickly realized the danger and began the process of creeping Russification in Belarus,' he added. That prompted pro-Russian organizations, joint educational programs and cultural projects to spring up 'like mushrooms after the rain — against the backdrop of harsh repressions against everything Belarusian,' Karbalevich said. Censorship and bans affect not only contemporary Belarusian literature but also its classics. In 2023, the prosecutor's office declared as extremist the 19th-century poems of Vincent Dunin-Martsinkyevich, who opposed the Russian Empire. When the Kremlin began supporting Lukashenko against the anti-government protests in 2020, it ensured his loyalty and received carte blanche in Belarus. 'Today, Lukashenko is paying Putin with our sovereignty,' said exiled opposition leader Sviatlana Tsikhanouskaya. 'Belarusian national identity, cultures and language are our strongest weapons against the Russian world and Russification.' Four cities in Belarus now host a 'Russia House' to promote its culture and influence, offering seminars, film clubs, exhibitions and competitions. 'The goal is to plant Russian narratives so that as many Belarusians as possible view Russian as their own,' said analyst Alexander Friedman. 'The Kremlin spares no expense and acts on a grand scale, which could be especially effective and dangerous in a situation where Belarus has found itself in information isolation, and there is almost no one left inside the country to resist the Russian world.' Almost the entire troupe of the Yanka Kupala Theater, the country's oldest, fled Belarus amid the political crackdown. Its former director, Pavel Latushka, now an opposition figure abroad, said the new management couldn't recruit enough new actors, and had to invite Russians, 'but it turned out that no one knew the Belarusian language.' 'Putin published an article denying the existence of an independent Ukraine back in 2021, and even then we understood perfectly well that he was pursuing similar goals in Belarus,' Latushka said. 'The main course was supposed to be Ukraine,' he added, with a Russified Belarus 'as a dessert.'	https://www.voanews.com/a/in-belarus-the-native-language-is-vanishing-as-russian-takes-prominence/7784130.html	2024-09-13T22:52:01-07:00

Slave to fear': Ghosts of the gulag haunt modern Russia	Moscow — When Russians started being arrested for opposing the Ukraine offensive, Maria felt the same kind of fear she guessed her ancestors, victims of repression under Soviet leader Joseph Stalin, must have lived through. Now 2½ years into its military offensive, Russia has imprisoned hundreds for protesting or speaking out against the campaign -- even in private -- in a crackdown that has paralyzed the Kremlin's domestic critics. 'It's not normal when you start behaving like your ancestors did. Twitching every time the phone rings ... thinking all the time about who you are talking with and what you are talking about,' Maria, a 47-year-old from Moscow, told AFP. 'My fear is growing.' Leafing through a book with photos of victims of Stalin's purges, Maria pointed to her great-grandfather. Of Polish origin, he was declared an 'enemy of the people' and executed in 1938 for 'spying.' He was posthumously rehabilitated after Stalin's death in 1953. His wife was also targeted, spending four years in the gulag, the Soviet network of harsh prison labor camps. Maria's grandmother, who had to live with the stigma of her parents being dubbed 'enemies of the people,' constantly worried she too would be arrested. Maria now feels a similar fear, concerned she could be labelled a 'foreign agent' -- a modern-day label with Stalin-era connotations that is used to marginalize critics of President Vladimir Putin's regime. Self-censorship Putin's Russia also has harsher legal tools at its disposal to target its opponents. Under military censorship laws, people can be convicted for up to 15 years for spreading 'false information' about the military campaign in Ukraine. In such a climate, Maria, an English professor at a university, is cautious about how she behaves and what she says in public. Outside her circle of close friends, she hides her pacifist convictions and her fondness for Ukrainian culture. She doesn't discuss politics with her colleagues, and lives in fear that somebody could denounce her for reading Western news or social media sites blocked in Russia that she accesses through a VPN. English itself is now considered an 'enemy language' that raises suspicions, said Maria, who asked for her surname to be withheld. When she is reading news articles on her phone on public transport, she said she 'immediately closes' the page and starts playing a game 'if I realize there is a person next to me not reading anything but just looking around.' Fearing her phone will be searched at passport control, she cleanses it before traveling of any chats where the fighting in Ukraine might have been mentioned. She is also afraid to wear her vyshyvanka, a traditional stitched Ukrainian shirt, in public, and shuns combining yellow and blue clothes -- the colors of the Ukrainian flag. 'Do not dare' After a brief eruption of anticonflict rallies in February 2022, the Kremlin has since stymied almost all shows of public opposition. 'People do not dare to protest, do not dare to speak out,' said Svetlana Gannushkina, a prominent Russian rights activist who has been labelled a 'foreign agent.' Heavy sentences for regime critics along with harsh treatment of prisoners has scared many into silence, she said. Gannushkina pointed to what she called a 'historical, maybe even genetic, fear' in a country that has seen multiple bouts of political repression -- from serfdom in the Russian Empire, the Bolsheviks' 'Red Terror' after the 1917 Revolution and the 1930s purges under Stalin. Her Memorial group worked to preserve the memory of victims of Communist repression and campaigned against modern rights violations until Russian authorities shut it down in 2021. Through history, repression has repeatedly 'divided society into those who were ready to submit and those who did not want to, understood that resistance leads to nothing, and left,' Gannushkina told AFP. 'History has made a kind of natural selection. ... And now we've got a whole generation of people who are not ready to resist.' 'Slave to fear' For Soviet dissident Alexander Podrabinek, 71, fear 'is not an ethnic, national or genetic peculiarity' specific to Russia. 'I have visited several totalitarian countries besides the Soviet Union and the situation is basically the same everywhere,' he told AFP. 'Fear is the main obstacle to a normal life in our country. ... Fear demoralizes people, deprives them of their freedom.' 'Someone who is afraid is no longer free. They become a slave to their fear, living without being able to realize their potential,' he added. Podrabinek was exiled to Russia's Siberia in 1978 and then imprisoned in 1981 after writing a book on punitive psychiatry in the USSR. Despite pressure from the KGB security services, he refused to leave the country. 'The only thing that can overcome fear,' he said, 'is the conviction that you are right.'	https://www.voanews.com/a/slave-to-fear-ghosts-of-the-gulag-haunt-modern-russia/7784121.html	2024-09-13T21:29:03-07:00	
Myanmar junta makes rare request for foreign aid to cope with deadly floods	Yangon, Myanmar — Myanmar's junta chief made a rare request Saturday for foreign aid to cope with deadly floods that have displaced hundreds of thousands of people who have endured three years of war. Floods and landslides have killed almost 300 people in Myanmar, Vietnam, Laos and Thailand in the wake of Typhoon Yagi, which dumped a colossal deluge of rain when it hit the region last weekend. In Myanmar more than 235,000 people have been forced from their homes by floods, the junta said Friday, piling further misery on the country where war has raged since the military seized power in 2021. 'Officials from the government need to contact foreign countries to receive rescue and relief aid to be provided to the victims,' Min Aung Hlaing said on Friday, according to the Global New Light of Myanmar newspaper. 'It is necessary to manage rescue, relief and rehabilitation measures as quickly as possible,' he was quoted as saying. The junta gave a death toll on Friday of 33, while earlier in the day the country's fire department said rescuers had recovered 36 bodies. A military spokesman said it had lost contact with some areas of the country and was investigating reports that dozens had been buried in landslides in a gold-mining area in the central Mandalay region. Aid restrictions Myanmar's military has previously blocked or frustrated humanitarian assistance from abroad. Last year it suspended travel authorizations for aid groups trying to reach around a million victims of powerful Cyclone Mocha that hit the west of the country. At the time the United Nations slammed that decision as 'unfathomable.' AFP has contacted a spokesperson for the U.N. in Myanmar for comment. After cyclone Nargis killed at least 138,000 people in Myanmar in 2008, the then-junta was accused of blocking emergency aid and initially refusing to grant access to humanitarian workers and supplies. Military trucks carried small rescue boats to flood-hit areas around the military-built capital Naypyidaw on Saturday, AFP reporters said. On Friday hundreds of villagers waded or swam through chin-high waters to safety following floods around the capital. Some told AFP they had sheltered in trees overnight to escape the raging flood waters below. State media said flooding in the area around the capital had caused landslides and destroyed electricity towers, buildings, roads, bridges and houses. More than 2.7 million people were already displaced in Myanmar by conflict triggered by the junta's 2021 coup.	https://www.voanews.com/a/myanmar-junta-makes-rare-request-for-foreign-aid-to-cope-with-deadly-floods/7784118.html	2024-09-13T20:48:15-07:00	
South Sudan postpones elections by 2 years, citing incomplete preparations	JUBA, South Sudan — The government in South Sudan has postponed elections scheduled for December for two years citing the need to complete processes such as a census, the drafting of a permanent constitution and the registration of political parties. The Presidential Adviser on National Security Tut Gatluak on Friday said the extension would provide an opportunity to complete critical processes before the new election date of December 22, 2026. This is the second time the country, which gained independence in 2011, is postponing elections and extending a transitional period that started in February 2020. President Salva Kiir and his former rival turned deputy, Riek Machar, signed a peace agreement in 2018 that ended a five-year civil war in which more than 400,000 people died. Cabinet Affairs Minister Martin Elia Lomuro said the extension followed recommendations from both electoral institutions and the security sector. Last month, the chairperson of National Election Commission, Professor Abednego Akok, told The Associated Press the country was behind the electoral calendar, which required voter registration to have started in June but was still pending due to a shortage of funds. The country is going through an economic crisis that has seen civil servants go unpaid for almost one year, after it's oil exports were affected by a damaged pipeline in war-torn neighboring Sudan through which it exports. The Tumaini initiative peace talks that have been going on in neighboring Kenya, believed to provide a foundation for the inclusion of non-signatory groups to sustain peace, have also stalled. A new security act that allows for warrantless detentions became law in August despite concerns from human rights groups that it would create fear in the runup to the elections. Andrea Mach Mabior, an independent political analyst, warned that any sham elections may result in a waste of resources and chaos. 'Going for elections that do not meet international standards will be a waste of money,' Mabior told the AP. But others like Edmund Yakani, executive director of the Community Empowerment Progress Organization, said delays to the elections or any extension of the transitional period would create a possibility of violence erupting across the fragile country. 'If we fail to conduct the elections in December 2024 the chance of the country turning into violence is higher than if we go for the elections,' Yakani told the AP in August. The country, which has gone through the shocks of civil war and climate change is in need of humanitarian aid with an estimated 9 million people — 73% of the country's population — projected to be in need of humanitarian assistance during 2024, according to the 2024 UN Humanitarian Needs Overview for South Sudan.	https://www.voanews.com/a/south-sudan-postpones-elections-by-2-years-citing-incomplete-preparations-/7784116.html	2024-09-13T20:39:58-07:00	
Dozens of Hong Kong journalists threatened in harassment campaign, says HKJA	BANGKOK — Dozens of Hong Kong journalists and their families have been harassed and intimidated in the past three months, according to the chair of a local press club. The Hong Kong Journalists Association or HKJA said Friday it had tracked 'systematic' and 'organized' attacks on journalists from June to August this year. At least 15 journalists and their family members, employers and neighbors were harassed both online and offline, the press club said. Selina Cheng, the chair of the HKJA, said in a press conference Friday that it is the biggest case of intimidation that the association has ever seen. 'I don’t believe this is right, and that’s why we are making a loud call today to say we do not accept such behavior,' she said. 'This type of intimidation and harassment, which includes sharing false and defamatory content and death threats, damages press freedom,' she added. Journalists from multiple Hong Kong media outlets have been affected, with anonymous threats and harassment made via social media email or in the mail, the HKJA said in a statement. Some of those targeted received threats to their personal safety and were warned to give up their employment or position within associations, the HKJA added. 'HKJA has gathered detailed information on a number of affected journalists and organisations,' the statement read. Those affected include two journalism education institutions and 13 media outlets, including the executive committee of the HKJA, Hong Kong Free Press, InMediaHK, and HK Feature. Many of the letters and emails warned that association with the named organizations or people could be a violation of Hong Kong’s national security laws. The emails and letters were sent anonymously, with emails sent from Microsoft Outlook accounts. On social media, posts showed photos of journalists and members of the HKJA executive committee pictured alongside images of knives, blood, shooting targets and 'memorial' signs. The Hong Kong Free Press condemned the attacks. In a statement shared on social media, it said that the landlord of the news website’s director, Tom Grundy, had received threatening letters, saying 'unimaginable consequences' would occur unless Grundy was evicted from his property. Grundy reported the threats to police, the news website said. Media watchdog Reporters Without Borders or RSF called on the international community to take action. 'We strongly condemn this harassment campaign led against the independent media outlets that managed to survive the previous waves of government repression,' said Cedric Alviani, RSF’s Asia-Pacific bureau director. 'We urge the international community to intensify its pressure on the Chinese regime so press freedom is fully restored in the territory.' VOA requested comment late Friday from the Hong Kong Police Force but did not immediately receive a response. Hong Kong’s undersecretary for security, Michael Cheuk, told media 'no one should be intimidated, insulted, or so-called harassed.' Cheuk urged anyone who felt under pressure to report it to law agencies, Reuters reported. The HKJA said that it has contacted Meta, which owns Facebook, and Wikimedia Foundation, the two main platforms used in the harassment campaign. Cheng told VOA she believes a person or group of people are responsible. 'Bots means they are machine-controlled. I don’t think that’s the case,' she added. Details of the intimidation campaign come as critics warn that press freedom is being eroded in Hong Kong. Since Beijing imposed a national security law on Hong Kong in 2020 — which carries life imprisonment for those found guilty of what are deemed as sedition, subversion, foreign interference or terrorism — news outlets have shuttered and there is greater self-censorship on sensitive issues, say media experts. Activists, political figures, lawmakers and reporters are cautious about speaking on the record to the media, with most declining to be interviewed for fear of reprisal. Media unions like the Hong Kong Journalist Association have also come under pressure, after being criticized by authorities and Chinese state media for alleged links to activist organizations. The governments of Hong Kong and China have said that the security law has brought stability back to the former British colony. But since 2020, dozens of people have been arrested under the legislation. At least 28 of those arrested were journalists or press freedom defenders. In August, two journalists from the now-defunct Stand News website were found guilty of sedition in a landmark case. And the pro-democracy publisher Jimmy Lai is in prison and on trial under the national security law for charges he denies.	https://www.voanews.com/a/dozens-of-hong-kong-journalists-threatened-in-harassment-campaign-says-hkja/7784104.html	2024-09-13T19:19:17-07:00

Iraqi, US forces kill top IS commander, other militants in joint operation	baghdad — Iraqi forces and American troops have killed a senior commander with the Islamic State group who was wanted by the United States, as well as several other prominent militants, Iraq's military said Friday. The operation in Iraq's western Anbar province began in late August, the Iraqi military said, and involved members of the Iraqi National Intelligence Service and Iraq's air force. Among the dead was an IS commander from Tunisia, known as Abu Ali Al-Tunisi; the U.S. Treasury Department had offered $5 million for information about him. Also killed was Ahmad Hamed Zwein, the IS deputy commander in Iraq. Despite their defeat, attacks by IS sleeper cells in Iraq and Syria have been on the rise over the past years, with scores of people killed or wounded. Friday's announcement was not the first news of the operation. Two weeks ago, officials said that the U.S. military and Iraq launched a joint raid targeting suspected IS militants in the country's western desert that killed at least 15 people and left seven American troops hurt. Five of the American troops were wounded in the raid itself, while two others suffered injuries from falls during the operation. One who suffered a fall was transported out of the region, while one of the wounded was evacuated for further treatment, a U.S. defense official said at the time, speaking on condition of anonymity. In Friday's announcement, the Iraqi military said the operation also confiscated weapons and computers, smartphones and 10 explosives belts. It added that 14 IS commanders were identified after DNA tests were conducted. It made no mention of the 15th person killed and whether that person had also been identified. The U.S. military has not commented on the August raid. The Islamic State group seized territory at the height of its power and declared a caliphate in large parts of Iraq and Syria in 2014 but was defeated in Iraq in 2017. In March 2019, the extremists lost the last sliver of land they once controlled in eastern Syria. At its peak, the group ruled an area half the size of the United Kingdom where it enforced its extreme interpretation of Islam, which included attacks on religious minority groups and harsh punishment of Muslims deemed to be apostates. Earlier Friday, the U.S. Central Command said its forces killed an IS attack cell member in a strike in eastern Syria. It added that the individual was planting an improvised explosive device for a planned attack against anti-IS coalition forces and their partners, an apparent reference to Syria's Kurdish-led Syrian Democratic Forces. In August last year, the U.S. had agreed to enter into talks to transition U.S. and anti-IS coalition forces from their long-standing role in assisting Iraq in combating IS. There are approximately 2,500 U.S. troops in the country, and their departure will take into account the security situation on the ground, and the capabilities of the Iraqi armed forces.	https://www.voanews.com/a/iraqi-us-forces-kill-top-is-commander-other-militants-in-joint-operation/7784098.html	2024-09-13T18:47:00-07:00	
China’s retirement age, among youngest in world, set to rise	BEIJING — Starting next year, China will raise its retirement age for workers, which is now among the youngest in the world's major economies, in an effort to address its shrinking population and aging work force. The Standing Committee of the National People's Congress, the country's legislature, passed the new policy Friday after a sudden announcement earlier in the week that it was reviewing the measure, state broadcaster CCTV announced. The policy change will be carried out over 15 years, with the retirement age for men raised to 63 years, and for women to 55 or 58 years depending on their jobs. The current retirement age is 60 for men and 50 for women in blue-collar jobs and 55 for women doing white-collar work. 'We have more people coming into the retirement age, and so the pension fund is (facing) high pressure. That's why I think it's now time to act seriously,' said Xiujian Peng, a senior research fellow at Victoria University in Australia who studies China's population and its ties to the economy. The previous retirement ages were set in the 1950's, when life expectancy was only around 40 years, Peng said. The policy will be implemented starting in January, according to the announcement from China's legislature. The change will take effect progressively based on people's birthdates. For example, a man born in January 1971 could retire at the age of 61 years and 7 months in August 2032, according to a chart released along with the policy. A man born in May 1971 could retire at the age of 61 years and 8 months in January 2033. Demographic pressures made the move long overdue, experts say. By the end of 2023, China counted nearly 300 million people over the age of 60. By 2035, that figure is projected to be 400 million, larger than the population of the U.S. The Chinese Academy of Social Sciences had previously projected that the public pension fund will run out of money by that year. Pressure on social benefits such as pensions and social security is hardly a China-specific problem. The U.S. also faces the issue as analysis shows that currently, the Social Security fund won't be able to pay out full benefits to people by 2033. 'This is happening everywhere,' said Yanzhong Huang, senior fellow for global health at the Council on Foreign Relations. 'But in China with its large elderly population, the challenge is much larger.' That is on top of fewer births, as younger people opt out of having children, citing high costs. In 2022, China's National Bureau of Statistics reported that for the first time the country had 850,000 fewer people at the end of the year than the previous year, a turning point from population growth to decline. In 2023, the population shrank further, by 2 million people. What that means is that the burden of funding elderly people's pensions will be divided among a smaller group of younger workers, as pension payments are largely funded by deductions from people who are currently working. Researchers measure that pressure by looking at a number called the dependency ratio, which counts the number of people over the age of 65 compared to the number of workers under 65. That number was 21.8% in 2022, according to government statistics, meaning that roughly five workers would support one retiree. The percentage is expected to rise, meaning fewer workers will be shouldering the burden of one retiree.	https://www.voanews.com/a/china-s-retirement-age-among-youngest-in-world-set-to-rise-/7784095.html	2024-09-13T18:41:22-07:00	
US drone was struck, recovered in Middle East, defense official says	pentagon — A U.S. MQ-9 drone was struck but safely recovered while operating in the Middle East this week, a U.S. defense official told VOA on Friday. 'We can confirm that a U.S. Air Force MQ-9 drone was struck but then landed safely and was recovered by U.S. partner forces on September 9. An investigation into the incident is underway. There were no reported injuries,' the defense official, who spoke on condition of anonymity to discuss national security sensitivities, said in a statement. The news came days after Yemen's Iranian-backed Houthi militants claimed they shot down an MQ-9 drone flying over that country. Houthi spokesperson Brigadier General Yahya Saree said in a prerecorded video message Sunday that the drone had been shot down over Yemen's Marib province, home to key oil and gas fields. The province has been held by allies of a Saudi-led coalition that has been at war with the Houthis for years. It was unclear from the U.S. statement where in the Middle East the drone was struck or who struck it. It was also unclear if the drone was struck and recovered on the same day — Monday — or struck before the Monday recovery. When VOA asked for clarification, it was told there were 'no additional details to share at this time.' The Houthis have downed U.S. drones several times since 2014, when the Iranian-backed group seized Yemen's capital. The attacks on U.S. drones, along with attacks on commercial and military vessels transiting the Red Sea and Gulf of Aden, have drastically increased since the start of the Israel-Hamas war. The Houthis' continuous assault campaign has disrupted commercial shipping in the important corridor, prompting many shipping companies to reroute ships. The militants have targeted more than 80 merchant vessels with missiles and drones since the war in Gaza started in October, seizing one, sinking two and killing at least four sailors. Other missiles and drones have either been intercepted by a U.S.-led coalition in the Red Sea or failed to reach their targets. The Houthi militant campaign began after Israel launched a retaliatory attack against Hamas in Gaza following Hamas' October 7 terror attack, and the Houthis claim they are acting in solidarity with Palestinians during the war. MQ-9 drones, also known as Reapers, cost around $30 million each, can fly up to 24 hours before landing, and can reach altitudes of about 15,000 meters. The aircraft have been flown by both the U.S. military and the CIA over Yemen for years. Some information for this report came from The Associated Press.	https://www.voanews.com/a/us-drone-was-struck-recovered-in-middle-east-defense-official-says-/7784085.html	2024-09-13T18:21:01-07:00	
Mounting North Korean threats await next US president	washington — Recent moves by Pyongyang have focused attention on what will be one of the first major foreign policy challenges facing the next U.S. president: how to deal with North Korea’s rapidly developing nuclear threat. In a set of rapid-fire developments on Friday: — North Korean leader Kim Jong Un called for an 'exponential increase' in the size of his nation’s nuclear arsenal, according to the state-run news agency KCNA. He made the same call in speeches on Tuesday and on the last day of 2022. — State media released photos for the first time of the Nuclear Weapons Institute where North Korea processes uranium for the manufacture of nuclear weapons. The photos, which showed a sophisticated array of centrifuges, were made public as Kim toured the facility. — North Korea announced that it had tested a new type of 600 mm multiple rocket launcher the previous day. South Korea said on Thursday that North Korea test-fired several short-range ballistic missiles into the waters off the eastern coast. The developments came in the context of enhanced military cooperation between North Korea and Russia, which is believed to be helping Pyongyang to develop its weapons capabilities in exchange for munitions used in Moscow’s invasion of Ukraine. 'The threat from North Korea’s nuclear and missile programs has been growing steadily and virtually unchecked over the course of several U.S. administrations,' said Evans Revere, a former State Department official with extensive experience negotiating with North Korea. 'Whoever the next U.S. president is, she or he will face a more sophisticated and dangerous North Korean threat.' Revere said in an interview that the winner of the U.S. election would have to find ways to weaken the link between Moscow and Pyongyang 'and demonstrate to Beijing that its ‘partnership without limits’ with Russia is a dangerous and ill-advised path that will yield no benefits' for China. Russian President Vladimir Putin and Chinese President Xi Jinping declared in May a 'new era' in opposition to the U.S. and reaffirmed the 'no limits' partnership that was first announced just days before Russia's invasion of Ukraine in February 2022. While China has held back on providing Russia with arms for its war effort, the United States has accused it of delivering electronic components and other dual-use items that are keeping Moscow’s arms industry afloat. Pyongyang, for its part, denies participating in any arms transfers to Russia, an act that would violate United Nations sanctions. But a report this week by Conflict Armament Research, a U.K.-based group that tracks weapons in armed conflicts, said parts from four North Korean missiles have been found in Ukraine. The missiles, examined by Kyiv, are either KN-23 or KN-24, known as Hwasong-11 short-range missile series, and thought to have been used in attacks in July and August, the report said. Pyongyang-Moscow military ties have also been expanded to include tourism, trade, and economic and technical cooperation. This makes the use of sanctions less effective as a policy tool to counter North Korea’s nuclear buildup, according to Gary Samore, former White House coordinator for arms control and weapons of mass destruction during the Obama administration. 'That’s not as much leverage now as it was before because of the Russian-North Korean relationship,' said Samore. 'The U.S. doesn’t have very strong economic leverage that it can use with North Korea.' With few obvious policy options available, the two presidential candidates – former President Donald Trump and Vice President Kamala Harris – have largely confined themselves to criticizing each other’s approach without laying out any specific plans to roll back the North Korean threat. At Tuesday night’s televised debate, Harris criticized Trump for exchanging 'love letters with Kim Jong Un' during his presidency while Trump disapproved of the current administration’s handling of the issue, saying, 'Look at what’s going on in North Korea.' During his presidency, Trump held three summits with Kim but the diplomatic effort ultimately failed when Trump refused Kim’s demand for sanctions relief in exchange for a partial rollback of his nuclear program. There have been no formal talks between the two countries since, although the Biden administration insists it is open to negotiations without preconditions, a policy that Harris could be expected to continue if elected. The Biden administration also maintains that its goal remains the complete denuclearization of the Korean Peninsula, even as many experts suggest it is time to acknowledge that Pyongyang will not give up its weapons and say the international community should focus on containment. Samore predicted that a Harris administration would continue to say that 'as an ultimate objective ... the U.S. seeks denuclearization in the long term.' A second Trump administration, he theorized, may say 'denuclearization is no longer possible' and 'accept North Korea as a nuclear power.' Robert Rapson, who served as charge d’affaires and deputy chief of mission at the U.S. Embassy in Seoul from 2018 to 2021, said much would depend on how the winner of the election decides to work with regional allies South Korea and Japan. 'In the likely absence of any grand outreach towards Pyongyang, Harris will have to carefully manage the relationship with ally Seoul, with a focus for the foreseeable future on maintaining peace and stability on the peninsula,' he said. He added that it was 'uncertain at this moment' whether Trump would feel compelled to reach out to Kim and whether he would diminish the value of the alliances with South Korea and Japan.

Pentagon: $5.9B in Ukraine aid is left to be spent before October 1	pentagon — The Pentagon says it has nearly $6 billion in funding for Ukraine left that could expire at the end of this month unless Congress or the State Department acts to extend the military's authority to draw weapons from its stockpiles to send to Kyiv. 'We have $5.9 billion left in Ukraine Presidential Drawdown Authority, all but $100 million of which will expire at the end of the fiscal year,' Pentagon press secretary Major General Pat Ryder said Friday. 'The department will continue to provide drawdown packages in the near future and is working with Congress to seek an extension of PDA [presidential drawdown] authorities beyond the end of the fiscal year.' A defense official, who spoke to VOA on the condition of anonymity, said Congress' monthslong deadlock in passing the supplemental funding bill for Ukraine was a 'contributing factor' as to why billions of dollars for weapons remained unspent. The money was expected to be allocated for Ukraine last year, but the U.S. House was unable to pass the $95 billion foreign aid package for Ukraine, Israel and Taiwan until late April of this year. Of that, about $61 billion was earmarked for Ukraine. The official said the delay left the Pentagon with less time to identify and send military aid to Kyiv from its stockpiles. The nearly $6 billion left in funding amounts to less than 10% of the aid allocated in April to address the conflict in Ukraine. Speaking in response to a VOA question earlier this month, deputy Pentagon press secretary Sabrina Singh said the Pentagon would 'use everything we can that's available to us to make sure that we are continuing to provide Ukraine what it needs, both in the short term and the long term.' 'We're in this fight with Ukraine for the long haul,' she said. Two ways to ensure access There are two ways to make sure that access to the remaining funds will not expire at the beginning of October, Mykola Murskyj, director of advocacy for the NGO Razom for Ukraine, told VOA. The first is that Congress has to approve it again. This requires lawmakers to pass a provision that would extend the authority to use the remaining amount in the next budget year. House members from both sides of the aisle have expressed support for extending the authorities so that all the allocated funding for Kyiv can be used. 'If we need to extend it, we'll extend it,' Representative Adam Smith, the ranking Democrat on the House Armed Services Committee, told VOA. Representative Mike Lawler, a Republican on the House Committee on Foreign Affairs, added that he would 'push to get it done' if the funding was not all spent by the deadline. The second way to ensure the military can access the remaining funds is for the State Department to notify Congress of its intent to use the funds, according to Murskyj. In this case, lawmakers will not need to vote on the extension, but formal notification must be issued by the secretary of state, as has been done in the past. A State Department spokesperson would not comment on whether it would issue the extension, saying it would not discuss communications with lawmakers and their staffs, but would continue 'to coordinate closely with Congress concerning the steadfast support that the United States, our allies and our partners worldwide are providing to help Ukraine defend itself against Russia's premeditated, unprovoked and unjustified war.' Murskyj told VOA his advocacy group was working with members of Congress to extend the funds. 'However, I am not going to put all of my eggs in that basket,' he said, because 'it is very difficult to predict what Congress will do, and there's always the potential for some kind of last-minute derailment.' In a letter to the administration, members of pro-Ukrainian nongovernmental organizations said extending these funds 'would send a powerful message to Ukraine, Russia and American voters that the administration wants Ukraine to win.' Kateryna Lisunova of VOA's Ukrainian Service contributed to this report.	https://www.voanews.com/a/pentagon-5-9b-in-ukraine-aid-is-left-to-be-spent-before-october-1-/7783763.html	2024-09-13T16:56:03-07:00

US slams RT as 'de facto' arm of Russian intelligence	washington — The United States and some of its allies have launched a global campaign to undercut efforts by RT and other Russian state-backed media outlets, accusing them of operating on behalf of the Kremlin’s intelligence agencies. The State Department on Friday announced sanctions against two people and three entities, including RT’s Moscow-based parent company, saying new intelligence leaves no doubt that they are no longer engaged in providing anything that resembles news and information. RT’s parent company and its subsidiaries 'are no longer merely fire hoses of Russian government propaganda and disinformation,' U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken told reporters at the State Department. 'They are engaged in covert influence activities aimed at undermining American elections and democracy, functioning like a de facto arm of Russia's intelligence apparatus,' he said, adding the Russian operations also seek to 'meddle in the sovereign affairs of countries around the world.' Blinken and other U.S. officials declined to share details about the new intelligence, saying only that some of it comes from RT employees, and that it shows how the Russian-controlled television network is playing a key role in running cyber operations and even acquiring lethal weapons for Russian troops fighting in Ukraine. RT quickly ridiculed the U.S. accusations both on social media and in a response to VOA. 'RT: *Lives rent free in the State Department head*,' the outlet posted on X. 'We’re running out of popcorn, but we’ll be here live, laughing hard...' In response to a query from VOA, RT pointed to comments by editor-in-chief Margarita Simonyan on her Telegram channel. 'American intelligence services have uncovered that we are helping the front lines,' Simonyan wrote, according to a translation from Russian. 'We’ve been doing this openly, you idiots. Should I send you a list of what we've bought and sent? We regularly publish this, just so you know.' The Russian Embassy in Washington has not yet responded to a request from VOA for comment. U.S. officials, though, said comments like the ones from RT’s Simonyan only give more weight to the allegations. 'They've admitted it,' said James Rubin, the special envoy for the State Department's Global Engagement Center. 'They have said they're operating under direct instruction of [Russian President] Vladimir Putin. That's what they say they're doing.' And the U.S. says the intelligence shows those Kremlin-assigned responsibilities go far beyond what could be considered normal broadcast operations, including oversight of a crowdsourcing campaign to provide Russian troops in Ukraine with sniper rifles, body armor, drones, night vision equipment and other weaponry. 'That's not what a TV station normally does. That's what ... that's what a military entity does,' Rubin said. RT is 'a fully fledged member of the intelligence apparatus and operation of the Russian government on the war in Ukraine.' The U.S. intelligence also points to Kremlin-directed RT operations in Argentina, Germany and the South Caucasus – some linked to a Russian military intelligence cyber team that has been embedded within the company. U.S. officials also said evidence shows RT is 'almost certainly' coordinating with traditional Russian intelligence services to meddle in next month’s presidential elections in Moldova. 'RT is going to be used to try to manipulate an election and, if they don't win the election, manipulate a crowd to try to generate violence for the possibility of overthrowing [the government],' Rubin said. U.S. officials also called out RT for covert influence operations in Latin America and Africa that have had serious consequences. 'One of the reasons why so much of the world has not been as fully supportive of Ukraine as you would think they would be — given that Russia has invaded Ukraine and violated rule number one of the international system — is because of the broad scope and reach of RT,' Rubin said. The State Department said Friday that it had instructed its diplomats to share evidence about RT’s efforts with countries around the world. 'We urge every ally, every partner, to start by treating RT’s activities as they do other intelligence activities by Russia within their borders,' Blinken said. Friday’s sanctions came a little more than a week after the U.S. took action against what it described as two Russian plots, one of them involving RT, aimed at undermining the U.S. presidential elections in November. The U.S. Department of Justice announced the takedown of 32 fake websites designed by Russia to mimic legitimate news sites, to bombard U.S. voters with propaganda aimed at building support for Russia in its war against Ukraine and bolstering support for Republican presidential candidate and former President Donald Trump. The U.S. also unsealed indictments against two RT employees, accusing them of funneling nearly $10 million to a U.S. company in Tennessee to promote and distribute English-language material favorable to the Russian government.	https://www.voanews.com/a/us-slams-rt-as-de-facto-arm-of-russian-intelligence-/7783709.html	2024-09-13T14:55:08-07:00

Critics denounce $1.3B in US military aid to Egypt despite alleged rights abuses	washington — The Biden administration’s approval this week of a $1.3 billion military aid package for Egypt despite its failure to hit human rights benchmarks has been criticized by rights experts. The bill’s approval Wednesday overrode human rights benchmarks required to release a certain portion of the aid. A group of senators had earlier urged the administration in a letter to withhold the aid, citing the Egyptian government’s 'targeting of political opponents and journalists.' Egypt, a longtime ally of the U.S., was far from reaching those benchmarks, Yeganeh Rezaian of the Committee to Protect Journalists, or CPJ, told VOA. 'No one can say Egypt is making human rights progress,' Rezaian said. The senators’ letter cited Egypt’s failure to investigate 'allegations of human rights abuses,' including enforced disappearances and torture in prison, especially for journalists and political dissidents. This was the first time during Biden’s presidency that Egypt received the full amount of U.S. foreign military financing allocated to Cairo. In previous years, a portion of aid had been withheld because of human rights concerns, according to CPJ. This year, the human rights requirements were waived in the interest of advancing cease-fire negotiations in Gaza, territory that borders Egypt, a spokesperson for Secretary of State Antony Blinken told Reuters. 'Egypt plays an important role in accessing Gaza for peace talks in Israel,' Rezaian told VOA. 'But that’s why the security of journalists and freedom of information in the country is very important for everyone, inside and outside.' CPJ researchers believe the world’s increased focus on the Israel-Hamas war has drawn attention away from other allegations of human rights violations in the same region. In Egypt, CPJ has documented the arrests of four journalists who were subjected to enforced disappearances since March. Their cases highlight the 'shameful record' of media persecution in Egypt, according to a joint statement published Monday by the CPJ and 34 other international rights groups. The statement called for the release of Ashraf Omar, Khaled Mamdouh, Ramadan Gouida and Yasser Abu Al-Ela. Authorities took all four journalists to undisclosed locations before their appearances in Egypt’s court. At least two have been subjected to physical torture during their imprisonment, according to CPJ. 'By releasing these folks, the government can show they believe in press freedom and democracy,' Rezaian told VOA. Among those detained is Omar, a cartoonist for independent news website Al-Manassa. Omar was subjected to electric shocks and other forms of physical torture, his wife told an Egyptian news website. Omar had published multiple 'critical cartoons' about the policies of his government, Sophie Brondel of Cartooning for Peace told VOA. She added that authorities have questioned him about his cartoons during detainment. Cartooning for Peace was one of the 34 co-signers of CPJ’s statement. 'We can see in many authoritarian regimes that cartoonists are often among the first targets,' Brondel told VOA. 'With their drawings, they have the capacity to also reach out to a broader public.' Freemuse, another artistic freedom organization that signed the document, has been monitoring Egypt’s media landscape for years. The organization noted an increase in how the government has 'hammered down on freedom of expression,' Sverre Pedersen, Freemuse’s executive director, told VOA. 'Without free expression and free art, it’s not possible to have democracy,' Pedersen said. Egypt has consistently been a top-10 jailer of journalists worldwide, according to CPJ data. The watchdog contends that torture and enforced disappearance of media workers are common practices under President Abdel-Fattah el-Sissi. In the decade since el-Sissi came to power, media repression in Egypt has intensified. The country has become 'one of the world’s most oppressive countries towards journalists,' with dozens of arrests and the blocking of over 500 news websites, according to Reporters Without Borders. The Egyptian Embassy in Washington did not respond to VOA's email requesting comment. 'Our statement is the first step in terms of raising awareness,' said Rezaian of CPJ. 'We want the statement to be amplified as much as possible and are hoping to move towards international pressure.'	https://www.voanews.com/a/critics-denounce-1-3b-in-us-military-aid-to-egypt-despite-alleged-rights-abuses/7783692.html	2024-09-13T14:28:19-07:00	
Malawi battles fresh cholera outbreak	Blantyre, Malawi — Malawi is recording new cases of cholera two months after it declared the end of the country's worst cholera outbreak, which began in March 2022 and killed nearly 2,000 people. New cases have been reported in Chitipa district in northern Malawi and Machinga district in the south. Records from Chitipa District Health Office, released Friday, show the district has recorded 22 cases of cholera, with one death, since the onset of the new outbreak last week. That includes nine new cases registered Friday, with eight people hospitalized. Cholera is an acute diarrheal disease that can kill within hours if left untreated. Machinga district hospital in southern Malawi registered its first cholera case in the new outbreak this week. 'It has been three days now since we registered that case,' said Wongani Nyirenda, the hospital’s spokesperson. 'However, we are doing everything to make sure that people are using safe water. We have given them some chlorine and a water guard to treat their water.' He said health surveillance assistants are also on the ground educating people about good hygiene practices. The resurgence of cholera cases comes two months after Malawi declared the end of the country's worst cholera outbreak, which began in March 2022 and killed nearly 2,000 people. Government authorities told VOA in July that they had stopped the outbreak by increasing access to safe water and administering an oral cholera vaccination campaign that began in December 2022. George Jobe, executive director of the Malawi Health Equity Network, is concerned about the resurgence. 'It is worrisome,' he said. 'Our hope and expectation was that we would have a breather. A longer breather, especially considering that in 2022 we had a big suffering from cholera which took us over a year. So, we wouldn’t want to go back to such a bad experience.' Jobe believes the resurgence means Malawi is still struggling to address the challenges of making safe water available. He said water contaminated by sewage is the main cause of cholera. 'We have issues to do with behavioral change where hygiene issues should be borne in mind, like washing hands with soap, having pit latrines and good waste management,' he said. The co-chairperson for the presidential task force on COVID-19 and cholera in Malawi, Dr. Wilfred Chalamira Nkhoma, did not respond to calls and texts from VOA seeking comment on the new outbreak. However, Ministry of Health officials told local media this week that Malawians should not panic, saying the government is putting measures in place to control the spread of the disease.	https://www.voanews.com/a/malawi-battles-fresh-cholera-outbreak/7783671.html	2024-09-13T13:58:54-07:00

Report details how China retaliates against people for engaging with UN	washington — China is among the foreign governments that retaliate against people for engaging with the United Nations, according to a report released this week by the U.N. Secretary-General. The report highlights how hard Beijing tries to silence its critics, according to Sophie Richardson, an expert on human rights in China. 'These [U.N.] mechanisms are some of the only ones available to people inside China, at least on paper, to provide any modicum of redress or justice for the human rights abuses either they’ve endured or the communities they work with have endured,' Richardson told VOA. 'That’s why you see the Chinese government go to extraordinary lengths to silence people who are simply trying to take reports to some of these human rights experts or bodies,' Richardson said. A former China director at Human Rights Watch, Richardson is currently a visiting scholar at Stanford University. The annual report chronicles government retaliation against people for engaging with the U.N. In addition to China, other countries named in the report include Colombia, India, Nicaragua, the Philippines and Russia. 'In my perfect world, governments that get referenced in these reprisals reports shouldn’t be members of the Human Rights Council,' said Richardson, who is based in Washington. China is a current member of the council in Geneva. China’s Washington embassy, as well as its U.N. offices in New York and Geneva, did not reply to VOA’s emails requesting comment for this story. One of the incidents included in the report’s China section is harassment against two members of the international legal team supporting Jimmy Lai, a pro-democracy publisher. Lai is on trial in Hong Kong on national security charges that are widely viewed as politically motivated. The 76-year-old is in prison following convictions in other cases that supporters also view as sham cases. Members of Lai’s legal team have faced death and rape threats, as well as attempts by unknown sources to hack their email and bank accounts, according to the report. Sebastien Lai thanked the U.N. for shedding light on his father’s case. 'These intimidation tactics will not succeed. I will not rest until my father is freed,' he said in a statement. Caoilfhionn Gallagher KC, a barrister leading Jimmy’s international legal team, also condemned the attacks. The reprisals 'are personally unpleasant and distressing,' Gallagher said in a statement. 'But they are also an attack on the legal profession and on the international human rights system.' The reprisals make it harder for Jimmy Lai to use U.N. mechanisms to achieve justice in his case, Gallagher said. Hong Kong’s government has tried to argue that the legal team interfered in Hong Kong’s judicial process by bringing his case to U.N. human rights mechanisms, according to the report. 'It’s just so nakedly in tension with its obligations under international law,' Richardson said. On Thursday, Lai’s international legal team submitted an urgent appeal to the U.N. special rapporteur on torture. The appeal raised several concerns, including that the elderly publisher has been in solitary confinement since late 2020 and that the British national has been denied access to independent medical care, according to a statement from his legal team. Lai’s trial began in December 2023. It was initially expected to last around 80 days but is now expected to resume in November. Press freedom groups have called the trial a sham, and the U.S. and British governments have called for his immediate release. Hong Kong officials, however, have said he will receive a fair trial. Other incidents cited in the U.N. report include the case of Cao Shunli, a Beijing-based human rights defender who was arrested following an attempt to engage in a universal periodic review of China’s human rights record at the Human Rights Council. Cao died in custody in 2014. Another case is that of the Beijing-based activists Li Wenzu and Wang Quanzhang, who are married. The couple have faced significant retaliation, including police surveillance and evictions, and their son is unable to enroll in school due to pressure from state authorities, the report said. 'If one reads these cases, you get a sense of what risks — what unbelievable risks — people are taking to do this kind of work,' Richardson said. The report doesn’t mention specific incidents involving Uyghurs or Tibetans, but Richardson says their absence underscores how difficult it is for some groups to access U.N. mechanisms in the first place, as well as how some people may be too scared to report such incidents to the U.N. The Chinese government has engaged in severe human rights abuses against both ethnic groups, according to myriad reports. Multiple governments and international human rights organizations have accused Beijing of committing genocide and crimes against humanity against the Uyghurs, which the Chinese government rejects.	https://www.voanews.com/a/report-details-how-china-retaliates-against-people-for-engaging-with-un/7783526.html	2024-09-13T12:35:16-07:00	
China, US resume top-level military communication amid ongoing tension	Taipei, Taiwan — The United States and China are taking steps to resume top-level military-to-military communication, which analysts say is aimed at avoiding miscommunication and preventing tensions in the Indo-Pacific region from spiraling out of control. The head of the U.S. Indo-Pacific Command, Admiral Sam Paparo, and the head of the People's Liberation Army (PLA) Southern Theater Command, General Wu Yanan, held a video call Tuesday. The Chinese defense ministry said the two commanders had an 'in-depth exchange of views on issues of common concern' while Paparo urged the Chinese military 'to reconsider its use of dangerous, coercive and potentially escalatory tactics in the South China Sea and beyond.' On Thursday, the Financial Times and The Wall Street Journal reported that Wu is expected to attend a defense conference held by the U.S. Indo-Pacific Command in Hawaii next week, citing anonymous U.S. defense officials. Meanwhile, Michael Chase, the U.S. assistant secretary of defense for China, Taiwan and Mongolia, is holding defense policy coordination talks with Chinese defense officials while attending the annual Xiangshan Security Dialogue held in Beijing. The U.S. delegation led by Chase will 'engage with regional allies and partners on the sidelines of the Xiangshan Forum to underscore the United States' shared vision for the region ‘underpinned by a set of enduring beliefs,’' said the U.S. Department of Defense in a readout released Thursday. The Biden administration has been working to restore communication between Chinese and American militaries since the U.S. president’s meeting with Chinese President Xi Jinping on the sidelines of the APEC Summit in California last November. It also follows the first meeting between U.S. national security adviser Jake Sullivan and China’s vice chairman of the Central Military Commission, Zhang Youxia, last month. During that meeting, Zhang said maintaining military security is 'in line with the common interests of both sides' and Sullivan highlighted the two nations’ shared responsibility to 'prevent competition from veering into conflict or confrontation.' Some analysts see a potential for further communication and engagement between the two militaries. 'I won’t rule out the possibilities that Beijing and Washington may look to establish a hotline between the two militaries, and whether that mechanism could be extended to the theater command level remains to be seen,' Lin Ying-Yu, a military expert at Tamkang University in Taiwan, told VOA by phone. While the resumption of top-level communication allows Beijing and Washington to avoid miscalculations, other experts say it is unclear whether China and the U.S. can establish a more sustainable mechanism to cope with potential crises. 'While having contact and knowing your interlocutors are positive things during non-crisis times, the real test is whether these contacts can hold back any unintended escalation when incidents happen,' said Ian Chong, a political scientist at the National University of Singapore. Chong said since theater commanders from the U.S. and China oversee implementing rather than formulating policies, it is unclear whether the latest development can become established protocols. 'If there’s a persistence of [maintaining military-to-military communication], then it would suggest that it has become a policy,' he told VOA by phone. Tensions remain high over contentious issues Tensions remain high between China and the U.S. over a range of issues, including the repeated collision between Chinese and Philippine vessels near disputed reefs in the South China Sea and Beijing’s increased maneuvers in waters and airspace near Taiwan and Japan. During the Xiangshan Forum, Lieutenant General He Lei, the former vice president of the PLA Academy of Military Sciences, characterized the Philippines’ attempt to safeguard its territorial claims in the South China Sea as 'a unilateral change of the status quo' while accusing the U.S. of undermining security across the Taiwan Strait by selling weapons to Taiwan. 'The Chinese people and the People's Liberation Army will never allow any external forces to interfere in China's internal affairs or invade China's territory,' he told Chinese state broadcaster CGTN in an interview. Some analysts say there are limits to what military-to-military communications can do to ease tensions over what are essentially political disagreements. 'The military tension is only a manifestation of their political differences over Taiwan and the South China Sea, so if their disagreements are not resolved, the military tension is very unlikely to see a permanent resolution,' Yun Sun, China program director at the Stimson Center in Washington, told VOA by phone. With less than two months until the U.S. presidential election, Chong in Singapore said Beijing and Washington’s recent efforts may be an attempt to lay the foundation for bilateral military-to-military communication to be continued after the November election. 'On the Democrat side, if some of the current team stays [after November], perhaps we would see this momentum continue,' he told VOA. 'On the Republican side, things are a bit messier, because you have those who prefer the isolationist approach, those who advocate a containment approach in Asia, and people who talk about competing against China to win,' Chong added. Sun said if Donald Trump wins the election in November, Beijing will expect instability in bilateral relations and be prepared for the military relationship to be affected.	https://www.voanews.com/a/china-us-resume-top-level-military-communication-amid-ongoing-tension/7783487.html	2024-09-13T11:53:08-07:00	
Mexican cartel leader 'El Mayo' Zambada pleads not guilty to US charges	new york — Ismael 'El Mayo' Zambada, a powerful leader of Mexico’s Sinaloa cartel, pleaded not guilty Friday to U.S. narcotics trafficking charges in a case accusing him of engaging in murder plots, ordering torture and channeling tons of drugs into the United States. Participating in a court hearing through a Spanish-language interpreter, Zambada gave yes-or-no answers to a magistrate’s standard questions about whether he understood various documents and procedures. Asked how he was feeling, he said, 'Fine, fine.' His lawyers entered the not guilty plea on his behalf. Outside court, Zambada attorney Frank Perez said his client wasn't contemplating making a deal with the government, and the attorney expects the case to go to trial. 'It's a complex case,' he said. Sought by American law enforcement for more than two decades, Zambada has been in U.S. custody since July 25, when he landed in a private plane at an airport outside El Paso, Texas, in the company of another fugitive cartel leader, Joaquin Guzman Lopez, according to federal authorities. Zambada later said in a letter that he was kidnapped in Mexico and brought to the U.S. by Guzman Lopez, a son of imprisoned Sinaloa co-founder Joaquin 'El Chapo' Guzman. Zambada's lawyer did not elaborate on those claims Friday. U.S. Magistrate Judge James Cho ordered Zambada detained until trial. His lawyers did not ask for bail, and U.S. prosecutors in Brooklyn asked the judge to detain him. 'He was one of the most, if not the most, powerful narcotics kingpins in the world,' Assistant U.S. Attorney Francisco Navarro said. 'He co-founded the Sinaloa cartel and sat atop the narcotics trafficking world for decades.' Zambada sat quietly as he listened to the interpreter. Leaving court after the brief hearing, he appeared to accept some help getting out of a chair, then walked out slowly but unaided. The 76-year-old had used a wheelchair at a court appearance in Texas last month. But Perez said after court Friday that Zambada was healthy and 'in good spirits.' Sketch artists were in the small courtroom, but other journalists could observe only through closed-circuit video because of a shortage of seats. In court and in a letter earlier to the judge, prosecutors said Zambada presided over a vast and violent operation, with an arsenal of military-grade weapons, a private security force that was almost like an army, and a corps of 'sicarios,' or hitmen, who carried out assassinations, kidnappings and torture. His bloody tenure included ordering the murder, just months ago, of his own nephew, the prosecutors said. 'A United States jail cell is the only thing that will prevent the defendant from committing further crimes,' Navarro said. Zambada also pleaded not guilty to the charges at an earlier court appearance in Texas. His next court appearance is scheduled for October 31. According to authorities, Zambada and 'El Chapo' Guzman built the Sinaloa cartel from a regional syndicate into a huge manufacturer and smuggler of cocaine, heroin and other illicit drugs to the U.S. Zambada has been seen as the group's strategist and dealmaker and a less flamboyant figure than Guzman. Zambada had never been behind bars until his U.S. arrest in July. His apprehension has touched off fighting in Mexico between rival factions in the Sinaloa cartel. Gunfights have killed several people. Schools and businesses in Culiacan, the capital of Sinaloa, have closed amid the fighting. The battles are believed to be between factions loyal to Zambada and those led by other sons of 'El Chapo' Guzman, who was convicted of drug and conspiracy charges and sentenced to life in prison in the U.S. in 2019. It remains unclear why Guzman Lopez surrendered to U.S. authorities and brought Zambada with him. Guzman Lopez is awaiting trial on a separate drug trafficking indictment in Chicago, where he has pleaded not guilty.	https://www.voanews.com/a/mexican-cartel-leader-el-mayo-zambada-pleads-not-guilty-to-us-charges-/7783468.html	2024-09-13T11:41:56-07:00	
Comoros president slightly injured in knife attack, spokesperson says	MORONI — Comoros President Azali Assoumani was slightly injured in a knife attack on Friday, the archipelago nation's government spokesperson said, adding that the attacker has been taken into custody. The incident occurred around 2 p.m. local time in Salimani Itsandra, a town just north of the capital, Moroni, a local source told Reuters. 'President Azali Assoumani was slightly injured with a knife during the funeral of a great sheik of the country. His injuries are not serious, and he has returned home,' government spokesperson Fatima Ahamada told Reuters. The motive for the attack was not immediately clear. The source from the town of Salimani Itsandra added that the attacker is a former policeman in his 20s. In May, Assoumani was sworn in for a fourth term in office following a tense January election which his opponents claim was tainted by voter fraud.	https://www.voanews.com/a/comoros-president-slightly-injured-in-knife-attack-spokesperson-says/7783427.html	2024-09-13T11:04:19-07:00

How propaganda outlets cover — or ignore — aspects of US election	Washington — When Kamala Harris and Donald Trump met in a presidential debate on Tuesday, they spoke about a range of foreign policy issues, including China and Russia’s war in Ukraine. But while the debate attracted large audiences and coverage in the United States and Europe, Beijing and Moscow’s state-run media were relatively quiet on the event. The minimal coverage is a contrast to the presidential debate between Joe Biden and Trump in June. Chinese media After that debate, Beijing-run outlets — like media around the world — were flooded with coverage of Biden’s poor performance. But Harris-Trump coverage was noticeably slimmer in state-run outlets such as Xinhua, the Global Times and the People’s Daily newspaper, China media analysts say. The shift is a subtle but significant distinction, according to China media analysts, that reflects how the Chinese Communist Party, or CCP, employs its propaganda apparatus. The relative lack of coverage wasn’t all that surprising to Kenton Thibaut, a senior resident China fellow at the Atlantic Council’s Digital Forensic Research Lab in Washington. The Chinese government is probably still figuring out how to move forward following Biden’s abrupt withdrawal, said Thibaut. She believes that’s a primary reason for the reduced coverage of this week’s debate. 'This is really reflective of how China handles changes in foreign policy issues,' Thibaut said. 'They just stick to very fact-based coverage, basically restating what the candidate said, until they — the propaganda department and such — can figure out basically how to cover it globally and domestically.' Another reason for the reduced coverage may have to do with democracy itself, according to China experts. 'The presidential debate is important for U.S. democracy, and democracy is always a sensitive topic for the CCP,' Anne-Marie Brady, a professor and specialist in Chinese politics at the University of Canterbury in New Zealand, told VOA in an email. Jonathan Hassid, an Iowa State University professor who specializes in Chinese media, agreed. 'Chinese media does not like covering democratic successes,' Hassid told VOA. 'Democratic failures are highlighted, but the successes are not.' That helps explain the difference between the coverage of the two debates. During the first debate, which by many accounts was a fiasco, Biden sounded hoarse and frail, and his repeated fumbles highlighted concerns over the 81-year-old’s capacity to serve another four-year term as president. In coverage of that debate, Chinese state media relied on narratives about how democracy doesn’t work well, Hassid said. For instance, Hu Xijin, a Chinese media commentator and former state media editor, wrote, 'Objectively speaking, the low-quality performance of these two old men was a negative advertisement for Western democracy.' By contrast, Hassid said, this week’s debate may have been perceived as a better display of democracy. Still, China also didn’t even feature that largely in the latest debate. While Harris didn’t go into much detail, she said that 'a policy about China should be in making sure the United States of America wins the competition for the 21st century.' Trump, meanwhile, has previously proposed tariffs up to 100% on Chinese products. When asked about Harris and Trump’s views about tariffs on imports from China, Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesperson Mao Ning on Wednesday said she had no comment. 'The presidential elections are the United States’ own affairs,' she said. 'That said, we are opposed to making China an issue in U.S. elections.' A spokesperson for China’s embassy replied to VOA’s request for comment with a similar statement: 'On the issue of the U.S. election, China’s position is consistent and clear. China has no intention and will not interfere in it. At the same time, we hope that the U.S. side will not make accusations against China in the election.' Russian media Russia — another propaganda powerhouse — also didn’t offer much coverage of the debate. 'But that doesn’t mean that they don’t drop in plenty of spin,' according to Darren Linvill, co-director of Clemson University’s Media Forensics Hub. Based on his analysis of Russian state media coverage of the debate, Linvill said outlets such as RT and Sputnik were focused on downplaying Harris and playing up Trump. There were some outliers, such as a Sputnik article in which a psychiatrist claimed Harris was trying to 'hide her imposter syndrome' during the debate. But most of the coverage was subtler, Linvill said. Articles tended to be anodyne and not necessarily critical of either side, Linvill said, but they still reveal Moscow’s well-documented preference for Trump. U.S. officials are again warning about Russian efforts to influence this year’s election. Last week, the Justice Department accused two Russians who work at the Kremlin-backed RT of money laundering by funneling nearly $10 million to a conservative Tennessee-based media outlet that is a leading platform for pro-Trump voices. While it’s important to monitor disinformation in the lead-up to and during an election, according to Thibaut, the period immediately after is perhaps even more important, especially if the election is close. 'This is a prime time for threat actors to take advantage of information, the polarizing narratives, the charged-up atmosphere to really sow social division,' Thibaut said. 'We have to really remain vigilant after the election as well.'	https://www.voanews.com/a/how-propaganda-outlets-cover-or-ignore-aspects-of-us-election/7783317.html	2024-09-13T10:12:54-07:00	
US-China rivalry for military influence in Africa ramps up	Johannesburg — While the U.S. was forced to downsize and pull its troops out of Niger this year, China is increasing its military cooperation on the continent, recently announcing a plan to spend $140 million to train 6,000 military personnel — a move, a U.S. defense official said Friday, was for China’s 'own economic growth and benefit.' Among the many ways that the U.S. and China are competing for influence in Africa, analysts say military cooperation on the continent is one that is seeing rising rivalry between the two superpowers. At a summit that focused on China-Africa cooperation last week, Chinese President Xi Jinping made the pledge to train the 6,000 military personnel. He also invited 500 African officers to visit China. ‘Most explicit’ pledge China has been cooperating with Africa in several areas of security for years, including participating in U.N. peacekeeping missions, holding joint military drills, and providing training and education for officers. However, analysts said the latest announcement was particularly noteworthy. 'This year’s military pledge was by far the most explicit,' Lauren Johnston, associate professor of China studies at the University of Sydney, told VOA. 'Never seen anything so measured and direct.' Asked by VOA about whether Xi’s pledge means China is outperforming the U.S. when it comes to security cooperation on the continent, a spokesperson for U.S.-Africa Command, or AFRICOM, said: 'We recognize that the PRC is adept at creating opportunities to expand influence on the continent.' The PRC is the acronym for China’s official name, the People’s Republic of China. 'Its long-term vision for Africa is tied to its own economic benefit and growth,' said the spokesperson, Kelly Cahalan. 'The PRC is the second-largest arms supplier in Africa after Russia, with defense exports of small arms, missile systems, aerial munitions, naval vessels, combat aircraft, infantry vehicles and unmanned aerial vehicles.' However, the AFRICOM spokesperson added that the U.S. 'would welcome the PRC's cooperation on issues such as climate change, global health security, arms control and non-proliferation.' Niger exodus In a blow to Washington earlier this year, the U.S. military was forced to pull troops out of Niger, after the junta there demanded the U.S. close its $100 million airbase combatting extremist groups in the Sahel region. Since then, the U.S. has been in talks with other West African nations, including Ivory Coast, Ghana and Benin 'as we start to reset and recalibrate some of our assets,' General Michael Langley commander of U.S.-Africa Command, or AFRICOM, told journalists in an online press briefing Thursday. Langley was speaking from Kenya, after also visiting Somalia to speak with the government about counter-terrorism efforts against al-Shabab. He has spent a lot of time on the continent recently, having also visited a number of North African countries earlier this year. Asked in the press briefing about China’s influence in Africa, General Langley said the choice lay with African governments. 'When we have engaged with our African partners, we don’t give them an ultimatum of who to choose for a security partner,' he said. 'All our activities and our partnership-centric type approach should be African-led and U.S.-enabled.' Darren Olivier, director of the conflict research consulting firm African Defense Review, said the U.S. is trying to shore up support after the blow it received in West Africa. 'The U.S. was clearly shaken by the junta takeovers in Sahelian countries like Burkina Faso & Niger and their subsequent ending of security cooperation and basing agreements,' he said in a written response to VOA, noting that the U.S. had been criticized for not being consultative enough with its African partners. 'General Langley’s tour therefore appears to be not just about shoring up support for new cooperation agreements and basing locations, but to reinforce the U.S.’s new message of listening first and advising second,' Olivier added. Playing the long game Efforts by the U.S. in Africa come as China is working to grow its ties as well. Jana de Kluiver, an analyst with the Institute for Security Studies based in South Africa, said China was looking to foster long-term connections with the people who will go on to become Africa’s military top brass and political elite. 'The 6,000 military personnel trained by China will later on become higher ranking figures in their respective countries, enhancing Beijing's soft power across the continent,' she told VOA. In 2022, China launched what it called the Global Security Initiative, or GSI, as a counterpoint to the U.S.-led security order. One of the main tenets of the initiative is China’s principle of non-interference. 'As Chinese economic interests expand across the continent, the need for a stable security environment becomes critical. However, Beijing is careful to avoid appearing too assertive, as its broader narrative seeks to contrast with the perceived interventionism of the West,' said the Institute for Security Studies’ de Kluiver. African Defense Review’s Olivier said it will be interesting to see how African nations that are used to Western military support and training now juggle their options. If they opt for Chinese training, they could then choose to 'silo their armed forces into units trained by Western countries and units trained by China, which will have its own impacts from incompatible doctrines and standards,' he told VOA. China always positions itself as a no-strings attached ally of Africa and Olivier said it would also depend where China placed any pre-conditions on military cooperation. 'Western countries are traditionally skittish about training units that might commit human rights violations,' he said. 'This might provide the opportunity for some countries frustrated with those restrictions to turn to Beijing for training instead.' Base concerns Washington has also long been concerned about the possibility that China is looking to establish a second permanent base in Africa. Beijing already has one on the continent’s east coast, in Djibouti, and is said to be seeking a foothold in West Africa. That would give Beijing a military presence across the Atlantic from America’s East Coast, a move that analysts say would be perceived by the U.S. as a threat to national security. China was believed to be looking to Equatorial Guinea, but those talks have reportedly stalled. Last week Bloomberg reported the U.S. is assembling a $5 million security package, including special forces training, for Gabon. The report quoted unnamed sources, but said the deal was aimed at preventing China from establishing a base in the country.	https://www.voanews.com/a/us-china-rivalry-for-military-influence-in-africa-ramps-up/7783311.html	2024-09-13T09:56:32-07:00	
Polish MPs vote to reform controversial constitutional court	Warsaw, Poland — Poland's lower house of parliament on Friday adopted legislation to reform the controversial constitutional court that remains under the control of the nationalists previously in power. To enter into effect, the legislation still needs to be signed by President Andrzej Duda — an ally of the preceding right-wing Law and Justice, or PiS, party government — who has not indicated what he plans to do. The constitutional court had been a source of contention between the PiS government and Brussels, which believed the tribunal damaged the independence of Poland's judiciary and extended the party's influence over the courts. Over the years, Poland's constitutional court has repeatedly challenged the primacy of EU law over national law. The parliament today 'took a huge step forward' towards reestablishing the rule of law in Poland, parliament speaker Szymon Holownia told reporters. The legislation notably calls for constitutional court judges to be chosen by a three-fifths majority vote — thus taking opposition votes into consideration — in contrast to the current absolute majority rule. Candidates would also be rejected if during the previous four years they had served as a lawmaker, senator, member of the European Parliament or government member or had been part of a political party. Holownia called on the president to sign the legislation into law and thereby 'repair' the judicial system leftover from the previous administration. He added that in case of a presidential veto, there would be no choice but to wait until a new head of state is elected next year. Since taking office in December, pro-EU Polish Prime Minister Donald Tusk's government has sought to reverse policies introduced by the previous administration that had been seen by Brussels as backsliding on democracy. In February, Brussels formally approved the release of EU funds — that had been blocked for several years under the PiS government — to Poland after Warsaw made progress on judicial reforms. In March, Polish Justice Minister Adam Bodnar announced a set of measures to 'redress the situation' at the constitutional court, which continues to oppose various legislative and governmental initiatives.	https://www.voanews.com/a/polish-mps-vote-to-reform-controversial-constitutional-court/7783243.html	2024-09-13T09:25:07-07:00	
Former Botswana president returns from self-imposed exile, appears in court	Gaborone, Botswana — Botswana’s former president, Ian Khama, has made a surprise return to the country after a nearly three-year self-imposed exile. Khama, who faces criminal charges, fled the southern African country in 2021, saying his life was in danger after a fallout with President Mokgweetsi Masisi. Khama appeared Friday in a Gaborone court, where his lawyers asked that a warrant of arrest against him be dropped. He faces 14 charges, which include illegal possession of firearms and money laundering. His lawyer, Unoda Mack, told reporters outside court that the warrant of arrest has been set aside. 'They wanted him, we brought him. The warrant has been set aside. He will appear in court, he will be coming. He brought himself,' Mack said. Khama, who leads a splinter opposition party, the Botswana Patriotic Front (BPF), has denied the criminal charges and says they are part of persecution by Masisi. Khama handpicked Masisi to succeed him in 2018. BPF Secretary General Lawrence Ookeditse said Khama, who led Botswana between 2008 and 2018, is back to fight the 'bogus' charges. 'He went to the magistrate court to try to get the bogus warrant of arrest that was brought on him quashed,' Ookeditse said. Khama’s return comes just weeks before Botswana holds its general election on October 30. Ookeditse said the former president will participate in campaigns for his party. 'We have been very consistent and General Khama has also been very consistent to the effect that we are going to cause an upset in these elections and he is going to be on the ground campaigning for the BPF, as we are going to do all we can to effect regime change in a democratic way in Botswana,' Ookeditse said. President Masisi has previously said Khama must return to face the law, and denied accusations of persecuting his predecessor. Khama will be back in court on September 23.	https://www.voanews.com/a/former-botswana-president-returns-from-self-imposed-exile-appears-in-court-/7783177.html	2024-09-13T08:52:02-07:00	
Apple faces challenges in Chinese market against Huawei's tri-fold phone	Taipei, Taiwan — The U.S.-China technology war is playing out in the smartphone market in China, where global rivals Apple and Huawei released new phones this week. Industry experts say Apple, which lacks home-field advantage, faces many challenges in defending its market share in the country. The biggest highlight of the iPhone 16 is its artificial intelligence system, dubbed Apple Intelligence, while the Huawei Mate XT features innovative tri-fold screen technology. But at a starting price of RMB 19,999, about $2,810, the Mate XT will cost about three times as much as the iPhone 16. According to data from VMall, Huawei's official shopping site, nearly 5.74 million people in China preordered the Mate XT as of late Thursday, 5½ days after Huawei began accepting preorders. But in a survey conducted on the Chinese microblogging site Weibo by Radio France International, half of the 9,200 respondents said they would not purchase a Mate XT because the price is prohibitive. An additional 3,500 said they are not in the market for a new phone now. 'I suggest that Huawei release some products that ordinary people can afford,' a Weibo user wrote under the name 'Diamond Man Yang Dong Feng.' The iPhone 16 is not available for preorder until Friday, but some e-commerce vendors in China have promised to deliver the new devices to consumers within half a day to two days of sale. In the competition between Apple and Huawei, iPhone 16 has some inherent disadvantages, said Shih-Fang Chiu, a senior industry analyst at the Taiwan Institute of Economic Research. 'Apple's strength is information security and privacy, but this is difficult to achieve in the Chinese market, where the government can control the data in China's market to a relatively high degree. In the era of AI mobile phones, this will bring challenges to Apple's development in the Chinese market,' Chiu said. Apple’s AI service on its iPhone 16 will roll out at a gradual pace in different languages, first in English and other languages later this year. The Chinese version will not be available until 2025. There are other challenges Apple faces as well, Chiu added, such as regulatory controls, consumer sentiment favoring local brands and weakening spending power amid China's economic slowdown. According to Counterpoint Research's statistics, Huawei held a market share of 15% in the second quarter of 2024, surpassing Apple's 14% market share. That compares with Apple’s 17.3% share in 2023 as reported by the industry research firm International Data Corporation China, or IDC China. Ryan Reith, the program vice president for IDC's Mobile Device Tracker suite, said in a written response to VOA that the iPhone 16 has not made significant hardware upgrades and that AI applications alone are not attractive because consumers have GPT and other AI solutions. AI applications are also another hurdle. Analyst Chih-Yen Tai said iPhone 16's AI services involve personal data collection, information application and cloud computing, which will require collaboration with Chinese service providers. That, along with the ban on Chinese civil servants and employees at state-owned enterprises from using their iPhone at work in recent years, will affect the sales of Apple products, said Tai, the deputy director of the Center for Science and Technology Policy Evaluation at Chung-Hua Institution for Economic Research in Taipei. 'China's patriotism has led to a strong number of preorders' for Huawei's tri-fold phones, Tai said. 'The competitors in China will sell the idea [to consumers] that iPhones will soon be edged out of the premium smartphone market. So, in the next stage, the affordable iPhone versions will be the key to whether it [Apple] can return to China or its previous glorious sales era,' Tai said. Tzu-Ang Chen, a senior consultant in the digital technology industry in Taipei, said use of Huawei's HarmonyOS operating system surpassed that of Apple's iOS in China in the first quarter of this year, representing China's determination to 'go its own way' and create 'one world, two systems.' 'The U.S.-China technology war has extended to smartphones,' Chen said. 'IPhone sales in China will get worse and worse, obviously because Huawei is doing better, and coupled with patriotism, Apple's position in the hearts of 1.4 billion people will never return.' He said that as China seeks to develop pro-China markets among member countries of the Belt and Road Initiative in Southeast Asia, the Middle East and Africa, China-made mobile phones may become their first choice.

Scenic California mountain town walloped by blizzard is now threatened by wildfire	RUNNING SPRINGS, California — In the Southern California mountain town of Running Springs, residents live between two scenic lake resorts — a seemingly serene spot but one also caught between the swings of devastating winter snowstorms and menacing summer wildfires. Niko Rynard is currently evacuated from his home due to the Line Fire, which has charred 58 square miles (150 square km) since the weekend. About a year and a half ago, the director of the Running Springs Area Chamber of Commerce raced down the mountains during a break in the relentless snowfall his neighbors came to call 'Snowmageddon.' Roads were blocked for days. The 29-year-old, who moved to the area nine years ago from the East Coast, is now staying with friends nearby but said others are shelling out hundreds of dollars to cram into hotel rooms until it's safe to return. The blaze is one of three major wildfires that have ravaged the mountains east of Los Angeles, destroying dozens of homes and forcing the evacuations of thousands of people. While California is only now confronting the height of wildfire season, the state already has seen nearly three times as much acreage burn than during all of 2023. Much of this, Rynard said, 'comes with the territory' and is part of living in a beautiful area. He said long-time residents have told him the massive wildfires are cyclical, much like the snow. To add to people's rattled nerves, Southern California was rocked by a 4.7-magnitude earthquake Thursday morning. Running Springs is dubbed the 'gateway to the San Bernardino Mountains' and perched more than a mile high. The town was among the communities snowed in when a blizzard walloped the area in 2023. Now, the community has been doused with bright fire-red retardant to protect it. 'It can be tough to live in these environments,' said Dawn Rowe, a San Bernardino County supervisor whose district covers mountain communities. 'It’s beautiful — a lot of people come to visit and they find they might want to relocate for one reason or another. I would encourage everybody to spend an amount of time doing their due diligence.' The Line Fire is burning through dense vegetation that grew after two back-to-back wet winters that included snowstorms that caused tree branches to break, leaving behind a lot of 'dead and down fuel,' said Cal Fire Operations Section Chief Jed Gaines. Another wildfire threatened the mountain community of Wrightwood about a 50-mile (80-kilometer) drive to the west. The fires have threatened tens of thousands of homes and other structures across Southern California since they escalated during a triple-digit heat wave over the weekend. Cooler weather was helping firefighters slowly gain the upper hand in battling the blazes. No deaths have been reported, but at least a dozen people, mainly firefighters, have been treated for injuries, mostly heat-related, authorities said. In one daring rescue caught on video, Cal Fire Riverside County Battalion Chief Mike Martinez saved a lone woman walking within feet of the Airport Fire in Orange County, driving his SUV up to the edge of the blistering flames so she could enter the vehicle. 'This is one of those moments ... you hope you never come across,' he told the Los Angeles Times. 'I’ve been doing this for almost 30 years. We’re used to extreme fire behavior but to see a civilian walking down the middle of the street was surreal.' Jason Anderson, district attorney for San Bernardino County, said Thursday that nine arson-related charges have been filed against a suspect accused of starting the Line Fire. 'This is particularly galling in a community that unfortunately over the last couple of years has dealt with the scourge of wildfires,' he told reporters, adding that the suspect’s vehicle has been linked to three areas where fires were started. The suspect is due to be arraigned in court on Friday. The full extent of the damage caused by the wildfires remains unclear. The three blazes are: — The Airport Fire in Orange County, which has burned more than 36 square miles (93 square kilometers). The fire was 5% contained Thursday morning and was reportedly sparked by workers using heavy equipment in the area. Ten firefighters and two residents were injured in the blaze, according to the Orange County Fire Authority. The fire has been difficult to tame because of the steep terrain and dry conditions — and because some areas hadn’t burned in decades. — The Line Fire in the San Bernardino National Forest, which was 18% contained Thursday and has threatened more than 65,000 homes. The blaze has injured three firefighters. — The Bridge Fire east of Los Angeles, which grew tenfold in a day and has burned 80 square miles (207 square km), torched at least 33 homes and six cabins, and forced the evacuation of 10,000 people. The cause of the fire is not yet known. It remained zero percent contained Thursday. In northern Nevada, the worst danger appears to have passed near Reno where a wildfire on the Sierra’s eastern front forced 20,000 evacuations over the weekend. The blaze closed all schools for four days and threatened to burn over the top of the mountains into the Lake Tahoe basin. Part of the state highway from Reno to Tahoe remained closed Thursday. Authorities further relaxed evacuation orders after 600 firefighters held fire lines despite winds gusting up to 70 mph (112 kph) the day before and bolstered containment of the 9-square-mile (23-square-kilometer) Davis Fire, now estimated at 37%. Most of the 8,000 residents that began the day under evacuation orders were downgraded to evacuation warnings, allowing them to begin to return to their homes. 'All containment lines ... are holding at this time,' Jason Clawson, an operations section chief for the federal firefighting team said at a briefing in Reno late Thursday. 'Absolutely no concerns. We have crews, equipment, engines all spread out around the entire fire.'	https://www.voanews.com/a/scenic-california-mountain-town-walloped-by-blizzard-is-now-threatened-by-wildfire-/7783041.html	2024-09-13T07:22:19-07:00

Analysts say Vietnam officials US trip could set path to C-130 deal	HO CHI MINH CITY — Analysts say this week’s visit to Washington by Vietnamese Defense Minister Phan Van Giang shows advances in cooperation between the two countries, despite rising Vietnamese nationalism that may indicate rising anti-American sentiment in Vietnam. A U.S.-based analyst told VOA on September 12 that Giang’s trip set the groundwork for Hanoi to potentially purchase military cargo planes from the United States this year. Giang met with U.S. Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin at the Pentagon on Monday. [September 9] Both leaders 'reaffirmed the importance of the U.S.-Vietnam partnership,' the Defense Department said in a statement, and noted the one-year anniversary of the elevation of the countries’ ties to a comprehensive strategic partnership, the highest tier in Hanoi's diplomatic hierarchy. The leaders also underscored the importance of working together to address the lasting impacts of the U.S.-Vietnam War. Austin announced that the U.S. would budget $65 million over the next five years to complete the decontamination of Bien Hoa airbase of dioxin, bringing the total from department to $215 million. The airbase was the primary storage site for the toxic chemical Agent Orange during the U.S.-Vietnam War and remains an environmental and public health hazard for those nearby. Andrew Wells-Dang, who leads the Vietnam War Legacies and Reconciliation Initiative at the United States Institute of Peace, told VOA by phone on September 5 that diplomatic visits are key to advancing war-remediation efforts, including finding and identifying the remains of missing soldiers. He said that along with the U.S. visit of Deputy Defense Minister Vo Minh Luong in July, visits from authorities provide 'opportunity for them to have high level support.' Zachary Abuza, a professor at the National War College in Washington and an expert on Southeast Asia, said joint war-reconciliation efforts also set the groundwork for defense cooperation more broadly. 'The United States is very pleased with the growth in bilateral defense relations, and it started from very low levels and was built on humanitarian missions,' Abuza said during the August 29 call. 'We've just continued to build on that,' he added. Cargo planes Reuters reported in July that Hanoi was considering purchasing Lockheed Martin C-130 cargo planes from the U.S., according to unnamed sources. The U.S.-based analyst, who asked that his name to be withheld because he has not been cleared to discuss the topic, said the C-130 deal was discussed but not finalized during Giang's visit. The analyst said the deal was held back by the 'massive [U.S.] bureaucracy' and because solidifying the purchase during the Washington visit would be 'too inflammatory for the Chinese.' Ian Storey, senior fellow at the ISEAS-Yusof Ishak Institute in Singapore, noted Vietnam's delicate diplomatic balancing act, illustrated by Giang's travel itinerary before the Washington trip. 'Vietnam aims to keep its relations with the major powers in balance,' he wrote in an email on August 30. 'As such, Vietnamese Defense Minister Phan Van Giang visited Russia and China in August.' Storey added that the purchase of C-130 planes would not pose a threat to China in its maritime territorial disputes with Vietnam. 'C-130 aircraft would enable the Vietnamese to transport troops and supplies to its occupied atolls in the South China Sea, but these assets are non-strategic and won't shift the dynamics in the South China Sea,' he wrote. Nguyen The Phuong, a maritime security expert at the University of New South Wales Canberra, said the C-130 purchase would be a 'symbolic move.' 'Vietnam will try to explore more areas of security and defense cooperation between Vietnam and the United States to upgrade to a higher, more meaningful level,' he told VOA on August 30. 'The C-130 would be the symbol of that kind of evolving relationship,' he said. Phuong said a C-130 is a likely entry point as there is still mistrust between the former foes regarding lethal weapons, and the deal would not rankle China too much. 'It could be quite advantageous for Vietnam,' he said of a potential C-130 purchase. 'Vietnam can improve its relationship with the United States, and at the same time, we could not anger China because Vietnam would just buy non-lethal weapons.' Rising nationalism Although there are positive signs to improving Hanoi-Washington relations, there have also been recent instances of anti-Western sentiment that could be an impediment to the countries relations, Phuong said. Fulbright University Vietnam, which has significant backing from the United States, is facing accusations of fomenting a 'color revolution,' similar to the popular uprisings in former Soviet republics. On August 21, Vietnam National Defense TV aired a critique of Fulbright for allegedly not displaying the Vietnamese flag at a graduation ceremony and facilitating a color revolution. The report has since been taken down, but Phuong said the Fulbright issue and other recent incidents show tension between Vietnam's conservative and liberal factions. 'It's a presentation of a continuous struggle between different factions, one conservative and one liberal,' Phuong said. Abuza said that Vietnamese authorities may be attempting to tighten control ahead of the anniversary of the end of the Vietnam War in 1975. 'Next April is the 50th anniversary of the fall of Saigon,' he said. 'The Vietnamese want to control that narrative 100%. There are a lot of sensitivities.' Along with the Fulbright incident, Phuong pointed to recent uproar around Vietnamese celebrities who were pictured with the South Vietnam flag while traveling to the United States. In addition, a Vietnamese high school student faced cyber bullying and was summoned by police after posting in September that he wanted to leave the country and would 'probably never see the [Communist] Party positively again.' 'There's extreme nationalism in Vietnam at the moment,' Phuong said. 'It's against Western values.'	https://www.voanews.com/a/ukraine-rushes-to-repair-damaged-energy-plants-in-time-for-winter-/7782903.html	2024-09-13T05:54:35-07:00

White House takes aim at Chinese fast fashion	Washington — The White House said on Thursday it is acting on Democratic lawmakers' demands to close what they see as a legal loophole that allows manufacturers — most from China — to dodge tariffs on low-priced goods and flood the U.S. with illegal and unsafe products. The Biden administration is targeting the 'de minimis' exemption, which allows parcels valued at less than $800 to enter the U.S. duty free. More than 1 billion such parcels entered the U.S. in fiscal 2023, U.S Customs and Border Protection said. White House officials attribute the more than fivefold increase from several years ago to the growth of Chinese e-commerce platforms such as Shein and Temu, and administration officials name-checked both of those popular fast-fashion retailers in a briefing with journalists on Thursday. Daleep Singh, deputy national security adviser for international economics, said these moves to close the loophole would have a big effect on Chinese apparel, and 'will drastically reduce the number of shipments entering through the de minimis exemption.' This would likely hamper Americans' ability to score items like an $8 T-shirt – available in a range of colors – that features a gunslinging, pants-wearing cartoon cowboy duck who proclaims, 'you just yee'd your last haw.' Or a $6 crop top that reads, in English, LIVE LAUGH LOBOTOMY. Or an $8 bra made of two fuzzy, dead-eyed cat faces shorn of their noses, mouths, whiskers and facial expressions, strung together and tied halter-style around the neck. Or an $8 item that can only be described as a business-formal bra, as it is made entirely of ties. It is available in a patchwork of leopard-, zebra- and tiger-print ties, presumably for a formal office that is animal themed. Singh added that the administration also seeks to tighten information collection requirements and consumer safety standards – and block products that don't make the cut. And further, he said, the White House is calling on Congress to pass a law this year to 'comprehensively reform the de minimis exemption.' In a Wednesday letter, 126 House Democrats urged the president to use his executive authority, saying they could not act 'amid interminable stagnation in Congress that has precluded legislation from passing.' 'While lawmakers would rather see the de minimis issue dealt with legislatively, the Democrats on the call said their patience was wearing thin,' the letter read. 'Despite the fact that the concept of de minimis reform has engendered broad bipartisan support, politicking has precluded a concrete resolution.' Congresswoman Rosa DeLauro of Connecticut, one of the initiative's leaders, expressed concerns over fast fashion's documented use of forced labor to make their cut-rate clothing. Rights group Amnesty International has reported that Shein, in particular, upholds 'questionable labor and human rights standards.' Shein's model, the group says, leans on subcontracting the making of garments, which leaves no room for transparency or accountability for worker conditions, and gives workers no right to unionize or assemble. Navtej Dhillon, deputy director of the National Economic Council, also said the moves address concerns over fentanyl shipments and for declining U.S. industry. 'Some foreign companies are attempting to use this pathway to ship illegal and dangerous products for our health, avoid our health and safety and consumer protection laws, and evade tariffs to undermine American manufacturers,' he said. 'Textile and apparel manufacturing supports tens of thousands of jobs in key states like Georgia and North Carolina. These American workers and manufacturers deserve to compete on a level playing field.' The congressional group pushing the administration cited approval from law enforcement and industry groups. 'The de minimis loophole is severely exacerbating our nation's opioid crisis,' said Bill Johnson, executive director of the National Association of Police Organizations. 'Closing it would help staunch the flow of fentanyl and other narcotics coming across our borders and help safeguard the lives of our children, families, and friends.' And Kim Glas, president and CEO of the National Council of Textile Organizations, said the industry group 'strongly supports closing the de minimis loophole,' noting the closure of 18 textile plants in the U.S. in the past year. 'De minimis is a free trade agreement for the world at the expense of U.S. manufacturers, retailers, and consumers,' she said in a statement. 'Shockingly, it has now become a black market for dangerous products facilitating fentanyl, precursors and pill presses. De minimis is destruction.' Shein said last year that they support 'responsible reform' of the policy but did not give precise recommendations. 'The de minimis exemption needs a complete makeover to create a level playing field for all retailers,' SHEIN Executive Vice Chairman Donald Tang said in a statement. 'At the same time, American consumers deserve to know that the products they purchase are authentic and ethically produced. We believe de minimis reform can and should achieve both.'	https://www.voanews.com/a/white-house-takes-aim-at-chinese-fast-fashion-/7782826.html	2024-09-13T04:24:44-07:00	
US and British leaders meet as Ukraine pushes to ease weapons restrictions	Washington — United States President Joe Biden and British Prime Minister Keir Starmer are meeting Friday amid an intensified push by Ukraine to loosen restrictions on using weapons provided by the U.S. and Britain to strike Russia. The talks come amid signs that the White House could be moving toward a shift in its policy, and as Russia's President Vladimir Putin warned that Ukraine's use of long-range weapons would put NATO at war with Moscow. Ukrainian officials renewed their pleas to use Western-provided long-range missiles against targets deeper inside Russia during this week's visit to Kyiv by U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken and U.K. Foreign Secretary David Lammy. Blinken said he had 'no doubt' that Biden and Starmer would discuss the matter during their visit, noting the U.S. has adapted and 'will adjust as necessary' as Russia's battlefield strategy has changed. The language is similar to what Blinken said in May, shortly before the U.S. allowed Ukraine to use American-provided weapons just inside Russian territory. The distance has been largely limited to cross-border targets deemed a direct threat out of concerns about further escalating the conflict. While the issue is expected to be at the top of the leaders' agenda, it appeared unlikely that Biden and Starmer would announce any policy changes during this week's visit, according to two U.S. officials familiar with planning for the leaders' talks who spoke on condition of anonymity because they weren't authorized to discuss the private deliberations. In addition to Blinken, Biden also has hinted a change could be afoot. In an exchange with reporters earlier this week about whether he was ready to ease weapons restrictions on Ukraine, he responded, 'We're working that out now.' Putin warned Thursday that allowing long-range strikes 'would mean that NATO countries, the United States, and European countries are at war with Russia. … If this is so, then, bearing in mind the change in the very essence of this conflict, we will make appropriate decisions based on the threats that will be created for us.' His remarks were in line with the narrative the Kremlin has actively promoted since early in the Ukraine war, accusing NATO countries of de-facto participation in the conflict and threatening a response. Earlier in the year, Putin warned that Russia could provide long-range weapons to others to strike Western targets in response to NATO allies allowing Ukraine to use their arms to attack Russian territory, saying it 'would mark their direct involvement in the war against the Russian Federation, and we reserve the right to act the same way.' Starmer, in response to the Russian leader's Thursday comments, said on his way to the U.S. that Britain does not seek any conflict with Russia. 'Russia started this conflict. Russia illegally invaded Ukraine. Russia could end this conflict straight away,' Starmer told reporters. 'Ukraine has the right to self-defense and we've obviously been absolutely fully supportive of Ukraine's right to self-defense — we're providing training capability, as you know.' 'But we don't seek any conflict with Russia — that's not our intention in the slightest,' Starmer said. Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy has pressed U.S. and allied military leaders to go much further. He argues that the U.S. must allow Ukraine to target Russian air bases and launch sites far from the border as Russia has stepped up assaults on Ukraine's electricity grid and utilities ahead of the coming winter. Zelenskyy also wants more long-range weaponry from the United States, including the Army Tactical Missile System, known as ATACMS, for strikes in Russia. ATACMS wouldn't be the answer to the main threat Ukraine faces from long-range Russian glide bombs, which are being fired from more than 300 kilometers (185 miles) away, beyond the ATACMS' reach, said Lt. Col. Charlie Dietz, Pentagon spokesperson. American officials also don't believe they have enough of the weapon systems available to provide Ukraine with the number to make a substantive difference to conditions on the ground, one of the U.S. officials said. During a meeting of allied defense ministers last week, Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin said he did not believe providing Ukraine with long-range weapon systems would be a game-changer in the grueling war. He noted that Ukraine has already been able to strike inside Russia with its own internally produced systems, including drones. 'I don't believe one capability is going to be decisive, and I stand by that comment,' Austin said. 'As of right now, the policy has not changed,' Maj. Gen. Pat Ryder, Pentagon press secretary, said Thursday. Starmer said he was visiting Washington for 'strategic meetings to discuss Ukraine and to discuss the Middle East.' It's the prime minister's second meeting with Biden since his center-left government was elected in July. It comes after Britain last week diverged from the U.S. by suspending some arms exports to Israel because of the risk they could be used to break international law. Both countries have downplayed their differences over the issue. Biden and Starmer's meeting also comes ahead of this month's annual meeting of global leaders at the United Nations General Assembly. The Oval Office meeting was scheduled in part to help the two leaders compare notes on the war in Ukraine, languishing efforts to get a cease-fire deal in Gaza and other issues ahead of the U.N. meeting. The White House also has sought in recent days to put a greater emphasis on the nexus between the war in Ukraine and conflict in the Middle East sparked after Iranian-backed Hamas militants in Gaza launched attacks on Israel on Oct. 7. The Biden administration said this week that Iran recently delivered short-range ballistic weapons to Russia to use against Ukraine, a transfer that White House officials worry will allow Russia to use more of its arsenal for targets far beyond the Ukrainian front line while employing Iranian warheads for closer-range targets. In turn, the U.S. administration says Russia has been tightening its relationship with Iran, including by providing it with nuclear and space technology. 'This is obviously deeply concerning,' White House national security spokesperson John Kirby said of the missile transfer. 'And it certainly speaks to the manner in which this partnership threatens European security and how it illustrates Iran's destabilizing influence now reaches well beyond the Middle East.'	https://www.voanews.com/a/us-and-british-leaders-meet-as-ukraine-pushes-to-ease-weapons-restrictions-/7782817.html	2024-09-13T03:56:55-07:00	
IS-claimed attack kills 14 Shiite Muslims in Afghanistan	Islamabad — Gunmen in central Afghanistan killed at least 14 Shiite Muslims in an overnight attack that was claimed by a local affiliate of the Islamic State group, multiple sources said Friday. The Interior Ministry spokesperson in Kabul, Abdul Matin Qani, told the local TOLO news channel that assailants targeted a group of civilians in the Afghan province of Daykundi on Thursday. He did not, however, immediately share any details about the number of casualties or the nature of the attack. The media outlet quoted area residents and sources as confirming that the violence had resulted in the deaths of at least 14 people and injuries to four others. The Islamic State group said through its Amaq news agency that 'soldiers' of its Afghan offshoot, the Islamic State Khorasan, also known as IS-K, were behind the shooting. It claimed that '15 Shiite [Muslims] were killed and six others wounded.' Daykundi residents said the victims had gathered to welcome pilgrims returning from the Shiite holy site of Karbala in Iraq. Richard Bennett, the United Nations special rapporteur on the Afghan human rights situation, denounced Thursday’s violence. 'Yesterday’s appalling ISKP-claimed killings of #Hazara from #Daykundi…. bears hallmarks of int'l crimes,' Bennett said Friday on social media platform X, formerly known as Twitter. 'I’m alarmed about the spate of ISKP-claimed attacks. Need for prevention, protection & [international] accountability #Afghanistan,' he wrote, using an acronym for IS-K. The Taliban regained control of Afghanistan three years ago and say their counterterrorism operations have since 'almost decimated' IS-K in the country. However, U.S. officials and recent United Nations reports dispute the claims, identifying IS-K as a growing terrorism threat to the region and beyond. Earlier this month, IS-K claimed a suicide bombing in the Afghan capital that killed six people. In May, the group took responsibility for an attack by gunmen in the central Bamiyan province that killed three Spanish tourists and their local translator. In March, IS-K claimed that it was behind an attack on a Moscow concert hall that killed 145 Russians. Taliban spokesperson Zabihullah Mujahid reiterated in a statement last week that 'concerns raised by Western countries and institutions regarding the presence and escalating threat' of IS-K in Afghanistan were 'unfounded and driven by propaganda.' Mujahid claimed that 'the entire Afghan territory remains firmly under the control of the Islamic Emirate, leaving no room for independent or external groups to operate.' The Taliban refer to their administration as the Islamic Emirate. No country has officially recognized the Taliban government in Kabul, mainly because of human rights concerns and extensive restrictions the Islamist Taliban have placed on women's access to education, work, and public life at large.	https://www.voanews.com/a/is-claimed-attack-kills-14-shiite-muslims-in-afghanistan/7782808.html	2024-09-13T03:48:05-07:00	
Boeing factory workers go on strike after rejecting contract offer	SEATTLE — Aircraft assembly workers walked off the job early Friday at Boeing factories near Seattle after union members voted overwhelmingly to go on strike and reject a tentative contract that would have increased wages by 25% over four years. The strike started at 12:01 a.m. PDT, less than three hours after the local branch of the International Association of Machinists and Aerospace Workers announced 94.6% of voting workers rejected the proposed contract and 96% approved the work stoppage, easily surpassing a two-thirds requirement. The labor action involves 33,000 Boeing machinists, most of them in Washington state, and is expected to shut down production of the company's best-selling airline planes. The strike will not affect commercial flights but represents another setback for the aerospace giant, whose reputation and finances have been battered by manufacturing problems and multiple federal investigations this year. The striking machinists assemble the 737 Max, Boeing's best-selling airliner, along with the 777, or 'triple-seven' jet, and the 767 cargo plane at factories in Renton and Everett, Washington. The walkout likely will not stop production of Boeing 787 Dreamliners, which are built by nonunion workers in South Carolina. The machinists make $75,608 per year on average, not counting overtime, and that would rise to $106,350 at the end of the four-year contract, according to Boeing. However, the deal fell short of the union's initial demand for pay raises of 40% over three years. The union also wanted to restore traditional pensions that were axed a decade ago but settled for an increase in Boeing contributions to employee's 401(k) retirement accounts. Outside the Renton factory, people stood with signs reading, 'Historic contract my ass' and 'Have you seen the damn housing prices?' Car horns honked and a boom box played songs such as Twisted Sister's We're Not Gonna Take It and Taylor Swift's Look What You Made Me Do. Boeing responded to the strike announcement by saying it was 'ready to get back to the table to reach a new agreement.' 'The message was clear that the tentative agreement we reached with IAM leadership was not acceptable to the members. We remain committed to resetting our relationship with our employees and the union,' the company said in a statement. Very little has gone right for Boeing this year, from a panel blowing out and leaving a gaping hole in one of its passenger jets in January to NASA leaving two astronauts in space rather sending them home on a problem-plagued Boeing spacecraft. As long as the strike lasts, it will deprive the company of much-needed cash it gets from delivering new planes to airlines. That will be another challenge for new Boeing CEO Kelly Ortberg, who six weeks ago was given the job of turning around a company that has lost more than $25 billion in the last six years and fallen behind European rival Airbus. Ortberg made a last-ditch effort to salvage a deal that had unanimous backing from the union's negotiators. He told machinists Wednesday that 'no one wins' in a walkout and a strike would put Boeing's recovery in jeopardy and raise more doubt about the company in the eyes of its airline customers. 'For Boeing, it is no secret that our business is in a difficult period, in part due to our own mistakes in the past,' he said. 'Working together, I know that we can get back on track, but a strike would put our shared recovery in jeopardy, further eroding trust with our customers and hurting our ability to determine our future together.' The head of the union local, IAM District 751 President Jon Holden, said Ortberg faced a difficult position because machinists were bitter about stagnant wages and concessions they have made since 2008 on pensions and health care to prevent the company from moving jobs elsewhere. 'This is about respect, this is about the past, and this is about fighting for our future,' Holden said in announcing the strike. The vote also was a rebuke to Holden and union negotiators, who recommended workers approve the contract offer. Holden, who had predicted workers would vote to strike, said the union would survey members to decide which issues they want to stress when negotiations resume.	https://www.voanews.com/a/boeing-factory-workers-go-on-strike-after-rejecting-contract-offer/7782758.html	2024-09-13T02:01:54-07:00	
European politicians say migration is out of control; numbers tell a different story	BARCELONA, Spain — Unauthorized migration to European Union countries dropped significantly overall in the first eight months of this year, even as political rhetoric and violence against migrants increased and far-right parties espousing anti-immigration policies made gains at the polls. There was, however, a spike in migrant arrivals to the Canary Islands, a Spanish archipelago close to the African coast that is increasingly used as an alternate stepping stone to continental Europe. Irregular migration dominated the European parliamentary elections in June and influenced recent state elections in eastern Germany, where a far-right party won for the first time since World War II. The German government this week announced it was expanding border controls around its territory following recent extremist attacks. What do the numbers show? Despite the heated debates, irregular crossings over the southern borders of the EU — the region that sees the most unauthorized migration — were down by 35% from January to August, according to the latest preliminary figures compiled by the United Nations’ International Organization for Migration. Nearly 115,000 migrants — less than 0.03% of the EU's population — have arrived without permission into the EU via Mediterranean and Atlantic routes so far this year, compared to 176,252 during the same period last year, the U.N. says. In contrast, more than a million people, most of them fleeing conflict in Syria, entered the EU in 2015. Data shared by the EU's border and coast guard agency Frontex shows a similar trend: Unauthorized crossings over the region's southern borders fell 39% overall this year compared to last year. 'The emergency is not numerical this year, nor was it last year,' Flavio di Giacomo, a spokesperson with the IOM office for the Mediterranean, told The Associated Press. Camille Le Coz, an associate director of the nonprofit Migration Policy Institute in Europe, said irregular migration is 'getting way too much attention compared to the scope of the issue and compared to other issues Europe should be tackling, such as climate change.' The most commonly used route for migrants is from North Africa, across the dangerous Central Mediterranean to Italy. Yet roughly 64% fewer migrants disembarked in Italy this year than during the same period in 2023, according to IOM and Frontex numbers. Experts say that's a result of the EU-supported crackdown in Tunisia and Libya, which comes at a price for migrants, many of whom are systematically rounded up and dumped in the desert. How long the downward trend will hold remains to be seen, however. Smugglers are always quick to adapt and find new routes around border controls. In the Eastern Mediterranean, the second-most-used route, smuggling networks are now using speedboats in increasingly aggressive ways to avoid controls and targeting islands farther away from the Turkish coast in the central Aegean, according to Greek authorities. The number of migrants arriving in Greece by sea and overland during the first eight months of the year rose by 57%, U.N. data shows. An alarming spike in the Atlantic Meanwhile, irregular migration from West Africa to the Canary Islands via the Atlantic, the third-most-used route, has more than doubled: More than 25,500 migrants — mostly from Mali, Senegal and other West African countries — had arrived in the islands as of August 31, the U.N. says. Countless other migrants have gone missing along the route, where rough winds and strong Atlantic currents work against them. Several migrant boats, carrying only the remains of Malian, Mauritanian and Senegalese citizens, have been found this year drifting as far away as the Caribbean and off Brazil. Precise numbers are hard to verify, but the Spanish migrant rights group Walking Borders has reported more than 4,000 dead or missing. The trend has Spanish authorities on alert for the fall, when conditions in the Atlantic are most favorable for the journey. The treacherousness of the route seems to have done little to dissuade would-be migrants, whose ranks have swelled to include people from Syria and Pakistan, according to rescuers. 'There are situations that need to be addressed, like the situation in the Canary Islands,' Le Coz acknowledged. A humanitarian crisis The adult migrants who successfully make it to the Canaries usually keep moving, headed for the promise of jobs and safety in mainland Spain or other European countries farther north. But that is not the case for thousands of unaccompanied minors. Under Spanish law, these young migrants must be taken under the wing of the local government, leading to overcrowded shelters and a political crisis. Earlier this year, island leaders fought unsuccessfully to have other regions of Spain share the responsibility. Spanish Prime Minister Pedro Sánchez recently traveled to three West African countries in an attempt to curb migration. In Senegal, he and President Bassirou Diomaye Faye signed agreements to promote temporary work opportunities in Spain for Senegalese nationals and vocational training in Senegal. They also agreed to step up police cooperation. No magic solutions Current anti-immigrant sentiments notwithstanding, Europe's aging population, declining birth rates and labor shortages have only increased the need for immigrant workers to sustain pensions and boost economic growth. And as long as migrants lack opportunities in their own countries, their exodus will continue. Add to this the growing instability and conflict in parts of Africa, the Middle East and Asia that have displaced millions. 'There is no magic deterrence,' Le Coz said. 'Migrants end up taking the toll of all of this: They are risking their lives, doing jobs in Europe where they face uncertain legal status for years and are vulnerable to all sorts of exploitation.' While long-term solutions to tackle unauthorized migration are being implemented, such as temporary work programs for migrants, they are still falling short. 'That's one step in the right direction, but this needs to happen at a much larger scale, and they need the private sector to be more involved,' Le Coz added.	https://www.voanews.com/a/european-politicians-say-migration-is-out-of-control-numbers-tell-a-different-story/7782754.html	2024-09-13T01:48:03-07:00

Rajapaksa clan heir runs for Sri Lanka president after family forced out of power	COLOMBO, Sri Lanka — When an uprising ousted Sri Lanka's president, many saw it as the end of his powerful family's hold on the island nation after more than 12 years of rule. Now, as Sri Lanka prepares to elect a new leader, Namal Rajapaksa is running for president. The 38-year-old is the son of former President Mahinda Rajapaksa and the nephew of the ousted President Gotabaya Rajapaksa. Namal Rajapaksa is presenting himself as an agent of change, but many see his bid for presidency as an attempt by the controversial political dynasty to regain power. By mid-2022, the clan's political career seemed in ruins. Some of its members were forced into hiding in military camps after angry protesters stormed their residences. Others simply gave up their seats in the government as people blamed them for hurtling the country of more than 20 million people into an economic crisis. Two years later, the family — shunned and pushed to political wilderness — is trying make a comeback via the Rajapaksa heir apparent who is styling himself as someone who could deliver Sri Lanka into a prosperous future. But for Namal Rajapaksa, it's more than just a political choice — it's a deeply personal one. He wants to shed the widespread allegations that the Rajapaksa clan ran the country as a family business that led to the economy crashing in 2022 — as well as the guilty verdict on corruption charges against them. 'The corruption charges are not something common to my family or to myself. If you look at all politicians in this country or in the world, including our region … all have been accused of being corrupt,' Namal told the Associated Press on a recent afternoon. 'People will understand, you know, because if you look at the current stage, everyone is blaming each other.' Sri Lanka was once an economic hope in South Asia, before it plunged into an economic crisis in 2022 when unsustainable debt and the COVID-19 pandemic led to a severe shortage of essentials. The crisis morphed into a popular uprising, with angry street protesters taking over the president's and prime minister's offices and other key buildings, forcing Gotabaya to flee the country and later resign. Many blamed the Rajapaksas. The family still had a big parliamentary majority, and voted Ranil Wickremesinghe to serve the remainder of the presidential term. Wickremesinghe ensured them protection in return for their support to pass laws in Parliament, enabling the clan to mark a return in politics. 'We didn't run away, we never ran away. It's just that some people thought we were hiding,' said Namal. Namal's prospects for a political comeback appear grim, as the main contest appears to be between three other candidates: Wickremesinghe, the parliamentary opposition leader and a left-leaning politician with a powerful alliance. Alan Keenan, senior consultant on Sri Lanka at the International Crisis Group, said the younger Rajapaksa's bid for the presidency is a test run that would establish 'his position as the heir apparent' of the political dynasty. 'I think they [the Rajapaksas] know that Namal will not win. But his candidature effectively reasserts the family's ownership of the party,' Keenan said. The Rajapaksa family has been a mainstay in Sri Lankan politics for decades. They influenced nearly everything — from bureaucracy to courts, police, business and sports. Namal Rajapaksa's father was a prime minister and then a two-term president from 2005 to 2015. Even though Mahinda Rajapaksa was adored by the country's majority Buddhist Sinhalese for defeating the ethnic Tamil separatists after a 26-year bloody civil war, allegations of human rights violations and corruption led to his defeat in 2015. The family, however, returned more powerful four years later, when Mahinda's brother was elected president. Gotabaya Rajapaksa whipped up majority Buddhist Sinhalese sentiments after the 2019 Easter Sunday bombings, blamed on Islamic extremist groups, killed 290 people. But the family's popularity quickly eroded under a tanking economy and alienation among ethnic Tamils, Muslims and other minorities. With hopes to reinvent himself as a young, modern leader removed from his family's tainted past, Namal Rajapaksa's efforts mirror that of his father, who still enjoys considerable support among some voters who credit him for crushing the Tamil separatists. Like his father, Namal Rajapaksa wears the trademark outfit that highlights his Buddhist Sinhalese culture, with a maroon scarf around his neck, a sarong and a white robe. During campaigns he can be seen touching his father's feet in reverence, a practice most locals consider noble. He is also promising to free the island nation from its debt crisis, create more jobs and eradicate corruption by digitizing the administrative systems. Still, many in Sri Lanka are done with the family, and public opposition to Rajapaksa's candidacy is particularly palpable among the Tamil community that makes up about 11% of Sri Lanka's population. The group was crushed in a 2009 government offensive headed by Mahinda and Gotabaya Rajapaksa to end the separatist civil war that broke out in 1983 and left at least 100,000 on both sides, with many more missing. Though not all Tamils were part of or supported the rebel group, their defeat has effectively become a political defeat to the community. They also blame the Rajapaksas for alleged human rights violations against civilians during the war. Vellaiyan Sivaprakash, a Tamil who works as an auditor in central Sri Lanka, said he constantly lived in fear of violence during the Rajapaksa rule and doubted whether he could live in Sri Lanka anymore. 'Their rule was like a monarchy and they behaved like princes and treated us like slaves,' Sivaprakash said. 'They should never come back to power.' Rajapaksas still have a large chunk of supporters who appreciate their role in ending the war and in big infrastructure projects including a road network, an airport and a seaport built on high-interest Chinese loans. Even though many of them believe Namal Rajapaksa has no chance of winning, they are banking on his future prospects. 'I will vote for Namal because I got my job under his father's government. He is still young and one day he can be the president,' said R. M. Lasantha, who works as a pipe fitter at the state-owned petroleum corporation. Some Sri Lankans say it would take the Rajapaksas at least a decade to make a political comeback. 'Their name is associated with corruption and bankruptcy, so rebuilding [their image] is a major challenge,' said Manilal Ranasinghe, who works in the tourism industry. 'At the same time,' Ranasinghe said, 'we know that Sri Lankans have a short memory.'	https://www.voanews.com/a/rajapaksa-clan-heir-runs-for-sri-lanka-president-after-family-forced-out-of-power-/7782716.html	2024-09-12T23:33:26-07:00	
North Korea’s Kim tours uranium enrichment site, calls for more weapons	SEOUL, South Korea — North Korea offered a rare glimpse into a secretive facility to produce weapons-grade uranium as state media reported Friday that leader Kim Jong Un visited the area and called for stronger efforts to 'exponentially' increase the number of his nuclear weapons. It's unclear if the site is at the North's main Yongbyon nuclear complex, but it's the North's first disclosure of a uranium-enrichment facility since it showed one at Yongbyon to visiting American scholars in 2010. While the latest unveiling is likely an attempt to apply more pressure on the U.S. and its allies, the images North Korea's media released of the area could provide outsiders with a valuable source of information for estimating the amount of nuclear ingredients that North Korea has produced. During a visit to the Nuclear Weapons Institute and the production base of weapon-grade nuclear materials, Kim expressed 'great satisfaction repeatedly over the wonderful technical force of the nuclear power field' held by North Korea, the official Korean Central News Agency reported. KCNA said that Kim walked around the control room of the uranium enrichment base and a construction site that would expand its capacity for producing nuclear weapons. North Korean state media photos showed Kim being briefed by scientists while walking along long lines of tall gray tubes, but KCNA didn't say when Kim visited the facilities and where they are located. KCNA said Kim stressed the need to further augment the number of centrifuges to 'exponentially increase the nuclear weapons for self-defense,' a goal he has repeatedly stated in recent years. It said Kim ordered officials to push forward the introduction of a new-type centrifuge, which has reached its completion stage. Kim said North Korea needs greater defense and preemptive attack capabilities because anti-North Korea 'nuclear threats perpetrated by the U.S. imperialists-led vassal forces have become more undisguised and crossed the red-line,' KCNA said. South Korea's Unification Ministry said it strongly condemned North Korea's unveiling of a uranium-enrichment facility and Kim's vows to boost his country's nuclear capability. A ministry statement said North Korea's 'illegal' pursuit of nuclear weapons in defiance of U.N. bans is a serious threat to international peace. It said North Korea must realize it cannot win anything with its nuclear program. North Korea first showed a uranium enrichment site in Yongbyon to the outside world in November 2010, when it allowed a visiting delegation of Stanford University scholars led by nuclear physicist, Siegfried Hecker, to tour its centrifuges. North Korean officials then reportedly told Hecker that 2,000 centrifuges were already installed and running at Yongbyon. Satellite images in recent years have indicated North Korea was expanding a uranium enrichment plant at its Yongbyon nuclear complex. Nuclear weapons can be built using either highly enriched uranium or plutonium, and North Korea has facilities to produce both at Yongbyon. It's not clear exactly how much weapons-grade plutonium or highly enriched uranium has been produced at Yongbyon and where North Korea stores it. 'For analysts outside the country, the released images will provide a valuable source of information for rectifying our assumptions about how much material North Korea may have amassed to date,' said Ankit Panda, an expert with the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace. 'Overall, we should not assume that North Korea will be as constrained as it once was by fissile material limitations. This is especially true for highly enriched uranium, where North Korea is significantly less constrained in its ability to scale up than it is with plutonium,' Panda said. In 2018, Hecker and Stanford University scholars estimated North Korea's highly enriched uranium inventory was 250 to 500 kilograms, sufficient for 25 to 30 nuclear devices. The North Korean photos released Friday showed about 1,000 centrifuges. When operated year-round, they would be able to produce around 20 to 25 kilograms of highly enriched uranium, which would be enough to create a single bomb, according to Yang Uk, a security expert at Seoul's Asan Institute for Policy Studies. The new-type centrifuge Kim wants to introduce is likely an advanced carbon fiber-based one that could allow North Korea to produce five to 10 times more highly enriched uranium than its existing ones, said Lee Choon Geun, an honorary research fellow at South Korea's Science and Technology Policy Institute. Some U.S. and South Korean experts speculate North Korea is covertly running at least one other uranium-enrichment plant. In 2018, a top South Korean official told parliament that North Korea was estimated to have already manufactured up to 60 nuclear weapons. Estimates on how many nuclear bombs North Korea can add every year vary, ranging from six to as many as 18.	https://www.voanews.com/a/north-korea-s-kim-tours-uranium-enrichment-site-calls-for-more-weapons/7782705.html	2024-09-12T22:24:02-07:00	
Pope wraps up Asia-Pacific tour, defies health fears along the way	Singapore — Pope Francis wrapped up an arduous 12-day tour of the Asia-Pacific on Friday, defying health concerns to connect with believers from the jungle of Papua New Guinea to the skyscrapers of Singapore. The 87-year-old pontiff flies home to Rome from Singapore, completing his longest trip in duration and distance since he became head of the world's estimated 1.4 billion Roman Catholics more than 13 years ago. The Argentine pope has relied on a wheelchair since 2022 because of knee pain and sciatica. He had a hernia operation in June 2023, and earlier this year he battled flu and bronchitis. Occasionally, during his four-nation trip, the pope struggled to keep his eyes open when listening to late-night liturgical readings or to remain engaged during formal military parades. But he was clearly energized by more freewheeling exchanges — cheerfully goading young people to shout out their agreement with his calls to help those in need. In a lively final inter-religious meeting with young Singaporeans, the pope urged them to respect other beliefs, avoid being slaves to technology and to get out of their comfort zones. 'Don't let your stomach get fat, but let your head get fat,' the pope said, raising a laugh from his audience. 'I say take risks, go out there,' he said. 'A young person that is afraid and does not take risks is an old person.' The historic tour, initially planned for 2020 but postponed by the COVID-19 pandemic, has included 43 hours of flight time and a distance of 32,000 kilometers. But neither the pace — 16 speeches and up to eight hours of time difference — nor the heat, nor multiple meetings have forced any rescheduling of his international odyssey. On a trip that took him to the outer edges of the church's world, the pope delivered a sometimes uncomfortable message for leaders not to forget the poor and marginalized. In Indonesia, the world's most populous Muslim-majority state, he visited the Istiqlal Mosque to deliver a joint message against conflict and climate change. In sweltering Papua New Guinea, he donned a bird of paradise headdress in a remote, jungle village where he told inhabitants to halt violence and renounce 'superstition and magic.' Addressing political and business leaders, he insisted that the country's vast natural resources should benefit the entire community — a demand likely to resound in a nation where many believe their riches are being stolen or squandered. And in staunchly Roman Catholic East Timor, he addressed nearly half the population, drawing about 600,000 rapturous believers in the tropical heat to a celebration of mass on the island's coast. Francis addressed East Timor's leaders, hailing a new era of 'peace' since independence in 2002. But he also called on them to do more to prevent abuse against young people, in a nod to recent Catholic Church child abuse scandals. In the affluent city-state of Singapore, the pope called for 'special attention' to be paid to protecting the dignity of migrant workers. 'These workers contribute a great deal to society and should be guaranteed a fair wage,' he said. There are an estimated 170 million migrant workers around the world. Most live in the Americas, Europe or Central Asia. But the Argentine pope was otherwise full of praise for the 'entrepreneurial spirit' and dynamism that built a 'mass of ultra-modern skyscrapers that seem to rise from the sea' in his final destination. Sandra Ross, 55, a church administrator in Singapore, said she was still 'feeling the warmth and joy' after attending mass led by the pope. 'I was deeply touched by Pope Francis' courage and dedication to his mission, despite his health challenges. His spirit and enthusiasm are truly inspiring,' she said.	https://www.voanews.com/a/pope-wraps-up-asia-pacific-tour-defies-health-fears-along-the-way/7782694.html	2024-09-12T21:35:31-07:00	
US presidential debate resonates across South Asia amid regional news	washington — This week’s U.S. televised debate between former President Donald Trump and Vice President Kamala Harris broke through an intensely busy news cycle in South Asia to garner attention across most major news outlets. Indian opposition leader Rahul Gandhi visited the United States. Bangladesh's interim leader, Muhammad Yunus, delivered his second major speech to the nation. And Pakistan suspended security officials over the controversial arrest of lawmakers from Parliament. Despite these significant developments and a nine- to 10-hour time difference from Washington, the pivotal showdown between the two contenders to succeed Joe Biden as U.S. president still drew high interest, underscoring the significance of U.S. electoral politics for the region. 'The news cycle in these countries is so fast and the issues they are dealing with internally are so intense that probably their focus has shifted from what is happening elsewhere,' said Awais Saleem, a former Pakistani journalist who is now a professor at Lamar University in the U.S. state of Texas. 'Nonetheless, [the U.S. election] is still keenly observed and keenly watched, because whatever happens in the U.S. invariably has an effect in other parts of the world, and South Asia is no exception,' Saleem said. India Take India, the region's most populous country and largest media market. Major Indian outlets, such as NDTV and CNN's local affiliate, dedicated significant coverage to the debate, even while prioritizing Gandhi's remarks in Washington. Aaj Tak, another leading channel, had a correspondent reporting on the debate from the spin room in Philadelphia. Large-circulation newspapers provided more substantial coverage, even while relying on international wire services for content. The Times of India, India's largest newspaper, featured a video analysis of the debate on its website. The Hindu, another major paper, ran multiple articles, including one focusing on Trump's pledge to end the Ukraine war and another on Hollywood's 'applause' for Harris. While much of the coverage was routine, some stood out. In addition to broadcasting the debate live, NDTV produced at least 10 stories and segments dedicated to what it termed a 'fiery presidential showdown.' These included highlights, key quotes and major takeaways. While Indians are as divided over Trump and Harris as Americans, most local outlets widely reported on the American media's verdict that Harris had outperformed Trump. Ahead of the debate, many Indians were skeptical of Harris, said Ashutosh, a veteran Indian journalist and co-founder of news outlet Satya Hindi. To find out how Harris did, Satya Hindi devoted a 30-minute segment featuring a U.S.-based Indian American academic, Ashutosh said. The verdict: Harris won the debate. 'There now is a feeling that Kamala Harris is not a weak candidate,' said Ashutosh, who goes by one name. India, like other South Asian countries, lacks an American-style tradition of live election debates. The concept intrigues many but faces cultural and political obstacles, experts say. On Satya Hindi, another guest, journalist Shravan Garg, questioned their feasibility. He asked whether Indian TV channels would 'dare' to host live debates and whether politicians would 'agree' to participate. Atul Singh, founder and editor-in-chief of Fair Observer, an international citizen journalism and civic education platform, said Indian interest in U.S. elections has surged in recent years, spurred by globalization and more recently by the Indian ancestry of Harris and Usha Vance, the wife of Republican vice presidential nominee JD Vance. But he said the level of interest varies across the country. States with stronger ties to the U.S., such as Gujarat, a source of migration to the U.S., and Maharashtra, a manufacturing hub for exports to the U.S., are gripped by U.S. election fever. In more rural regions such as Bihar, with fewer connections to the U.S., enthusiasm is far more subdued. 'So it depends on which part of the country you're in,' Singh said. 'I'd say some areas in India simply don't care, and others, the ones that are part of the global economy, are absolutely obsessed.' Pakistan In neighboring Pakistan and Bangladesh, the debate received far less coverage despite comparable public interest. Geo TV, Pakistan's leading TV news channel, ran an international segment on the debate, reporting on the candidates' 'combative demeanor.' A wire story on its website noted that foreign policy 'largely took a backseat.' Leading English language newspaper Dawn highlighted the debate as its top international story, reporting how Harris put Trump 'on the defensive at a combative presidential debate.' A wire fact check about the debate was included among its 'must read stories' on its homepage. Express Tribune, another leading newspaper, picked up multiple wire service stories about the debate, posting three short video compilations on its websites, including a video of viral memes generated by Trump's comment that migrants were eating people's cats and dogs in Ohio. Atif Khan, a Pakistani journalist, said Harris' unexpected emergence as the Democratic nominee helped boost Pakistani public interest in the U.S. presidential election. 'Every political discussion on television now involves a mention of the U.S. election,' Khan said. 'There is talk about Trump. There is talk about Kamala Harris.' While Pakistani media generally don't cover elections in neighboring countries, some local outlets are already planning their U.S. election coverage and trying to secure U.S. visas for their reporters, he said. 'Pakistanis think that a change of president will inevitably have direct implications for not just Pakistan but also the region,' he said. Underscoring the Pakistani media's interest, Saleem, the Lamar University professor, noted receiving weekly invitations from various outlets to discuss the U.S. election campaign. Bangladesh In Bangladesh, the debate's coverage was overshadowed by continuing reverberations from the August 5 collapse of Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina's government. While interim leader Yunus' speech dominated headlines on Wednesday, leading outlets provided more substantive coverage of the debate, drawing on international wire stories and analysis. Prothom Alo, Bangladesh's largest media outlet, called the debate 'the most important moment' before the November 5 election. Daily Star, one of the most reputable outlets, ran at least four stories, including a fact check and a video analysis. Daily Ittefaq, a Bengali language newspaper, ran a summary of U.S. media accounts of the debate, reporting that even the conservative Fox News had declared Harris the winner. Singh, founder of Fair Observer, said the post-Hasina political turmoil in Bangladesh likely contributed to the relatively thin coverage. 'They've got their own fish to fry,' he said. But, he added, political elites in Bangladesh, Pakistan and Sri Lanka – all dependent on International Monetary Fund largesse – are keenly watching the U.S. election campaign. 'They are in economic crisis, so they follow the election for practical reasons,' he said.	https://www.voanews.com/a/us-presidential-debate-resonates-across-south-asia-amid-regional-news-/7782630.html	2024-09-12T18:52:18-07:00

Pakistan police officer kills blasphemy suspect in custody	quetta/islamabad — A police officer in Pakistan’s southwestern Baluchistan province shot and killed a man Thursday who was being held in custody on blasphemy allegations. The fatal shooting happened inside a highly protected police station in the provincial capital of Quetta, a day after the victim, a Muslim, was arrested for allegedly making derogatory remarks about the Prophet Muhammad. A senior local police officer, Muhammad Baloch, told reporters that they had arrested the policeman involved in the shooting and registered a murder case against him. He did not name the detainee. On Wednesday, witnesses reported that when the blasphemy suspect, Abdul Ali, was taken into custody in the Kharotabad neighborhood, a mob of dozens of residents quickly surrounded the police detention facility and demanded that he be handed over to them so they could kill him. Police officials reported the protesters also had thrown a grenade at the building, but the resulting blast did not cause any casualties. They said the violence forced them to transfer Ali to the police station in the central garrison area of Quetta, where he was fatally shot 'inside the lock-up by an on-duty policeman' on Thursday. Activists of a religious party later prevented Ali’s family from burying him in his hometown of Pishin, about 50 kilometers from Quetta, forcing those attempting to carry out the burial to flee the graveyard along with the body. In Islamabad, the national capital, an Islamic party senator, Abdul Shakoor Khan, while speaking in the upper house of parliament expressed solidarity with the alleged killer. Khan vowed to help get him a lawyer for his legal battle. 'We will not tolerate anyone issuing blasphemous remarks against the Holy Prophet,' Khan said. Blasphemy is a highly sensitive issue in majority-Muslim Pakistan, where mere allegations have led to mobs lynching scores of suspects, even some in police custody. Insulting the Quran or Islamic beliefs is punishable by death under the country's blasphemy laws, though no one has ever been officially executed. Thursday’s killing of a blasphemy suspect in custody by a police officer, however, is the first of its kind in Pakistan. In early June, a 73-year-old Pakistani man from the minority Christian community died in a hospital a week after being violently attacked by a mob following blasphemy accusations in his native Sargodha district in central Punjab province. Days later, on June 20, a Muslim man from Punjab was visiting the scenic Swat Valley in the northwestern Pakistani province of Khyber Pakhtunkhwa when a mob violently lynched him for allegedly desecrating Islam's holy book, the Quran. Domestic and international rights groups have long sought reforms in the blasphemy laws, arguing they are often misused to settle personal vendettas or to target Pakistani minority communities. Hundreds of suspects, mostly Muslims, are languishing in jails in Pakistan because of fear of retaliation from religious groups deters judges from moving their trials forward.	https://www.voanews.com/a/pakistan-police-officer-kills-blasphemy-suspect-in-custody-/7782586.html	2024-09-12T17:04:49-07:00

Nine charged in police breakup of pro-Palestinian camp at US university	ann arbor, michigan — Authorities have filed charges against nine people who are accused of trespassing or resisting police during the May breakup of a pro-Palestinian camp at the University of Michigan. 'The First Amendment does not provide a cover for illegal activity,' Attorney General Dana Nessel said Thursday, a day after charges were filed in Washtenaw County. The camp on the Diag, known for decades as a site for campus protests, was cleared by police on May 21 after a month. Video posted online showed police using what appeared to be an irritant to spray people, who were forced to retreat. The university said the camp had become a threat to safety, with overloaded power sources and open flames. Nessel said two people were charged with trespassing, a misdemeanor, and seven more people were charged with trespassing as well as resisting police, a felony. Protesters have demanded that the school's endowment stop investing in companies with ties to Israel. But the university insists it has no direct investments and less than $15 million placed with funds that might include companies in Israel. That's less than 0.1% of the total endowment. U.S. Representative Rashida Tlaib, a Detroit Democrat who supports the protesters, said the charges were 'frivolous' and a 'shameful attack' on the rights of students. Separately, Nessel said state prosecutors charged two people for alleged acts during a counterdemonstration on April 25, a few days after the camp was created. Nessel said authorities still were investigating spring protests at the homes of elected members of the university's governing board.	https://www.voanews.com/a/nine-charged-in-police-breakup-of-pro-palestinian-camp-at-us-university/7782191.html	2024-09-12T16:11:53-07:00	
Zimbabwe proposes culling elephants to address food shortages, reduce effects of drought	Harare, Zimbabwe — Zimbabwe's government said Thursday it is considering a proposal to cull its elephant population to address food shortages and reduce the effects of an El Nino-induced drought. 'Zimbabwe has more elephants than our forests can accommodate,' said Sithembiso Nyoni, Zimbabwe's minister of environment, climate, and wildlife. 'We are having a discussion with ZimParks [Zimbabwe Parks and Wildlife Authority] and some communities to do like what Namibia has done, so that we can cull the elephants and mobilize the women to maybe dry the meat, package it, and ensure that it gets to some communities that need the protein.' Zimbabwe is one the five countries in southern Africa that the World Food Programme said has been hit hard by El Nino drought, leaving millions of people food-insecure. The proposal to cull elephants in Zimbabwe follows Namibia's recently announced plans to cull 723 wild animals — including 83 elephants — to mitigate the effects of the drought and distribute the meat to communities facing food shortages. Much as Namibia's decision attracted condemnation from conservationists, Zimbabwe's proposal to cull elephants will paint the country in a bad light, said Farai Maguwu of the Center for Natural Resource Governance. 'Elephants are protected by international conventions, such as CITES [the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species]. They are in a world heritage,' said Maguwu. 'So, one does not just decide to say, 'I want to slaughter them.' They are not like goats, which a person can just say, 'I want to slaughter a goat and feed my family.' There are rules and procedures.' Maguwu said officials in Harare have long fought to change those rules. 'Zimbabwe has always been pushing for the right to kill elephants,' said Maguwu. 'We all know when you look at how our natural resources are being plundered right now, like minerals, the whole idea is to sell ivory. It's not even about the communities there.' Maguwu also said that 'there is a lot that government can do to cushion the people from the impacts of drought rather than killing elephants. I think they should stop that move.' Zimbabwe said it has about 100,000 elephants against its carrying capacity of about 45,000 and has not been able to sell some of the jumbos because of CITES. Minister Nyoni said Zimbabwe's culling would fall within the confines of the country's law. 'If Zimbabwe had a way, we would sell our elephants for ivory yesterday,' said Nyoni. 'The people who prevent us from selling our ivory are people who have already finished and killed off their own animals. They don't have elephants. And they don't have the experience of this human wildlife conflict that we are facing. And those are people who influence the decision of CITES. So, it is a problem that Zimbabwe is facing. … There is a thinking that we move out of CITES and then do our own thing. There are consequences for doing that. Zimbabwe would like to be independent; we would like to take charge of our own animals. But we can't because we are part of the global village.' Nyoni added that Zimbabwe would continue to negotiate with other CITES members so that Harare is allowed to trade in ivory and elephants by CITES. Efforts to reach CITES for comment did not yield results Thursday.	https://www.voanews.com/a/drought-hit-zimbabwe-plans-to-cull-elephants-amid-backlash/7782058.html	2024-09-12T14:28:53-07:00	
VOA interview: Chairman speaks on Republicans' Afghan withdrawal report	WASHINGTON — U.S. House of Representatives Foreign Affairs Committee Chairman Michael McCaul’s office recently released detailed findings of an investigation into the chaotic August 2021 U.S. withdrawal from Afghanistan, which has been criticized for poor planning. Speaking with Saba Shah Khan of VOA’s Urdu Service, McCaul, a Republican from Texas, denied that the latest probe is a 'political exercise' that coincides with a tight presidential race. He said its purpose is to ensure that 'an evacuation will never happen like this again.' On Tuesday, the committee's ranking Democrat, Representative Gregory Meeks from New York, issued a statement criticizing the report as a collection of 'cherry-picked witness testimony' that excludes 'anything unhelpful to a predetermined, partisan narrative about the Afghanistan withdrawal.' 'The Majority did not involve the Minority in this report, nor have they even provided a draft copy to us,' he wrote. In the following interview, McCaul accuses White House officials of 'stonewalling' the investigation and mentions his September 3 decision to subpoena Secretary of State Antony Blinken for testimony even though findings of the full report were released Monday. 'We’re still not finished with the investigation,' McCaul told VOA on Tuesday. State Department spokesperson Matthew Miller last week issued a statement to The Hill stating that Blinken was unable to testify on the dates requested and offered 'reasonable alternatives' to comply with McCaul's request. The following has been edited for length and clarity. VOA: Why is the Foreign Affairs Committee report on U.S. withdrawal from Afghanistan being released now? With less than two months left to Election Day, some would say the report is politically driven. U.S. Representative Michael McCaul: It's been three years since the ... chaotic evacuation. The first year, the majority — at that time, the Democrats — did nothing to investigate. So, I've had two years to put this very comprehensive, complete, historic account of what happened together. In the meantime, we served many subpoenas. We've had to threaten contempt proceedings. And I would have liked to have had this done a year ago. The administration has been, you know, stonewalling us and slowing down the delivery of the report. In fact, we're still not finished with the investigation. VOA: In light of the report, what do you think the Biden administration could have done differently to avoid the chaos and mayhem that unfolded during the withdrawal? McCaul: That’s one of the key takeaways here. The military is on the ground doing their job. That's to pull out by July [as dictated by a predetermined date of withdrawal negotiated by the prior administration]. The intelligence community sees what's happening. They report this information. It gets a little bit manipulated when it gets to the higher level. And then it is amplified that everything's fine in Afghanistan, when, in fact, on the ground, the conditions are getting very bad. The State Department is required by law to come out with an evacuation plan called the NEO [Noncombatant Evacuation Operations]. They kept resisting this because they thought evacuation means failure. So, they wait until the very day that the Taliban is overrunning Kabul before they finally initiate an evacuation plan. That is why it was so chaotic. That is why the 13 servicemen and women were left behind — with Taliban, by the way — to work with them to help Afghans get out. VOA: The report says that [President Joe] Biden kept Zalmay Khalilzad on as special representative [for Afghanistan reconciliation from September 2018 to October 2021], making it clear Biden embraced the [February 2020] Doha Accord. Sir, was that a good decision? McCaul: The complaint I had — and Zal and I, you know, I've known him for a long time, and I have respect for him — but he did not include the Afghan government in the Doha talks. So, it was just between Zal Khalilzad and the Taliban. That sent a terrible message to the Afghan government. They felt like they were sidelined. ... The Doha Agreement had conditions. Most important is the Taliban cannot hit U.S. forces. They were continuing to do that. But according to President Biden's press guy [former State Department spokesperson Ned Price], Doha was 'immaterial' as to the evacuation. He was going to go to zero — that means zero troops, zero contractors, zero air power — one way or the other. That was going to happen. He made that decision on day one. VOA: The [Doha] negotiations and the decision to leave Afghanistan was made during the Trump administration. Chairman, do you think.... McCaul: ... that isn’t accurate, because the Taliban were in violation of the Doha conditions. Twenty-five hundred troops were left on the ground — General [Kenneth] McKenzie and [Mark] Milly said that was sufficient to stabilize, along with 6,500 NATO and air power and contractors. That they could stabilize both Bagram and HKIA [Hamid Karzai International Airport] when it went to zero. That's when it changed. VOA: The date of withdrawal was decided by the Trump administration… McCaul: ... if conditions were met, which they weren't ... VOA: ... do you think that it is fair to hold the Biden administration solely responsible for the failure? McCaul: And we don't. We actually fault Zal Khalilzad. We list a lot of top D.O.D. [Department of Defense] and State Department officials that Congress, in a resolution, will condemn for their actions. Zal Khalilzad, he's a dear friend, but by not letting the Afghan government participate — to me, that was a major error. And a lot of this, by not executing a plan of action to get out and evacuate, according to the top generals and the intelligence community, was the fatal flaw, leaving behind Americans, Afghan allies, and most importantly, the women. VOA: The report also says that the U.S. did not keep track of whether the Taliban were following the Doha Agreement. In your opinion, how could the U.S. have made Taliban comply? McCaul: In my opinion, they were in violation at the time the president made the decision to go to zero. But according to his press spokesperson, that was immaterial to the withdrawal. It was going to happen one way or the other. What people don't understand is it's not just the military being pulled out, it's the air cover, it's the contractors. When everything is pulled out, the Afghan army was virtually defenseless. VOA: It is also said in the report that Afghanistan is a hotbed of terrorist activities. Can U.S. leave Taliban to their doings? And what is the way forward? McCaul: It’s very, very dangerous. I was the chairman of Homeland Security Committee. What we're seeing now, and we saw it before, is the Haqqani [network and] Taliban protecting Zawahiri, [the] number two Al-Qaeda [figure], who was taken by drone strike not too long after the evacuation. We know that they were collaborating — ISIS-K and Taliban — because United States is a common enemy. Most disturbingly is Bagram, the prisons in Bagram. They [the Taliban] released thousands of ISIS prisoners that have now gone to the Khorasan region — that's Tajikistan, Afghanistan, Pakistan — [for] external operations. Just recently, the FBI indicated to us that eight of them have been detained in the United States coming across the southwest border. ... So, when Americans think Afghanistan is some faraway, distant land, it is all interconnected and it does threaten the homeland. VOA: What is the way forward? What do you think the U.S. strategy should be to handle this? McCaul: Number one, we don't want to see this happen again. This was not a political exercise for me. As a [former] federal prosecutor, I just wanted to get to the facts and the evidence, wherever that took me. I didn’t have conclusions in advance. ... So, to answer your question, we want to propose a new way to do this legislatively, through Congress, so that an evacuation will never happen like this again. Saigon was bad. This is worse. VOA: The report quotes a study that 118 girls were sold as child brides in Afghanistan, in a village. And, in the same village, 116 parents are waiting for a buyer. So, my question to you is that it seems like there is no hope for women and girls in Afghanistan. What is your suggestion? And what can the U.S do? McCaul: I mean, can you imagine being 25 years old as a woman and never lived under Sharia law, and now you have to go backwards to the stone age? And that's essentially what has happened there. I got four busloads of the American School of Music girls out through Abbey Gate, because I knew the Taliban — the way they feel about women and music — their days would be numbered. Now, it's very difficult. Do you normalize the Taliban? Do you treat them as a foreign terrorist organization? I think any aid or assistance we give to Afghanistan has to be conditioned on treatment of women and children. And they should be allowed to go to school, they should be allowed to go outside their homes, they should not be beaten. Just fundamental rights.

Exclusive interview: US boosts diplomacy, security support in Somalia	MOGADISHU, SOMALIA/WASHINGTON — In an exclusive interview, U.S. Ambassador to Somalia Richard Riley shed light on the ongoing diplomatic efforts and security challenges facing the East African nation, including U.S. efforts to find a peaceful diplomatic solution to the ongoing dispute between Somalia and Ethiopia. Somalia and Ethiopia have been in a dispute that was ignited at the beginning of this year when Ethiopia signed a memorandum of understanding, or MoU, with the breakaway region of Somaliland — a deal Somalia sees as an infringement on its sovereignty. The agreement gives Ethiopia leasing rights to a large portion of the Red Sea coastline in Somaliland. During the interview conducted at the U.S. Embassy in Mogadishu, Riley, who was sworn in to his post in May, shared with VOA his insights on the U.S. commitment to finding peaceful resolutions and supporting the Somali government in combating terrorism. Diplomatic resolution 'We are very much aware and working collaboratively to make sure there is a diplomatic resolution of this current situation,' he said. 'It is an unfortunate situation, very disruptive, and started ... with this MoU between Somaliland and Ethiopia. Of course, we do not recognize it, and we are trying to solve it through diplomatic channels.' Turkey, a key Somali partner, has been trying to mediate the dispute between the neighboring countries, holding two rounds of talks in Ankara that ended without an agreement. The Ethiopian and Somali foreign ministers who represented their countries at the meeting did not hold direct talks. Turkey’s foreign minister shuttled between them. Turkish Foreign Minister Hakan Fidan described the talks at the time as 'candid, cordial and forward-looking.' Abdi Aynte, a former Somali minister of planning and international cooperation who was involved in the negotiations, said the only thing the two sides agreed upon was to reconvene on September 17. 'The core issue remains Ethiopia’s refusal to annul the MoU with Somaliland, which is Somalia’s position, and if Ethiopia continues to insist on its position of not withdrawing from the MoU, I think there is nothing to expect from any talks between the two countries,' Aynte said. Another analyst who spoke with VOA earlier this year, Cameron Hudson, who is a researcher at the Washington-based Center for Strategic and International Studies, questioned the United States’ commitment and ability to quell tensions in the volatile region. Riley said he is hopeful, though, that a solution may come from the third round of talks in Turkey. 'There are negotiations ongoing,' he said. Concerns about potential conflict Fears have been growing in Somalia that the boiling tensions could turn into an armed conflict between Ethiopian soldiers currently stationed in Somalia and Somalis. Riley said such confrontation is 'unacceptable.' 'No one can accept there would be any kind of conflict, much less war,' he said. 'That is why everybody in the international community is working nonstop. We certainly are, from the United States and from Washington, to find the proper resolution of this conflict between Ethiopia and Somalia. This is absolutely needed. It is needed soon very quickly, and you have the full power and support, Somalia does, to make sure there is a proper diplomatic solution.' Ethiopian troops became part of the African Union mission, known as ATMIS, in Somalia in January 2012. Under the mission, at least 3,000 Ethiopian soldiers officially operate as part of an AU peacekeeping mission fighting al-Shabab. An additional 5,000 to 7,000 Ethiopian soldiers are stationed in several regions under a bilateral agreement. Last month, the United Nations Security Council passed Resolution 2748, which allows ATMIS troops to stay in Somalia through December 2024. Somalia says all Ethiopian troops should be out of the country by the end of 2024, especially after the expiration of ATMIS. Somali Prime Minister Hamza Abdi Barre said last month that Ethiopian forces would not be part of the upcoming African Union Support Mission in Somalia, or AUSSOM, unless Ethiopia withdraws from the controversial memorandum of understanding. Commitment to Somalia’s security Riley said the U.S. is Somalia’s largest donor and security partner, providing tens of billions of dollars over the years in personnel, equipment and funding. 'The United States, for example, just forgave over $1 million of Somali sovereign debt,' he said. He added that the U.S. will extend full support to any mission whose objective is to make Somalia a peaceful place. 'We absolutely have always strongly supported the current ATMIS force here. We are very grateful to the troop-contributing countries, who have provided very brave personnel for many years to assist the federal government to bring stability and security here,' Riley said. 'We are looking forward to this transition so that it is a proper one, it is well organized, and it is efficient, and it does the job. That is the main issue to make sure that the mandate of the follow-on force under AUSSOM will be suited to the need.' Two urgent issues He said there are imperative challenges in Somalia that the U.S. wants to help the country handle. 'There are two immediate urgencies: to ensure that the Somali National Army and armed forces, including the police, receive all the resources they need to fight against horrific terrorist groups like al-Shabab and ISIS,' he said. 'The other challenge is to ensure that the economy of Somalia continues to grow, with more investment and connectivity to international markets. Somalia needs both physical and economic security.'

US Attorney General says he won't let Justice Department be used as political weapon	WASHINGTON — Attorney General Merrick Garland said Thursday he will not allow the Justice Department 'to be used as a political weapon,' as he denounced 'conspiracy theories' and 'dangerous falsehoods' targeting federal law enforcement. Speaking to U.S. attorneys gathered in Washington and other Justice Department members, Garland forcefully defended the department's integrity and impartiality against claims of politicization by Republicans. Garland said norms protecting the department from political interference matter 'now more than ever.' 'Our norms are a promise that we will not allow this department to be used as a political weapon. And our norms are a promise that we will not allow this nation to become a country where law enforcement is treated as an apparatus of politics,' Garland said to applause in the Great Hall at Justice Department headquarters. Garland's comments come amid an onslaught of attacks from Republicans, who claim the Justice Department has been politically weaponized to go after former President Donald Trump. Trump was indicted in two separate criminal cases by special counsel Jack Smith, who Garland brought in from outside the department to run the investigations. Trump has vowed if returned to the White House in November to 'completely overhaul' what he has described as the 'corrupt Department of Injustice.' He has also threatened to jail those 'involved in unscrupulous behavior' this election, writing in a recent post on X that they will face 'long term prison sentences so that this Depravity of Justice does not happen again.' Garland did not mention Trump or Republicans in his speech. But he condemned what he described as 'outrageous' attacks he says put law enforcement in harm's way. 'These attacks have come in the form of conspiracy theories, dangerous falsehoods, efforts to bully and intimidate career public servants by repeatedly and publicly singling them out, and threats of actual violence,' Garland said. 'Through your continued work, you have made clear that the Justice Department will not be intimidated by these attacks.' Trump, the Republican presidential nominee, has repeatedly used social media to go after Smith and other prosecutors as well as the judges handling his cases. Republicans have also falsely claimed that the New York criminal case, in which Trump was convicted of 34 felony counts in May, was orchestrated by Democratic President Joe Biden and the Justice Department. Garland came into office pledging to restore the department's reputation for political independence after four tumultuous years under Trump. But he has faced an onslaught of criticism over his department's handling of politically sensitive cases, including the prosecution of Biden's son Hunter, who pleaded guilty last week to federal tax charges in a case brought by a different special counsel. Garland said that department employees have made clear through their work that they 'do not bend to politics' and that they 'will not break under pressure.' 'We must treat like cases alike,' Garland said, adding. 'There is not one rule for friends and another for foes, one rule for the powerful and another for the powerless, one rule for the rich and another for the poor, one rule for Democrats and another for Republicans, or different rules depending on one's race or ethnicity. 'To the contrary, we have only one rule: we follow the facts and apply the law in a way that respects the Constitution and protects civil liberties.'	https://www.voanews.com/a/us-attorney-general-says-he-won-t-let-justice-department-be-used-as-political-weapon/7781869.html	2024-09-12T11:19:23-07:00	
China tries to reshape Tibet, Xinjiang narratives with new propaganda efforts	Taipei, Taiwan — Chinese authorities have rolled out new propaganda efforts aimed at countering Western narratives about the human rights situation in the northwest Xinjiang Uyghur Autonomous Region and Tibet. In recent weeks, they have continued to invite foreign vloggers to visit Xinjiang, home to millions of Uyghur people, a majority Muslim ethnic minority group. Also this month, China inaugurated an international communication center to produce content portraying some 'positive developments' in Tibet, such as Tibetan people’s growing income. Since 2017, the United States, United Nations, European Parliament and rights organizations have condemned China for interning up to 1 million Uyghurs, forcing hundreds of thousands of Uyghur women to go through abortion or sterilization, and forcing Uyghurs, Kazakhs and other ethnic minorities in Xinjiang to work in factories, which prompted the United States to pass the Uyghur Forced Labor Protection Act in 2021. In Tibet, human rights organizations and Western countries, including the U.S., have accused the Chinese government of erasing the Tibetan language and culture through compulsory Chinese language education for Tibetan children, forcing hundreds of thousands of rural Tibetans to relocate to urban areas and replacing the name 'Tibet' with the Romanized Chinese name 'Xizang' in official documents. Taiwan said on September 5 it knows of reports China has been recruiting Taiwanese influencers to visit Xinjiang and help promote a more positive narrative about the region through their videos. Taiwan’s Mainland Affairs Council, which oversees cross-strait exchanges, said it was still looking into the recent surge of Xinjiang-related content produced by Taiwanese influencers and urged them to avoid violating an anti-infiltration law by accepting payment from Beijing. Taiwanese Youtuber Potter Wang claimed in June that the Chinese government had been inviting Taiwanese influencers on paid trips to China to produce content. His claims prompted several Taiwanese YouTubers who have recently published videos about Xinjiang to deny receiving payment from Beijing. In response to warnings from Taiwanese authorities, China’s Taiwan Affairs Office said Beijing welcomed 'Taiwan compatriots' to visit China and enjoy 'the magnificent mountains and rivers, taste the various kinds of food, experience the local customs, and share what they have seen and heard.' Apart from inviting Taiwanese influencers to visit Xinjiang, Beijing has been inviting foreign journalists and vloggers to visit Xinjiang since the start of 2024. In several reports, China’s state-run tabloid Global Times said these foreigners learned about 'Xinjiang's latest economic achievements, religious freedom, and ethnic integration' following visits to local industry, religious venues and residential homes. Some experts say Chinese authorities usually impose tight control over foreign influencers’ itineraries in Xinjiang to ensure the content they produce is aligned with the positive narrative that Beijing aims to promote, which is contrary to existing foreign media reports about mass internment of Uyghurs, forced labor of ethnic minorities or harsh birth control programs. 'Foreign influencers usually spend time in Xinjiang’s capital, Urumqi, and visit places like the Grand Bazaar, where they will try local food and watch dance performances that could seem to suggest that cultural forms of the Uyghur people are protected,' said Timothy Grose, a professor of China Studies at Rose-Hulman Institute of Technology in Indiana. In addition to showcasing aspects of Uyghur culture, Grose said, foreign influencers’ Xinjiang videos will often portray Uyghurs being employed and local signs containing Chinese and Uyghur characters. 'Beijing believes this is an effective strategy [to counter existing international narratives about Xinjiang] if they are indirectly controlling the types of pictures that are exported out of Xinjiang,' he told VOA by phone. By flooding social media platforms with Xinjiang content produced by these foreign influencers, Grose said, the Chinese government is trying to reach and influence casual viewers, especially younger audiences, with no deep knowledge about China or Xinjiang. 'These casual viewers don’t have expertise in China, so they won’t know where to find signs of oppression in the videos since they are unfamiliar with the Uyghur culture or China’s ethnic policy,' he said. Since China is directly or indirectly filling social media platforms with content aligned with their preferred narrative for Xinjiang, Grose said, it will be difficult for academics, activists, and journalists to counter Beijing’s propaganda efforts with content that reflects the reality in the region. Telling the Tibet stories Beijing has also launched a new initiative to 'tell the Tibet story well.' On September 2, several local and central Chinese government agencies inaugurated an 'international communication center' in the Tibetan capital, Lhasa, that aims to enhance Beijing’s ability to promote its preferred narratives about Tibet. During a roundtable event focusing on 'building a more effective international communication system for Tibet-related issues,' French writer Margot Chevestrier, who works for China’s state-run China International Communications Group, said that many young Chinese people are affected by 'biased reporting' on global social media and that these misunderstandings often stem from 'misleading reporting by some media or individuals.' The new international communication center will 'enable more people at home and abroad to know Tibet, understand Tibet, and love Tibet,' according to China’s state-run China News, an online news website. Some analysts say the communication center may serve as a centralized institution to 'coordinate' Beijing’s propaganda efforts focusing on Tibet. 'Since there doesn’t seem to be as much propaganda efforts on Tibet as on Xinjiang, Beijing might be thinking how they can use this tactic,' said Sarah Cook, an independent researcher on China and former China research director at nonprofit organization Freedom House. Cook said the amount of propaganda effort that China dedicated to Xinjiang and Tibet shows that these two issues are of a high priority for Beijing. 'While Tibet and Xinjiang are their priorities, the tactics that the Chinese propaganda apparatus deploys are similar, including spreading disinformation through fake accounts, restricting foreign journalists’ access to certain places, and suppressing information that contradicts their preferred narrative,' she told VOA by phone. Since its propaganda efforts have been seemingly successful, Grose said, Beijing will continue to employ the same set of strategies to challenge existing facts about the situation in Xinjiang and Tibet. To push back against Beijing’s campaigns, he said, Xinjiang and Tibet-focused groups should try to increase their presence on social media platforms and create more 'captivating and moving' visual content that is 'properly contextualized' but can influence young audiences. Additionally, Cook said it’s important for individuals concerned about the situation in Tibet and Xinjiang to work with like-minded research groups and expose the different propaganda campaigns that China is pushing. 'They can try to produce short videos informing people of Beijing’s tactics,' she said.	https://www.voanews.com/a/china-tries-to-reshape-tibet-xinjiang-narratives-with-new-propaganda-efforts/7781836.html	2024-09-12T11:10:15-07:00	
US imposes sanctions on Cambodian tycoon over scam centers	washington — The United States announced sanctions on Thursday on Cambodian businessman and ruling party senator Ly Yong Phat as well as several entities over alleged abuses related to workers who were trafficked and forced to work in online scam centers. The move comes at a delicate phase in relations between the United States and Cambodia, which has moved ever closer to Washington's strategic rival China despite U.S. efforts to woo its new leader Hun Manet, son of longtime strongman Hun Sen. Ly Yong Phat was appointed Hun Sen’s personal adviser in 2022. The U.S. Treasury Department's Office of Foreign Assets Control said the sanctions targeted Ly's L.Y.P. Group Co. conglomerate and O-Smach Resort. It said it was also sanctioning Cambodia-based Garden City Hotel, Koh Kong Resort, and Phnom Penh Hotel for being owned or controlled by Ly. Bradley Smith, the Treasury's acting under secretary for terrorism and financial intelligence, said the move was made to 'hold accountable those involved in human trafficking and other abuses, while also disrupting their ability to operate investment fraud schemes that target countless unsuspecting individuals, including Americans.' Cambodia and other countries in Southeast Asia have emerged in recent years as the epicenter of a multibillion-dollar criminal industry targeting victims across the world with fraudulent crypto and other schemes, often operating from fortified compounds run by Chinese syndicates and staffed by trafficked workers. The Treasury statement said scammers leverage fictitious identities and elaborate narratives to develop trusted relationships and deceive victims. In many cases, this involves convincing victims to invest in virtual currency, or in some cases, over-the-counter foreign exchange schemes, it said. The statement said traffickers force victims to work up to 15 hours a day and, in some cases, 'resell' victims to other scam operations or subject them to sex trafficking. It noted that the U.S. State Department's annual Trafficking in Persons Report this year highlighted abuses in O’Smach and Koh Kong and that official complicity in trafficking crimes remained widespread, resulting in selective and often politically motivated enforcement of laws. Americans have been targeted by many of the scams. In 2022, in the U.S alone, victims reported losses of $2.6 billion from pig butchering – a type of long-term scam – and other crypto fraud, more than double the previous year, according to the FBI. The Treasury reportsaid that for more than two years the O-Smach Resort has been investigated by police and publicly reported on 'for extensive and systemic serious human rights abuse.' It said victims reported being lured there with false employment opportunities, having phones and passports confiscated upon arrival and being forced to work scam operations. 'People who called for help reported being beaten, abused with electric shocks, made to pay a hefty ransom, or threatened with being sold to other online scam gangs,' it said, adding that there had been two reports of victims jumping to their death from buildings within the resort. The report said local authorities had conducted repeated rescue missions, including in October 2022 and March 2024, freeing victims of various nationalities, including Chinese, Indian, Indonesian, Malaysian, Singaporean, Thai and Vietnamese. The U.S state department said in June that Cambodian government officials were complicit in trafficking and that some officials owned facilities used by scam operators. Spokespeople for Cambodia's government and foreign ministry did not answer phone calls or respond to messages seeking comment when asked about the sanctions. The U.S. and other governments have repeatedly engaged with Cambodia to put an end to the scam centers. Washington had considered sanctions for months, sources briefed on the matter told Reuters. They said the decision was initially expected earlier this year but had been delayed. A change of leadership to West Point-educated Hun Manet last year was seen by U.S. officials as an opportunity to mend ties with Cambodia, but despite U.S. efforts, its ties with China have steadily grown. Beijing sent warships to Cambodia this year and is backing the expansion of a key naval base.	https://www.voanews.com/a/us-imposes-sanctions-on-cambodian-tycoon-over-scam-centers/7781840.html	2024-09-12T11:07:00-07:00	
Biden to host Quad summit in Delaware	White House — President Joe Biden will host his second and final Quad leaders’ summit in his home state of Delaware on September 21, the White House announced Thursday. Biden is planning to host the three other leaders of the group, Prime Minister Anthony Albanese of Australia, Prime Minister Narendra Modi of India, and Prime Minister Kishida Fumio of Japan. The summit will be held on the sidelines of the United Nations General Assembly, happening concurrently in New York. The leaders are expected to enhance cooperation including the existing Indo-Pacific Partnership for Maritime Domain Awareness, a key initiative aimed at countering China’s aggression in the South China Sea. 'The Quad Leaders Summit will focus on bolstering the strategic convergence among our countries, advancing our shared vision of a free and open Indo-Pacific region, and delivering concrete benefits for partners in the Indo-Pacific in key areas,' said White House spokesperson Karine Jean-Pierre in a statement Thursday. Biden hosted the first Quad leaders’ summit at the White House in 2021. The group has since met twice more in person in Japan. In a reflection of the importance of the group, Biden has hosted all the leaders for subsequent state visits at the White House. India was scheduled to host this year, but the four leaders agreed that New Delhi will instead do so in 2025. 'President Biden’s visit to India in September 2023 for the G20 summit meant that it was difficult for him to return to India in January 2024, on the sidelines of India’s Republic Day in January 2024, as per India’s original planning,' said Aparna Pande, director of the Hudson Institute’s Initiative on the Future of India and South Asia. Both India and the U.S. then became caught up in their own electoral cycles, making travel and summit-hosting respectively challenging, Pande told VOA. With Biden and Kishida set to leave office, the Wilmington summit will be the last gathering of the current leaders. Whoever wins the U.S. November election, whether Vice President Kamala Harris or former President Donald Trump, will be invited to the Delhi summit next year.	https://www.voanews.com/a/biden-to-host-quad-summit-in-delaware/7781833.html	2024-09-12T10:50:21-07:00	
Report: IS-Somalia becomes financial hub; leader could be top IS chief	Nairobi, Kenya — The International Crisis Group says Islamic State in Somalia has become an important financial influence for terrorism, and a report suggests the leader of the branch might become the new overall head of the militant group. IS-Somalia is not as active on the battlefield as its local counterpart, the al-Qaida-linked terror group al-Shabab, which controls large parts of southern and central Somalia, but it is building relations with other IS branches, the International Crisis Group said in a report released Thursday. In addition, the report says, IS-Somalia is able to finance terror operations in other African countries. Omar Mahmood, a senior researcher with the International Crisis Group, or ICG, said IS-Somalia plays a bigger role outside Somalia than al-Shabab does. 'Al-Shabab is by far and away a bigger threat,' Mahmood said. 'But at the same time, Islamic State Somalia has, one, persisted despite some significant odds against it. And two, it's carved out a role for itself within the wider Islamic State network, particularly when it comes to serving as a financial hub between some of the affiliates and other parts of the Islamic State.' The ICG said the Islamic State restructured its African operations in 2020, placing affiliates from the Democratic Republic of Congo and Mozambique under the watch of IS headquarters in Somalia’s Puntland region. IS-Somalia is reported to have between 100 and 400 fighters stationed in the northern part of the country. According to ICG, about half of the fighters are believed to be foreigners. Early this year, Puntland authorities arrested six Islamic State members who were Moroccans; they were later deported. According to the Armed Conflict Location and Event Data Project, since May of this year, the group has been increasingly active and has waged several attacks against security forces and business centers. IS-Somalia has also increased its activities in the port city of Bosaso and its surroundings, carrying out an extortion racket that it uses to support its fighters and activities. Richard Tuta, a Kenyan counterterrorism expert, said Somalia’s weak central government has enabled Somalia to be the financial hub of the IS group. 'Somalia ... does not have strong institutions, so it's easy for such institutions to be compromised,' Tuta said. 'It's easy to undertake both illegal and legal ways of fundraising towards terrorism activity. And because of the country's strategic location, it has a porous border, surrounded by an ocean, which is very hard to keep [under] surveillance.' In May, the U.S. carried out airstrikes in Somalia targeting IS leader Abdulqadir Mumin. Mumin survived. Mahmood said that if Mumin becomes the overall head of Islamic State, his rise would signal the group's growing influence in Africa. 'Now whether he's actually the head of the movement is something that's disputed,' Mahmood said. 'There's a couple other figures that are thrown out there as well. And so that's a bit uncertain. It would be quite a big jump ... for the Islamic State to designate someone on the African continent, but it would also symbolize the growing role of Islamic State within ... the African continent.' Puntland authorities have arrested dozens of IS members in the Bari region. Some have been handed jail terms. Others were executed for their involvement in terror activities and the deaths of civilians or government security forces. The ICG called for cooperation between the Somali government in Mogadishu and Puntland regional authorities to tackle IS-Somalia and urged outside actors to pay closer attention to the group’s activities.	https://www.voanews.com/a/report-is-somalia-becomes-financial-hub-leader-could-be-top-is-chief/7781793.html	2024-09-12T10:20:15-07:00	
New York City police commissioner to resign after his phone was seized in federal investigation	new york — New York City Police Commissioner Edward Caban said he would resign Thursday, one week after it emerged that his phone was seized as part of a federal investigation that touched several members of Mayor Eric Adams' inner circle. Caban said he made the decision to resign after the 'news around recent developments' had 'created a distraction for our department,' according to an email to the police department obtained by The Associated Press. 'I am unwilling to let my attention be on anything other than our important work, or the safety of the men and women of the NYPD,' he added. It was not immediately clear who will replace Caban as police commissioner. Inquiries to the police department were not returned. Caban was one of several high-ranking city officials whose electronic devices were seized last week by federal investigators, according to people familiar with the matter. The people spoke on condition of anonymity because they were not authorized to discuss the investigation. The subject of the investigation, which is being led by U.S. Attorney's office in Manhattan, remains unclear. It was not immediately clear whether federal authorities were seeking information linked to one investigation or several. Federal authorities are also investigating Caban's twin brother, James Caban, who runs a nightclub security business, according to a person familiar with the matter. The person could not publicly discuss details of the ongoing investigation and spoke to AP on condition of anonymity. Edward Caban, 57, had been in charge of the nation's largest police department for about 15 months. Of Puerto Rican heritage, he was the first Latino to lead the 179-year-old NYPD. Other officials whose devices were recently seized include First Deputy Mayor Sheena Wright; Philip Banks, the deputy mayor for public safety; his brother David Banks, the city's schools chancellor; and Timothy Pearson, a mayoral adviser and former high-ranking NYPD official. The searches added to a flurry of investigative activity around Adams' administration and his campaign. Adams, a first-term Democrat, was subpoenaed in July, eight months after federal agents seized his cell phones and an iPad while he was leaving an event in Manhattan. Federal authorities haven't publicly accused him or any officials of any crimes, and Adams has denied any wrongdoing. The investigation that led to Caban's devices being seized is not believed to be tied to a probe that led federal investigators to seize Adams' devices last November, according to two people familiar with the matter. They spoke on condition of anonymity because they were not authorized to speak publicly. On Tuesday, Adams acknowledged that the sudden increase in federal scrutiny had 'raised a lot of questions and a lot of concerns.' Caban joined the department as a patrol officer in 1991 in the Bronx, where he grew up. His father, retired Detective Juan Caban, had served with Adams, a former police captain, when they were both on the city's transit police force. Three of Caban's brothers were also police officers. Caban worked in precincts across the city, rising to sergeant, lieutenant, captain, executive officer, commanding officer, deputy inspector and inspector. He was the department's first deputy commissioner, second-in-command, before being named commissioner last year. Caban replaced Keechant Sewell, the first woman to lead the force. She resigned 18 months into a tenure clouded by speculation that she was not truly in control of the department after Adams appointed ex-NYPD chief Philip Banks as his deputy mayor of public safety. She is now the senior vice president of security and guest experience for the New York Mets. From January 1 to September 1, the department tallied 243 murders, compared with 279 in the same period last year. Burglary, grand larceny and auto thefts were also down. At the same time, there was a 17.8% spike in reported hate crimes, 11.1% jump in rapes and smaller increases in some other categories. Caban was also criticized for his handling of officer discipline. In April, he declined to take any internal department disciplinary action against two involved in the fatal 2019 shooting of a Black man, Kawaski Trawick, inside his Bronx apartment. Caban said the officers 'acted within the law' and that the city's police watchdog agency waited too long to bring administrative charges. In August, Caban upheld a department administrative trial judge's recommendation to drop a disciplinary case against Chief of Department Jeffrey Maddrey, who was accused of ordering officers to void the November 2021 arrest of a retired officer who previously worked for him. The trial judge, Rosemarie Maldonado, said the watchdog agency didn't have jurisdiction to investigate the case.	https://www.voanews.com/a/new-york-city-police-commissioner-to-resign-after-his-phone-was-seized-in-federal-investigation-/7781789.html	2024-09-12T10:17:02-07:00

Six months on, key measures languish in Pacific Islands pact with US	WASHINGTON — More than six months after a crucial security deal between Washington and some Pacific Island nations was signed into law, key features of the Compacts of Free Association have not been implemented, raising questions in the region about U.S. commitment to its Pacific partners in the face of an increasingly assertive Beijing. In March, the passage of the Compacts of Free Association, or COFA, extended $7 billion in economic aid over 20 years to three Pacific Island nations: Micronesia, Palau and the Marshall Islands. Additionally, COFA says Washington provides for their defense and can deny China access to their territorial waters, a maritime area larger than the continental United States. Since then, however, some parts of the deal have yet to be implemented, including services and health benefits for veterans who live on the islands. Currently, veterans must travel to nearby islands such as Guam or as far away as Hawaii to get the help they need. 'The Biden-Harris administration has failed' to deliver veterans services to these Pacific Island nations, said Arkansas Republican Bruce Westerman, who is chair of the U.S. House of Representatives Natural Resources Committee, during an oversight hearing on COFA this week. The U.S. State Department also has yet to establish a mandatory new office dedicated to diplomacy with the three islands. In addition, Washington’s federal programs and services agreement with Palau has not been renewed, and the current agreement expires on September 30. Federal services in limbo range from welfare benefits and food stamp programs to the U.S. Postal Service and veterans’ health benefits. 'Many of our veterans living in Palau are suffering,' Hersey Kyota, Palau’s ambassador to the U.S., told the Indian and Insular Affairs Subcommittee in the oversight hearing, Tuesday. Palau is home to around 20,000 people; with that small population, it has the highest per capita rate of U.S. military volunteers. Kyota said at least three Palauan veterans have died by suicide since January. 'They need medication; they need to travel to Guam or Hawaii, but most of them do not have enough resources to pay for their own ticket,' he said. Andrew Harding of the Heritage Foundation said the delays play to Beijing’s advantage. 'The implementation process is failing,' Harding told VOA. 'If we really want to prove that we are the preferred partner in the Pacific, especially to our COFA partners, we can’t have these types of questions be raised.' Greg Brown, a senior analyst at the Australian Strategic Policy Institute, said, 'This doesn’t look good. Now, it’s hurry up and wait, and who are we waiting for? We're waiting for ourselves. We're waiting for the Americans.' At the hearing on Tuesday, Anka Lee, deputy assistant secretary of defense for East Asia, acknowledged the critical need for U.S. engagement with Palau, Micronesia and the Marshall Islands. 'We know that the PRC is aggressive. They are pushing very hard, and we have to compete with them toe to toe,' he said to lawmakers, using the acronym for China’s official name, the People’s Republic of China. During the oversight hearing, Taylor Ruggles, the senior COFA adviser at the U.S. State Department, blamed some of the delay on communication issues between the White House and Congress and a focus on rolling out additional embassies in other Pacific Island nations such as Vanuatu. He said there’s an interagency meeting this week to get all the federal agencies together to move the process forward. That meeting, the second this year, is scheduled for Thursday. The first was held in April. Dr. Miguel H. Lopez, assistant undersecretary for health at the U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs, said this week the department would 'provide a comprehensive model of care' to Pacific veterans that is equal to treatment veterans receive in the continental United States. Ambassadors to Palau, Micronesia and the Marshall Islands told lawmakers at the hearing that they received letters from the Veterans Administration Monday night, just hours before the oversight hearing. 'The [veterans] agreement calls for a one-year duration. We’re within six to seven months now, and we have not heard anything,' said Jack Soram, the Federated State of Micronesia ambassador to the United States. 'We don’t have that much time. Veterans need this help,' said Representative Ed Case, a Democrat from Hawaii.	https://www.voanews.com/a/six-months-on-key-measures-languish-in-pacific-islands-pact-with-us/7781649.html	2024-09-12T08:50:43-07:00	
US sanctions 16 allies of Venezuela's president over accusations of obstructing election	WASHINGTON — The U.S. government on Thursday responded to Venezuela's disputed July presidential election by imposing sanctions against 16 allies of President Nicolas Maduro, accusing them of obstructing the vote and carrying out human rights abuses. Those targeted by the Treasury Department include the head of the country's high court, leaders of state security forces and prosecutors. The move came days after the departure into exile of Edmundo Gonzalez Urrutia, the former diplomat who represented the main opposition parties and claimed to have won the July 28 presidential election by a wide margin. Venezuela's electoral authorities declared Maduro the victor hours after polls closed, but unlike previous elections, they never released detailed vote tallies to back up their claim. Global condemnation over the lack of transparency prompted Maduro to ask Venezuela's high court, stacked with ruling party loyalists, to audit the results. The court reaffirmed his victory. Experts from the United Nations and the Carter Center, which at the invitation of Maduro's government observed the election, determined the results announced by electoral authorities lacked credibility.	https://www.voanews.com/a/us-sanctions-16-allies-of-venezuela-s-president-over-accusations-of-obstructing-election-/7781644.html	2024-09-12T08:30:45-07:00	
Kansas prison where 'In Cold Blood' killers were executed will soon open for tours	LANSING, Kansas — The shuttered Kansas prison where the killers chronicled in Truman Capote's In Cold Blood were executed is now a tourist attraction. Starting Friday, former wardens and corrections officers will lead two-hour tours of the stone-walled building in Lansing that first began housing inmates in the 1860s, The Kansas City Star reported. The building, originally called the Kansas State Penitentiary, was without purpose after the Kansas Department of Corrections opened the newly constructed Lansing Correctional Facility in 2020. But instead of demolishing it, the Department of Corrections transferred control of the building to the Lansing Historical Society and Museum. Upcoming events include a car show inside the prison walls later this month. 'We’re expecting the prison to open up to large crowds who want to know what went on inside those walls,' Debra Bates-Lamborn, president of the society, said after state prison officials handed over the keys this week. For years, the prison carried out executions by hanging at the gallows — a site that visitors will not be able to access during tours. Since removed from prison grounds, the wooden gallows are now disassembled and under the state’s custody. Among the notable inmates executed at the prison were Richard 'Dick' Hickock and Perry Smith, who were convicted of murdering four members of the Clutter family on Nov. 15, 1959, in the family's home near Holcomb, Kansas. Capote, along with his close friend and fellow writer Harper Lee, visited the prison while doing research for the book about the killings. Hickock and Smith were executed in April 1965, among the last inmates to be hanged in the state. One spot on the tour is the Chow Hall, where the late country music legend Johnny Cash performed for inmates in 1970. 'Johnny Cash has always said that audiences in prisons are the most enthusiastic audience he’s ever played to,' Bates-Lamborn said. The prison tour is modeled off of a similar tour in Missouri. About a year ago, a state lawmaker approached the Lansing Historical Society and Museum with the idea of preserving the prison by converting it into a tourist attraction. Bates-Lamborn said she and another board member made the trip to Jefferson City to tour the Missouri State Penitentiary, which has been open for tours since 2009. 'Afterwards, I thought ours is a shoo-in and we’re so much better,' she said. Tours of the facility will be held on Fridays, Saturdays and Sundays, and are scheduled to run until October 26. Since the facility has no heat or electricity, the tours stop over the winter and will return in the spring.	https://www.voanews.com/a/kansas-prison-where-in-cold-blood-killers-were-executed-will-soon-open-for-tours-/7780460.html	2024-09-12T08:17:13-07:00	
Harvey Weinstein indicted on additional sex crimes charges ahead of New York retrial	NEW YORK — Disgraced movie mogul Harvey Weinstein has been indicted on additional sex crimes charges ahead of his retrial in New York, Manhattan prosecutors said at a hearing Thursday. The indictment will remain under seal until Weinstein's arraignment on the new charges, which is scheduled for September 18. Weinstein, 72, is recovering from emergency heart surgery Monday at a Manhattan hospital to remove fluid on his heart and lungs and was not at Thursday's hearing. Prosecutors retrying Weinstein's overturned rape conviction disclosed last week that they had begun presenting to a grand jury evidence of up to three additional allegations against Weinstein, dating as far back as the mid-2000s. They include alleged sexual assaults at the Tribeca Grand Hotel, now known as the Roxy Hotel, and in a Lower Manhattan residential building between late 2005 and mid-2006, and an alleged sexual assault at a Tribeca hotel in May 2016. Because the indictment is under seal, it was not known whether the new charges involved some or all of the additional allegations. Prosecutors had been seeking to retry Weinstein after New York's highest court, the Court of Appeals, overturned his 2020 conviction on rape and sexual assault charges earlier this year and ordered a new trial. It remains to be seen whether the new charges will be included in the retrial, as prosecutors hope, or handled as a separate case by the court. The new charges come after prosecutors in Britain announced last week that they would no longer pursue charges of indecent assault against Weinstein, who was the most prominent villain of the #MeToo movement in 2017 when women began going public with accounts of his behavior. Weinstein, who co-founded the film and television production company Miramax, has long maintained that any sexual activity was consensual. At Thursday's hearing, Judge Curtis Farber ruled that because of Weinstein's health concerns, he will be allowed to remain at Bellevue Hospital indefinitely instead of being moved back to the city's Rikers Island jail complex. Manhattan District Attorney Alvin Bragg's office had signaled for months that new charges were imminent against Weinstein, who was once one of the most powerful people in Hollywood, having produced films such as Pulp Fiction and The Crying Game. In July, prosecutors told a judge they were actively pursuing claims of rape that occurred in Manhattan within the statute of limitations. They said some potential accusers who were not ready to come forward during Weinstein's first New York trial had indicated they were now willing to testify. New York's highest court threw out Weinstein's 2020 conviction in April after determining the trial judge unfairly allowed testimony against him based on allegations from other women that were not part of the case. Prosecutors have said one of the accusers in that case, Jessica Mann, is prepared to testify against him again. It's unclear if the second accuser, Mimi Haley, would participate. Her lawyer, Gloria Allred, declined to comment. The Associated Press does not generally identify people alleging sexual assault unless they consent to be named, as Haley and Mann did. Weinstein, who had been serving a 23-year sentence in New York when his conviction was quashed, was convicted in Los Angeles in 2022 of another rape. His 16-year prison sentence in that case still stands, but his lawyers appealed in June, arguing he did not get a fair trial in Los Angeles. Weinstein has remained in custody in New York's Rikers Island jail complex while awaiting the retrial.	https://www.voanews.com/a/harvey-weinstein-indicted-on-additional-sex-crimes-charges-ahead-of-new-york-retrial/7781592.html	2024-09-12T08:04:57-07:00	
US commander: Support for Somalia in the works as country readies for withdrawal of AU mission	Nairobi, Kenya — A U.S. Marine Corps general who commands forces in Africa says stability and support programs for Somalia are in the works as the country prepares for the withdrawal of African Union troops in December. General Michael Langley, head of the U.S. Africa Command, said that after meeting this past weekend with Somali President Hassan Sheikh Mohamud and his top military official, Major General Ibrahim Sheikh Muhyadin Addow, he’s confident the country can manage its own security after the December withdrawal of the African Union Transitional Mission in Somalia, known as ATMIS. Langley's remarks, in a virtual briefing to reporters Thursday, came 2 1/2 years after the multidimensional mission was authorized by the U.N. Security Council, in part to help stabilize the country following years of insurgency by the militant group al-Shabab. Langley said that Somali authorities have told him military operations in the southern and central parts of the country are focused on liberating some areas from the militants and stabilizing others. 'The operations are ebbing and flowing,' Langley said. 'I’ll just use some of their narratives. They have a young army, it’s a building army, so there are some successes and some setbacks, but I think the morale across the forces is building and they are very enthusiastic they’re going to be able to keep al-Shabab back on their heels going forward in future operations.' In a briefing to the Security Council in June, Mohamed el-Amine Souef, head of ATMIS, told the council that the threat posed by al-Shabab remains unpredictable. Citing a recent attack on Somali security forces in the Galmudug region, and a mortar attack on the ATMIS camp in Baidoa, he said the group still retains the ability to conduct devastating assaults. Although Somali forces supported by ATMIS have achieved significant gains in the fight against al-Shabab, support from international partners is essential to maintain the momentum, he said. After visiting Somalia, Langley arrived in Kenya, which contributes troops to ATMIS, where he said he plans to engage with the Kenyan military leadership to explore future prospects on how to help the Somali army hit its operational objectives. 'They have been a tremendous partner with the Somali national army, institutionalizing, professionalizing, helping them to be able to operate in various areas, collaborating along the border to ensure the defeat of al-Shabab,' Langley said. In West Africa, U.S. troops recently withdrew from Niger, where they were ordered to leave after a military junta took power. Juntas that took power by force also rule Mali and Burkina Faso. Langley said the way forward on security cooperation across the Sahel is still to be determined, but added that U.S. forces will stay engaged. 'In the interim, yes, we are pivoting to some degree on like-minded countries with democratic values and shared objectives and shared challenges across the coast of West Africa,' he said. 'So yes, we are in talks with Cote D’Ivoire, in talks with Ghana and Benin, as well as we start to reset and calibrate some of our assets.' He said those countries are facing threats from terrorist groups like al-Qaida and Islamic State, which initially operated in Mali, Burkina Faso and Niger, but are now moving toward other countries across the region.	https://www.voanews.com/a/us-commander-support-for-somalia-in-the-works-as-country-readies-for-withdrawal-of-au-mission/7781558.html	2024-09-12T07:59:47-07:00	
Pope ends his longest trip in religiously diverse Singapore	Pope Francis is in Singapore for the final leg of his tour of Asia and Oceania. It has been the longest and farthest trip of his tenure, taking in four countries and covering more than 30,000 kilometers. He has delivered a message of interfaith harmony throughout, and as Adam Hancock has been finding out, that theme will be prominent during his stay in the Southeast Asian financial hub.	https://www.voanews.com/a/pope-ends-his-longest-trip-in-religiously-diverse-singapore/7781520.html	2024-09-12T07:30:58-07:00	
Iran summons 4 European envoys over accusations it supplied missiles to Russia	TEHRAN, Iran — Iran's government on Thursday summoned the envoys of Britain, France, Germany and the Netherlands over their accusations that Tehran supplied short-range ballistic missiles to Russia to use against Ukraine. State-run IRNA news agency reported that the country's foreign ministry summoned the envoys separately on Thursday to strongly condemn the accusations. IRNA said the ministry also condemned Britain, France, and Germany for issuing a joint statement against Iran and called it an 'unconventional and non-constructive statement.' The joint statement, issued Tuesday, condemned the alleged transfer of missiles, calling it 'an escalation by both Iran and Russia' and 'a direct threat to European security.' The three countries also announced new sanctions against Iran, including the cancellation of air services agreements with Iran, which will restrict Iran Air's ability to fly to the U.K. and Europe. IRNA said that Iran's foreign ministry told the envoys that their insistence on taking such positions is seen as part of the West's ongoing hostile policy against the Iranian people. The actions will 'be met with an appropriate response from the Islamic Republic of Iran.' U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken said this week that Iran had ignored warnings that the transfer of such weapons would be a profound escalation of the conflict. He told reporters during a trip to London that dozens of Russian military personnel had been trained in Iran to use the Fath-360 close-range ballistic missile system, which has a maximum range of 120 kilometers.	https://www.voanews.com/a/iran-summons-4-european-envoys-over-accusations-it-supplied-ballistic-missiles-to-russia/7781498.html	2024-09-12T07:26:56-07:00	
Firefighters hope cooler weather will aid battle against 3 major Southern California fires	Wrightwood, California — Firefighters battling three major wildfires in the mountains east of Los Angeles took advantage of cooler weather Wednesday as they slowly gained the upper hand, but not before dozens of homes were destroyed and thousands of people were forced to evacuate. California is only now heading into the teeth of the wildfire season but already has seen nearly three times as much acreage burn than during all of 2023. The wildfires have threatened tens of thousands of homes and other structures across Southern California since they accelerated during a triple-digit heat wave over the weekend. No deaths have been reported, but at least a dozen people, mainly firefighters, have been treated for injuries, mostly heat-related, authorities said. In the small community of Wrightwood, about 90 minutes outside Los Angeles, authorities implored residents to flee the exploding Bridge Fire, which has burned more than a dozen homes in the area. Resident Erin Arias said she was racing up the mountain when she got the order to leave and did, grabbing her passport and dog. On Wednesday, she and her husband doused water on the roof of their still-standing home. Their cat was missing, she said. 'It's absolutely scary,' Arias said, looking at the burned embers of her neighbor's home. 'We're really lucky.' UCLA climate scientist Daniel Swain said the fire moved extraordinarily fast across complex terrain, likely giving residents less time to evacuate than usual and surprising even seasoned fire officials. The Bridge Fire 'had to go up mountain sides, burn down slope, jump across valleys, burn across new ridges, and then make it down slope again at least two other times in effectively one burning period,' he said. The full extent of the damage caused by the fires remained unclear. The three blazes are: — The Airport Fire in Orange County, which has burned more than 91 square kilometers. The fire was 5% contained Wednesday night and was reportedly sparked by heavy equipment operating in the area. Orange County Fire Capt. Steve Concialdi said eight firefighters have been treated for injuries, mostly heat-related. One resident suffered smoke inhalation and another burns, he said. Several homes burned in El Cariso Village. — The Line Fire in the San Bernardino National Forest, which was 18% contained Wednesday and had charred 148 square kilometers. The blaze has injured three firefighters. Authorities said it was caused by arson in Highland. A suspect was arrested Tuesday. — The Bridge Fire east of Los Angeles, which grew tenfold in a day and has burned 202 square kilometers, torched at least 33 homes and six cabins and forced the evacuation of 10,000 people. The cause of the fire is not yet known. It remained zero percent contained Wednesday night. Gov. Gavin Newsom sent National Guard troops in to help with evacuations, and the White House said President Joe Biden was monitoring the situation. In El Cariso Village, a community of 250 people along Highway 74 in Riverside County, an Associated Press photographer saw at least 10 homes and several cars engulfed in flames. Orange County Fire Authority Incident Commander Kevin Fetterman said the blaze has been difficult to tame because of the terrain and dry conditions and because some areas hadn't burned in decades. More than 5,500 homes in Riverside County were under evacuation orders, affecting more than 19,000 residents. Several recreational cabins and structures in the Cleveland National Forest have been damaged. In San Bernardino County, some 65,600 homes and buildings were under threat by the Line Fire, and residents along the southern edge of Big Bear Lake were told to leave Tuesday. The Line Fire blanketed the area with a thick cloud of dark smoke, which provided shade for firefighters trying to get ahead of winds expected later Wednesday, said Fabian Herrera, a spokesperson for those battling the Line Fire. A man from the town of Norco suspected of starting the Line Fire on Sept. 5 was arrested and charged with arson, San Bernardino County Sheriff's Department said. Officials did not specify what was used to start the fire. Investigators collected evidence from the man's vehicle and home that suggests he could have been involved in starting other fires, San Bernardino County Sheriff Shannon Dicus said Wednesday. On the Nevada border with California near Reno, the Davis Fire forced thousands of people to evacuate over the weekend, destroyed one home and a dozen structures and charred nearly 23 square kilometers of timber and brush along the Sierra Nevada's eastern front. Rich Meyr and Evelyn Kelley were the first arrivals at an evacuation center set up Wednesday at a recreation center in south Reno. Both said they refused to evacuate previous fires but decided to play it safe this time. 'My son's wedding is Saturday. I threw all the flowers and gowns in the RV and we left. It looks like a garden shop inside that RV,' Kelley said. 'But who wants to burn alive?' More than 600 firefighters kept the blaze from growing Wednesday despite high winds that grounded all aircraft that had dropped retardant on the flames over the past two days. The fire was about 30% contained Wednesday night.	https://www.voanews.com/a/firefighters-hope-cooler-weather-will-aid-battle-against-3-major-southern-california-fires/7781406.html	2024-09-12T05:50:51-07:00

Pope Francis, in Singapore, urges fair wages for migrant workers	Singapore — Pope Francis on Thursday urged political leaders in Singapore, a leading global financial hub, to seek fair wages for the country's million-plus lower-paid foreign workers. In likely the last major speech of an ambitious 12-day tour across Southeast Asia and Oceania, the 87-year-old pontiff expressed concern for Singapore's rapidly aging population and its migrant workforce, centered in the construction and domestic services industries. 'I hope that special attention will be paid to the poor and the elderly ... as well as to protecting the dignity of migrant workers,' the pope said in an address to about 1,000 politicians and civil and religious leaders. 'These workers contribute a great deal to society and should be guaranteed a fair wage,' he said. There were 1.1 million foreigners on work permits in Singapore who earned less than S$3,000 ($2,300) per month as of December 2023, including 286,300 domestic workers and 441,100 workers in the construction, shipyard and process sectors, government data shows. Many of the migrant workers come from nearby countries such as Malaysia, China, Bangladesh and India. Many also come from the Philippines, a majority Catholic country. A Singapore NGO that provides services for migrant workers, Humanitarian Organisation for Migration Economics, welcomed the pope's remarks, saying they were in 'full agreement' with his call for fair wages. Singapore's workforce ministry did not immediately respond to a request for comment. Concern for migrants has been a common theme for Francis. Earlier on his trip, he asked leaders in Papua New Guinea to work for fair wages as that country becomes a major target of international companies for its gas, gold and other reserves. 'Example to follow' Francis' speech came after private meetings with President Tharman Shanmugaratnam and Prime Minister Lawrence Wong at the country's parliament building, where the pope was presented with a white orchid plant, a new hybrid that was named in his honor. Francis praised Singapore's efforts to confront climate change, calling them a model for other countries. Singapore's government says rising sea levels due to global warming could have major implications for its low-lying coastline and it is planning to spend S$100 billion ($77 billion) over the course of the century on the issue. 'Your commitment to sustainable development and the preservation of creation is an example to follow,' the pope said. Francis, who has prioritized trips to places never visited by a pope, or where Catholics are a small minority, is only the second pope to visit Singapore, following a brief 5-hour layover by the late John Paul II in 1986. Singapore, with a population of 5.92 million, is plurality Buddhist, with about 31% of people identifying with that faith. The Vatican counts about 210,000 Catholics in the country, although that number is higher if foreign workers are included. There are also strong Muslim, Hindu and Taoist communities, and Francis praised Singapore as 'a mosaic of ethnicities, cultures and religions living together in harmony.' Hong Kong presence Francis celebrated a Mass the Vatican said drew some 50,000 people to Singapore's national sports stadium, a venue that has also hosted performers such as Taylor Swift, who played six concerts there in March. People queued outside the stadium, under tight security measures, at least five hours before the start of the event. Connie Rodriguez, a Filipino Catholic in Singapore, said it was 'overwhelming' to see the pope. 'You really feel so blessed,' she said. Francis toured the stadium at the beginning of the event in a white golf cart decorated with the Vatican seal. He greeted dozens of schoolchildren, babies, and disabled people. He also took a few selfies. Among those who attended the Mass, which featured a prayer in Mandarin, were Catholics who traveled from Hong Kong for the event, including the territory's archbishop, Cardinal Stephen Chow Sau-yan. The Vatican is currently renegotiating a controversial deal with China over the appointment of Catholic bishops in the country, which is up for renewal in October. Francis' 12-day tour has also included stops in Indonesia, Papua New Guinea, and East Timor. He returns to Rome on Friday.

Francine weakens moving inland from Gulf Coast after hurricane winds cause power outages	MORGAN CITY, La. — Francine weakened Thursday after striking Louisiana as a Category 2 hurricane that knocked out power to hundreds of thousands of homes and businesses, sent storm surge rushing into coastal communities and raised flood fears in New Orleans and beyond as drenching rains spread over the northern Gulf Coast. The tropical storm was forecast to be downgraded to a tropical depression as it churned northward over Mississippi, the National Hurricane Center said. Some 3 to 6 inches (8 to 15 centimeters) of rain were possible in parts of Mississippi, Arkansas, Tennessee, Alabama, Georgia and the Florida Panhandle, with up to 10 inches (25 centimeters) possible in some spots in parts of Alabama and Florida, forecasters said, warning of the potential threat of scattered flash flooding as farflung as Jackson, Mississippi; Birmingham, Alabama; Memphis, Tennessee; and Atlanta. Francine slammed the Louisiana coast Wednesday evening with 100 mph (155 kph) winds in coastal Terrebonne Parish, battering a fragile coastal region that hasn't fully recovered from a series of devastating hurricanes in 2020 and 2021. It then moved at a fast clip toward New Orleans, pounding the city with torrential rains. There were no immediate reports of deaths or injuries. TV news broadcasts from coastal communities showed waves from nearby lakes, rivers and Gulf waters thrashing sea walls. Water poured into city streets amid blinding downpours. Oak and cypress trees leaned in the high winds, and some utility poles swayed back and forth. 'It's a little bit worse than what I expected to be honest with you,' said Alvin Cockerham, fire chief of Morgan City about 30 miles (50 kilometers) from where the storm's center made landfall. 'I pulled all my trucks back to the station. It's too dangerous to be out there in this.' Power outages in Louisiana topped 390,000 early Thursday in Louisiana, according to the tracking site poweroutage.us, with an additional 46,000 outages reported in Mississippi. Sheltering at her mother's home just outside Morgan City, Laura Leftwich said blasts of wind had swept away two large birdhouses outside. She had a generator powering an internet connection so she could video chat with friends, holding her computer to a window to show them water overflowing in the street. If the storm had been any more intense, 'I wouldn't have the guts to look outside,' said Leftwich, 40. 'It's a little scary.' The sixth named storm of the Atlantic hurricane season, Francine drew fuel from exceedingly warm Gulf of Mexico waters, strengthening to a Category 2 storm before landfall. It weakened late Wednesday to a tropical storm. In addition to torrential rains, there was a lingering threat of spin-off tornadoes from the storm Thursday in Florida and Alabama. Louisiana Gov. Jeff Landry said the National Guard would fan out to parishes impacted by Francine. They have food, water, nearly 400 high-water vehicles, about 100 boats and 50 helicopters to respond to the storm, including for possible search-and-rescue operations. Since the mid-19th century, some 57 hurricanes have tracked over or made landfall in Louisiana, according to The Weather Channel. Among them are some of the strongest, costliest and deadliest storms in U.S. history. Morgan City, home to around 11,500 people, sits on the banks of the Atchafalaya River in south Louisiana and is surrounded by lakes and marsh. It's described on the city's website as 'gateway to the Gulf of Mexico for the shrimping and oilfield industries.' President Joe Biden granted an emergency declaration to help Louisiana secure expedited federal money and assistance. Landry and Mississippi Gov. Tate Reeves also declared states of emergency. The Mississippi Emergency Management Agency said it distributed more than 100,000 sandbags to the southern part of the state and the Department of Education reported a number of school district closures for Wednesday and Thursday.	https://www.voanews.com/a/francine-weakens-moving-inland-from-gulf-coast-after-hurricane-winds-cause-power-outages/7781319.html	2024-09-12T04:25:29-07:00	
South Korea approves building two nuclear reactors	Seoul — South Korea approved the construction of two nuclear reactors on its east coast Thursday, reversing a previous administration's anti-nuclear policy as Seoul now works to expand its atomic energy capabilities. The Nuclear Safety and Security Commission approved permits to build the Shin Hanul 3 and 4 reactors after it 'confirmed the safety' of the project in southeast Uljin city. 'No factors have been found at the reactor construction site that could cause geological disasters such as subsidence or ground collapse,' it said. Each reactor will have a capacity of 1.4 gigawatts, and they are scheduled to be built by 2033. Seoul sought to phase out nuclear energy under the leadership of Moon Jae-in, whose government aimed to make South Korea completely nuclear-free by 2084. But since Yoon Suk Yeol took office in 2022, his government has ambitions to increase the share of power generated from nuclear energy to 36 percent by 2038, up from the current 30 percent. The new reactors will 'contribute to the development of cutting-edge technologies such as AI by providing a stable supply of clean and reliable energy,' said Sung Tae-yoon, Yoon's chief of staff for policy. The development could also 'help the country secure reactor construction bids overseas,' he told reporters. The approval came eight years after Korea Hydro & Nuclear Power Company first submitted the permit request. The process was suspended in 2017 amid the then-government's push to reduce the country's dependence on nuclear energy. Thursday's decision was criticized by Korean activist group Energy Justice Actions as an 'irresponsible move that threatens the safety of the people, in opposition to the global trend towards an energy shift' towards renewable resources. The two new reactors will be Uljin's ninth and tenth, the group said, calling such a concentration a 'global rarity.'	https://www.voanews.com/a/south-korea-approves-building-two-nuclear-reactors/7781297.html	2024-09-12T04:04:26-07:00	
Indonesian leader spends final weeks of his term in unfinished new capital	Jakarta — Indonesian President Joko Widodo will from Thursday spend the final weeks of his term in the country's planned new capital, Nusantara, amid doubts about the continued pace of development of his flagship $32 billion megaproject. The massive infrastructure undertaking on the island of Borneo has suffered a series of setbacks, including construction delays, land issues, and a lack of foreign investment. This June the two top officials overseeing Nusantara abruptly resigned. Jokowi, as the outgoing leader is known, reiterated on Thursday that it could be decades before Nusantara is finished. 'It could take 10, 15, or even 20 years,' Jokowi told top military and police officials during a meeting in Nusantara's recently completed eagle-shaped palace. 'Moving to the new capital is not only about moving to a new building, palace or location,' he added. 'But is a change of mindset and working patterns.' Intended to ease the burden on the congested, polluted and densely populated current capital Jakarta, the parliament in 2022 passed a law to move its capital. But ahead of the Oct. 20 inauguration of president-elect Prabowo Subianto and Jokowi's eldest son, vice president-elect Gibran Rakabuming Raka, doubts have grown about Nusantara's future viability. Analysts say the development of Nusantara is unlikely to continue at the same breakneck speed in the next administration. Prabowo, who ran on a platform of continuing Jokowi's policies, is expected to prioritize his own signature $28 billion 'free nutritious food program' targeting malnutrition and stunted growth in schoolchildren across the world's fourth-most populous nation. Jokowi told officials on Thursday that Prabowo had promised to speed up construction. Located on the eastern side of Borneo island, Nusantara is about 1,200 km from Jakarta. Nusantara's presidential palace and its first hotel were recently completed, while housing for state officials, an airport and toll roads are still under way. On Friday Jokowi is expected to hold his second cabinet meeting in Nusantara and may announce several new investments.	https://www.voanews.com/a/indonesian-leader-spends-final-weeks-of-his-term-in-unfinished-new-capital/7781279.html	2024-09-12T03:35:51-07:00

Vietnam death toll climbs to 199 as typhoon aftermath brings flash floods, landslides	HANOI, Vietnam — Nearly 200 people have died in Vietnam in the aftermath of Typhoon Yagi and 128 are missing as flash floods and landslides take their toll, state media reported Thursday. Vietnam's VNExpress newspaper reported that 199 people have died while more than 800 have been injured. In the capital, flood waters from the Red River receded slightly but many areas were still inundated with water neck-high in some places. In Hanoi's Tay Ho district, people waded through muddy brown water above their knees to make their way along one street, some still wearing their bicycle and motorcycle helmets after abandoning their vehicles along the way. A few paddled along the road in small boats as empty water bottles, a plastic foam cooler and other flotsam drifted by; one man pushed his motorbike toward drier ground in an aluminum sloop. Pedestrians hiked up their shorts as high as possible to avoid being soaked by the wake caused by a delivery truck powering its way through the water. Bakery owner Mai Anh evacuated the area with her family to shelter with her parents, but returned Thursday to check on her shop and found more than half a meter of water still inside. 'I can't do business with the flood like this,' she said. 'The goods in my shop are all destroyed.' The flooding in Hanoi has been reportedly the worst in two decades. Residents started evacuating the area Tuesday as the flood waters rose, and power and drinking water have been cut since Wednesday. The flood waters damaged the doors to Hoang Anh Tu's home, from which he operates a beer shop. Though he and his family were able to relocate to his parents' house, they have had to take turns guarding the building. 'It's very difficult,' he said. 'We haven't even been able to assess the damage because the flood came so fast.' Yagi was the strongest typhoon to hit the Southeast Asian country in decades. It made landfall Saturday with winds of up to 149 kph. Despite weakening on Sunday, downpours continued and rivers remain dangerously high. The death toll spiked earlier in the week as a flash flood swept away the entire hamlet of Lang Nu in northern Vietnam's Lao Cai province Tuesday. Hundreds of rescue personnel worked tirelessly Wednesday to search for survivors, but as of Thursday morning 53 villagers remained missing, VNExpress reported, while seven more bodies were found, bringing the death toll there to 42. Floods and landslides have caused most of the deaths, many of which have come in the northwestern Lao Cai province, bordering China, where Lang Nu is located. Lao Cai province is also home to the popular trekking destination of Sapa. On Monday, a bridge collapsed and a bus was swept away by flooding, killing dozens of people. The steel bridge in Phu Tho province over the engorged Red River collapsed, sending 10 cars and trucks along with two motorbikes into the river. The bus carrying 20 people was swept into a flooded stream by a landslide in mountainous Cao Bang province. Experts say storms like Typhoon Yagi are getting stronger due to climate change, as warmer ocean waters provide more energy to fuel them, leading to higher winds and heavier rainfall.	https://www.voanews.com/a/vietnam-death-toll-climbs-to-199-as-typhoon-aftermath-brings-flash-floods-landslides/7781246.html	2024-09-12T02:34:13-07:00	
Ukraine businesses hire more women and teens as labor shortages bite	KYIV, Ukraine — After spending years in what she described as 'boring, sedentary' roles in the offices of several Ukrainian companies, Liliia Shulha landed her dream job as a truck driver with Ukraine's leading retailer, Fozzy Group. 'I always dreamed about big cars. Instead of (playing with) dolls, I drove cars when I was a child,' she told Reuters. 'Now the situation is such that they take people without experience and they train. I was lucky,' said Shulha, 40, wearing a company uniform in front of a large truck. As the war with Russia drains the labor force, businesses are trying to cover critical shortages by hiring more women in traditionally male-dominated roles and turning to teenagers, students and older workers. With millions of people, mostly women and children, abroad after fleeing the war, and tens of thousands of men mobilized into the army, the jobs crisis could endanger economic growth and a post-war recovery, analysts say. Ukraine has lost over a quarter of its workforce since Russia's invasion in February 2022, central bank data showed. Nearly 60% of businesses said finding skilled workers was their main challenge, an economy ministry survey of over 3,000 companies showed. 'The situation is indeed critical,' said Tetiana Petruk, chief sustainability officer at steel company Metinvest, one of Ukraine's largest employers with a workforce of about 45,000. It has about 4,000 vacancies. 'The staff deficit that we feel has an impact on our production,' Petruk told Reuters in an online interview. 'We are not the only ones who feel the staff shortages, all companies in the regions feel that, including our contractors.' Reuters spoke to representatives of nine Ukrainian companies, from big industrial firms to retail groups and small private entrepreneurs. All said staff shortages and a growing mismatch of skills were big challenges. Businesses said they were changing recruitment and business practices, automating, rotating existing staff and expanding their job descriptions, re-hiring retirees and offering more benefits, especially for younger workers. They also have had to increase wages. The average monthly wage now is about $470 compared to about $350 a year ago. 'There is a noticeable shift away from gender and age bias in candidate selection as employers adjust criteria to attract needed employees,' said the Kyiv School of Economics. 'This trend also extends to entrepreneurship, where the share of female entrepreneurs is growing significantly.' More women Male-dominated industries are more affected by staff shortages, the central bank said. The construction sector, transport, mining and others have all suffered because of military mobilization, for which men aged 25 to 60 are eligible. To keep the economy running, the government provides full or partial deferrals for critical companies. In the energy and weapons production sectors, 100% of staff are eligible for draft deferral. In some other sectors, firms can retain 50% of male staff. But the process to secure deferral is long and complicated. As the government toughened mobilization rules this year, the number of men preferring informal employment - allowing them to stay off public data records - grew, some enterprises said. In the agricultural southern region of Mykolayiv, women are being trained as tractor drivers. Women are also increasingly working as tram and truck drivers, coal miners, security guards and warehouse workers, companies say. 'We are offering training and jobs for women who have minimal experience,' said Lyubov Ukrainets, human resources director at Silpo, part of Fozzy Group. Including Shulha, the company has six female truck drivers and is more actively recruiting women for other jobs previously dominated by men, including loaders, meat splitters, packers and security guards. The share of female employees is growing in industries such as steel production. Petruk said female staff accounted for about 30-35% of Metinvest's workforce and the company now hired women for some underground jobs. Metinvest was unable to provide comparative figures for before the war. Some other women are unable or unwilling to join the workforce because of a lack of childcare. Shulha, who works 15-day stretches on the road, has moved back in with her parents to ensure care for her 14-year-old son and 16-year-old daughter. Young people Businesses and economists expect labor market challenges to persist. Employers are turning their attention to young people by offering training, job experience and targeted benefit packages. Metinvest, which previously focused on students, is now increasingly working with professional colleges, Petruk said. Silpo is more actively hiring teenagers for entry-level jobs in supermarkets and has launched a specialized internship program for students. Mobile phone operator Vodafone repackaged its youth program, creating an opportunity for about 50 teenagers in 12 cities to get their first job experience. 'We want to offer the first proper experience of the official job to this young audience. Another objective is to build a talent pool,' said Ilona Voloshyna of Vodafone Retail. 'Also we want to understand the youth,' she said in a Vodafone shop in Kyiv as six teenagers consulted with visitors. The government and foreign partners have launched several programs to help Ukrainians reskill. 'We provide the opportunity for everyone at state expense to obtain a new profession which is in demand on the labor market, or to raise their professional level,' said Tetiana Berezhna, a deputy economy minister.	https://www.voanews.com/a/ukraine-businesses-hire-more-women-and-teens-as-labor-shortages-bite/7781233.html	2024-09-12T01:39:28-07:00

Botswana, US firm partner to conduct border pathogen monitoring	Gaborone, Botswana — Botswana and an American biotech firm, Ginkgo Bioworks, have partnered to conduct pathogen surveillance at the country’s entry points. Health officials say the proactive move is meant to safeguard public health as the world faces emerging disease threats. Botswana introduced mpox screening last month for travelers at its entry points. In a statement Wednesday, Ministry of Health spokesperson Christopher Nyanga said a pathogen-monitoring program is critical to detecting similar emerging health threats. Dr. Mbatshi Mazwiduma, a public health expert, said the pathogen-surveillance program will complement existing strategies to prevent disease threats. 'The initiative by the Ministry of Health is a very welcome development in the sense that it is at least demonstrating that they are both embracing traditional methods of surveillance and disease detection plus at the same time, they are looking at other innovative ways of disease detection,' he said. Through the collaboration, Boston-based Gingko Bioworks will work with the Ministry of Health to collect and monitor travelers’ samples. Nasal swabs will be used to collect the samples. Nyanga said testing will be done on a voluntary, anonymous basis. 'Although participation in this initiative is entirely voluntary, travelers are encouraged to participate because this early detection of pathogens is meant to safeguard the health of all citizens, visitors and residents of this country,' he said. 'The samples collected will be kept anonymous. The data collected from the samples will be vital in strengthening the country's robust health system and response to public health threats and emergencies.' But Mazwiduma said voluntary participation in the pathogen-monitoring program could hinder effective disease detection. 'Perhaps if non-invasive, non-intrusive, the technique should be compulsory because it ensures that the number of people who comply to sample acquisition is increased and, therefore, you can actually rapidly achieve suitable sample sizes for you to be able to ensure that you do not miss any patients, but also more importantly that it allows you to improve your validation of these particular technologies,' Mazwiduma said. Botswana and Gingko Bioworks previously collaborated in a 2022 pathogen-monitoring program to detect new and emerging COVID-19 variants. During the same year, Botswana was credited with the discovery of COVID-19 variant omicron.	https://www.voanews.com/a/botswana-us-firm-partner-to-conduct-border-pathogen-monitoring/7781207.html	2024-09-11T23:38:23-07:00

Philippines stands firm on Sabina Shoal but looks to ease tension with China	MANILA/BEIJING, — The Philippines will stick to its position on Sabina Shoal, it said on Thursday, even while exploring ways to ease tension in the area during 'frank and candid' talks with China on managing disputes in the key waterway of the South China Sea. The Southeast Asian nation's sustained presence at the feature, aiming to monitor what it suspects to be China's small-scale reclamation activities has angered Beijing, turning the shoal into their latest flashpoint in the contested waters. During Wednesday's meeting of officials in Beijing, China vowed to 'firmly uphold its sovereignty' and reiterated a demand for the immediate withdrawal of a Philippine coast guard ship anchored at the shoal since April. 'I reaffirmed the Philippines' consistent position and explored ways to lower the tension,' Philippine Foreign Affairs Undersecretary Theresa Lazaro said on X, posting a picture of her handshake with Chinese Vice Foreign Minister Chen Xiaodong. 'We agreed to continue discussions on areas of co-operation, especially on hotline mechanism, coastguard cooperation, and marine scientific and technological co-operation.' The two had a frank and candid exchange of views, the Philipine foreign ministry said in its statement. The Sabina Shoal, which China refers to as Xianbin Reef, and Manila as Escoda Shoal, lies 150 km west of the Philippine province of Palawan, well within its exclusive economic zone. The two nations have traded accusations of intentional ramming of each others' vessels in a series of clashes last month, just after reaching a pact on resupply missions to a beached Filipino naval ship in the Second Thomas Shoal. China claims sovereignty over most of the China Sea, overlapping into maritime zones of Brunei, Indonesia, Malaysia, the Philippines and Vietnam. In 2016 the Hague arbitration tribunal voided China's expansive and historical claims, a decision Beijing rejects. The Philippine navy has said it has recently monitored 207 Chinese vessels, including 'maritime militia boats' within the country's EEZ, with dozens observed near Sabina Shoal.	https://www.voanews.com/a/philippines-stands-firm-on-sabina-shoal-but-looks-to-ease-tension-with-china/7781199.html	2024-09-11T22:26:14-07:00	
Blinken to discuss support for Ukraine in visit to Poland	WARSAW, Poland — U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken will meet with senior Polish government officials on Thursday to discuss support for Ukraine in its fight against Russia and deepening U.S. defense cooperation with Warsaw. Washington's top diplomat travels to NATO ally Poland following a visit to Kyiv on Wednesday, where he heard Ukrainian officials' appeals to be allowed to fire Western-supplied missiles deep into Russian territory. Blinken is scheduled to meet with Polish Prime Minister Donald Tusk, President Andrzej Duda and Foreign Minister Radoslaw Sikorski, according to their offices. More than 2-1/2 years since Russia's invasion began, Ukrainian forces are being pressured on the battlefield by a better armed and bigger foe, as they try to fend off Russian gains in the east where Moscow is focusing its attacks. In a bid to regain some of the initiative and divert Russian forces, Kyiv last month sent troops into Russia's Kursk region, but progress has stalled. The security of Poland's eastern flank will also feature in the discussions with Blinken, said Mieszko Pawlak, head of the international policy bureau at Duda's office. Russia's invasion of Ukraine has made defense a top priority for eastern members of the NATO alliance, and Poland has sought to strengthen the borders it shares with Belarus and Russia. Relations between Poland and Russia have deteriorated sharply since Moscow sent tens of thousands of troops into neighboring Ukraine on February 24, 2022. Warsaw has ramped up defense spending in response and expects record defense spending in 2025 of $47.95 billion. Deepening energy cooperation is also expected to be a topic of discussion while Blinken is in Warsaw, the State Department said on Tuesday. Pawlak said cooperation on civilian nuclear energy including building the first Polish nuclear power plant would be on the agenda.	https://www.voanews.com/a/blinken-to-discuss-support-for-ukraine-in-visit-to-poland/7781188.html	2024-09-11T21:51:25-07:00	
US supports two permanent UN Security Council seats for Africa	UNITED NATIONS — The United States supports creating two permanent United Nations Security Council seats for African states and one seat to be rotated among small island developing states, U.S. Ambassador to the U.N. Linda Thomas-Greenfield will announce on Thursday. The move comes as the U.S. seeks to repair ties with Africa, where many are unhappy about Washington's support for Israel's war in Gaza, and deepen relations with Pacific Islands nations important to countering Chinese influence in the region. Thomas-Greenfield told Reuters she hopes the announcement will 'move this agenda forward in a way that we can achieve Security Council reform at some point in the future,' describing it as part of U.S. President Joe Biden's legacy. The push for two permanent African seats and a rotating seat for small island developing states is in addition to Washington's long-held support for India, Japan and Germany to also get permanent seats on the council. Developing nations have long demanded permanent seats on the Security Council, the most powerful body in the United Nations. But years of talks on reform have proved fruitless and it is unclear whether U.S. support could fuel action. Ahead of making the announcement at the Council on Foreign Relations in New York on Thursday, Thomas-Greenfield clarified to Reuters that Washington does not support expanding veto power beyond the five countries that hold it. The Security Council is charged with maintaining international peace and security and has the power to impose sanctions and arms embargos and authorize the use of force. When the U.N. was founded in 1945, the Security Council had 11 members. This increased in 1965 to 15 members, made up of 10 elected states serving two-year terms and five permanent veto-wielding nations: Russia, China, France, the U.S. and Britain. Legitimacy problem U.N. Secretary-General Antonio Guterres backs Security Council reform. 'You have a Security Council that corresponds exactly to the situation after the Second World War ... that has a problem of legitimacy, and that has a problem of effectiveness, and it needs to be reformed,' Guterres told Reuters on Wednesday. Any change to the Security Council membership is done by amending the founding U.N. Charter. This needs the approval and ratification by two-thirds of the General Assembly, including the Security Council's current five veto powers. The 193-member U.N. General Assembly has annually discussed reform of the Security Council for more than a decade. But momentum has grown in recent years as geopolitical rivalries have deadlocked the council on several issues, particularly after permanent veto-wielding member Russia invaded Ukraine. 'Much of the conversation around Security Council reform has been just that: a conversation,' Thomas-Greenfield will say on Thursday, according to prepared remarks reviewed by Reuters of her announcement that Washington supports moving to negotiations on a draft text to amend the U.N. Charter to expand the council. Thomas-Greenfield told Reuters she could not say how long it might take to get the General Assembly to vote on such a resolution. Each year the General Assembly elects five new members from different geographical groups for two-year terms on the Security Council. Africa currently has three seats rotated among states. 'The problem is, these non-permanent seats don't enable African countries to deliver the full benefit of their knowledge and voices to the work of the council ... to consistently lead on the challenges that affect all of us - and disproportionately affect Africans,' Thomas-Greenfield will say. She will also say that small island developing states deserve a rotating elected seat because they offer 'critical insights on a range of international peace and security issues: including, notably, the impact of climate change.'	https://www.voanews.com/a/us-supports-two-permanent-un-security-council-seats-for-africa/7781186.html	2024-09-11T21:43:47-07:00

China ramping up transnational repression, Uyghur exiles in US say	washington — Many exiled Uyghurs in the U.S. say China has ramped up transnational repression against them, using their relatives who still live in China to threaten them into silence abroad. 'I’ve been targeted online with fake accounts. … Chinese trolls even registered for a webinar using fake emails and posted my home address, saying, ‘We are watching you,’ ' Elfidar Iltebir, president of the Uyghur American Association, a rights group, told VOA last week in a phone interview. The harassment prompted her to increase her home security. Iltebir said the repression has intensified, especially over the past two years. 'People are afraid to come out and advocate, fearing for their families’ safety,' she said. From 2017 to 2020, she said, nearly every Uyghur American had at least one family member detained in Xinjiang, spurring many to activism. But as China increased pressure on these exiles, many of them are thinking twice about their activist work. She described a climate of fear within her organization. 'Some of our supporters now ask if they can help behind the scenes, afraid to be seen publicly,' Iltebir said. Chinese agents, sending messages through Uyghur relatives in Xinjiang, 'tell us not to attend political or cultural events, not to join any organizations, to stay away from activists. 'They even dictate who to invite to weddings. I’ve seen community members receive these orders.' VOA reached out to the Chinese Embassy in Washington for comment on the allegations of transnational repression targeting Uyghur Americans. The embassy did not respond to multiple inquiries. However, the FBI says it is aware of such activity targeting Uyghurs and other ethnic minority groups in the United States. 'Tactics and patterns morph with advancements in technology,' the federal police agency said in a statement to VOA. 'These acts – often identified as transnational repression (TNR) – represent severe violations of international norms, U.S. law, and individual rights and freedoms. TNR conducted by any government, against any person including Uyghur Americans, is unacceptable.' The agency says it has worked to raise awareness of the problem among state, local and university law enforcement partners and has conducted training to help vulnerable communities recognize repressive tactics and examples of transnational harassment. It also provides resources in 60 languages, including in Uyghur. Iltebir detailed her organization’s work with the FBI to support the estimated 10,000 to 15,000 Uyghur Americans in combating China’s transnational repression. China, Uyghurs and human rights Uyghurs are a largely Muslim minority group. Approximately 12 million Uyghurs live in China's northwestern Xinjiang Uyghur Autonomous Region, where accusations of mass detention, forced labor and other human rights abuses have drawn global attention and condemnation. In recent years, the U.S., U.N., European Parliament and rights organizations have condemned China or its policies in the Uyghur region. Some have accused Bejing of committing genocide and crimes against humanity. Allegations include the arbitrary mass imprisonment of Uyghurs and other Muslim and Turkic groups, forced labor, forced sterilization, family separation and other abuses. China denies any wrongdoing in the region, labeling the targeted Uyghurs as extremists, terrorists and separatists and justifying its policies as necessary measures to combat terrorism and separatism. Fear and anonymity Fear often keeps exiles from speaking out or enabling the media to confirm accusations. One such U.S.-based Uyghur rights activist is a man who came to the U.S. for his education. He spoke to VOA on the condition of anonymity, fearing retaliation and increased harassment of his family members in Xinjiang. In 2017, he said, his sibling and extended family were arbitrarily detained in Xinjiang. 'The only thing I was obsessed with was my academic work,' he said, but the detentions forced him into activism. After joining a Washington-based rights group advocating for human rights in China, including the Uyghurs, in 2019, he began receiving intimidating social media messages from Chinese authorities. 'I started receiving all sorts of intimidation from [Chinese] police through WhatsApp and other social media platforms,' he recalled. 'They even invited me to a third country to meet them there. I never agreed.' Despite the evolving nature of these tactics, he said, the harassment has never ceased. 'I have submitted details of these incidents to the FBI at least 15 times in the past and provided them with all the details of the communications I've received over the past few years,' he said. But ultimately, he said, the FBI can do nothing because the harassers are based outside the U.S. However, the agency has taken legal action against China’s transnational repression schemes in the U.S. In a case last month, Wang Shujun of New York was found guilty of acting as a covert Chinese agent. The FBI said he supported transnational repression by posing as a member of a pro-democracy group while feeding Beijing information about its members. Political response 'Chinese Communist agents should not be able to threaten and intimidate American residents without consequences, anywhere — especially and including here in the United States,' said Republican U.S. Representative Chris Smith, chairman of the Congressional-Executive Commission on China, in an email to VOA on Tuesday. Smith emphasized that while the FBI has made efforts, 'more can and must be done to stop transnational repression and abuse.' According to the FBI, China has long targeted diaspora communities, particularly what China describes as the 'five poisons' - groups seen as threats to Chinese Communist Party rule, including Uyghurs, Tibetans, democracy activists, Falun Gong practitioners and Taiwanese independence advocates. 'The PRC has used proxies, including private investigators, to harass dissidents in the U.S.,' the FBI told VOA. Despite the challenges, Iltebir remains determined to speak out. 'We cannot be silenced. If we don’t speak out, who will? Seeing non-Uyghurs stand with us inspires me to continue this fight for freedom, justice and human rights,' she said. Yihua Lee of VOA's Mandarin Service contributed to this report.	https://www.voanews.com/a/china-ramping-up-transnational-repression-uyghur-exiles-in-us-say-/7781143.html	2024-09-11T19:09:31-07:00	
US grants Egypt $1.3 billion in military aid, overriding rights conditions	washington — The Biden administration is overriding human rights conditions on military aid to Egypt, a State Department spokesperson said on Wednesday, granting the U.S. ally its full allocation of $1.3 billion this year for the first time during this administration, despite ongoing concerns over human rights in the country. The announcement comes as Washington has relied heavily on Cairo, a longstanding U.S. ally, to mediate so far unsuccessful talks between Israel and Hamas on a cease-fire deal to end the war in Gaza. Of the $1.3 billion in U.S. foreign military financing allocated to Egypt, $320 million is subject to conditions that have meant at least some of that sum has been withheld in recent years. Secretary of State Antony Blinken told Congress on Wednesday that he would waive a certification requirement on $225 million related to Egypt's human rights record this year, citing 'the U.S. national security interest,' the spokesperson said by email. 'This decision is important to advancing regional peace and Egypt’s specific and ongoing contributions to U.S. national security priorities, particularly to finalize a cease-fire agreement for Gaza, bring the hostages home, surge humanitarian assistance for Palestinians in need, and help bring an enduring end to the Israel-Hamas conflict,' the spokesperson said. Democrat Chris Murphy, who chairs the Senate Foreign Relations Committee's Middle East subcommittee, said Washington had previously withheld military aid from Egypt on human rights grounds while maintaining its strategic relationship with the country. 'It's no secret that Egypt remains a deeply repressive autocratic state, and I see no good reason to ignore that fact by waiving these requirements,' Murphy said. Cairo has remained a close regional ally of Washington despite accusations of widespread abuses under President Abdel Fattah el-Sissi's government, including torture and enforced disappearances. Sissi denies there are political prisoners in Egypt. He says stability and security are paramount and authorities are promoting rights by trying to provide basic needs such as jobs and housing. The war in Gaza, sparked by the October 7 attacks by Palestinian militants on southern Israel, has increased Washington's reliance on Cairo for diplomatic efforts like the cease-fire talks. Much-needed humanitarian aid for Palestinians in Gaza also enters from Egypt. Blinken issued a similar waiver on the human rights conditions last year but withheld a portion of the military aid over Egypt's failure to make 'clear and consistent progress' on the release of political prisoners. This year, he determined that Egypt had made sufficient efforts on political prisoners to release $95 million tied to progress on the issue, the spokesperson said. They cited Egypt's efforts to draft legislation to reform pretrial detention and the broader penal code, its release of some political prisoners and a move to end travel bans and asset freezes associated with foreign funding for nongovernmental organizations. Seth Binder, director of advocacy for the Washington-based Middle East Democracy Center, said that while about 970 prisoners had been released since last September, at least 2,278 Egyptians were arbitrarily arrested over the same period, according to data collected by the center and Egyptian human rights groups. The State Department spokesperson said Washington was continuing 'a rigorous dialogue with the Egyptian government on the importance of concrete human rights improvements that are crucial to sustaining the strongest possible U.S.-Egypt partnership.'	https://www.voanews.com/a/us-grants-egypt-1-3-billion-in-military-aid-overriding-rights-conditions/7781141.html	2024-09-11T18:44:23-07:00	
Peru's Fujimori, divisive head of political dynasty, dies at 86	lima, peru — Former Peruvian President Alberto Fujimori, who steered economic growth during the 1990s but was later jailed for human rights abuses stemming from a bloody war against Maoist rebels, died Wednesday. He was 86. Close colleagues visited him earlier in the day, reporting that he was in critical condition. 'After a long battle with cancer, our father ... has just departed to meet the Lord,' his daughter Keiko Fujimori wrote in a message on X, signed by the former leader's other children. Fujimori, the son of Japanese immigrants, was the little-known chancellor of a farming university when elected to office in 1990. He quickly established himself as a cunning politician whose hands-on style produced results even as he angered critics for concentrating power. He slayed hyperinflation that had thrown millions of Peruvians out of work, privatized dozens of state-run companies, and slashed trade tariffs, setting the foundations for Peru to become, for a while, one of Latin America's most stable economies. Under his watch, the feared leader of the Maoist Shining Path, Abimael Guzman, was captured, dealing a crucial blow to a movement that in the 1980s seemed close to toppling the Peruvian state. Guzman died in prison in September 2021. But many Peruvians saw Fujimori as an autocrat after he used military tanks to shut down Congress in 1992, redrafting the constitution to his liking to push free-market reforms and tough anti-terrorism laws. A slew of corruption scandals during his 10-year administration also turned public opinion against him. Shortly after he won a third election in 2000 — amending the constitution to run — videos emerged of his top adviser and spy chief Vladimiro Montesinos doling out cash to bribe politicians. Fujimori fled to exile in Japan. He resigned via fax from Tokyo and then unsuccessfully campaigned for a Japanese senatorial seat. Montesinos was later captured in Venezuela and jailed, convicted by the hundreds of videos he recorded of himself handing out cash bribes to politicians and business and media executives. The cases against Fujimori piled up, including accusations that he had ordered the use of death squads in his battle against Shining Path militants. Fujimori was safe in Japan — he was a dual citizen, and Japan does not extradite its citizens. So many were shocked when in 2005 he decided to return to Peru, apparently in hopes of forgiveness and a return to politics. Instead, he was detained during a layover in Chile, extradited to Peru in 2007, and in 2009 he was convicted and sentenced to 25 years in prison. Once jailed, Fujimori's public appearances were limited to hospital visits where he often appeared disheveled and unwell. While detractors dismissed his health complaints as a ploy to get out of prison, then-President Pedro Pablo Kuczynski briefly pardoned Fujimori in 2017. Months later Kuczynski was impeached, and the pardon overturned by Peru's top constitutional court, sending Fujimori back to the special prison that held him and no other inmates. The court restored the pardon in December 2023, releasing the ailing Fujimori, who had suffered from stomach ulcers, hypertension and tongue cancer. In May 2024, Fujimori announced he had been diagnosed with a malignant tumor. Fujimori's legacy has been most passionately defended by his daughter Keiko, who has been close to clinching the presidency herself three times on a platform that has included pardoning her father and defending his constitution. The late Fujimori was born in Lima on Peruvian Independence Day, July 28, 1938. A mathematician and agricultural engineer, Fujimori was a political nobody when he decided to run for the presidency, driving a tractor to his campaign rallies. He surprised the world by defeating renowned writer Mario Vargas Llosa in the 1990 election, with heavy support from the left. He touted himself as an alternative to the country's white elite and gained crucial support from Peru's large Indigenous and mixed-race populations. As Peru battled what was among the world's worst hyperinflation, Fujimori promised not to carry out drastic measures to tame it. But in his second week in office, he suddenly lifted the subsidies that kept food essentials affordable, in what became known as the 'Fuji-shock.' 'May God help us,' Fujimori's finance minister said on TV after announcing the measure. Inflation worsened in the short-term, but the bet paid off, eventually stabilizing the economy after over a decade of crisis. Even as support for him started to wane, Fujimori pulled off audacious stunts in his second term. In 1997, he devised a plan to dig tunnels under the Japanese ambassador's residence in Lima to end a four-month hostage crisis after another insurgency, the Tupac Amaru Revolutionary Movement, took 500 people captive for 126 days. In a surprise attack, Fujimori sent in more than 100 commandos in a raid that killed all 14 insurgents. Only two commandos and one of the remaining 72 hostages died. Television footage showed Fujimori calmly stepping over the corpses of the insurgents after the raid.	https://www.voanews.com/a/peru-s-fujimori-divisive-head-of-political-dynasty-dies-at-86/7781135.html	2024-09-11T18:37:16-07:00	
Haitian Americans fear for their safety after Trump repeats false claims about immigrants	WASHINGTON — Haitian Americans said they fear for their safety after Donald Trump repeated a false and derogatory claim during this week's presidential debate about immigrants in Ohio. Haitian community leaders across the U.S. said the Republican candidate's remarks about immigrants eating household pets during his debate with Democratic Vice President Kamala Harris could put lives at risk and further inflame tensions in the small city of Springfield, Ohio, where thousands of recent Haitian arrivals have boosted the local economy but also strained the safety net. 'We have to be careful where we go,' said Viles Dorsainvil, 38, who says the Haitian community center he heads in Springfield has received threatening phone calls. The hostility has prompted one friend working at an Amazon warehouse to consider leaving, he said. 'He said that things are getting out of hand now; the way people are treating us, making bad comments about us,' Dorsainvil said. Trump's Tuesday remark that 'they're eating the dogs, the people that came in, they're eating the cats' is the latest in a long line of lies about immigrants that have defined his political career. It followed a similar false claim spread by his running mate, U.S. Senator JD Vance of Ohio, on social media about Springfield's new residents. City officials say they have received no credible reports of anybody eating household animals. Karen Graves, a city spokesperson, said she was not aware of recent hate crimes targeting Haitian residents but that some had been victims of 'crimes of opportunity,' such as property theft. The Haitian Times reported that some Haitian families in Springfield, Ohio, were keeping their children home from school, while other sources told the newspaper that they were subject to bullying, assaults and intimidation in front of their homes amid racist rhetoric amplified by social media. The lie fed on frustrations of some in the western Ohio city, who say the 15,000 Haitians who have arrived in recent years to fuel the city's economy, have also stressed limited resources at local schools and health clinics and driven up rents. Tensions have increased since a Haitian driving without an Ohio license struck a school bus in 2023, killing 11-year-old Aiden Clark and injuring 26 other children. 'People are getting really fed up,' city resident Richard Jordan said at a city council meeting on Tuesday. 'Things are going to get ugly.' At that same meeting, Clark's father Nathan Clark criticized Trump and Vance for exploiting his son's death. 'They can vomit all the hate they want about illegal immigrants, the border crisis, and even untrue claims about fluffy pets being ravaged and eaten by community members,' Clark said. 'However, they are not allowed, nor have they ever been allowed, to mention Aiden Clark from Springfield, Ohio.' Last month, a white supremacist was ejected from a city council meeting after he made threatening statements towards Haitian immigrants. 'My heart fell' Ahead of the debate, billionaire Elon Musk amplified the lie further on his X social media platform, as did Republicans on the House of Representatives Judiciary Committee. Guerline Jozef, who heads the national advocacy group Haitian Bridge Alliance, said her group had been trying to knock down the rumor before the debate. When Trump mentioned it, 'my heart fell to the floor,' she said. 'This has become a nationwide lie that people everywhere are repeating.' For Taisha Saintil, now an analyst with the immigrant advocacy group UndocuBlack Network, said Trump's remark brought back painful memories of being taunted when she arrived at a Florida elementary school in 2006. Some 1.1 million Haitian Americans live in the U.S., about half of whom are immigrants, according to the Census Bureau. Long established in Florida and New York, Haitian immigrants have recently been moving to states like North Carolina and California to pursue work, Jozef said. Seeking work Springfield officials say the majority of Haitian migrants are in the country legally, drawn by jobs at warehouses and factories. They have opened two restaurants and seven groceries, according to a city fact sheet. 'While we are experiencing challenges related to the rapid growth of our immigrant population, these challenges are primarily due to the pace of the growth,' city manager Bryan Heck said in a video on Wednesday. Ohio Governor Mike DeWine, a Republican, said on Tuesday the state is providing $2.5 million to help the new residents get vaccines and other health services, and state police are being brought in to help enforce traffic laws. He said President Joe Biden's administration should also provide aid to cities like Springfield that see a sudden increase in new migrants. Trump's comments could energize his supporters to help him win over undecided voters, particularly aggrieved white voters who feel a sense of their own decline in this country, said Republican strategist Mike Madrid, founder of the anti-Trump Lincoln Project. 'The attempts to dehumanize people is a long-proven strategy to work at a time when society's undergoing change,' he said. But that strategy risks spurring violence, Haitian American leaders said. Democratic Representative Sheila Cherfilus-McCormick, the only Haitian-American in Congress, said Trump's rhetoric endangers Haitians across the country. 'We've heard these stereotypes for years about Haitian people, Black immigrants, doing all these things that we know aren't true,' she said. Gepsie Metellus, who heads the Sant La Haitian neighborhood center in North Miami, said Trump's comment was viewed as a 'cheap political shot' in her community, but directly endangers those in Springfield. 'This rhetoric has a way of turning out really badly,' she said.	https://www.voanews.com/a/haitian-americans-fear-for-their-safety-after-trump-repeats-false-claims-about-immigrants/7781117.html	2024-09-11T18:11:50-07:00

DACA case faces uncertainty again as US appellate court arguments loom	washington — The future of the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals (DACA) program remains in limbo with another court hearing set for October 10. Judges from the 5th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals will hear arguments on the case, initiated in 2018 by Texas and other Republican-led states seeking to end DACA. The program offers temporary protection from deportation and work permits to undocumented immigrants brought to the U.S. as children who are often referred to as 'Dreamers.' The case centers on whether DACA exceeds presidential authority, immigration advocates from the coalition 'Home is Here' said during a recent conversation with reporters. 'Our response to that is that presidential authority in the area of immigration, and particularly the discretion exercised by the executive branch, is very broad and certainly encompasses the type of program that DACA is, which is now a regulation,' Nina Perales, vice president of litigation at the Mexican American Legal Defense and Educational Fund, said during the call. A central issue in the case is whether Texas and other states have the standing to sue. Texas and other Republican-led states have argued that DACA has harmed them financially because they are spending resources on education, health care and other services on undocumented immigrants who were allowed to remain in the country illegally. But Perales, who will be one of the attorneys arguing the case in October, said that 'Texas cannot show any injury as a result of DACA' because recipients contribute to their communities and states by paying taxes and more. A final decision could take a while, said Perales, who noted the 5th Circuit could take 'as long as 18 months' to rule. And the case could end in several ways: The 5th Circuit might dismiss the case, send it back to the lower court or rule against DACA, which could then be appealed to the U.S. Supreme Court. 'One possible scenario is that the 5th Circuit decides [U.S. District] Judge [Andrew] Hanen didn't evaluate the evidence properly and sends the case back to [him],' she said. If that happens, Perales said, DACA recipients might benefit from the current case's legal state, which allows recipients to continue renewing their DACA benefits while awaiting the courts' final resolution. The Biden administration continues to accept new applications but does not process them. How we got here Former President Barack Obama, frustrated with congressional inaction on the Dream Act, created DACA by executive order in 2012. Some DACA recipients arrived legally, but their families later overstayed their visas; others arrived by crossing the U.S.-Mexico border without authorization. They are now in their mid-20s to late 30s, and they come from around the world. In 2018, Texas and other Republican-led states sued the federal government, arguing not only that they were being harmed financially but also that only Congress has the authority to grant immigration benefits. In 2022, the Biden administration revised the program in hopes of satisfying one of the arguments made in federal courts by Republican-led states — that the program was not created properly. Biden officials issued the new version of DACA in late August. It went through a period of public comments as part of a formal rule-making process to increase its odds of surviving this legal battle. In a February 2023 statement, Texas Attorney General Ken Paxton, a Republican, wrote in a statement on his website that 'the Obama and Biden programs are practically indistinguishable in both the negative harms that they will have on this country and in the illegal means used to implement them. I am therefore calling for the new DACA rule to end in the same way that the Obama-era rule did: struck down as unlawful.' But DACA has support. In October 2022, a coalition of dozens of influential corporations, including Apple, Amazon, Google and Microsoft, sent a letter to Republicans and Democrats in Congress urging a bipartisan solution for the almost 600,000 immigrants who are enrolled in DACA. According to the Migration Policy Institute, DACA has 'improved recipients' employment outcomes, increased the labor force participation rates of those who are eligible, decreased their unemployment rates, and boosted earnings for those with the lowest incomes.' MPI's analysis shows that DACA holders contribute 'nearly $42 billion to the U.S. gross domestic product each year and add $3.4 billion to the federal balance sheet.' Bruna Bouhid-Sollod, a former DACA recipient and current senior political director at United We Dream, highlighted the emotional impact of the uncertainty. 'The importance of making [the impact] really clear is really important. … DACA recipients and their families are dealing with an extreme amount of stress,' she said. With renewal periods lasting just two years, many recipients are in constant limbo, unsure if their work permits and deportation protections will remain intact. There is a lot at stake, according to immigration lawyers and advocates. 'Unless you're living in it … you don't think about the impact it has on the people that are waiting for their lives to be decided by this case,' Bouhid-Sollod said.	https://www.voanews.com/a/daca-case-faces-uncertainty-again-as-us-appellate-court-arguments-loom/7780772.html	2024-09-11T17:39:28-07:00	
North Korea fires ballistic missile toward sea, South Korea says	SEOUL, South Korea — North Korea fired a ballistic missile toward the sea Thursday morning, South Korea's military said, days after North Korean leader Kim Jong Un vowed to put his nuclear force fully ready for battle with its rivals. South Korea's Joint Chiefs of Staff said in a brief statement that the launch took place off North Korea's eastern coast but gave no details, such as how far the weapon traveled. Japan's prime minister's office also alerted on its X account that North Korea had launched a suspected ballistic missile, but it did not provide details. The launch was North Korea's first public weapons firing in more than two months. On July 1, North Korea claimed to have tested a new tactical weapon capable of delivering a 'super-large' 4.5 ton-class warhead. In a speech Monday, Kim said he would redouble efforts to make his nuclear force fully ready for combat with the United States and its allies. He said North Korea faced 'a grave threat' because of what he called 'the reckless expansion' of a U.S.-led regional military bloc that is now developing into a nuclear-based one. Kim has made similar vows numerous times, but his latest threat came as outside experts believe North Korea will perform a nuclear test explosion or long-range missile test-launches ahead of the U.S. presidential election in November. Last week, North Korea also resumed launches of trash-carrying balloons toward South Korea. Since 2022, North Korea has significantly accelerated its weapons testing in a bid to perfect its capabilities to launch strikes on the U.S. and South Korea. The U.S. and South Korea have responded by expanding military drills that North Korea calls invasion rehearsals. Last month, Kim had held off from missile tests or other provocative military demonstrations as the United States and South Korea conducted large-scale summertime military exercises. North Korea issued statements berating the allies for raising tensions.	https://www.voanews.com/a/north-korea-fires-ballistic-missile-toward-sea-south-korea-says/7781097.html	2024-09-11T17:25:48-07:00	
Trump falsely accuses immigrants in Ohio of abducting, eating pets	COLUMBUS, Ohio — Former President Donald Trump on Tuesday amplified false rumors that Haitian immigrants in Ohio were abducting and eating pets, repeating during a televised debate the type of inflammatory and anti-immigrant rhetoric he has promoted throughout his campaigns. There is no evidence that Haitian immigrants in an Ohio community are doing that, officials say. But during the debate with Vice President Kamala Harris, Trump specifically mentioned Springfield, Ohio, the town at the center of the claims, saying that immigrants were taking over the city. 'They're eating the dogs. They're eating the cats. They're eating the pets of the people that live there,' he said. Harris called Trump 'extreme' and laughed after his comment. Debate moderators pointed out that city officials have said the claims are not true. Trump's comments echoed claims made by his campaign, including his running mate, Ohio Senator JD Vance, and other Republicans. The claims attracted attention this week when Vance posted on social media that his office has 'received many inquiries' about Haitian migrants abducting pets. Vance acknowledged Tuesday it was possible 'all of these rumors will turn out to be false.' Officials have said there have been no credible or detailed reports about the claims, even as Trump and his allies use them to amplify racist stereotypes about Black and brown immigrants. While president, Trump questioned why the U.S. would accept people from 's—hole' countries such as Haiti and some in Africa. His 2024 campaign has focused heavily on illegal immigration, often referencing in his speeches crimes committed by migrants. He argues immigrants are responsible for driving up crime and drug abuse in the United States and taking resources from American citizens. Here's a closer look at how the false claims have spread. How did this get started? On September 6, a post surfaced on X that shared what looked like a screengrab of a social media post apparently out of Springfield. The retweeted post talked about the person's 'neighbor's daughter's friend' seeing a cat hanging from a tree to be butchered and eaten, claiming without evidence that Haitians lived at the house. The accompanying photo showed a Black man carrying what appeared to be a Canada goose by its feet. That post continued to be shared on social media. On Monday, Vance posted on X: 'Reports now show that people have had their pets abducted and eaten by people who shouldn't be in this country. Where is our border czar?' he said. The next day, Vance posted again on X about Springfield, saying his office had received inquiries from residents who said 'their neighbors' pets or local wildlife were abducted by Haitian migrants. It's possible, of course, that all of these rumors will turn out to be false.' Other Republicans shared similar posts. Among them was Texas Senator Ted Cruz, who posted a photo of kittens with a caption that said to vote for Trump 'So Haitian immigrants don't eat us.' Hours before Trump's debate with Harris, he posted two related photos on his social media site. One Truth Social post was a photo of Trump surrounded by cats and geese. Another featured armed cats wearing MAGA hats. A billboard campaign launched by the Republican Party of Arizona at 12 sites in metropolitan Phoenix plays off the false rumors. The billboard image resembles a Chick-fil-A ad, portraying four kittens and urging people to 'Vote Republican!' and 'Eat Less Kittens.' Chick-fil-A said the party didn't reach out to the restaurant chain before running the ad, declining to comment further. In a statement, the state party said the ad humorously underscores the need for border security. What do officials in Ohio say? The office of the Springfield city manager, Bryan Heck, issued a statement knocking down the rumors. 'In response to recent rumors alleging criminal activity by the immigrant population in our city, we wish to clarify that there have been no credible reports or specific claims of pets being harmed, injured or abused by individuals within the immigrant community,' Heck's office said in an emailed statement. Springfield police on Monday told the Springfield News-Sun that they had received no reports of stolen or eaten pets. Governor Mike DeWine held a news conference Tuesday to address the influx of Haitian immigrants to Springfield. He said he will send state troopers to Springfield to help local law enforcement deal with traffic issues and is earmarking $2.5 million over two years to provide more primary health care to immigrant families. DeWine declined to address the allegations, deferring comment to local officials. But he repeatedly spoke in support of the people of Haiti, where his family has long operated a charity. What do we know about a separate case 281 km away? An entirely unrelated incident that occurred last month in Canton, Ohio, quickly and erroneously conflated into the discussion. On Aug. 26, Canton police charged a 27-year-old woman with animal cruelty and disorderly conduct after she 'did torture, kill, and eat a cat in a residential area in front (of) multiple people,' according to a police report. But Allexis Ferrell is not Haitian. She was born in Ohio and graduated from Canton's McKinley High School in 2015, according to public records and newspaper reports. Court records show she has been in and out of trouble with the law since at least 2017. Messages seeking comment were not returned by several attorneys who have represented her. She is being held in Stark County jail pending a competency hearing next month, according to the prosecutor's office. What do advocates for Haitian immigrants say? The posts create a false narrative and could be dangerous for Haitians in the United States, according to Guerline Jozef, founder and executive director of the Haitian Bridge Alliance, a group that supports and advocates for immigrants of African descent 'We are always at the receiving end of all kind of barbaric, inhumane narratives and treatments, specifically when it comes to immigration,' Jozef said in a phone interview. Her comments echoed White House national security spokesman John Kirby. 'There will be people that believe it, no matter how ludicrous and stupid it is,' Kirby said. 'And they might act on that kind of information, and act on it in a way where somebody could get hurt. So it needs to stop.' What is the broader context of Haitians in Ohio and the United States? Springfield, a city of roughly 60,000, has seen its Haitian population grow in recent years. It's impossible to give an exact number, according to the city, but it estimates Springfield's entire county has an overall immigrant population of 15,000. The city also says that the Haitian immigrants are in the country legally under a federal program that allows for them to remain in the country temporarily. Last month the Biden administration granted eligibility for temporary legal status to about 300,000 Haitians already in the United States because conditions in Haiti are considered unsafe for them to return. Haiti's government has extended a state of emergency to the entire country due to endemic gang violence.	https://www.voanews.com/a/trump-falsely-accuses-immigrants-in-ohio-of-abducting-eating-pets/7781096.html	2024-09-11T17:19:22-07:00	
Threats in Indo-Pacific fuel debate over US nuclear redeployment	washington — Threats from China, Russia and North Korea have fueled debate in Washington about whether the United States should consider redeploying tactical nuclear weapons to the Indo-Pacific region, with leading U.S. Senate members expressing opposing views. Earlier in May, Republican Senator Roger Wicker, ranking member of the Senate Armed Services Committee, put forward a military spending plan that included the idea of redeploying U.S. tactical nuclear arms that were withdrawn from South Korea more than three decades ago. Another Republican, Senator James Risch, who is the ranking member of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, told VOA Korean last month in an email statement that the U.S. should 'explore options for returning nuclear weapons to the Pacific theater for the purpose of strengthening extended deterrence.' The term 'extended deterrence' refers to the U.S. commitment to respond in kind to a nuclear attack on South Korea. Drawing a contrast, Democratic Senator Jack Reed, chairman of the Senate Armed Services Committee, told reporters Monday in a phone conference that he didn't think that U.S. tactical nuclear weapons should be redeployed to the Korean Peninsula, adding that it could provoke a 'major response from the Chinese.' Redeployment of nukes The U.S. government has made it clear that the U.S. does not plan to redeploy its tactical nuclear weapons to the Korean Peninsula. 'We believe that the only effective way to reduce nuclear threats on the peninsula is by curbing the proliferation of nuclear weapons,' a State Department spokesperson said in an emailed statement to VOA last week. In 1991, the U.S. withdrew from South Korea all of its nuclear weapons, or about 100, according to some studies. The U.S. has been closely watching the growing military cooperation among China, Russia and North Korea, especially in the wake of Russia’s invasion of Ukraine. It has identified the three nations as threats to stability in the Indo-Pacific region and beyond. On August 22, the White House confirmed to VOA that a new 'nuclear employment guidance' had been issued. The terms of the classified document are not public, but The New York Times quoted two senior administration officials as saying that it 'seeks to prepare the United States for possible coordinated nuclear challenges from China, Russia and North Korea.' 'The guidance issued earlier this year is not a response to any single entity, country, nor threat,' White House National Security Council spokesman Sean Savett said in an email to VOA. 'We have repeatedly voiced concerns about the advancing nuclear arsenals of Russia, PRC [China] and the DPRK [North Korea].' Vipin Narang, who recently served as the acting assistant secretary of defense for space policy, said in an August forum held by the Washington-based Center for Strategic and International Studies that the United States may need to seek 'a change in the size or posture' of nuclear forces to deal with threats from China, Russia and North Korea. Growing threats In South Korea, there is growing uneasiness about the U.S. capability to protect South Korea from North Korea’s advancing nuclear and missile weapons. North Korea’s state Korean Central News Agency on Sunday released a photo showing the country’s leader, Kim Jong Un, inspecting a new 12-axle transporter erector launcher (TEL), which could be used to launch a new, longer missile to potentially attack the United States. The next day, in a speech celebrating the country’s founding anniversary, Kim vowed to increase the number of nuclear weapons 'exponentially.' Amid these geopolitical tensions, U.S.-based experts appear to be divided about whether the U.S. should redeploy tactical nuclear weapons to the Korean Peninsula. Richard Lawless, former deputy undersecretary of defense for Asian and Pacific security, said the idea that South Korea would be intimidated by China, Russia or South Korea from even beginning a discussion on the subject with Washington 'is failed logic.' 'Many Americans continue to fail to appreciate the threat of North Korea and China, typically playing down the latter.' Robert Peters, a research fellow for nuclear deterrence and missile defense at the Heritage Foundation, told VOA Korean via email that he supported the deployment of tactical nuclear weapons to South Korea. 'I’m concerned about the credibility of our deterrent in the face of North Korean nuclear expansion and Chinese nuclear breakout,' Peters said, adding that stationing nonstrategic nuclear weapons within the theater gives the U.S. president 'far more optionality when crafting a deterrence message during times of acute crisis or conflict than if he or she could rely solely on strategic nuclear weapons.' Opposing views But Bruce Klingner, a senior research fellow for Northeast Asia at the Heritage Foundation, said he was against redeploying U.S. tactical nuclear weapons. 'Placing such high-value weapons in a static, fixed bunker makes a very tempting preemptive target for North Korea,' Klingner told VOA Korean on Tuesday via email. 'During a crisis, it could even lower deterrence by making Pyongyang more likely to initiate a preemptive attack on the bunker prior to the weapons being deployed on mobile launch platforms.' Gary Samore, former White House coordinator for arms control and weapons of mass destruction during the Obama administration, said he didn't support the redeployment of U.S. nuclear weapons to South Korea. 'From a strictly military standpoint, the U.S. can enforce extended deterrence with nuclear-armed submarines and long-range bombers that North Korea cannot defend against,' Samore told VOA Korean on Tuesday via email. 'Politically, redeployment of U.S. nuclear weapons in South Korea would be controversial with some Korean political parties and the Korean public and would increase tensions in the region, especially with China and North Korea, and even between South Korea and Japan,' Samore said. Sydney Seiler, who until last year was the national intelligence officer for North Korea on the U.S. National Intelligence Council, told VOA Korean via email Tuesday that 'there is a consensus among [U.S. and South Korean] leaders and their senior national security advisers that such a redeployment is unnecessary at this time.' The Chinese Embassy in Washington told VOA in an email Tuesday that the Chinese 'firmly oppose any country’s attempt to use the Korean Peninsula nuclear issue to harm China’s strategic security interests.' 'It is hoped that the U.S. can abandon the cold war mentality and hegemonic logic, adopt a rational and responsible nuclear policy, stop nuclear sharing, extended deterrence, expanding nuclear alliance, and other negative moves, and play a constructive role in maintaining regional and global peace and stability,' Chinese Embassy spokesperson Liu Pengyu said Tuesday in a written statement via email, responding to an inquiry from VOA Korean.	https://www.voanews.com/a/threats-in-indo-pacific-fuel-debate-over-us-nuclear-redeployment/7780765.html	2024-09-11T16:57:29-07:00

US pledges support for Africa's AI goals	Abuja, Nigeria — The two-day pan-African AI conference co-hosted by the United States concluded Wednesday in Lagos, Nigeria's commercial hub. Hundreds of delegates including public officials, tech leaders, policy makers academics and entrepreneurs attended the conference to hold talks about the development and use of safe, secure and trustworthy AI systems in Africa. The U.S. deputy secretary of state, Kurt Campbell, spoke at the summit about the opportunity at hand. 'A global technology revolution is well under way — the race to develop and deploy new technologies, including artificial intelligence, is already shaping everything about our lives,' said Campbell. 'We aim to foster collaborations between the United States and Africa AI researchers, policy makers and industry leaders, so that we can work together to drive innovation and address common challenges. This will enable us to share the benefits of AI globally.' The conference is a significant step in Africa's technological future. Campbell said artificial intelligence can be used to address problems like global health, food security, education, energy and climate change, and asserted the conference has provided the ground for African voices in AI to shape emerging global AI systems. 'I cannot overstate Africa's growing importance in the global technology landscape,' said Campbell. 'By developing human capital and strengthening research and innovation ecosystems and building and AI ready institutional and regulatory environment, we can help AI work for Africa. The African Union's landmark AI strategy sets the roadmap for African countries to harness AI's potential to achieve developmental aspirations in education, health, agriculture, infrastructure, peace and security and good governance.' In July, the African Union launched the continent's Artificial Intelligence Strategy, saying AI is pivotal in transforming Africa into a global technology hub, and it called on member states to adopt the strategy. On Tuesday, Nigeria's minister of communication, innovation and digital economy, Bosun Tijani, announced a $61,000 grant for Nigeria's brightest AI startups. 'For us to truly harness artificial intelligence for our collective benefits, we must be deliberate and collaborative in our approach,' said Tijani. 'We just ensure that our digital transformation journey is inclusive, equitable and human focused.' Africa currently represents 2.5% of the global AI market, according to the Artificial Intelligence for Development Africa, or AI4D. But analysts say with more talks about safe use, AI applications could boost Africa's economy by $2.9 trillion by the year 2030 with Kenya, South Africa and Nigerian markets taking the lead.	https://www.voanews.com/a/us-pledges-support-for-africa-s-ai-goals/7780639.html	2024-09-11T14:10:15-07:00	
International arms embargo on Darfur renewed as fighting rages	United Nations — The U.N. Security Council unanimously renewed for another year an arms embargo on parties in the Darfur region of Sudan, where the war between rival generals has intensified in recent months, exacerbating a dire humanitarian crisis. Sudan’s envoy welcomed the extension but urged the council to go further and sanction the entire Rapid Support Forces militia, the rival of the government-backed Sudanese Armed Forces. 'The militia, in its entirety, really needs to be listed, because it fulfills all the conditions,' Ambassador Al-Harith Idriss Al-Harith Mohamed said. 'There also needs to be an end to the financing of the militia.' The RSF as it is known, has captured most of Darfur, and a battle has been going on since May over North Darfur’s capital, El Fasher, which is the only Darfuri regional capital not to have fallen to the RSF. Sudan’s military has repeatedly accused the United Arab Emirates of supplying the RSF with arms and ammunition smuggled in through neighboring Chad. The UAE strongly denies the accusations. A report by a United Nations panel of experts earlier this year said there was substance to media reports that cargo planes originating in the UAE capital had landed in eastern Chad with arms, ammunition and medical equipment destined for the paramilitary group. At the meeting, Sudan’s envoy accused the UAE of profiting from his nation’s natural resources, including gold and uranium, and he urged the Security Council to act. 'We are calling for clear measures to be taken against those who seek to sabotage the Sudanese economy — namely businesses and companies whose headquarters are in the UAE,' Mohamed said. 'The repetition of baseless allegations does not make them true,' Emirati Ambassador Mohamed Abushahab told the council. He urged the army, known as the SAF, to show 'political courage' and participate in peace talks to end the war. The SAF sat out U.S.- and Saudi-brokered talks in Geneva in August because the UAE was invited to participate. The United States led the negotiations in the council on the renewal of the Darfur arms embargo, which was first put in place in 2004 during the genocide carried out by Arab Janjaweed fighters against non-Arab ethnic groups in Darfur. Janjaweed fighters make up elements of today's RSF. 'Renewing the sanctions measures will restrict the movement of arms into Darfur and sanction individuals and entities contributing to, or complicit in, destabilizing activities of Sudan,' U.S. envoy Robert Wood said. 'All of this is critical to helping end the escalating conflict, alleviate humanitarian catastrophe and put Sudan back on the path to stability and security.' The U.S. also has proposed that the Security Council sanction two RSF commanders, but their designation remains in limbo after Russia put a hold on it on August 31. Rights groups said the embargo renewal did not go far enough and should include the whole of Sudan. 'The council should correct this failure as soon as possible and expand the arms restrictions to cover all of Sudan, to limit the flow of arms and curb widespread atrocities being committed in the country,' said Human Rights Watch’s Jean-Baptiste Gallopin. Sudan is facing a massive humanitarian crisis as a result of the war between the rival generals that began in April 2023. More than 10 million people have fled their homes in search of safety, and last month, international monitors confirmed famine in North Darfur. Across the country, the United Nations says, 26 million people are in crisis levels of hunger. Human rights violations are also rife. In June, the RSF and SAF were added to an annual U.N. blacklist for perpetrators of grave violations against children. They were named for violations committed last year, including the killing and maiming of children, for attacking schools and hospitals, and in the case of the RSF, for sexual violence and recruiting and using children in their ranks.	https://www.voanews.com/a/international-arms-embargo-on-darfur-renewed-as-fighting-rages/7780603.html	2024-09-11T13:37:39-07:00	
Aflatoxin kills hundreds of dogs in southern Malawi	Blantyre, Malawi — Malawi has recently recorded the sudden deaths of dogs that consumed meals prepared from maize husks contaminated with aflatoxins. Veterinary experts say the country has recorded 450 dog deaths since April, when the first cases were identified in Malawi’s commercial city, Blantyre. Aflatoxins are toxic substances produced by fungi that grow on pet food ingredients like peanuts, corn and other grains. Experts warn that the accumulation of those toxins in an animal’s body can lead to liver damage, blood clotting and, in severe cases, death. Timothy Banda is the veterinary clinic manager at the Blantyre Society for the Protection and Care of Animals, which has been testing the dogs. He told VOA that symptoms include a yellowish tint on the dog‘s skin, hemorrhagic diarrhea or bloody diarrhea, and sometimes vomiting. 'For the past two, three weeks, we haven’t received any death from the problem,' he said. 'But from the time it started somewhere around April up to somewhere around early August, the estimations could be somewhere around 450 dogs so far have died.' He said the aflatoxin contamination was suspected after it was observed that the dogs were not responding to treatment. 'Under normal circumstances, once we started the right treatment, we could get good results, but in this scenario, they were all dying despite whatever treatment was given. Nothing could work out,' Banda said. Banda said the affected dogs were those fed with nsima, a thick porridge prepared from maize or maize husks. Alfred Manda, a resident of Chirimba township, told VOA that he lost three dogs in August. 'The kind of food I mostly give out to my dogs is nsima flour made from leftover maize called madeya,' he said. 'To me, I thought it was a healthy diet. I wish I knew earlier. I could have done things better to save my dogs, but unfortunately this is the sad reality that I have faced.' Health experts warn that aflatoxins can also cause tumors in the livers of animals and humans. But health officials in Malawi, where maize is the staple food, have not reported any human deaths resulting from consuming contaminated maize. In Zambia, media reports indicate over 400 dogs died in July after consuming maize meal contaminated with aflatoxins. Malawi authorities are advising dog owners to switch to alternative foods, such as rice, until the problem is contained.	https://www.voanews.com/a/aflatoxin-kills-hundreds-of-dogs-in-southern-malawi-/7780590.html	2024-09-11T13:27:06-07:00	
Mexico's Senate OKs controversial judicial overhaul after protesters storm chamber	MEXICO CITY — Mexico's Senate voted early Wednesday to overhaul the country's judiciary, clearing the biggest hurdle for a controversial constitutional revision that will make all judges stand for election, a change that critics fear will politicize the judicial branch and threaten Mexico's democracy. The approval came in two votes after hundreds of protesters pushed their way into the Senate on Tuesday, interrupting the session after it appeared that Morena, the governing party of outgoing President Andrés Manuel López Obrador, had lined up the necessary votes to pass the proposal. Judicial employees and law students had protested for weeks, saying the plan, under which all judges would be elected, could threaten judicial independence and undermine the system of checks and balances. The legislation sailed through the lower chamber, where Morena and its allies hold a supermajority, last week. Approval by the Senate posed the biggest obstacle and required defections from opposition parties. Both of the Senate votes were 86-41. The chamber erupted into cheers and chants of 'Yes, we could!' The legislation must now be ratified by the legislatures of at least 17 of Mexico's 32 states. The governing party is believed to have the necessary support after major gains in recent elections. Oaxaca's legislature became the first to ratify it just hours after the Senate's approval. President-elect Claudia Sheinbaum, who takes office October 1, congratulated lawmakers on passing the overhaul. The election of judges 'will strengthen the delivery of justice in our country,' Sheinbaum wrote on the social media platform X. 'The regime of corruption and privileges each day is being left farther in the past and a true democracy and true rule of law are being built.' López Obrador acknowledged Wednesday that many are against the plan, but said that 'it's incredibly important to put an end to corruption and impunity. We're going to make a lot of progress when the people can freely elect judges, magistrates and ministers.' Some experts and observers, however, have suggested that the overhaul could have the opposite effect, and allow corrupt individuals and criminals to have more sway over the justice system. On Tuesday evening, just hours after the governing party appeared to have wrangled the votes it needed, protesters with pipes and chains broke into the Senate chamber. The protesters said lawmakers were not listening to their demands. 'The judiciary isn't going to fall,' yelled the protesters, waving Mexican flags and signs opposing the overhaul. They were joined by a number of opposition senators as they chanted in the chamber. Others outside roared when newscasters announced the Senate was taking a recess. Among them was Alejandro Navarrete, a 30-year-old judicial worker who said he and his colleagues, 'knowing the danger the reform represents,' came to call on the Senate to strike down the proposal. 'They have decided to sell out the nation and sell out for political capital they were offered. We felt obligated to enter the Senate,' he said, carrying a Mexican flag. 'Our intention is not violent, we didn't intend to hurt them, but we intend to make it clear that the Mexican people won't allow them to lead us into a dictatorship.' López Obrador, a populist long averse to independent regulatory bodies who has ignored courts and attacked judges, says the plan would crack down on corruption by making it easier to punish judges. Critics say it would handicap the judiciary, stack courts with judges favoring the president's party, allow anyone with a law degree to become a judge and even make it easier for politicians and criminals to influence courts. It has spooked investors and prompted U.S. Ambassador Ken Salazar to call it a risk to democracy and an economic threat.	https://www.voanews.com/a/mexico-s-senate-oks-controversial-judicial-overhaul-after-protesters-storm-chamber-/7780547.html	2024-09-11T12:43:21-07:00	
Jordan's Islamist party bounces back in election clouded by Gaza war	AMMAN — Jordan's moderate Islamist opposition made significant gains in Tuesday's parliamentary election, initial official results showed on Wednesday, boosted by anger over Israel's war in Gaza. The Islamist Action Front (IAF) also benefited from a new electoral law that encourages a bigger role for political parties in the 138-seat parliament, though tribal and pro-government factions will continue to dominate the assembly. The IAF, the political arm of the Muslim Brotherhood, won up to a fifth of the seats under the revamped electoral law, which for the first time allocated 41 seats for parties, according to preliminary figures seen by Reuters and confirmed by independent and official sources. 'The Jordanian people have given us their trust by voting for us. This new phase will increase the burden of responsibility for the party towards the nation and our citizens,' Wael al Saqqa, head of the IAF, told Reuters. The IAF win allowed it to capture 31 seats for the first time since parliamentary life was revived in 1989 after decades of martial law. The party has emerged as the largest political grouping in parliament. 'The elections reflect the desire for change and those who voted were not necessarily all Islamists but wanting change and had become fed up with the old ways,' said Murad Adailah, the head of the Muslim Brotherhood. The IAF, the only effective grassroots opposition, praised the authorities for not meddling in polls. Adailah told Reuters their win was a 'popular referendum' that backs their platform of support for the militant Palestinian group Hamas, their ideological allies, and their demand to scrap the country's peace treaty with Israel. In a country where anti-Israel sentiment runs high, they have led some of the largest protests in the region in support of Hamas in what their opponents say allowed them to increase their popularity. Hamas has been designated a terror group by the U.S., U.K., EU and others. The election represents a modest step in a democratization process launched by King Abdullah as he seeks to insulate Jordan from the conflicts at its borders and speed up the slow pace of political reforms. Under Jordan's constitution, most powers still rest with the king who appoints governments and can dissolve parliament. The assembly can force a cabinet to resign by a vote of no confidence. The monarch hopes nascent political parties under the new law will help pave the way for governments that emerge from parliamentary majorities. The voting system still favors sparsely populated tribal and provincial regions over the densely populated cities mostly inhabited by Jordanians of Palestinian descent, which are Islamist strongholds and highly politicized. Turnout among Jordan's 5.1 million eligible voters in Tuesday's poll was low at 32.25%, initial official figures showed, up slightly from 29% at the last election in 2020. The Muslim Brotherhood has been allowed to operate in Jordan since 1946. But it fell under suspicion after the Arab Spring, which saw Islamists pitted against established powers in many Arab countries.	https://www.voanews.com/a/jordan-s-islamist-party-bounces-back-in-election-clouded-by-gaza-war-/7780493.html	2024-09-11T12:16:13-07:00	
Soyuz craft heads to space station with 2 Russians, 1 American	MOSCOW — A Soyuz spacecraft carrying two Russians and an American blasted off Wednesday for an express trip to the International Space Station. The space capsule atop a towering rocket set off at 1623 GMT from Russia's manned space launch facility in Baikonur, Kazakhstan, and was scheduled to dock with the space station three hours later, in contrast to some missions that last for days. The mission commander is Alexei Ovchinin, with Russian compatriot Ivan Vagner and American Donald Pettit in the crew. The blast-off took place without obvious problems and the Soyuz entered orbit eight minutes after liftoff, a relief for Russian space authorities after an automated safety system halted a launch in March because of a voltage drop in the power system. On the space station, Pettit, Vagner and Ovchinin will join NASA's Tracy Dyson, Mike Barratt, Matthew Dominick, Jeanette Epps, Butch Wilmore, and Suni Williams, and Russians Nikolai Chub, Alexander Grebenkin, and Oleg Kononenko.	https://www.voanews.com/a/soyuz-craft-heads-to-space-station-with-2-russians-1-american/7780406.html	2024-09-11T11:45:20-07:00

Afghanistan, Turkmenistan begin work on long-delayed gas pipeline	ISLAMABAD — Taliban-ruled Afghanistan and neighboring Turkmenistan on Wednesday marked the resumption of work on a long-delayed gas pipeline designed to run through the two countries, Pakistan and India. The estimated $10 billion Turkmenistan-Afghanistan-Pakistan-India, or TAPI, project is designed to annually transport up to 33 billion cubic meters of Turkmen natural gas from the southeastern Galkynysh field through the proposed 1,800-kilometer pipeline. Prime Minister Mohammad Hassan Akhund of the de facto Taliban government traveled to the Turkmen border region of Mary and joined top leaders of the host country to inaugurate construction of a vital section of the TAPI project. It is intended to link the city of Serhetabat in Turkmenistan to Herat in western Afghanistan. Turkmen President Serdar Berdimuhamedov joined and addressed the ceremony via video link. 'This project will benefit not only the economies of the participating countries but also the entire region,' he said. Taliban authorities declared a public holiday in Herat, the capital of the province of the same name, to mark the occasion, with posters celebrating the TAPI project plastered across the border city. Initially signed in the early 1990s to provide natural gas to energy-deficient South Asia, the TAPI project has faced repeated delays due to years of Afghan hostilities, which ended in 2021 when the then-insurgent Taliban recaptured power as all U.S. and NATO forces exited the country. While Turkmen leaders Wednesday pledged to enhance bilateral ties between Ashgabat and Kabul and carry forward the TAPI project, experts remain skeptical that the gas pipeline will become operational soon. They cite funding issues, U.S.-led Western economic sanctions on Afghanistan and the international community’s refusal to recognize the Taliban as the legitimate government over restrictions on Afghan women’s rights. Islamabad’s persistent diplomatic and military tensions with New Delhi are also considered a significant obstacle to the materialization of the TAPI project. According to officials of the participating countries, Pakistan and India, each one plans to purchase 42% of the gas exports, and Afghanistan will receive the rest. Kabul will also earn around $500 million in transit fees annually. Pakistan’s relations with Afghanistan deteriorated after the Taliban takeover over terrorism concerns. Islamabad complains that Kabul shelters and facilitates fugitive anti-Pakistan militants to orchestrate cross-border terrorist attacks from Afghan sanctuaries, charges the Taliban reject.	https://www.voanews.com/a/afghanistan-turkmenistan-begin-work-on-long-delayed-gas-pipeline/7780374.html	2024-09-11T10:55:13-07:00	
US House Republicans cancel vote on stopgap funding measure	WASHINGTON — U.S. House of Representatives Speaker Mike Johnson canceled a vote scheduled for Wednesday on his stopgap funding bill, saying more work is needed to build support for a measure, less than three weeks before a government shutdown deadline. 'No vote today, because we're in the consensus-building business here in Congress, with small majorities, and that's what you do,' Johnson told reporters at the Capitol. The vote had been set for later on Wednesday. Johnson added that Republicans will be working through the weekend to find a bill that would gain enough votes for passage, now that his measure, opposed by President Joe Biden and congressional Democrats, has faltered. House Republicans have attached a controversial provision requiring people to provide proof of citizenship to register to vote, a measure meant to force Democrats to take stances on the politically charged issue of non-citizen voting, which is already illegal in federal elections. Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump, who continues to falsely claim his 2020 loss was the result of fraud, has urged Republicans to pass the voting measure ahead of the November 5 election. The federal government's fiscal year ends on September 30, when funding for many agencies expires. Without some sort of extension, federal programs not deemed essential would have to suspend many of their operations, forcing thousands of government workers to go on leave. Success for the funding bill was not guaranteed in the chamber that Republicans control by a narrow 220-211 margin. Several House Republicans have said they would vote against the measure, citing spending concerns, and many members of the caucus generally oppose stopgap spending measures. Two Republicans joined Democrats on Tuesday in voting against a procedural move to advance the bill. Democrats broadly see the citizenship registration requirement as meant to undermine confidence in administering elections. 'We're watching a movie we've seen over and over again,' said Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer on Tuesday. 'House Republicans are trying to pass a bill so partisan that it even splits their own caucus. This proposal isn't even serious.' The White House on Monday said Biden would veto this funding package were it to pass, citing the 'unrelated cynical' voting requirement. The administration also wants a temporary funding period shorter than six months, as well as more money for the Federal Emergency Management Agency to fix infrastructure damaged by natural disasters. Lawmakers face an even more critical self-imposed deadline on January 1, before which they must act to raise or extend the nation's debt ceiling or risk defaulting on more than $35 trillion in federal government debt.	https://www.voanews.com/a/us-house-republicans-cancel-vote-on-stopgap-funding-measure/7780375.html	2024-09-11T10:50:42-07:00

Generation Z drives far-right support in Europe	London — Support for far-right figures among young voters appears to be growing in several European countries. Much of the focus is on Germany, where the Alternative for Germany party (AfD) is hoping to secure another victory in the upcoming Brandenburg state election in the east of the country on September 22. AfD secured a resounding victory in the Thuringia state election earlier this month, winning 32.8% of the vote, well ahead of second-place Christian Democrats at 23.6%. It was the first time the far right had won a state election since the end of World War II in 1945. 'More than a third of young people, almost 40% of 18- to 29-year-olds, [voted] for the AfD,' according to Ben Ansell, a professor at the University of Oxford and host of the podcast 'What’s Wrong with Democracy?' In contrast, only 1 in 5 voters over 70 years of age chose AfD. The party is hoping young voters will propel it to victory in the upcoming Brandenburg state election. '[Other parties] probably expected that the AfD is only a party for old people and that young people don't vote for the AfD. That is exactly wrong,' said AfD chairman in Brandenburg Hans-Christoph Berndt at a recent campaign event. What’s driving the popularity of the far right among younger people? Immigration appears to be a key factor, said Ansell. 'In eastern Germany, [AfD] are just really popular,' he said. 'It’s a part of the country that is poorer than the other parts, that is less ethnically diverse and therefore reacts more to the new diversity than Berlin does, or other parts of Germany.' 'Some people have argued that it's concerns about the war in Ukraine,' Ansell added. 'Other people have argued that it's a response to COVID, or a response to the housing crisis … it's getting on the housing ladder and things like that, having the same quality of life they thought their elders had.' The trend among young voters is not limited to Germany. In June’s European elections, France’s far-right National Rally was the most popular party among 18- to 34-year-olds, with 32% of the vote — much higher than over-65s. National Rally’s 28-year-old president, Jordan Bardella, has 1.6 million followers on TikTok, a social media platform popular among young people. 'TikTok is short videos that aim to shock. The skill that populist parties have in making videos and finding political moments that are short, sharp and shocking — to get people excited about politics,' said Ansell. Meanwhile, a recent study by El País newspaper suggested that a quarter of Spanish men aged between 18 to 26 — known as 'Generation Z' — believe that in some circumstances, authoritarianism may be preferable to democracy. Among the so-called baby-boomer generation, aged 59 and over, the figure is less than 10%. Preference for authoritarianism was also lower among female voters — a trend seen in other countries, said Ansell. 'It’s something that comes out actually most obviously in east Asia — that young men are reacting politically very differently to young women. In [South] Korea, that’s extremely stark, as young men have voted for explicitly anti-feminist movements. But you can see this huge gender gap among the under-30s opening up in all countries, including in the United States right now,' he said. It remains to be seen whether such trends among young voters will be replicated in the United States in the presidential election on November 5. Recent polls suggest the Democrats’ Kamala Harris has increased support among younger voters compared to her Republican rival, Donald Trump.	https://www.voanews.com/a/generation-z-drives-far-right-support-in-europe-/7780257.html	2024-09-11T09:48:13-07:00

Biden, Harris and Trump visit Sept. 11 site in New York	New York — President Joe Biden, Vice President Kamala Harris and former President Donald Trump made a rare joint appearance on Wednesday at the New York City site that marks the Sept. 11 plane attacks in 2001 that killed nearly 3,000 people. Harris, the Democratic presidential nominee and Trump, her Republican rival in the Nov. 5 U.S. presidential election, shook hands and exchanged a few words, despite their a contentious debate the night before, then lined up for the commemoration. Trump's running mate, Senator JD Vance of Ohio, also attended. Instead of formal remarks, the ceremony at the 'ground zero' site where planes brought down the World Trade Center's twin towers included wives, husbands, sisters, brothers and grandchildren reading the names of family members killed 23 years ago. The annual rite marks the suicide attacks by al Qaeda Islamist militants that hit Manhattan, the Pentagon and a Pennsylvania field. 'Richard J. O'Connor. We will always love and miss you,' a small red-headed boy said of his grandfather, who was killed in the World Trade Center that morning. A bagpipe and drum processional was accompanied by New York City's fire and police departments and Port Authority honor guards. The national anthem was performed and moments of silence were held at the times each target was struck. Former New York Mayor Michael Bloomberg also attended, standing between Biden and Trump. After New York, Biden and Harris were flying to Shanksville, Pennsylvania, where passengers on United Flight 93 overcame the hijackers and the plane crashed in a field, preventing another target from being hit. Then the president and vice president will head back to the Washington area to visit a memorial at the Pentagon. 'On this day 23 years ago, terrorists believed they could break our will and bring us to our knees. They were wrong. They will always be wrong. In the darkest of hours, we found light. And in the face of fear, we came together - to defend our country, and to help one another,' Biden said in an early morning statement. Trump, who also plans to visit the Pennsylvania memorial, told Fox News on Wednesday: 'It was very, very sad, horrible day. There's never been anything like it.' Biden earlier issued a proclamation honoring those who died as a result of the attacks, as well as the hundreds of thousands of Americans who volunteered for military service afterwards. 'We owe these patriots of the 9/11 Generation a debt of gratitude that we can never fully repay,' Biden said, citing deployments to Afghanistan, Iraq and other war zones, as well as the capture and killing of Sept. 11 mastermind Osama bin Laden and his deputy. U.S. congressional leaders on Tuesday posthumously awarded the Congressional Gold Medal to 13 service members who were killed in the Aug. 26, 2021, suicide bombing at Kabul's airport during the chaotic U.S. withdrawal from Afghanistan.	https://www.voanews.com/a/7780183.html	2024-09-11T08:46:35-07:00	
Hellish' scene unfolds as wildfire races toward California mountain community	TRABUCO CANYON, California — Alex Luna, a 20-year-old missionary, saw the sky turn from a cherry red to black in about 90 minutes as an explosive wildfire raced toward the Southern California mountain community of Wrightwood and authorities implored residents to leave their belongings behind and get out of town. 'It was very, I would say, hellish-like,' Luna said Tuesday night. 'It was very just dark. Not a good place to be at that moment. ... Ash was falling from the sky like if it was snowing.' Luna was among those who heeded the evacuation order that was issued for the community of about 4,500 in the San Gabriel Mountains east of Los Angeles. The Bridge Fire, which had burned 189 square kilometers (73 square miles) as of late Tuesday with no containment, is one of three major wildfires burning in Southern California and endangering tens of thousands of homes and other structures. The fires sprung to life during a triple-digit heat wave that finally broke Wednesday. The cooler temperatures brought the prospect of firefighters finally making headway against the flames. Other major fires were burning across the West, including in Idaho, Oregon and Nevada, where about 20,000 people had to flee a blaze outside Reno. In Northern California, a fire that started Sunday burned at least 30 homes and commercial buildings and destroyed 40 to 50 vehicles in Clearlake City, 175 kilometers (109 miles) north of San Francisco. Roughly 4,000 people were forced to evacuate. California is only now heading into the teeth of the wildfire season but already has seen nearly three times as much acreage burn than during all of 2023. Evacuation orders were expanded Tuesday night in Southern California as the fires grew and included parts of the popular ski town of Big Bear. Some 65,600 homes and buildings were under threat by the Line Fire, including those under mandatory evacuations and those under evacuation warnings, nearly double the number from the previous day. The San Bernardino County Sheriff's Department announced Tuesday that a Norco man suspected of starting the Line Fire in Highland on September 5 had been arrested and charged with arson. He was held in lieu of $80,000 bail. Residents along the southern edge of Big Bear Lake were told to leave the area, which is a popular destination for anglers, bikers and hikers. As of late Tuesday, the blaze had charred more than 140 square kilometers (54 square miles) of grass and brush with 14% containment, according to CalFire. It blanketed the area with a thick cloud of dark smoke. The fire impacted key radio towers, including communication channels for those responding to the fire. Cooler weather could moderate fire activity toward the end of the week, CalFire said in an update. Public safety power shut-offs were anticipated in parts of the Big Bear and Bear Valley areas. The acrid air prompted several districts in the area to close schools through the end of the week because of safety concerns. Three firefighters have been injured since the blaze was reported Thursday, state fire managers said. For Wrightwood, a picturesque town 124 kilometers (77 miles) east of Los Angeles known for its 1930’s cabins. threatening wildfires have become a regular part of life. Authorities expressed frustration in 2016 when only half the residents heeded orders to leave. Janice Quick, the president of the Wrightwood Chamber of Commerce, lives a few miles outside town. Late Tuesday afternoon she was eating lunch outside with friends and they were rained on by embers the size of her thumbnail that hit the table and made a clinking sound. A friend texted to tell her that the friend's home had been consumed by fire, while another friend was watching through her ring camera as embers rained down on her home. 'I've never seen anything like this and I've been through fires before,' said Quick, who has lived in Wrightwood for 45 years. In neighboring Orange County, firefighters used bulldozers, helicopters and planes to control a rapidly spreading blaze called the Airport Fire that started Monday and spread to about 8 square kilometers (3 square miles) in only a few hours. The blaze was ignited by a spark from heavy equipment being used by public workers, officials said. By Tuesday night, it had charred more than 78 square kilometers (30 square miles) and was heading over mountainous terrain into neighboring Riverside County with no containment, said Orange County Fire Authority Capt. Steve Concialdi. It burned some communications towers on top of a peak, though so far officials said they did not have reports of the damage disrupting police or fire communication signals in the area. Concialdi said the fire was burning away from homes in Orange County, but there are 36 recreational cabins in the area. He said authorities don't yet know if the cabins were damaged or destroyed by the blaze. Two firefighters who suffered heat-related injuries and a resident who suffered from smoke inhalation were treated at a hospital and released. Sherri Fankhauser, her husband and her daughter set up lawn chairs and were watching helicopters make water drops on a flaming hillside a few hundred yards away from their Trabuco Canyon home on Tuesday. They didn't evacuate even though their street had been under a mandatory evacuation order since Monday. A neighbor did help Fankhauser's 89-year-old mother-in-law evacuate, Fankhauser said. The flames died down last night but flared up again in the morning. 'You can see fire coming over the ridge now,' Fankhauser said Tuesday afternoon. 'It's getting a little scarier now.'	https://www.voanews.com/a/hellish-scene-unfolds-as-wildfire-races-toward-california-mountain-community-/7780144.html	2024-09-11T08:27:52-07:00

Samsung Electronics plans global job cuts of up to 30%, sources say	SEOUL/NEW DELHI — Samsung Electronics, the world's top maker of smartphones, TVs and memory chips, is cutting up to 30% of its overseas staff at some divisions, three sources with direct knowledge of the matter told Reuters. South Korea-based Samsung has instructed subsidiaries worldwide to reduce sales and marketing staff by about 15% and the administrative staff by up to 30%, two of the sources said. The plan will be implemented by the end of this year and would impact jobs across the Americas, Europe, Asia and Africa, one person said. Six other people familiar with the matter also confirmed Samsung's planned global headcount reduction. It is not clear how many people would be let go and which countries and business units would be most affected. The sources declined to be named because the scope and details of the job cuts remained confidential. In a statement, Samsung said workforce adjustments conducted at some overseas operations were routine, and aimed at improving efficiency. It said there are no specific targets for the plans, adding that they are not impacting its production staff. Samsung employed a total of 267,800 people as of the end of 2023, and more than half, or 147,000 employees, are based overseas, according to its latest sustainability report. Manufacturing and development accounted for most of those jobs and sales and marketing staff was around 25,100, while 27,800 people worked in other areas, the report said. The 'global mandate' on job cuts was sent about three weeks ago, and Samsung's India operation was already offering severance packages to some mid-level employees who have left in recent weeks, one of the direct sources said. The total employees who may need to leave the India unit could reach 1,000, the person added. Samsung employs some 25,000 people in India. In China, Samsung has notified its staff about the job cuts that are expected to affect about 30% of its employees at its sales operation, a South Korean newspaper reported this month. Big challenges The job cuts come as Samsung grapples with mounting pressure on its key units. Its bread-and-butter chip business has been slower than its rivals in recovering from a severe downturn in the industry that drove its profit to a 15-year low last year. In May, Samsung replaced the head of its semiconductor division in a bid to overcome a 'chip crisis' as it seeks to catch up with smaller rival SK Hynix in supplying high-end memory chips used in artificial intelligence chipsets. In the premium smartphone market, Samsung is facing stiff competition from Apple and China's Huawei, while it has long lagged behind TSMC in contract chip manufacturing. And in India, which earns Samsung around $12 billion in annual revenue, a strike over wages is disrupting production. One of the sources familiar with the plans said the job cuts were being made in preparation for a slowdown in global demand for technology products as the global economy slows. Another source said Samsung is seeking to shore up its bottom line by saving costs. It was not immediately clear if Samsung will also cut jobs in its headquarters in South Korea. One of the sources said Samsung would find it difficult to lay off workers in South Korea because it was a politically sensitive issue. Conglomerate Samsung Group, of which the electronics giant is the crown jewel, is the country's biggest employer and plays a key role in its economy. Job cuts could also stir labor unrest at home. A South Korean workers' union at Samsung Electronics recently went on strike for several days, demanding higher wages and benefits. Shares in Samsung Electronics, South Korea's most valuable stock, are trading at their lowest level in 16 months on Wednesday, as some analysts cut their profit estimates for the company recently, citing a weak recovery in demand for smartphones and personal computers.	https://www.voanews.com/a/samsung-electronics-plans-global-job-cuts-of-up-to-30-sources-say-/7780071.html	2024-09-11T08:03:47-07:00	
AI not a US election gamechanger yet	Washington — When the U.S. announced the seizure of 32 internet domains tied to Russian efforts to ply American voters with disinformation ahead of November’s presidential election, prosecutors were quick to note the use of artificial intelligence, or AI. The Russian operation, known as Doppelganger, drove internet and social media users to the fake news using a variety of methods, the charging documents said, including advertisements that were 'in some cases created using artificial intelligence.' AI tools were also used to 'generate content, including images and videos, for use in negative advertisements about U.S. politicians,' the indictment added. And Russia is far from alone in turning to AI in the hopes of swaying U.S. voters. 'The primary actors we've seen for election use of this are Iran and Russia, although as various private companies have noticed, China also has used artificial intelligence for spreading divisive narratives in the United States,' according to a senior intelligence official, who spoke on the condition of anonymity in order to discuss sensitive information. 'What we've seen is artificial intelligence is used by foreign actors to make their content more quickly and convincingly tailor their synthetic content in both audio and video forms,' the official added. But other U.S. officials say the use of AI to spread misinformation and disinformation in the lead-up to the U.S. election has so far failed to live up to some of the more dire warnings about how deepfakes and other AI-generated material could shake-up the American political landscape. 'Generative AI is not going to fundamentally introduce new threats to this election cycle,' according to Cait Conley, senior adviser to the director of the Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency, the U.S. agency charged with overseeing election security. 'What we're seeing is consistent with what we expected to see,' Conley told VOA. AI 'is exacerbating existing threats, in both the cyber domain and the foreign malign influence operation-disinformation campaigns,' she said. But little of what has been put out to this point has shocked officials at CISA or the myriad state and local governments who run elections across the country. 'This threat vector is not new to them,' Conley said. 'And they have taken the measures to ensure they're prepared to respond effectively.' As an example, Conley pointed to the rash of robocalls that targeted New Hampshire citizens ahead of the state’s first in the nation primary in January, using fake audio of U.S. President Joe Biden to tell people to stay home and 'save your vote.' New Hampshire's attorney general quickly went public, calling the robocalls an apparent attempt to suppress votes and telling voters the incident was under investigation. This past May, prosecutors indicted a Louisiana political consultant in connection with the scheme. More recently, the alleged use of AI prompted a celebrity endorsement in the U.S. presidential race by pop star Taylor Swift. 'Recently I was made aware that AI of ‘me’ falsely endorsing Donald Trump’s presidential run was posted to his site,' Swift wrote in an Instagram social media post late Tuesday. 'It brought me to the conclusion that I need to be very transparent about my actual plans for this election as a voter,' she wrote, adding, 'I will be casting my vote for Kamala Harris and Tim Walz.' But experts and analysts say for all the attention AI is getting, the use of such technology in attacks and other influence operations has been limited. 'There's not a tremendous amount of it in the wild that's particularly successful right now, at least to my knowledge,' said Katie Gray, a senior partner at In-Q-Tel, the CIA's technology-focused, not-for-profit strategic investment firm. 'Most attackers are not using the most sophisticated methods to penetrate systems,' she said on September 4 at a cybersecurity summit in Washington. Others suggest that at least for the moment, the fears surrounding AI have outpaced its usefulness by malicious actors. ‘We jump to the doomsday science fiction,' said Clint Watts, a former FBI special agent and counterterror consultant who heads up the Microsoft Threat Analysis Center (MTAC). 'But instead, what we're seeing is the number one challenge to all of this right now is access, just getting to the [AI] tools and accessing them,' he said, speaking like Gray at the cybersecurity summit. Over the past 14 months, MTAC has logged hundreds of instances of AI use by China, Russia and Iran, Watts said. And analysts found that Moscow and Tehran, in particular, have struggled to get access to a fully AI toolbox. The Russians 'need to use their own tools from the start, rather than Western tools, because they're afraid they'll get knocked off those systems,' Watts said. Iran is even further behind. 'They've tried different tools,' Watts said. 'They just can't get access to most of them for the most part.' U.S. adversaries also appear to be having difficulties with the underlying requirements to make AI effective. 'To do scaled AI operations is not cheap,' Watts said. 'Some of the infrastructure and the resources of it [AI], the models, the data it needs to be trained [on] – very challenging at the moment.' And Watts said until the products generated by AI get better, attempted deepfakes will likely have trouble resonating with the targeted audiences. 'Audiences have been remarkably brilliant about detecting deepfakes in crowds. The more you watch somebody, the more you realize a fake isn't quite right,' according to Watts. 'The Russian actors that we've seen, all of them have tried deepfakes and they've moved back to bread and butter, small video manipulations.'	https://www.voanews.com/a/ai-not-a-us-election-gamechanger-yet/7780093.html	2024-09-11T08:03:15-07:00

Workers' protest grounds flights at Kenya's main airport	Nairobi — Hundreds of workers at Kenya's main international airport demonstrated on Wednesday against a planned deal between the government and a foreign investor. Planes have remained grounded, with hundreds of passengers stranded at the airport. The government has said that the build-and-operate agreement with India's Adani Group would see the Jomo Kenyatta International Airport modernized, and an additional runway and terminal constructed, in exchange for the group running the airport for 30 years. Kenya Airport Workers Union, in announcing the strike, said that the deal would lead to job losses and 'inferior terms and conditions of service' for those who will remain. Kenya Airways on Wednesday announced there would be flight delays and possible cancellations because of the ongoing strike at the airport, which serves Nairobi. The strike has affected local flights coming from the port city of Mombasa and the lake city of Kisumu, where delays have been reported by local media. At the main airport, police officers had taken up security check-in roles with long lines seen outside the departure terminals and worried passengers unable to confirm if their flights would depart as scheduled. The Kenya Airports Authority said in a statement that it was 'engaging relevant parties to normalize operations' and urged passengers to contact respective airlines to confirm flight status. The Central Organization of Trade Unions' secretary-general, Francis Atwoli, told journalists at the airport that the strike would have been averted had the government listened to the workers. 'This was a very simple matter where the assurance to workers in writing that our members will not lose jobs and their jobs will remain protected by the government and as is required by law and that assurance alone, we wouldn't have been here,' he said. Last week, airport workers had threatened to go on strike, but the plans were called off pending discussions with the government. The spotting of unknown people moving around with airport officials taking notes and photographs raised concerns that the Indian firm officials were readying for the deal, local media outlets reported last week. The High Court on Monday temporarily halted the implementation of the deal until a case filed by the Law Society and the Kenya Human Rights Commission is heard.	https://www.voanews.com/a/workers-protest-grounds-flights-at-kenya-s-main-airport/7779969.html	2024-09-11T06:32:57-07:00	
Gunmen kill Pakistan polio vaccinator and police guard near Afghan border	Islamabad — Gunmen in northwestern Pakistan killed an anti-polio worker and a policeman guarding him Wednesday, the second attack on healthcare teams trying to carry out a national immunization campaign against the paralytic virus. Area officials reported that the assailants targeted a polio team providing vaccine to children in the Bajaur district, bordering Afghanistan. The attack also injured a policeman. No group immediately claimed responsibility for the deadly attack in one of the militancy-hit districts of Pakistan’s Khyber Pakhtunkhwa province. The start of the immunization campaign Monday was marred by a roadside bombing of a polio vaccination team in the province’s South Waziristan district. That attack resulted in injuries to at least ten people, including three vaccinators and six police personnel. An Afghanistan-based Islamic State affiliate known as Islamic State-Khorasan reportedly claimed responsibility for the deadly blast. Militants in violence-affected districts often target polio vaccinators, suspecting them of spying on behalf of Pakistani security forces. Such attacks have killed dozens of vaccinators and police personnel escorting them in past years, mostly in areas near or adjacent to the Afghan border, dealing critical blows to polio eradication efforts. On Monday, the Pakistan Polio Eradication Program said that the country of about 240 million is facing an 'intense outbreak' of wild poliovirus this year, paralyzing 17 children so far nationwide. It reported that sewage samples tested positive in 66 districts for the highly contagious virus, threatening more children. The program noted that the ongoing house-to-house campaign aims to vaccinate more than 33 million children under five in 115 districts nationwide. Pakistan and Afghanistan, which reported nine paralytic polio cases so far in 2024, are the only two remaining polio-endemic countries globally. Polio immunization drives in both countries, which share a nearly 2,600-kilometer border, have long faced multiple challenges, such as security and vaccine boycotts, which have set back the goal of eradicating the virus from the globe. Officials at the World Health Organization have reported an improvement in Afghan vaccination efforts since the Islamist Taliban retook control of the country three years ago, ending years of nationwide hostilities and enabling polio teams to inoculate children in previously inaccessible areas.	https://www.voanews.com/a/gunmen-kill-pakistan-polio-vaccinator-and-police-guard-near-afghan-border/7779922.html	2024-09-11T06:04:01-07:00	
US inflation reaches 3-year low as Federal Reserve prepares to cut interest rates	Washington — The post-pandemic spike in U.S. inflation eased further last month as year-over-year price increases reached a three-year low, clearing the way for the Federal Reserve to cut interest rates next week. Wednesday’s report from the Labor Department showed that consumer prices rose 2.5% in August from a year earlier. It was the fifth straight annual drop and the smallest such increase since February 2021. From July to August, prices rose just 0.2%. Excluding volatile food and energy costs, so-called core prices rose 3.2% in August from 12 months earlier, the same as in July. On a month-to-month basis, core prices rose 0.3% last month, a pickup from July's 0.2% increase. Economists closely watch core prices, which typically provide a better read of future inflation trends. For months, cooling inflation has provided gradual relief to America’s consumers, who were stung by the price surges that erupted three years ago, particularly for food, gas, rent and other necessities. Inflation peaked in mid-2022 at 9.1%, the highest rate in four decades. Fed officials have signaled that they’re increasingly confident that inflation is falling back to their 2% target and are now shifting their focus to supporting the job market, which is steadily cooling. As a result, the policymakers are poised to begin cutting their key rate from its 23-year high in hopes of bolstering growth and hiring. A modest quarter-point cut is widely expected next week. Over time, a series of rate cuts should reduce the cost of borrowing across the economy, including for mortgages, auto loans and credit cards. The latest inflation figures could inject themselves into the presidential race in its final weeks. Former President Donald Trump has heaped blame on Vice President Kamala Harris for the jump in inflation, which erupted in early 2021 as global supply chains seized up, causing severe shortages of parts and labor. Harris has proposed subsidies for home buyers and builders in an effort to ease housing costs and backs a federal ban on price-gouging for groceries. Trump has said he would boost energy production to try to reduce overall inflation. A key reason why inflation eased again in August was that gas prices tumbled by about 10 cents a gallon last month, according to the Energy Inflation Administration, to a national average of about $3.29. Economists also expect the government’s measures of grocery prices and rents to rise more slowly. Though food prices are roughly 20% more expensive than before the pandemic, they have barely budged over the past year. Another potential driver of slower inflation is that the cost of new apartment leases has started to cool as a stream of newly built apartments have been completed. According to the real estate brokerage Redfin, the median rent for a new lease rose just 0.9% in August from a year earlier, to $1,645 a month. But the government’s measure includes all rents, including those for people who have been in their apartments for months or years. It takes time for the slowdown in new rents to show up in the government’s data. In July, rental costs rose 5.1% from a year ago, according to the government’s consumer price index. Americans’ paychecks are also growing more slowly — an average of about 3.5% annually, still a solid pace — which reduces inflationary pressures. Two years ago, wage growth was topping 5%, a level that can force businesses to sharply raise prices to cover their higher labor costs. In a high-profile speech last month, Fed Chair Jerome Powell noted that inflation was coming under control and suggested that the job market was unlikely to be a source of inflationary pressure. Consumers have propelled the economy for the past three years. But they are increasingly turning to debt to maintain their spending and credit card, and auto delinquencies are rising, raising concerns that they may have to rein in their spending soon. Reduced consumer spending could lead more employers to freeze their hiring or even cut jobs.	https://www.voanews.com/a/us-inflation-reaches-a-3-year-low-as-federal-reserve-prepares-to-cut-interest-rates-/7779927.html	2024-09-11T06:03:09-07:00	
European business confidence in China is at an all-time low, report says	HONG KONG — China must reprioritize economic growth and reforms and boost investor confidence by leveling the playing field for all companies in the country, a European business group said Wednesday. With 'business confidence now at an all-time low' over lagging domestic demand and overcapacity in certain industries, the annual European Business in China Position Paper called on China to open its economy and allow a more free market to determine resource allocation. It also recommended introducing policies to boost domestic demand. Profit margins in China are at or below the global average for two-thirds of the companies surveyed earlier in the year, according to the paper published Wednesday by the European Chamber of Commerce in China. In August, China filed a complaint with the World Trade Organization over European Union tariffs on electric vehicles made in China. It also launched anti-dumping and subsidies investigations of European dairy products, brandy and pork exports. The tit-for-tat actions have raised fears that a trade war may break out. Many European businesses are deciding that the returns on investments in the world's second-largest economy are not worth the risks, due to issues including China's economic slowdown and a politicized business environment. 'For some European headquarters and shareholders, the risks of investing in China are beginning to outright the returns, a trend that will only intensify if key business concerns are left unaddressed,' Jens Eskelund, president of China's European Union Chamber of Commerce, said in a message at the beginning of the paper. The European Chamber's paper proposes over 1,000 recommendations for China to resolve challenges and problems faced by European businesses operating in the country and boost investor confidence. Among them are calls for China to refrain from punishing companies for the actions of their home governments. Others include ensuring that policy packages for attracting foreign investment are followed by implementation, and refraining from 'erratic policy shifts.' The report also recommended that the EU proactively engage with China and keep its responses 'measured and proportionate' when disagreements arise.	https://www.voanews.com/a/european-business-confidence-in-china-is-at-an-all-time-low-report-says-/7779873.html	2024-09-11T05:00:01-07:00	
Wagner lost veteran fighters in Mali ambush, in setback to Russia's Africa campaign	LONDON/DAKAR — Among the dozens of Wagner mercenaries presumed dead after a lethal battle with Tuareg rebels during a desert sandstorm in Mali in July were Russian war veterans who survived tours in Ukraine, Libya and Syria, according to interviews with relatives and a review of social media data. The loss of such experienced fighters exposes dangers faced by Russian mercenary forces working for military juntas, which are struggling to contain separatists and powerful offshoots of Islamic State and Al Qaeda across the arid Sahel region in Mali, Burkina Faso and Niger. The Mali defeat raises doubts over whether Moscow, which has admitted funding Wagner and has absorbed many of its fighters into a defense ministry force, will do better than Western and U.N. troops recently expelled by the juntas, six officials and experts who work in the region said. By cross-referencing public information with online posts from relatives and fighters, speaking to seven relatives and using facial recognition software to analyze battlefield footage verified by Reuters, the news agency was able to identify 23 fighters missing in action and two others taken into Tuareg captivity after the ambush near Tinzaouaten, a town on the Algerian border. Several of the men had survived the siege of Bakhmut in Ukraine, which Wagner's late founder Yevgeny Prigozhin called a 'meat grinder.' Others had served in Libya, Syria and elsewhere. Some were former Russian soldiers, at least one of whom had retired after a full-length army career. Grisly footage of dead fighters has now circulated online, and some of relatives told Reuters the bodies of their husbands and sons had been abandoned in the desert. Reuters could not confirm how many of the men it identified were dead. Margarita Goncharova said her son, Vadim Evsiukov, 31, was first recruited in prison where he was serving a drug-related sentence in 2022. He rose through the ranks in Ukraine to lead a platoon of 500 men, she said. After coming home, he worked as a tailor but struggled with survivor's guilt and secretly traveled to Africa in April to join his former commander, she said. 'He wanted to fly to Africa many times. I discouraged him as much as I could,' Goncharova said in an interview with Reuters. 'I told him 'fate has given you a once-in-a-million chance. You can start your life again; you've won such a crazy lottery'.' The Russian Ministry of Defense, Ministry of Foreign Affairs and Wagner did not respond to requests for comment for this story. After Prigozhin died in August last year, Wagner employees were invited to join a newly created group called the Africa Corps, under the defense ministry, 'to fight for justice and the interests of Russia,' according to the Africa Corps channel on social-media platform Telegram. On the channel, Africa Corps says about half its personnel are former Wagner employees who it allows to use Wagner insignia. Wagner's social media channels remain active. The Russian government has not publicly commented on the Tinzaouaten battle. Mali's armed forces-led government said the defeat had no impact on its goals. The Malian Armed Forces 'are committed to restoring the authority of the state throughout the country,' army spokesman Colonel Major Souleymane Dembele told Reuters. Wagner has acknowledged heavy losses in the Mali ambush but gave no figure. The Malian army, which fought alongside the Russians, also did not give a toll. Tuareg rebels, who are fighting for an independent homeland, said they had killed 84 Russians and 47 Malians. Reuters could not independently establish how many were killed in battle. One video, out of more than 20 sent to Reuters by a Tuareg rebel spokesman, showed at least 47 bodies, mostly white men, in military-style uniforms lying in the desert. Reuters verified the location and date of the video. Mikhail Zvinchuk, a prominent blogger close to the Russian defense ministry, said on social media platform RuTube in August that the defeat showed Wagner fighters who arrived from Ukraine had underestimated the rebels and the Al Qaeda fighters. Missing in action Wagner-linked Telegram accounts named two of the dead as Nikita Fedyakin, the administrator of The Grey Zone, a popular Wagner-focused Telegram channel with over half a million subscribers, and Sergei Shevchenko, who the accounts described as the unit commander. Reuters could not verify the identity of Shevchenko. Reuters separately identified 23 Wagner operators missing in Mali via relatives who posted in an official Wagner Telegram chat group, checking the names against social media accounts, publicly available data and facial recognition software. All the relatives received calls from Wagner recruiters on Aug. 6 to notify them their men were missing in action, they said in the chat group. Lyubov Bazhenova told Reuters she had no idea her son Vladimir Akimov, 25, who had briefly served in Russia's elite airborne forces as a conscript, had signed up. She was angry with Wagner for sharing no further information about his fate or the whereabouts of his body. She said letters to the prosecutor's office, defense ministry and foreign ministry had gone unanswered. Facial-recognition software was used to identify another two men captured by Tuareg fighters, based on photographs and videos of the ambush site published by Tuareg sources. The Tuareg rebels posted videos and photos of the two captives on social media. Mohamed Elmaouloud Ramadane, a spokesman for the rebel alliance, confirmed the men were in rebel captivity as of late August. One of the missing fighters, Alexei Kuzekmaev, 47, had no military experience, his wife Lyudmila Kuzekmaeva told Reuters. 'Neither my hysterics, nor tears, nor persuasion - nothing helped. He just confronted me a month before he left home. He said 'I bought a ticket and will be leaving.'' Among the most experienced men was Alexander Lazarev, 48, a Russian army veteran who served in wars against Chechen separatists in the 1990s and 2000s, according to his wife's posts in the Wagner channel. She declined to comment. Lazarev appears in many photos on the Russian Facebook equivalent VKontakte wearing military uniform, with symbols linked to several army subdivisions. Parastatal mercenary force Democratic governments in Mali, Burkina Faso and Niger were overthrown since 2020 in a series of coups driven by anger with corrupt leaders and a near decade of failed Western efforts to fight insurgencies that have killed thousands and displaced millions. The military juntas have kicked out French and U.S. troops and U.N. peacekeepers. In Africa, Wagner emerged in Sudan in 2017 as the deniable face of Russian operations. Its enterprises soon ranged from protecting African coup leaders to gold mining and fighting jihadists. Wagner is also active in Central African Republic. It first appeared in Mali in late 2021. Wagner's fortunes rose and fell last year. In May, the group led Russia to its first significant Ukrainian battlefield victory in almost a year with the capture of Bakhmut. But after his criticism of Russian military leaders and his effort to lead a rebellion weeks after the Bakhmut victory, Prigozhin died in a fiery plane crash in August. The Kremlin has rejected as an 'absolute lie' U.S. officials' claim that Putin had Prigozhin killed. Eric Whitaker, the top U.S. envoy to Burkina Faso until retiring in June, who previously served in Niger, Mali and Chad, said the Putin administration has achieved complete control over the Wagner brand in the post-Prigozhin era. 'Africa Corps earns (the Russian government) hard-currency payments from host governments for its services and also gains a significant sources of revenue from gold derived from its activities in the Sahel,' he said. Russian mercenary activity soared in Mali after Africa Corps was formed, according to data from the Armed Conflict Location & Event Data Project (ACLED), a U.S.-based crisis-monitoring group. Based on media reports and social media documenting, the data shows violent events linked to Russian mercenaries rose 81% and reported civilian fatalities rose 65% over the past year, compared to the year before Prigozhin's death. Wagner does not publish recruitment figures. Jędrzej Czerep, an analyst at Warsaw-based think tank Polish Institute of International Affairs, estimated that around 6,000 Russian mercenaries serve in Africa, while three diplomatic sources said about 1,500-2,000 were in Mali. 'When Africa Corps started to promote and recruit, they were flooded with applications,' said Czerep. 'Being sent to one of the African missions was seen as far safer than Ukraine,' he said. Tuareg spokesman Ramadane said the rebel alliance was preparing for more clashes. Further losses could eventually drive Russia out, said Tibor Nagy, the top U.S. envoy to Africa in 2019, when Wagner withdrew from northern Mozambique months after around a dozen of its men were killed during a conflict with an Islamic State affiliate. 'They were out of there very quickly,' said Nagy. Wagner has not publicly commented on its plans in Mali.	https://www.voanews.com/a/wagner-lost-veteran-fighters-in-mali-ambush-in-setback-to-russia-s-africa-campaign-/7779865.html	2024-09-11T04:49:18-07:00	
China, Philippines to discuss South China Sea dispute amid clashes	Taipei, Taiwan — As China is set to host bilateral talks with the Philippines this month, their South China Sea dispute is expanding from sea to air, increasing the risk of military confrontation, analysts warn. The Chinese Communist Party’s People’s Daily newspaper on Monday published an article warning that 'China-Philippines relations stand at a crossroads' over the South China Sea dispute. The warning came after Filipino Foreign Affairs Secretary Enrique Manalo told reporters at a diplomatic reception on September 4 that Beijing will host the next round of the Bilateral Consultative Mechanism meetings designed to manage differences between the two countries. Manalo did not say on which date the talks would start this month but expressed hope the two countries would discuss an incident in late August when coast guard ships from both sides collided at a disputed shoal. Both countries blame the other for the collision, though video released by the Philippine coast guard appears to show the Chinese coast guard ship ramming their vessel, BRP Teresa Magbanua. It was the second such collision of their coast guard ships in August at the disputed atoll. Vincent Kyle Parada, a former defense analyst for the Philippine Navy and a graduate student at the S. Rajaratnam School of International Studies at Nanyang Technological University in Singapore, says the frequency of the sea clashes is pushing the two sides to expand their operations to the air. 'Over the past few weeks, China has been actively working to disrupt resupply missions to the ship and crew, to the point that after one such failed attempt, the Philippine government announced that essential supplies reached critical levels,' he told VOA Mandarin. 'Manila did manage to resupply BRP Teresa Magbanua through a helicopter, signaling this potential shift.' Parada added, 'This potential shift from maritime to aerial resupply emissions in the future is obviously a risk because China has also been escalating aerial operations in the South China Sea. 'Beijing would increase its aerial presence in the Spratlys and send fighter jets to its artificial islands for extended deployments. I think the goal there really would be to make aerial resupply emissions an incredibly dangerous policy option for Manila. That way, it limits Manila's ability to sustain a long-term presence in the disputed territories.' According to the latest data from the Philippine Department of Foreign Affairs, the administration of Ferdinand Marcos Jr. has lodged 176 diplomatic protests with the Chinese government, which claims almost the entire South China Sea, putting it in conflict with Brunei, Indonesia, Malaysia, the Philippines, Taiwan and Vietnam. Song Zhongping, a Chinese military expert and researcher at Xuanyuan (Hong Kong) Science and Technology Exchange Center, says any Chinese military moves in the airspace over the South China Sea are due to what he calls 'illegal expansion' by the Philippines. 'Whether it's Scarborough Shoal, Second Thomas Shoal or Sabina Shoal, these are all China's sovereign territories,' he told VOA Mandarin, repeating Beijing’s claims. 'If the Philippines wants to conduct patrols or resupply by air, this in itself is violating the security of China's airspace, and China will inevitably take certain measures to intercept it.' An article published on September 2 by the Beijing-based think tank South China Sea Strategic Situation Probing Initiative says since 2024, the Philippines has 'repeatedly dispatched military aircraft to invade the islands and reefs of Spratly Islands and Macclesfield Bank' and also sent military aircraft to carry out airdrops and replenishment missions over the sea, indicating that 'air intrusion is becoming another major path for the Philippines to cause trouble in the South China Sea.' The article warned that if the Philippines insists on carrying out an 'air invasion,' China will have to take corresponding measures, and 'once there is friction or even collision, the consequences will be much more serious than the collision with a ship.' Su Tzu-yun, a research fellow and director at the Division of Defense Strategy and Resources in Taiwan, says China is more likely to take coercive actions in the air, making it difficult for the Philippines to defend its sovereignty. 'China may first take measures to interfere, as it does with the United States and Australian military aircraft, and it will scatter thermal flares to interfere so that Philippine helicopters may not be able to get close,' Su told VOA Mandarin. 'It may use jets to create turbulence, meaning it uses air from the jet tail to interfere with the Philippine helicopter when it’s flying.' Su says Beijing is taking more aggressive interception actions, which greatly increase the risk of accidental conflict. 'The number of Chinese ships has increased. Second, coupled with the previous conflict between China and the Philippines in the sea, which caused injuries to Philippine coast guards, and now it threatens to use stronger means against the Philippine so-called aircraft, so it is moving the definition of gray zone operations closer to the direction of war.' Philippine National Defense Secretary Gilberto Teodoro in August said the Philippines plans to purchase 40 new multirole fighter jets and mid-range missiles to strengthen its territorial defense, Reuters reported. The U.S. in July repeated its commitment to the Philippines’ security after China’s increasingly assertive actions in the South China Sea. US reiterates 'ironclad' commitment to Philippines amid China actions in South China Sea. Parts of the disputed South China Sea are believed to be rich in oil and gas, and the waters are an important transit point for trillions of dollars in annual shipping. The Hague-based intergovernmental Permanent Court of Arbitration in 2016 unanimously ruled that China’s claim to almost all the South China Sea had 'no legal basis,' which Beijing rejected.

Indonesia's dwindling middle class seen dimming economic outlook	KARAWANG, Indonesia — Rahmat Hidayat lost his job when the shoe factory he worked for closed down last year in the industrial town of Karawang in Indonesia's West Java. The 44-year-old now earns less than half of what he used to make by selling grilled meatballs. Unable to afford his wife's diabetes medication, Rahmat picks herbs to make a tonic instead. Like Rahmat, millions of working to middle class Indonesians have become poorer, largely due to an increase in layoffs and a drop in the number of job opportunities since the pandemic. This trend bodes ill for the outlook for Southeast Asia's biggest economy — household consumption accounts for over half of gross domestic product — as well as the widely held investment thesis that an expanding middle class will drive Indonesia's ambition to become a high-income nation by 2045. It also poses a challenge for the incoming administration of President Prabowo Subianto, who won a February election by a landslide on promises to boost economic growth and create 19 million of jobs. Prabowo takes office on Oct. 20. 'Pushing the economy to grow higher with weak consumption is difficult,' said Mohammad Faisal, an economist at the Jakarta-based Center of Reform on Economics. The government classifies those who spend between $132 to $643 a month as middle class, based on a World Bank criteria. This group is key to economic growth as their spending accounts for nearly 40% of private consumption, and more than 80% if combined with the aspiring middle class, who spend $57 to $132. The size of the middle class, however, has dropped from 21.5% of the total population in 2019 to 17.1% in 2024, according to official data released last month. Even though Indonesia's economy has bounced back after the pandemic, with growth of around above 5% a year since 2022 amid generally low inflation, this shrinking middle class is likely to pressure future growth, as the government will have to contend with lower tax revenues and a possibly more subsidies, said Jahen Rezki, an analyst from the University of Indonesia. 'In the long run, if the middle class dwindles, it will certainly be a big burden for the state,' he said. Big state spending One of the main reasons for the demise of the middle class is the changing labour market. A large portion of the foreign investment coming into Indonesia has targeted industries such as mining, which are becoming much less labour intensive as more cutting-edge technology is deployed. Also, stronger competition from lower cost destinations such as China, especially in the textile sector, has squeezed factories, leading to lay offs that the textile association said were the worst in the last decade. Prabowo's brother and adviser Hashim Djojohadikusumo said the incoming government will help the middle class by creating millions of new jobs from projects like the $28 billion free meals programme and the building of millions of homes. 'We want to create a lot of small, medium and micro entrepreneurs, for example through our housing program. We want to build 3 million units of houses, in villages and cities. That's to create middle class,' he told Reuters recently. However, how much the next government is able to spend on welfare schemes might be limited, especially next year when a large amount of government debt is due to mature, said Teguh Yudo Wicaksono, an economist at Islam Internasional Indonesia University. For former factory worker Rahmat, the best help the government can give is a handout he can use to expand his food business, as it has become increasingly difficult to find a job. His wife Fatimah said her children often ask for their favorite spicy meat dish, but she can only afford to feed them instant noodles with eggs most of the time. 'I could only tell my kids to please wait until dad got his fair compensation from the factory, we will cook a delicious meal again,' she said.	https://www.voanews.com/a/indonesia-s-dwindling-middle-class-seen-dimming-economic-outlook-/7779794.html	2024-09-11T03:29:30-07:00	
Hurricane Francine takes aim at Louisiana coast	BATON ROUGE, La. — Hurricane Francine barreled early Wednesday toward Louisiana and is expected to make landfall in coming hours as forecasters raised threats of potentially deadly storm surge, widespread flooding and destructive winds on the northern U.S. Gulf coast. Francine drew fuel from exceedingly warm Gulf of Mexico waters to jump from a tropical storm to a Category 1 hurricane on Tuesday night. The National Hurricane Center said Francine might even reach Category 2 strength with winds of 155 to 175 kph before crashing into a fragile coastal region that still hasn't fully recovered from a series of devastating hurricanes since 2020. Louisiana Gov. Jeff Landry warned at midday Tuesday — when Francine was still a tropical storm — that residents around south Louisiana and in the heavily populated state capital of Baton Rouge and nearby New Orleans — should 'batten down all the hatches' and finish last preparations before a 24-hour window to do so closed. Once Francine makes landfall, Landry said, residents should stay in place rather than venture out into waterlogged roads and risk blocking first responders or utility crews working to repair power lines. The governor said the Louisiana National Guard is being deployed to parishes that could be impacted by Francine. They are equipped with food, water, nearly 400 high-water vehicles, about 100 boats and 50 helicopters to respond to the storm, including possible search-and-rescue operations. Francine was centered Wednesday morning about 395 kilometers southwest of Morgan City, Louisiana, and was moving northeast at 17 kph with maximum sustained winds of 90 150 kmh, the Miami-based hurricane center said. Some additional strengthening is expected Wednesday morning and then Francine is expected to weaken quickly after it moves inland. A hurricane warning was in effect along the Louisiana coast from Cameron eastward to Grand Isle, about 80 kilometers south of New Orleans, according to the center. A storm surge warning stretched from the Mississippi-Alabama border to the Alabama-Florida border Such a warning means there's a chance of life-threatening flooding. In downtown New Orleans, cars and trucks were lined up for blocks on Tuesday to collect sandbags from the parking lot of a local YMCA. CEO Erika Mann said Tuesday that 1,000 bags of sand had already been distributed by volunteers later in the day to people hoping to protect homes from possible flooding. One resident picking up sandbags was Wayne Grant, 33, who moved to New Orleans last year and was nervous for his first potential hurricane in the city. The low-lying rental apartment he shares with his partner had already flooded out in a storm the year before and he was not taking any chances this time around. 'It was like a kick in the face, we've been trying to stay up on the weather ever since,' Grant said. 'We're super invested in the place, even though it's not ours.' Francine is the sixth named storm of the Atlantic hurricane season. There's a danger of life-threatening storm surge as well as damaging hurricane-force winds, said Brad Reinhart, a senior hurricane specialist at the hurricane center. There's also the potential for 10 to 20 centimeters of rain with the possibility of 30 centimeters locally across much of Louisiana and Mississippi through Friday morning, Reinhart said. The hurricane center said parts of Mississippi, Alabama and the Florida Panhandle were at risk of 'considerable' flash and urban flooding starting Wednesday, followed by a threat of possible flooding later in the week into the lower Mississippi Valley and lower Tennessee Valley as the soggy remnants of Francine sweep inland. Francine is taking aim at a Louisiana coastline that has yet to fully recover since hurricanes Laura and Delta decimated Lake Charles in 2020, followed a year later by Hurricane Ida. A little over three years after Ida trashed his home in the Dulac community of coastal Louisiana's Terrebonne Parish – and about a month after he finished rebuilding – Coy Verdin was preparing for another hurricane. 'We had to gut the whole house,' he recalled in a telephone interview, rattling off a memorized inventory of the work, including a new roof and new windows. Verdin, 55, strongly considered moving farther inland, away from the home where he makes his living on nearby Bayou Grand Caillou. After rebuilding, he said he's there to stay. 'As long as I can. It's getting rough, though,' he said. Francine's storm surge on the Louisiana coast could reach as much as 3 meters from Cameron to Port Fourchon and into Vermilion Bay, forecasters said. They said landfall was likely somewhere between Sabine Pass — on the Texas-Louisiana line — and Morgan City, Louisiana, about 350 kilometers to the east.	https://www.voanews.com/a/hurricane-francine-takes-aim-at-louisiana-coast/7779769.html	2024-09-11T02:49:33-07:00

Trump, Harris exchange barbs on debate stage	In the U.S. presidential election, the Republican Party’s presidential nominee, Donald Trump, clashed with his Democratic Party rival, Kamala Harris, Tuesday evening over issues such as abortion, immigration and foreign policy.

Vietnam's export hub factories may face weeks of disruption after Typhoon Yagi	HANOI, VIETNAM — Typhoon Yagi severely damaged a large number of factories and flooded warehouses in northern Vietnam's export-oriented industrial hubs, forcing plants to shut, with some expected to take weeks to resume full operations, executives said. The typhoon, the strongest in Asia this year, made landfall in Vietnam's northern coast on Saturday and was still causing deadly floods and landslides on Wednesday, killing dozens and ravaging key infrastructure, including power networks and roads. The disruptions could affect global supply chains as Vietnam hosts large operations of multinationals that mostly export their products to the United States, Europe and other developed countries. In the coastal city of Haiphong, one of the areas worst hit by the typhoon, 95% of businesses were expected to resume some activities on Tuesday, the body managing Haiphong industrial zones said on its website. 'Many businesses had their roofs blown off, some walls were torn and collapsed, gates, fences, signs, camera systems, garages and sliding metal doors were overturned, water flooded into factories,' said a report on its website. In the DEEP C industrial zones, which host factories in Haiphong and the neighboring province of Quang Ninh, 20 out of 150 investors' plants will be out of service for at least a few weeks, said Bruno Jaspaert, head of DEEP C industrial zones. Based on a review of his clients, he expected power consumption at those facilities would remain one-third below normal for weeks or months because many companies were busy rebuilding their damaged factories. Goods ready for export or delivery to clients were flooded in warehouses in the area, companies said. In another industrial park in Haiphong, South Korea's LG Electronics said it had partly resumed work on Tuesday, although the factory's walls were crushed on Saturday and a warehouse with refrigerators and washing machines had been flooded. 'Many of them are gone with the wind,' said Calvin Nguyen, head of Vietnamese logistics firm WeDo Forwarding Co., referring to products that were to be delivered to the United States and the European Union, without specifying which goods. The company's three warehouses in Haiphong had their roofs blown off and on Wednesday were still flooded, he said. The industry ministry did not reply to a request for comment. Power cuts Power outages were still affecting several areas in the north, as Vietnam's state-owned power distributor EVN worked to restore dozens of damaged electricity lines. In Quang Ninh, along the coast north of Haiphong, many factories still had no electricity or water service, Jaspaert said. Chinese solar panel maker Jinko Solar's factory in Quang Ninh was severely damaged, one of its workers said, noting on Tuesday work had not resumed as windows had been smashed and the roof had been blown away. Jinko was not immediately available for a comment. Far from the coast, the industrial hubs of Thai Nguyen and Bac Giang which host large factories of multinationals such as Samsung Electronics and Apple supplier Foxconn were also facing severe flooding. Samsung's large facilities in Thai Nguyen had not been visibly affected on Tuesday evening, according to a Reuters witness. Water was receding on Wednesday in the province, about 60 kilometers north of Hanoi, but more rain was expected.	https://www.voanews.com/a/vietnam-s-export-hub-factories-may-face-weeks-of-disruption-after-typhoon-yagi/7779700.html	2024-09-10T22:58:27-07:00	
Pope Francis’ visit puts Indonesia’s religious freedom under spotlight	JAKARTA, INDONESIA — During his three-day visit to Indonesia last week, Pope Francis, the head of the Catholic Church, urged Indonesians to live up to the promise represented by the nation’s own motto — 'Unity in Diversity.' While praising Indonesia’s constitution, which guarantees religious freedom, Francis also warned in an address following a meeting with President Joko Widodo that the diversity of the world’s largest Muslim-majority nation can also lead to conflict. Francis emphasized the importance of interfaith dialogue to eliminate prejudices and build mutual respect. 'This is indispensable for meeting common challenges, including that of countering extremism and intolerance, which through the distortion of religion attempt to improve their views by using deception and violence,' Francis said. Indonesia’s statistical agency says that 87% of the country’s 280 million people are Muslim. However, 2.9% of the total population is Catholic, making its Christian community the third largest in Asia after the Philippines and China. Indonesia’s struggle against religious intolerance Despite legal guarantees of religious freedom, which includes a Religious Harmony bill signed into law in 2006, research by Human Rights Watch indicates a flare-up of religious intolerance. Examples include the imprisonment of Jakarta’s Christian governor for blasphemy in 2016, violence against religious minorities; and problems faced by some Christian groups seeking to secure building permits for churches. Novi from Kupang, East Nusa Tenggara, a Catholic, who traveled to Jakarta to witness Pope Francis' visit to Istiqlal Mosque, hopes the visit can encourage a revival of religious tolerance in the country. 'I’m really sad when I hear news reports saying that churches faced difficulties in setting up a church and require approval of the majority from the surrounding community and municipal and provincial office,' she said. In 2006, a group of religious and community leaders established the Religious Harmony Forum (FKUB), dedicated to protecting religious harmony, including making recommendations to the mayor or regent on the construction of any new house of worship. But according to Andreas Harsono, a senior Indonesian researcher at Human Rights Watch, the forum has been politicized over the years. In hopes of quelling religious intolerance, Minister of Religious Affairs Yaqut Cholil Qoumas said a new presidential regulation is being developed that will no longer allow the FKUB to recommend the establishment of a house of worship. That right will remain with the Ministry of Religious Affairs. Andreas Harsono of the Human Rights Watch sees this as a 'step in the right direction.' 'The FKUB recommendations are proven to be the most damaging of the 2006 regulations on religious harmony. The religious harmony regulation basically makes the so-called majority have veto power over the minorities in Indonesia. It's turning Indonesia into an intolerant Muslim-majority country,' he said. Halili Hasan, executive director of the SETARA Institute, agrees with abolishing the FKUB’s right to recommend. He added that FKUB has not been able to prevent and handle various violations of freedom of religion and belief. SETARA Institute is a think tank that advocates for democracy and human rights in Indonesia and releases an annual report on the condition of freedom of religion and belief. The report in 2023 listed at least 65 places of worship that experienced disturbances throughout that year, ranging from objections to the construction of a house of worship to the sealing off of places of worship. That compares to 50 such incidents in the previous year. Still, the Ministry of Religious Affair’s Religious Harmony Index survey for 2023 found a steady increase in religious harmony from 2020 to 2023. The index was scored from 0 to 100, with 100 being the most harmonious. The national score for 2023 was 76.02, the highest score recorded in the last five years. Eli Trisiana is a Muslim and government civil servant who came to see Pope Francis. 'We need to hold a heart-to-heart dialogue with those deemed religious intolerant,’’ Eli Trisiana said. ‘’We cannot deal with them using violence. I think that is the best method to solve differences of opinion. In Islam there are verses taught to us that reconcile with non-believers, which is 'unto you your religion and unto me my religion.' Interfaith dialogue During an interfaith dialogue at Istiqlal Mosque in Jakarta, 87-year-old Pope Francis met with representatives of Indonesia’s six officially recognized religions — Islam, Buddhism, Confucianism, Hinduism, Protestantism and Catholicism — along with a representative for traditional beliefs. Francis and the grand imam of the Istiqlal Mosque, Nasaruddin Umar, signed a 'Human Fraternity' document declaring their commitment to interfaith harmony. The document calls for religious leaders to overcome two serious crises faced by the world: dehumanization and climate change. The grand imam said he won’t let this signing be in vain and that he plans to follow up with a future plan of action that supports interfaith dialogue and true religious harmony.	https://www.voanews.com/a/pope-francis-visit-puts-indonesia-s-religious-freedom-under-spotlight/7779698.html	2024-09-10T22:51:59-07:00	
Iran president heads to Iraq on first foreign visit	Tehran, Ian — Iran's new president, Masoud Pezeshkian, is to visit neighboring Iraq on Wednesday as he moves to deepen already close ties on his first foreign visit since taking office. Pezeshkian has vowed to make relations with neighboring countries a priority as he seeks to ease Iran's international isolation and mitigate the impact of U.S.-led sanctions on its economy. His visit comes after Western powers on Tuesday announced fresh sanctions on Iran for supplying Russia with short-range missiles for use against Ukraine. It also comes amid turmoil in the Middle East sparked by the war in Gaza, which has drawn in Iran-backed armed groups around the region and complicated Baghdad's ties with Washington. On Tuesday night, an explosion was heard at the base of a U.S.-led anti-militant coalition at the Baghdad international airport, according to Iraqi security officials. A spokesperson for the Iranian-backed Ketaeb Hezbollah (Hezbollah Brigades) in Iraq said the Tuesday night attack aimed to 'disrupt the Iranian president's visit to Baghdad.' Ties between Iran and Iraq, both Shiite-majority countries, have grown closer since the U.S.-led invasion of 2003 toppled the Sunni-dominated regime of Iraqi dictator Saddam Hussein. Pezeshkian has directly linked shoring up ties to sanctions pressure. 'Relations with neighboring countries ... can neutralize a significant amount of pressure of the sanctions,' he said last month. Iran has suffered years of crippling Western sanctions, especially after its arch-foe the United States, under then-president Donald Trump, unilaterally abandoned a landmark nuclear deal between the Islamic republic and major powers in 2018. Pezeshkian, who assumed the presidency in late July, has made the top diplomat who negotiated the 2015 deal, Mohammad Javad Zarif, his vice president for strategic affairs as part of his bid for a more open Iran.	https://www.voanews.com/a/iran-president-heads-to-iraq-on-first-foreign-visit/7779694.html	2024-09-10T22:36:47-07:00	
Top takeaways from the Harris-Trump debate	WASHINGTON — Vice President Kamala Harris and former President Donald Trump faced off on Tuesday night in Philadelphia in a debate that comes less than two months before the presidential election. The race is tight between the two candidates. Among registered voters, Harris leads Trump by 1 point — 49% to 48% — according to the latest PBS/NPR/Marist poll. That result falls within the margin of error. The ABC debate marks the first face-to-face meeting between Harris, 59, and Trump, 78. A former prosecutor, Harris is the first woman, Black American and South Asian American vice president. Trump, a businessman who has been criticized for his sexist and racist remarks, is the first convicted felon to run for president and, if elected, would be 82 by the end of his term. During what could be their only debate, Harris and Trump sparred on issues ranging from the economy and immigration to democracy, abortion and the Israel-Hamas war. Here are some of the key takeaways from the debate. Economy The economy was the debate’s first topic, with Harris saying she wants to create an 'opportunity economy.' She cited her plan to increase the tax credit for starting new small businesses from $5,000 to $50,000. 'I am actually the only person on this stage who has a plan that is about lifting up the middle class,' she said, adding that Trump wants to help the rich with tax cuts. Trump has said he will further reduce the corporate tax rate from the current 21% to 15%. Harris wants to increase the rate to 28%. It was 35% before Trump’s 2017 tax bill. Trump spent much of his answer on the economy talking about immigration. However, he also said he created one of the best economies in the United States, without offering specifics, and that he will do it again. 'Look, we’ve had a terrible economy, because inflation, which is really known as a country buster,' Trump said. Immigration Immigration has been one of the biggest issues in this presidential campaign. Throughout the debate, Trump lambasted the Biden administration’s handling of immigration – often when the moderators asked questions unrelated to immigration. Trump repeated his false claims that immigrants are 'taking over the towns. They’re taking over buildings. They’re going in violently.' He also cited baseless conspiracy theories about Haitian immigrants in Ohio eating pet dogs and cats. Harris criticized Trump for killing a bipartisan bill earlier this year that would have put 1,500 more border agents on the U.S. southern border. Harris has said she would support the bill. Abortion Trump and Harris grew increasingly combative when debating the question of abortion. As president, Trump appointed three justices to the U.S. Supreme Court who helped form the majority that overturned the constitutional right to abortion in 2022. That decision laid the groundwork for states to impose restrictive rules on abortion around the country. 'The Supreme Court had great courage in doing it,' Trump said during the debate. When asked if he would support a national abortion ban, he said: 'No, I’m not in favor of abortion ban. But it doesn't matter because this issue has now been taken over by the states.' He also said he would not oppose abortion in cases of rape, incest or when the life of the mother is at risk. He also falsely claimed that Democrats support abortions 'after birth.' In response, Harris emphasized the importance of women’s reproductive rights. 'One does not have to abandon their faith or deeply held beliefs to agree the government and Donald Trump certainly should not be telling a woman what to do with her body,' she said. She added that she would support Congress passing a bill to codify federal abortion protections and, as president, sign it into law. Rule of law, threats to democracy and Jan. 6 Harris was a prosecutor for a dozen years, first as San Francisco district attorney and then as California’s attorney general. A central component of Harris’ campaign has been portraying Trump as a threat to democracy. During the debate, Harris highlighted Trump’s status as a convicted felon. Trump replied with the unsubstantiated accusation that Harris and the Biden administration are 'weaponizing' the government to prosecute him When asked by the moderator whether Trump would acknowledge that he lost the 2020 presidential election, he replied with the false claim that he actually won the election. On the Jan. 6 insurrection, Trump said, 'I had nothing to do with that, other than they asked me to make a speech.' 'It’s time to turn the page,' Harris said. 'There is a place in our campaign for you to stand for our country, to stand for democracy, to stand for rule of law and to end the chaos and to end the approach that is about attacking the foundations of our democracy,' she added. Russia-Ukraine War and Israel-Hamas War In addition to domestic policy, the moderators also pressed Harris and Trump on foreign policy issues, including the ongoing wars between Ukraine and Russia, and Israel and Hamas. On the Israel-Hamas war, Harris said the United States would defend Israel. She added that she supports a two-state solution. The war 'must end immediately, and the way it will end is we need a cease-fire deal, and we need the hostages out,' Harris said. Trump claimed that 'Israel will be gone' if Harris becomes president, which is unsubstantiated. Trump also repeated his claim that the Oct. 7 massacre by Hamas in southern Israel would have never happened if he were president. Trump said the Russia-Ukraine war would not have happened if he were president. When asked if he wants Ukraine to win the war against Russia, Trump would only say, 'I want the war to stop.' Harris replied: 'If Donald Trump were president, Putin would be sitting in Kyiv right now.'	https://www.voanews.com/a/top-takeaways-from-the-harris-trump-debate-/7779682.html	2024-09-10T21:51:14-07:00	
Arrested Nigerian workers' union leader freed	Abuja, Nigeria — The Nigerian secret police released labor union leader Joe Ajaero on Tuesday after hours of interrogation over alleged terrorism financing. Ajaero's arrest Monday sparked criticism about what critics see as a government crackdown on dissent. Ajaero, was released by the Department of State Services, or DSS, after he was arrested at the Abuja airport while on his way to the United Kingdom to attend a labor conference. He said Tuesday that DSS kept his passport. He said the police questioned him for hours about alleged terrorism financing involving British national Andrew Wynne and last month's anti-government protests in Nigeria. Ajaero is a prominent critic of the Nigerian government and has led many demonstrations to denounce reforms introduced by President Bola Tinubu last year. Hamisu Santuraki, the spokesperson of the United Action Front of Civil Society, a coalition of civil society groups, said the government should have asked Ajaero to come in for questioning. 'It’s not done anywhere — arresting somebody without sending him an invitation, it is wrong, they should've sent him a letter,' Santuraki said. We just want them to release his passport, so we're having a meeting. Nigeria is our country.' Later Tuesday, a government spokesman, Bayo Onanuga, said Ajaero was invited to speak to a law enforcement agency and was stopped from traveling abroad because he 'snubbed' that invitation. In a statement released on X, Onanuga also said Nigeria 'categorically denies any human rights abuse.' Santuraki said the coalition and the Labor Congress are deciding on what steps to take. The Nigerian government is facing a wave of criticism from rights groups who accuse it of trying to stifle dissent and free expression. Investigative journalist Isaac Bristol was recently detained on charges of leaking classified and restricted documents, sedition, and tax evasion, among other allegations. Another journalist, David Hundeyin, was declared wanted by the police last week. Ajaero's arrest came days after he criticized a decision by Nigerian officials to increase the gasoline price by 39 percent. Nigerian authorities said global oil market forces determined the new pump price of refined petrol, which had more than quadrupled in Nigeria since President Tinubu scrapped fuel subsidies last year. On Monday, the Socio-Economic Rights Accountability Project, or SERAP, said state operatives also raided their offices. The group this week called for a probe of the national oil company. 'We consider this an act of aggression, intimidation and harassment by the government, and it might not be unconnected with the statement that SERAP had issued over the weekend calling on the president to direct the NNPC to reverse the price of petroleum,' said Kolawole Oluwadare, a deputy director at SERAP. 'We consider this as an instance of the escalation of attacks against the civic space and this of course is not acceptable in a democracy.' Ajaero was also arrested in November by police in southeastern Imo state, moments before he was to lead a rally.	https://www.voanews.com/a/arrested-nigerian-workers-union-leader-freed/7779664.html	2024-09-10T21:17:07-07:00	
Taylor Swift endorses Kamala Harris for president after debate ends	WASHINGTON — Taylor Swift, one of the music industry's biggest stars, endorsed Kamala Harris for president shortly after the debate ended on Tuesday night. 'I think she is a steady-handed, gifted leader and I believe we can accomplish so much more in this country if we are led by calm and not chaos,' Swift wrote in an Instagram post, which included a link to a voter registration website. Swift has a dedicated following among young women, a key demographic in the November election, and her latest tour has generated more than $1 billion in ticket sales. In a half hour, the post received more than 2.3 million likes. She included a picture of herself holding her cat Benjamin Button, and she signed the message 'Childless Cat Lady.' The remark is a reference to 3-year-old comments made by JD Vance, Donald Trump's running mate, about women without children not having an equal stake in the country's future. A Harris senior campaign official said the endorsement was not coordinated with the campaign. Tim Walz, Harris' running mate, appeared to learn about the endorsement in the middle of a live interview on MSNBC. As Rachel Maddow read the text, Walz broke into a smile and patted his chest. 'That was eloquent. And it was clear,' Walz said. 'And that's the kind of courage we need in America to stand up.' Swift wrote that her endorsement was partially prompted by Trump's decision to post AI-generated pictures suggesting that she had endorsed him. One showed Swift dressed as Uncle Sam, and the text said, 'Taylor wants YOU to VOTE for DONALD TRUMP.' Trump's posts 'brought me to the conclusion that I need to be very transparent about my actual plans for this election as a voter,' Swift wrote. She added that 'I've done my research, and I've made my choice.' The Trump campaign dismissed Swift's endorsement. 'This is further evidence that the Democrat Party has unfortunately become a party of the wealthy elites,' said spokesperson Karoline Leavitt. 'There's many Swifties for Trump out there in America,' she said, herself included. Swift's endorsement was not exactly a surprise. In 2020, she supported President Joe Biden, and she cheered for Harris in her debate against then-Vice President Mike Pence. She also was openly critical of Trump, saying he had stoked 'the fires of white supremacy and racism.' Swift is a popular figure nationwide, but especially among Democrats. An October 2023 Fox News poll found that 55% of voters overall, including 68% of Democrats, said they had a favorable view of Swift. Republicans were divided, with 43% having a favorable opinion and 45% an unfavorable one. AP VoteCast suggests that a partisan divide on Swift was apparent as early as 2018. That's the year Swift made her first political endorsement, supporting Tennessee Democrat Phil Bredesen for Senate over Republican Marsha Blackburn. VoteCast found that among Tennessee voters that year, 55% of Democrats and just 19% of Republicans said they had a favorable opinion of Swift. Blackburn won by a comfortable margin in the deep red state. Swift is the leading nominee at Wednesday's MTV Video Music Awards. While it's unclear whether Swift will attend the show in New York, she could use any acceptance speeches to elaborate on her support of Harris.	https://www.voanews.com/a/taylor-swift-endorses-kamala-harris-for-president-after-debate-ends/7779656.html	2024-09-10T21:00:13-07:00	
Vietnam death toll from Typhoon Yagi at 141 as Hanoi faces flood risk	HANOI, Vietnam — The death toll in Vietnam from Typhoon Yagi has risen to 141, the government said on Wednesday as it warned that flood waters were causing the Red River to rise rapidly and threaten to inundate downtown districts of the capital Hanoi. Heavy rains brought by Typhoon Yagi have triggered deadly landslides and floods throughout northern Vietnam, killing 141 people with 59 others missing, the disaster management agency said. There has also been severe property damage and disruption to business and industry. State media reports late on Tuesday said the water level of the Red River in Hanoi had been rising 10 centimeters every hour. Some schools in Hanoi have told students to stay home for the rest of the week due to flood concerns, while thousands of residents living in low-lying areas have been evacuated, according to sources, government and state media.	https://www.voanews.com/a/vietnam-death-toll-from-typhoon-yagi-at-141-as-hanoi-faces-flood-risk/7779648.html	2024-09-10T20:38:11-07:00	
US, UK top diplomats head to Ukraine with eye on weapons	Przemysl, Poland — The top U.S. and British diplomats headed together into Ukraine on Wednesday to discuss further easing rules on firing Western weapons into Russia, whose alleged acquisition of Iranian missiles has raised new fears. In a rare joint trip, U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken was taking the train to Kyiv with Foreign Secretary David Lammy, whose 2-month-old Labor government has vowed to keep up Britain's role as a key defender of Ukraine. The pair, who boarded the train early Wednesday at the Polish border town of Przemysl, are expected to meet in Kyiv with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy, who has kept pressing the West for weapons with more firepower and fewer restrictions. U.S. President Joe Biden, asked in Washington whether he would let Ukraine use longer-range weapons, said: 'We're working that out right now.' Biden, while strongly supportive of Ukraine, has previously made clear he wants to avoid devolving into direct conflict between the United States and Russia, the world's two leading nuclear powers. Blinken, speaking Tuesday in London alongside Lammy, said the United States was committed to providing Ukraine 'what they need when they need it to be most effective in dealing with the Russian aggression.' But Blinken, who is on his fifth trip to Kyiv since the war, said it was also important to see if Ukrainian forces could maintain and operate particular weaponry. Pressed later in an interview with Sky News on whether the United States would green-light long-range weapons, Blinken said, 'We never rule out, but when we rule in, we want to make sure it's done in such a way that it can advance what the Ukrainians are trying to achieve.' The renewed talk about long-range weapons comes after the United States said that Iran has sent short-range missiles to Russia, which could strike Ukraine with them within weeks. The Iranian shipments have raised fears that Moscow would be freed up to use its long-range missiles against comparatively unscathed areas in western Ukraine. Western powers announced new sanctions against Iran's clerical state over the sale, which defied repeated warnings. The United States earlier this year gave its blessing for Ukraine to use Western weapons to hit Russian forces when in direct conflict across the border. But Ukraine last month launched a surprise, daring offensive directly into Russian territory in Kursk, hoping to restore morale and divert Moscow as Russian troops trudge forward in the front lines of eastern Ukraine. British media reports said Biden, who meets Prime Minister Keir Starmer on Friday, was set to end objections to letting Ukraine fire long-range Storm Shadow missiles into Russia. Britain has repeatedly pushed the United States, by far Ukraine's biggest military supplier, to be more forward on weapons. One key ask of Ukraine is to loosen restrictions on U.S.-supplied Army Tactical Missile Systems, or ATACMS, which can hit targets up to 300 kilometers away. In a joint letter to Biden, leading members of Congress from the rival Republican Party asked him to act on ATACMS immediately. 'As long as it is conducting its brutal, full-scale war of aggression, Russia must not be given a sanctuary from which it can execute its war crimes against Ukraine with impunity,' said the letter signed by Representative Mike McCaul, chairman of the House Foreign Affairs Committee. Republicans, however, are deeply divided over Ukraine, and a victory in November by Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump over Biden's political heir Kamala Harris could dramatically shift US policy. Trump aides have suggested that if he wins, he would leverage aid to force Kyiv into territorial concessions to Russia to end the war.	https://www.voanews.com/a/us-uk-top-diplomats-head-to-ukraine-with-eye-on-weapons/7779634.html	2024-09-10T20:19:20-07:00	
Tigray leader reports talks with archrival Eritrea	Mekelle/Addis Ababa, Ethiopia — The leader of Tigray People's Liberation Front Debretsion Gebremichael has reported previously undisclosed talks between his region and the leaders of Eritrea. Speaking at a press conference in the regional capital Mekelle, Ethiopia, on Tuesday, Debretsion said the first round of talks took place about six months ago in Dubai, United Arab Emirates. He told reporters that Getachew Reda, the president of the Tigray Interim Regional Administration, represented the TPLF at the talks in Dubai. Without indicating venue and date, Debretsion also said there have been subsequent meetings with the Eritrean leaders after the initial meeting in Dubai. 'This was decided by the TPLF Executive Committee,' he said. 'Accordingly, President Getachew Reda has engaged with Eritrea's leaders. This is something that I know and my party's Executive Committee knows.' He said the talks, which were aimed at creating peace between the two sides, had a positive result. 'The abduction of citizens, looting and other activities by the Eritrean forces has improved and eased as a result,' he said. He said the TPLF party’s intention is to 'make peace with all our neighbors, including the Fano forces and the Eritrean government.' 'Based on this principle, Getachew met with the Eritrean leaders, which is known by the honorable prime minister and my part. But this is for a good cause and for peace,' he said. Debretsion indicated that Prime Minister Abiy Ahmed has been encouraging them to engage in the talks. He adds that Getachew has also briefed the Ethiopian leader about the talks. There has been no immediate reaction from Ethiopia prime minister’s office, Eritrea and from IRA leader Getachew. VOA’s Horn of Africa Service has reached out to the Ethiopia prime minister’s office and government communication service but has not received a response. Also, repeated attempts to get reaction from the Eritrea’s ministry of information were not successful. The governments of Ethiopia and Eritrea were allies during a deadly two-year war in Tigray that killed thousands. Human rights organizations and the United States have accused Eritrean and Ethiopian forces of committing war crimes during the war in Tigray, a charge the two governments denied. In November 2022, the Ethiopian government and TPLF signed the Cessation of Hostilities Agreement in Pretoria, South Africa, committing to a permanent ending of fighting. Tigray regional officials allege that Eritrean troops remain in parts of their region despite the Pretoria agreement’s call for the withdrawal of foreign forces. The agreement called for the withdrawal of all foreign forces and non-Ethiopian National Defense Forces, referring to the Eritrean forces and Ethiopian militias allied with the Ethiopian government. During his visit to Ethiopia, Hammer will review the implementation of the Pretoria Cessation of Hostilities Agreement on northern Ethiopia with the signatories, the State Department said in a statement. 'The United States remains committed to supporting the Ethiopian government and the Tigray Interim Regional Administration to achieve lasting peace, including through effective disarmament, demobilization, and reintegration for ex-combatants; an orderly and peaceful return of internally displaced persons; and advancing transitional justice and accountability,' the statement read. Hammer will also discuss with Ethiopian officials their efforts to advance dialogue to end violence in the Amhara and Oromia regions, it added.	https://www.voanews.com/a/tigray-leader-reports-talks-with-archrival-eritrea/7779628.html	2024-09-10T20:12:08-07:00

China takes lead in critical technology research after 'switching places' with US	SINGAPORE — An Australian think tank that tracks tech competitiveness says China is now the world leader in research on almost 90% of critical technologies. In a newly released report, the research group adds there is also a high risk of Beijing securing a monopoly on defense-related tech, including drones, satellites and collaborative robots — those that can work safely alongside humans. Analysts say the huge leap forward for China is the result of heavy state investment over the past two decades. They add that despite the progress, Beijing is still dependent on other countries for key tech components and lacks self-sufficiency. The report from the government-funded Australian Strategic Policy Institute, or ASPI, released last Thursday, says China led the way in research into 57 out of 64 advanced technologies in the five years from 2019-2023. ASPI's Critical Technology Tracker ranks countries' innovation capabilities based on the number of appearances in the top 10% of research papers. It focuses on crucial technologies from a range of fields including artificial intelligence, biotechnology, cyber and defense. The report found that 'China and the United States have effectively switched places as the overwhelming leader in research in just two decades.' China led in only three of the 64 technologies between 2003 and 2007 but has shot up in the rankings, replacing the U.S., which is now a frontrunner in just seven critical technologies. Josh Kennedy-White is a technology strategist based in Singapore. He says China's huge leap is a 'direct result of its aggressive, state-driven research and development investments over the past two decades.' He adds that the shift toward China is 'particularly stark in fields like artificial intelligence, quantum computing and advanced aircraft engines, where China has transitioned from a laggard to a leader in a relatively short period.' ASPI also determines the risk of countries holding a monopoly on the research of critical technologies. They currently classify 24 technologies as 'high risk' of being monopolized — all by Beijing. Ten technologies are newly classified as 'high risk' this year, with many of them linked to the defense industry. 'The potential monopoly risk in 24 technology areas, especially those in defense-related fields like radars and drones, is concerning in the current and future geopolitical context,' Tobias Feakin, founder of consultancy firm Protostar Strategy, told VOA. Chinese President Xi Jinping has sought to boost his country's advanced manufacturing capabilities with the ambitious 'Made in China 2025' initiative. The policy, launched in 2015, aims to strengthen Beijing's self-reliance in critical sectors and make China a global tech powerhouse. Xi, according to Feakin, views advanced technologies as 'strategic priorities for China's development, national security and global competitiveness.' He adds that technologies are seen as a 'central component of China's long-term economic and geopolitical goals.' Beijing's ambitions are being closely watched in Washington, with the Biden administration working to limit China's access to advanced technology. Last week, the U.S. introduced new export controls on critical technology to China, including chip-making equipment and quantum computers and components. That announcement came shortly after U.S. national security adviser Jake Sullivan made his first ever visit to Beijing. He met with Xi and Chinese Foreign Minister Wang Yi. Sullivan told reporters that Washington 'will continue to take necessary action to prevent advanced U.S. technologies from being used to undermine national security.' The continued efforts to curb China's chip industry mean that Beijing must look further afield for advanced technology. 'Even though it leads in areas like artificial intelligence and 5G, China still depends on Taiwan, the U.S. and South Korea to produce high-end semiconductors', Kennedy-White told VOA. Describing this as China's Achilles' heel, Kennedy-White says the lack of self-sufficiency in the semiconductor industry could 'stunt Beijing's progress in artificial intelligence, quantum computing and military applications.' As China continues its dominance in critical technology research, questions have been raised over exactly how the country is making these breakthroughs. Last October, officials from the Five Eyes intelligence alliance (Australia, Canada, New Zealand, the United Kingdom and the United States) issued a joint statement accusing China of stealing intellectual property. U.S. FBI director Christopher Wray described it as an 'unprecedented threat.' Kennedy-White, managing director of Singapore-based venture catalyst firm DivisionX Global, agrees with this assessment. He says China's jump up the ASPI rankings is 'not entirely organic.' 'There is a correlation between China's rise in certain technologies and allegations of intellectual property theft,' he added. ASPI also recommends ways for other countries to close the gap on China. It advises the AUKUS alliance of Australia, the U.K. and the U.S. to join forces with Japan and South Korea to try to catch up. The report also highlights the emergence of India as a 'key center' of global research innovation and excellence. The South Asian nation now ranks in the top five countries for 45 out of the 64 technologies that are tracked by ASPI. It's a huge gain compared with 2003-2007, when India sat in the top five for only four technologies. Feakin says countries across the Asia-Pacific 'will benefit from leveraging India's growing technology expertise and influence.' It will also provide a counterbalance to 'overdependence on China's technology supply chain,' he added.	https://www.voanews.com/a/china-takes-lead-in-critical-technology-research-after-switching-places-with-us/7779603.html	2024-09-10T18:50:59-07:00	
Congress bestows highest honor on 13 troops killed during Afghanistan withdrawal	WASHINGTON — House Speaker Mike Johnson on Tuesday presented Congress' highest honor — the Congressional Gold Medal — to 13 U.S. service members who were killed during the disastrous withdrawal from Afghanistan, even as the politics of a presidential election swirled around the event. Both Democrats and Republicans supported the legislation to posthumously honor the 13 U.S. troops, who were killed along with more than 170 Afghans in a suicide bombing at the Abbey Gate at Kabul's airport in August 2021. President Joe Biden signed the legislation in December 2021. On Tuesday, the top Republican and Democratic leaders for both the House and Senate spoke at a somber ceremony in the Capitol Rotunda, hailing the lives and sacrifices of the service members. Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer called on the lawmakers gathered to 'ensure the sacrifices of all our servicemembers were not in vain.' 'We must care for them and their families and defend the values of freedom and democracy they so nobly fought for,' said Schumer, a New York Democrat. But rather than a unifying moment, the event took place against the backdrop of a bitter back-and-forth over who is to blame for the rushed and deadly evacuation from Kabul. Johnson, a Louisiana Republican and ally of Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump, scheduled the ceremony just hours before the first debate between Trump and Democrat Kamala Harris. 'They lost their lives because of this administration's catastrophic withdrawal from Afghanistan,' Johnson said at a news conference minutes before the ceremony. Then as the speaker opened the ceremony, he took another jab at how the Biden administration has defended its handling of the final months of America's longest war. 'To the families who are here, I know many of you have yet to hear these words, so I will say them: we are sorry,' Johnson said. 'The United States government should have done everything to protect our troops, those fallen and wounded at Abbey Gate deserved our best efforts, and the families who have been left to pick up the pieces continue to deserve transparency, appreciation and recognition.' Republicans on the House Foreign Affairs Committee also released a scathing investigation on Sunday into the withdrawal that cast blame on Biden's administration and minimized the role of Trump, who had signed the withdrawal deal with the Taliban. White House national security spokesperson John Kirby on Monday criticized the House report as partisan and one-sided and said it revealed little new information and contained several inaccuracies. He noted that evacuation plans had started well before the pullout, and the fall of Kabul 'moved a lot faster than anyone could have anticipated.' He also acknowledged that during the evacuation 'not everything went according to plan. Nothing ever does.' 'We hold ourselves all accountable for that,' he said of the deaths. Top military and White House officials attended the ceremony Tuesday, including Secretary of Veterans Affairs Denis McDonough and Air Force Gen. Charles Q. Brown, Jr. the chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff. Pentagon reviews have concluded that the suicide bombing was not preventable and suggestions troops may have seen the would-be bomber were not true. Regardless, Trump has thrust the withdrawal, with the backing from some of the families of the Americans killed, into the center of his campaign. Last month, his political team distributed video of him attending a wreath-laying ceremony for the fallen service members at Arlington National Cemetery on the third anniversary of the bombing, despite the cemetery's prohibition on partisan activity on the grounds as well as an altercation with a cemetery employee who was trying to make sure the campaign followed those rules. Most assessments have concluded Trump and Biden share blame for the disastrous end to the 20-year war, which saw enemy Taliban take over Afghanistan again before the last American troops even flew out of the Kabul airport. Over 2,000 U.S. troops were killed in Afghanistan. The main U.S. government watchdog for the war points to Trump's 2020 deal with the Taliban to withdraw all U.S. forces and military contractors as 'the single most important factor' in the collapse of U.S.-allied Afghan security forces and Taliban takeover. Biden's April 2021 announcement that he would proceed with the withdrawal set in motion by Trump was the second-biggest factor, the watchdog said.	https://www.voanews.com/a/congress-bestows-highest-honor-on-13-troops-killed-during-afghanistan-withdrawal/7779578.html	2024-09-10T17:50:10-07:00

House speaker pushes funding bill that includes proof of citizenship mandate	washington — House Speaker Mike Johnson vowed Tuesday to press ahead with requiring proof of citizenship for new voters as part of a bill to avoid a partial government shutdown in three weeks, though the measure appeared likely to be voted down. Democrats overwhelmingly oppose the measure. Enough Republicans were also coming out against the bill, though for different reasons, that its prospects of passing the House appeared dim. Even if it does pass the House on Wednesday, the bill would go nowhere in the Senate. Johnson said the issue of election security is too critical to ignore, though research has shown that voting by non-citizens is extremely rare. It's also clear that Republicans see value in making House Democrats take another vote on the issue. The House approved a bill with the proof of citizenship mandate back in July 'If you have a few thousand illegals participate in the election in the wrong place, you can change the makeup of Congress and you can affect the presidential election,' Johnson said. 'The American people understand that.' The first test for the stopgap spending bill came Tuesday with a 209-206 vote that kept it moving ahead. But some Republicans who have said they will oppose the bill on final passage allowed it to proceed. The measure includes a six-month extension of federal funding to keep agencies and programs operating through March 28. But Democrats want a shorter-term extension so that the current Congress will set full-year spending levels for fiscal 2025 rather than the next president and Congress. They also want the proof of citizenship mandate stripped out of the bill, saying it's unnecessary because states already have effective safeguards in place to verify voters' eligibility and maintain accurate voter rolls. 'Is it any surprise that the speaker's purely partisan CR seems to be running into trouble?' Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer said, using Washington parlance for the short-term continuing resolution needed to prevent a shutdown. 'The answer is very simple. The House should stop wasting time on a CR proposal that cannot become law.' Schumer called on Johnson to consult with Democratic leaders and the White House on a bipartisan package that can pass both chambers. A few House Republicans have also come out against the bill. Some won't vote for any continuing resolution. They want Congress to return to passing the dozen annual appropriations bills individually. Others say the continuing resolution funds programs at levels they consider inappropriate at a time of nearly $2 trillion annual deficits. 'I'm a firm no on bankrupting the nation and a yes on election integrity,' said Representative Cory Mills in announcing his opposition. Representative Tim Burchett said Republican leadership was asking him to vote for what he called 'a Nancy Pelosi-Schumer budget.' 'I just think that's a bad idea,' Burchett said. Republicans can afford to lose only four votes from their ranks if every Democrat votes against the bill. Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump on Tuesday seemingly encouraged a government shutdown if Republicans in the House and Senate 'don't get assurances on Election Security.' He said on the social media platform Truth Social that they should not go forward with a continuing resolution without such assurances. Senate Republican leader Mitch McConnell disagreed when asked about Trump's post. 'Shutting down the government is always a bad idea, no matter what time of the year it is,' McConnell said. House Republicans met behind closed doors Tuesday morning to discuss the path forward. Representative Jim Jordan, a co-founder of the conservative House Freedom Caucus, told colleagues 'this is the best fight we've ever had,' said Representative Kevin Hern. By holding another vote on the proof of citizenship requirement for voter registration, House Republicans are making Democrats in competitive swing districts take another vote on the issue ahead of the election. Last time, five Democrats sided with Republicans in support of the requirement. And their votes this time will be highly scrutinized. Lawmakers said no plan B was discussed for government funding and that Johnson was determined to hold a vote regardless of the likely outcome. 'This is important to him,' said Representative Ralph Norman. 'This is the hill to die on.'	https://www.voanews.com/a/house-speaker-pushes-funding-bill-that-includes-proof-of-citizenship-mandate-/7779214.html	2024-09-10T17:14:09-07:00

Questions continue to swirl around China's 'disappeared' foreign minister	washington — More than a year after China's former foreign minister, Qin Gang, disappeared from public view, raising a host of questions, the Chinese government remains silent on his whereabouts. A new report this week from The Washington Post, citing two former U.S. government officials, suggests Qin has been spared any jail time and now is nominally holding a low-ranking position at a publishing house under the Chinese Ministry of Foreign Affairs. Earlier reports speculated that he was sentenced to life in prison or had died from suicide or torture. Some are skeptical about the Washington Post report, while others see it as evidence of uncertainty and impermanence within the political system directed by the Chinese Communist Party, or CCP. According to Sunday's Washington Post report, Qin, 58, now works, at least on paper, for the World Affairs Press, a state-owned publishing house under the Foreign Ministry. One of the former officials said Qin is 'not going to jail, but his career is over.' Before he disappeared from public view in July of last year, Qin was the youngest foreign minister since the founding of the CCP. A leading theory among Chinese political analysts is that Qin was removed because he had an affair with Fu Xiaotian, a prominent Chinese television journalist, and that the pair had a child born out of wedlock in the United States. Some reports suggested that the Chinese government suspected Fu of sharing state secrets with foreign intelligence agencies, but these rumors have never been confirmed. Like Qin, Fu disappeared from public life for more than a year ago. During a top-level political meeting in July, the Third Plenum of the 20th Central Committee, the CCP agreed to Qin's request that he be removed from his post as a member of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China, Chinese state media reported. That followed an official announcement in February that said Qin had resigned as a parliamentary deputy. A reporter from The Washington Post recently visited the bookstore of the World Affairs Press in Beijing, but employees there told the newspaper that they had not heard that Qin worked at the publishing house. A staff member who answered the phone said she did not know if the news was true. China's Foreign Ministry did not respond to a request for comment. Some observers pointed out that the Washington Post's report is based on an anonymous source who has left office, and the authenticity still needs to be verified. Neil Thomas, a fellow on Chinese politics at the Asia Society Policy Institute's Center for China Analysis, said on social media platform X, 'The rumors of Qin Gang moving to World Affairs Press have been around for months. Sources are U.S. ex-officials and I don't know what they do. But @nakashimae & @cdcshepherd are top reporters.' Charles Smith, an encryption security expert, said on X that he doesn't believe the article, which 'even notes the 'bookstore' employees have never seen Qin. ... He's on an extended fishing vacation.' His tweet was accompanied by an image of a skeleton fishing underwater. Last December, online news outlet Politico reported that Qin had been arrested for undermining national security and was tortured to death or committed suicide. Yen-Ting, an X user who frequently comments on China's social and political issues, tweeted, 'It's almost poetic justice, a 'Wolf Warrior' reduced to selling books while the regime's whispers suggest he's paid off the hook rather than locked up. This is China's way of dealing w/ its wayward wolves: not through the claws of justice but by shoving them into obscurity.' Kalpit A. Mankikar, a fellow in the Strategic Studies Program with the Observer Research Foundation in New Delhi, tweeted, 'Once seen as Stalin's heir, Soviet politician Georgy Malenkov fell from grace and was banished to Kazakhstan to manage a power plant. In #China, ex-foreign minister Qin Gang seems to have rehabilitated at a Party-run bookshop, says @washingtonpost.' The Washington Post report also quoted current and former U.S. officials who had dealt with Qin as saying he lacked the diplomatic skills of his experienced colleagues to break out of the 'Wolf Warrior' model. One example is that Qin appeared to threaten the U.S. with China 'erasing' Taiwan Strait's median line, in a heated exchange with U.S. officials amid former U.S. House Speaker Nancy Pelosi's visit to Taiwan in August 2022. American columnist James Pinkerton tweeted a reader's online comment on the Washington Post report. The reader Paul Messina said, 'I believe that now that the Chinese economy is falling apart, Xi has realized that this 'Wolf Warrior' tactic has actually exacerbated the fall of Chinese industry. Besides aggravating the West, particularly the United States with this nonsense, it has led to multiple Western corporations leaving China, permanently closing their doors and factories in search of friendlier nations to do business. 'Vietnam and other nations have greatly benefited. Thus this idiot actually decreased the CCP's prestige in the world. I believe that this is why his new 'career' is librarian. Xi made a big mistake with his 'Wolf Warrior' attitude towards the world. I believe that he now realizes this fact.' Liu Jianchao, the head of the International Liaison Department of the CCP Central Committee, who is relatively moderate in terms of rhetoric and image, is considered a possible candidate to succeed Wang Yi as the next foreign minister. According to The New York Times, as China is already seeking to soften its image in the U.S. and Europe and improve relations with some of its neighbors, appointing Liu may mean China is abandoning its 'Wolf Warrior' diplomacy.

Google, Apple lose court fights against EU, owe billions in fines, taxes	LONDON — Google lost its last bid to overturn a European Union antitrust penalty, after the bloc's top court ruled against it Tuesday in a case that came with a whopping fine and helped jumpstart an era of intensifying scrutiny for Big Tech companies. The European Union's top court rejected Google's appeal against the $2.7 billion penalty from the European Commission, the 27-nation bloc's top antitrust enforcer, for violating antitrust rules with its comparison shopping service. Also Tuesday, Apple lost its challenge against an order to repay $14.34 billion in back taxes to Ireland, after the European Court of Justice issued a separate decision siding with the commission in a case targeting unlawful state aid for global corporations. Both companies have now exhausted their appeals in the cases that date to the previous decade. Together, the court decisions are a victory for European Commissioner Margrethe Vestager, who is expected to step down next month after 10 years as the commission's top official overseeing competition. Experts said the rulings illustrate how watchdogs have been emboldened in the years since the cases were first opened. One of the takeaways from the Apple decision 'is the sense that, again, the EU authorities and courts are prepared to flex their [collective] muscles to bring Big Tech to heel where necessary,' Alex Haffner, a competition partner at law firm Fladgate, said by email. The shopping fine was one of three huge antitrust penalties for Google from the commission, which punished the Silicon Valley giant in 2017 for unfairly directing visitors to its own Google Shopping service over competitors. 'We are disappointed with the decision of the Court, which relates to a very specific set of facts,' Google said in a brief statement. The company said it made changes to comply with the commission's decision requiring it to treat competitors equally. It started holding auctions for shopping search listings that it would bid for alongside other comparison shopping services. 'Our approach has worked successfully for more than seven years, generating billions of clicks for more than 800 comparison shopping services,' Google said. European consumer group BEUC hailed the court's decision, saying it shows how the bloc's competition law 'remains highly relevant' in digital markets. 'It is a good outcome for all European consumers at the end of the day,' Director General Agustín Reyna said in an interview. 'It means that many smaller companies or rivals will be able to go to different comparison shopping sites. They don't need to depend on Google to reach out to customers.' Google is still appealing its two other EU antitrust cases: a 2018 fine of $4.55 billion involving its Android operating system and a 2019 penalty of $1.64 billion over its AdSense advertising platform. Despite the amounts of money involved, the adverse rulings will leave a small financial dent in one of the world's richest and most profitable companies. The combined bill of $17 billion facing Apple and Alphabet, Google's parent company, represents 0.3% of their combined market value of $5.2 trillion. Those three cases foreshadowed expanded efforts by regulators worldwide to crack down on the tech industry. The EU has since opened more investigations into Big Tech companies and drew up a new law to prevent them from cornering online markets, known as the Digital Markets Act. Google is also now facing pressure over its lucrative digital advertising business from the EU and Britain, which are carrying out separate investigations, and the United States, where the Department of Justice is taking the company to federal court over its alleged dominance in ad tech. Apple failed in its last bid to avoid repaying its Irish taxes Tuesday after the Court of Justice upheld a lower court ruling against the company, in the dispute that dates back to 2016. The case drew outrage from Apple, with CEO Tim Cook calling it 'total political crap.'	https://www.voanews.com/a/google-apple-lose-court-fights-against-eu-owe-billions-in-fines-taxes-/7779133.html	2024-09-10T15:17:31-07:00	
US Assistant Secretary of State O'Brien: Georgia's leadership is 'in denial'	WASHINGTON — A controversial law on 'foreign influence transparency' is heading toward full implementation in Georgia, even though the country aspires to join the European Union and North Atlantic Treaty Organization. September 2 was the deadline for Georgian nongovernmental organizations and media organizations receiving more than one-fifth of their funding from abroad to register as 'organizations serving the interests of a foreign power.' Only 1.6% of the country’s organizations chose to do so. Many organizations expect they will be forced to register and fined for allegedly serving foreign interests. Georgia’s so-called 'foreign agent' law has been labeled a 'Russian-style law' and heavily criticized by Georgia’s Western partners, who say it undermines the hope of most Georgians that their country will join European institutions. Georgia’s government, however, insists the law simply seeks to ensure 'transparency.' On October 26, Georgians will head to the polls to elect a new parliament, and the political opposition believes these elections will be a referendum on whether the country will continue to move toward integration with Europe. U.S. Assistant Secretary of State for European and Eurasian Affairs James O'Brien spoke with Voice of America’s Georgian Service about what the Biden administration will be most closely watching. VOA: The Georgian government is moving ahead with implementation of the Law on Transparency of Foreign Influence, which has triggered criticism and the imposition of travel restrictions against Georgian government officials by the U.S. and a pause in aid by both the U.S. and the EU. What message does the Biden administration have now for the Georgian leadership? Will the process of implementing the law affect whether the October parliamentary election will be seen as free and fair? U.S. Assistant Secretary of State James O'Brien: We want the Georgian people to be able to register their votes in a free and fair election. For that to happen, we need to see the whole process work well, all these organizations [being] able to work effectively over the next several months without fear of oppression or violence. This law, as we've said repeatedly, is flawed fundamentally. There are ways that European states protect their election systems. This law does not do that. Having a government agency essentially force a registration and have access to all the data in that organization is at odds with modern European practice. … It’s caused an enormous amount of damage to Georgia's prospects for joining the EU and NATO. The elections need to be free and fair. It's good that the Organization of Security and Cooperation in Europe will be able to have a mission to observe some parts [of the election], but it also depends on the community groups. All of that is one big system, and this law tries to kick one leg out from a three-legged stool. It doesn't work. And so, I'm worried that it means the elections will not be free and fair, and they certainly won't be seen as free and fair. Without that, Georgia can't make the next step forward. VOA: The U.S. and Georgia have been strategic partners for over three decades. The Biden administration has taken several steps, including visa restrictions, pausing aid and postponing joint military drills. What might the next steps be? What are the options on the table? O’Brien: We’ve already put in place restriction on travel to the U.S. that's affected dozens of people. We're not allowed to say who exactly. But it's a very significant step. We have suspended help, assistance to a range of the Georgian society. That's a shame, but it's necessary. And the EU’s said that the process of joining the EU is effectively suspended. We do not want to see a return to the kind of violence, harassment and oppression that we saw in the spring, where civil society groups, individuals were visited by often-thuggish groups with Russian accents, they were visited by members of the government. All of those things can't happen. VOA: Meanwhile, [ruling party] Georgian Dream leaders have promised to 'ban opposition parties' following the elections. How does this sound coming from the leadership of a country aspiring to EU and NATO membership, and what concerns does it raise about the ruling party’s intentions? O’Brien: It doesn't sound like a democracy. One party doesn't get to decide what other party gets to compete. It's for the citizens to decide what parties take their seats in parliament, according to fair rules that are understood in advance. So, I think that was a very revealing comment. And it suggests that this is not a government capable of bringing Georgia toward Europe. VOA: Russian intelligence services are accusing the U.S. of plotting 'regime change' in Georgia. Some Georgian Dream members also have accused U.S. organizations like the NDI or IRI [the National Democratic Institute and the International Republican Institute, both of which are American nongovernmental organizations funded by the U.S. government] of helping the opposition. What do you make of these accusations, and are you worried about possible Russian interference or malign influence in the Georgian elections? O’Brien: Well, anyone who believes the Russian security services, I think, is fooling themselves. The American organizations are very transparent. It's known who we work with, and we work to support the Georgian people so that they can organize themselves inside or outside government. That's the full goal. We don't pick winners and losers. We are for the Georgian people, most of whom, almost 90% of whom, want to move toward Europe, and it's this government with its very bad legal drafting — like it's just bad lawyering — that has caused this problem. And we would like them to fix it so that the Georgian people can organize themselves and could have a free and fair election. If the government succeeds in … denying access to resources by all these groups, the only ones left standing will be Russian sources of information. So, whatever the case has been till now, what the government is doing [now] makes it much easier for Russia to dominate Georgia's information space. VOA: After so many high-level engagements with the Georgian authorities, and Prime Minister [Irakli] Kobakhidze speaking about the need for 'resetting' the relationship, do you have any indication that they might be ready to change course? O’Brien: No. And they're in denial. They haven't noticed we’ve suspended $95 million in assistance. The EU is suspending a proportionate amount: They are saying you don't get to move toward Europe. And what Georgian Dream tries to tell its voters, and all Georgian citizens, is [that] everything is fine. It is not fine. Georgia wants to join the European Union. There are clear rules. The people responsible for those rules are saying you have made a mistake. You have written a bad law. They are on the verge of writing two new bad laws and those need to stop in order for the people of Georgia to get what they overwhelmingly want. We've said again and again to the Georgian officials: The transparency you say you want is readily available. All the American organizations are transparent. The European organizations are transparent. There are ways to achieve that. But they've chosen to do it in a way that lets the [Georgian] Ministry of Justice control your local neighborhood organization. And that's not democratic, and it's not part of Europe. We want them to turn back so that the Georgian people can be part of Europe.	https://www.voanews.com/a/us-assistant-secretary-of-state-o-brien-georgia-s-leadership-is-in-denial-/7779104.html	2024-09-10T14:47:15-07:00	
Dam overflow sparks new crisis in insurgency-hit Nigerian city	Maiduguri, Nigeria — Flood water from an overflowing dam has destroyed thousands of homes in Maiduguri, the capital city of Borno state in northeast Nigeria, and emergency officials fear the situation could get worse. Several aerial videos and photos shared by the National Emergency Management Agency (NEMA) with AFP showed rows of houses submerged in murky water. An epicenter of more than a decade-long insurgency, Maiduguri serves as the hub for the responses to the humanitarian crisis in the northeast region. The United Nations refugee agency in Nigeria on its X account said it was the city's worst flooding in 30 years. 'It is an unprecedented incident,' NEMA spokesman Ezekiel Manzo told AFP on Tuesday. 'Some of the central parts of the city that have not witnessed flood in so many years are witnessing it today.' Thousands of homes have been submerged by the rapid rise of water after the rupture of the Alau Dam on the Ngadda River, 20 kilometers (12 miles) south of Maiduguri. 'The last three days have over 150,000 individuals with over 23,000 households affected,' said NEMA zonal coordinator Surajo Garba. But with more locations being hit, 'we are sure the figure will be much over 200,000 individuals,' Garba forecast. 'The flood, which began over the weekend and worsened in the following days, was the direct result of excess water from the Alau Dam,' said Nigeria's Vice President Kashim Shettima, who hails from Maiduguri, as he visited the area. 'The collapse of the spillways unleashed a significant surge of water downstream, causing widespread flooding in the surrounding communities,' Shettima said. The flood also inundated the city's post office and main zoo, with authorities warning that deadly animals had been washed into communities. Manzo said forecasts did not prepare the emergency workers for the extent of the flooding, while also blaming the impact of climate change for the disaster. He told AFP there were deaths from the incident but declined to give a specific number because rescue workers continue rescue operations in the affected areas. With flooding still high in many parts of the city, authorities have opened three temporary shelters for the victims. 'Homes are submerged, schools shut down and businesses crippled as people evacuate with their belongings,' the U.N. High Commissioner for Refugees' Nigeria office said. Floods have killed at least 229 people and displaced around 380,000 more in parts of the country, according to NEMA, but mainly in the northern region. Some 110,000 hectares (280,000 acres) of farmland have also been affected, NEMA figures showed. Damage to farmland will worsen Nigeria's high rates of food insecurity, Save the Children warned last week. 'One in every six children across Nigeria faced hunger in June-August this year' – a 25% increase on the same period last year, the NGO said in a statement. Flooding, usually caused by abundant rains and poor infrastructure, has caused large-scale destruction in Africa's most populous country in the past. More than 360 people died and more than 2.1 million were displaced in 2012. In 2022, more than 500 people died and 1.4 million were displaced in the worst floods in a decade. Nigeria's President Bola Ahmed Tinubu offered his 'condolences' to those affected in a statement, 'especially to the families that have lost their means of livelihood due to the disaster.' His office said earlier he is working with state authorities to 'address the immediate humanitarian needs of the affected people.'	https://www.voanews.com/a/dam-overflow-sparks-new-crisis-in-insurgency-hit-nigerian-city/7778990.html	2024-09-10T14:16:41-07:00	
Abortion-rights measure will be on Missouri's November ballot, court rules	JEFFERSON CITY, Missouri — An amendment to restore abortion rights in Missouri will be on the ballot, the state's Supreme Court ruled Tuesday. The proposal to enshrine abortion rights in the constitution is expected to widely undo the state's 2022 near-total abortion ban if passed. Judges ruled hours before the Tuesday deadline for changes to be made to the November ballot. Supreme Court judges ordered Republican Secretary of State Jay Ashcroft to put the measure back on the ballot. He had removed it Monday following a county circuit judge's ruling Friday. The order also directs Ashcroft, an abortion opponent, to 'take all steps necessary to ensure that it is on said ballot.' The court's full opinion on the case was not immediately released Tuesday. Missourians for Constitutional Freedom, the campaign backing the measure, lauded the decision. 'Missourians overwhelmingly support reproductive rights, including access to abortion, birth control, and miscarriage care,' campaign manager Rachel Sweet said in a statement. 'Now, they will have the chance to enshrine these protections in the Missouri Constitution on November 5.' Mary Catherine Martin, a lawyer for a group of Republican lawmakers and abortion opponents suing to remove the amendment, had told Supreme Court judges during rushed Tuesday arguments that the initiative petition 'misled voters' by not listing all the laws restricting abortion that it would effectively repeal. The amendment is part of a national push to have voters weigh in on abortion since the U.S. Supreme Court overturned Roe v. Wade in 2022. Missouri banned almost all abortions immediately after that Supreme Court ruling. Eight other states will consider constitutional amendments enshrining abortion rights, including Arizona, Colorado, Florida, Maryland, Montana, Nebraska, Nevada and South Dakota. Most would guarantee a right to abortion until fetal viability and allow it later for the health of the pregnant woman, which is what the Missouri proposal would do. New York also has a ballot measure that proponents say would protect abortion rights, though there's a dispute about its impact. Voting on the polarizing issue could draw more people to the polls, potentially impacting results for the presidency in swing states, control of Congress and the outcomes for closely contested state offices. Missouri Democrats, for instance, hope to get a boost from abortion-rights supporters during the November election. Legal fights have sprung up across the country over whether to allow voters to decide these questions — and over the exact wording used on the ballots and explanatory material. In August, Arkansas' highest court upheld a decision to keep an abortion rights initiative off the state's November ballot, agreeing with election officials that the group behind the measure did not properly submit documentation regarding the signature gatherers it hired. Seven states have previously had abortion questions on their ballots since Roe was overturned, and voters have sided with abortion-rights supporters each time.	https://www.voanews.com/a/abortion-rights-measure-will-be-on-missouri-s-november-ballot-court-rules-/7779041.html	2024-09-10T14:13:19-07:00	
Jamaica to deploy 20 soldiers, 4 police to help fight gangs in Haiti	SAN JUAN, Puerto Rico — Jamaican Prime Minister Andrew Holness announced Tuesday that his country would send two dozen soldiers and police officers to Haiti this week to boost a United Nations-backed mission led by Kenya to fight violent gangs. The 20 soldiers and four police officers are scheduled to arrive Thursday and will join nearly 400 Kenyan police who arrived earlier this year and are working alongside Haitian police and military, said Vice Admiral Antonette Wemyss-Gorman, chief of defense staff for Jamaica's military. The Jamaicans will be responsible for providing command, planning and logistics support, Holness said at a news conference. Jamaica had pledged a total of 170 soldiers and 30 police officers, but Holness said it wasn't possible to deploy them all at once. 'It's not practical,' he said, adding that facilities to host those arriving and a command structure need to be in place before the full number pledged is deployed. 'We want a very successful operation.' The initial number of police and soldiers announced by Holness surprised many and comes at a time when the U.S. government has warned that the Kenyan-led mission lacks money and personnel as it considers a U.N. peacekeeping mission as one way to secure more resources. In recent days, the U.N. and Ecuador circulated a draft resolution obtained by The Associated Press asking the U.N. to start planning for a peacekeeping operation to replace the current mission. Such a proposal would have to be decided by the U.N. Security Council, which experts do not believe would approve it. On Monday, U.N. Secretary-General Antonio Guterres said 'it's very strange' that there is apparently no money available to support the Kenyan-led mission. 'I think countries should assume responsibilities and should come and provide the necessary funding,' he said. Holness did not comment on the possibility of a U.N. peacekeeping mission but said the current mission 'can be a long and extended process.' He added that the mission is not the only or final solution to problems in Haiti, where gangs control 80% of the capital of Port-au-Prince. The violence has spread to other areas across the country, with more than 3,200 people killed from January to May, according to the U.N. The ongoing violence also has left more than half a million people homeless in recent years. 'Haiti is the example of what could happen if states and governments do not take the problem seriously and put in place the measures and resources necessary to bring the problem under control,' Holness said. Overall, the mission is expected to have a total of 2,500 personnel, with the Bahamas, Bangladesh, Barbados, Benin and Chad also pledging to send police and soldiers, although it wasn't clear when that would happen. On Saturday, the Bahamas' foreign affairs minister, Fred Mitchell, told reporters that while the government hasn't wavered in its pledge, it's unclear when it will deploy troops to Haiti given that the mission's dynamics have changed. 'One of the things the Bahamas has to consider is the new position of the U.S.,' he said. The mission is expected to cost roughly $600 million a year, although the U.N. has received only $68 million out of $85 million pledged so far. The U.S. and Canada have provided most of the funds.	https://www.voanews.com/a/jamaica-to-deploy-20-soldiers-4-police-to-help-fight-gangs-in-haiti/7778997.html	2024-09-10T13:16:22-07:00	
Farmers in northern India get boost with new animal fodder	In the Himalayan mountains of northern India, thousands of dairy farmers face a crisis during winter due to shortage of fodder.

Blinken, Lammy stress importance of Taiwan Strait status quo in US-UK talks	State Department — U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken and British Foreign Secretary David Lammy addressed Indo-Pacific security and highlighted the need to maintain the status quo on the Taiwan Strait during their U.S.-U.K. Strategic Dialogue, underscoring its global significance. 'We also discussed joint efforts to ensure peace and stability across the Taiwan Strait and freedom of navigation and overflight of the South China Sea. For both of us, maintaining peace and stability, preserving the status quo is essential,' Blinken told reporters during a joint press conference with Lammy in London. 'It's essential not just to us; it’s, again, essential to countries all around the world,' Blinken added. U.S. officials have stressed the need to keep open high-level communication between Washington and Beijing to clear up misperceptions and prevent their competition from escalating into conflict. Earlier this week, the United States and China held theater-level commander talks for the first time in an effort to stabilize military relations. The video teleconference Monday, between Admiral Samuel Paparo, commander of U.S. Indo-Pacific Command, and General Wu Yanan, commander of the People's Liberation Army's Southern Theater Command, was aimed at preventing misunderstandings, particularly in regional hotspots like the South China Sea. According to the U.S. Indo-Pacific Command, Admiral Paparo emphasized the Chinese military’s responsibility to adhere to international laws and norms to ensure operational safety. 'Paparo also urged the PLA to reconsider its use of dangerous, coercive, and potentially escalatory tactics in the South China Sea and beyond.' In Beijing, China’s Ministry of National Defense issued a press release Tuesday stating the two commanders exchanged views on matters of mutual concern, but did not provide further details about the discussion. Washington has been seeking to establish new channels for regular military communication with Beijing after relations hit a historic low when the U.S. downed a suspected Chinese surveillance balloon last year. The theater-level commander talks differ from the broader discussions between U.S. and Chinese defense chiefs, which cover all strategic issues impacting both nations, Ryan Haas, a senior fellow at the Brookings Institution, told VOA. The theater-level talks provide a platform for more focused discussions on operational issues, crisis management, and deconfliction at an operator-to-operator level, added Haas, a former senior official on the White House National Security Council from 2013 to 2017. The virtual meeting between Paparo and Wu followed a meeting last month in Beijing, where U.S. national security adviser Jake Sullivan and Chinese leader Xi Jinping’s top military adviser agreed to the talks.	https://www.voanews.com/a/blinken-lammy-stress-importance-of-taiwan-strait-status-quo-in-us-uk-talks/7778934.html	2024-09-10T12:27:55-07:00	
Political startups bleed support in India-administered Kashmir over suspected Delhi ties	Srinagar, Indian-administered Kashmir — New political parties formed after the revocation of Jammu and Kashmir’s special autonomy five years ago appear to be bleeding support ahead of the first regional elections since then. Analysts see perceived ties to the central government in New Delhi as a factor. Typical of the trend is former lawmaker Noor Mohammad Sheikh, who recently resigned from the Jammu and Kashmir Apni Party, or JKAP, a political group he had joined a few years ago in Indian-administrated Kashmir. Established in 2020 by Syed Mohammad Altaf Bukhari, a businessman-turned-politician, and Ghulam Hassan Mir, a veteran politician from north Kashmir, JKAP aimed to build a bridge between the local population and New Delhi after Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi reduced the Himalayan region to a federally controlled territory in August 2019. Bukhari and Mir successfully recruited over 50 politicians, including Sheikh, from various pro-India parties, giving JKAP a promising start. The party was expected to reshape the political landscape of the region by challenging the dominance of the two main parties — the National Conference, or NC, and the People’s Democratic Party, or PDP. 'Bukhari took the initiative to engage with the government of India during a time of complete silence in the Kashmir Valley,' Sheikh told VOA. 'I chose to join the party because I believed I could represent my people when no one else was doing so.' JKAP, however, suffered an abrupt downfall after a disappointing performance during Indian general elections held earlier this year. With the announcement of the first assembly elections since Indian Kashmir became a union territory scheduled to begin September 18, JKAP began to unravel. Core members of the group started leaving one after another, causing the party to fragment. 'My workers did not support me, so I chose to leave the [JKAP] after three years,' Sheikh said. 'My supporters and I held a protest on August 5, and on that very day I decided to contest the election as an independent candidate.' Noor Ahmad Baba, a prominent Srinagar-based political analyst and professor, told VOA that the central government tried to reshape the politics in Kashmir from above by promoting new political groups in the region, but they couldn’t push aside traditional parties, especially the NC. 'It’s hard to achieve such goals in a country like India. Even a dictator wouldn’t be able to do it. Over time, people have become more politically aware and can analyze things and respond accordingly,' Baba said. 'The parliamentary elections indicated that building a new political party takes time and sacrifices and cannot be imposed from above.' Multiple parties that formed after the region lost its semiautonomous status have faced similar challenges. The Democratic Progressive Azad Party, established by former Chief Minister Ghulam Nabi Azad in September 2022, has lost over a dozen lawmakers, including co-founder Taj Mohiuddin. Azad, once a close aide to India’s opposition leader Rahul Gandhi, faced criticism from the locals who suspect that he, like lawmakers among other regional upstart parties, has a covert alliance with Modi’s ruling Bharatiya Janata Party. The suspicion was fueled by Modi’s praise for Azad following his exit from the Indian National Congress. Azad, however, dismisses these claims as attempts to undermine his new political role. Similarly, the much longer established Jammu Kashmir Peoples Conference, or JKPC, led by separatist-turned-mainstream politician Sajad Lone, is losing ground. Many attribute its decline to Lone’s alleged closeness to Modi. Many politicians who left these upstart parties are now running as independent candidates. They say that elections attract 'new combinations and shifting allegiances.' 'I left JKPC for my own survival,' Nizam Ud Din Bhat, a former lawmaker from north Kashmir’s Bandipora district, told VOA. 'My voters and workers wanted me to contest election from my home district as an independent candidate.' Muzamil Maqbool, another analyst and a political commentator, believes that public pressure has forced many individuals to run independently. 'People like the work done by some of these candidates but they do not like the political party they represented,' he said. 'However, we cannot ignore the fact that these independent candidates could join hands with any leading political party in the assembly elections by October this year,' he said. 'Horse trading in politics is not a new thing and in Kashmir; it is often the only way for politicians to secure their future and survive.' Professor Baba believes that those who switched parties during tough times and aligned with New Delhi may face difficulties. 'People now understand that such individuals are motivated by a desire to cling to power,' Baba said. 'I believe it might cost them in the upcoming elections.' JKAP co-founder Hassan Mir told VOA that emotional politics played by other parties has impacted people for decades. 'Every political party is referred to by various names, but if the vision and agenda are clear, it’s crucial to persuade people regardless of the labels attached,' he said. 'Some members departed because they sought power and realized we couldn’t provide it while others left due to unmet expectations regarding their mandates.'

US senator blocks promotion of top aide to Defense Secretary Austin	washington — Alabama Senator Tommy Tuberville is blocking the quick promotion of the top military aide to Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin over concerns that he and other senior staff did not immediately notify President Joe Biden when Austin was hospitalized with complications from cancer treatment earlier this year. Biden in July nominated Lieutenant General Ronald Clark to become commander of U.S. Army forces in the Pacific. But Clark has faced criticism from Republicans over his role as one of Austin's top aides when the defense secretary was in the hospital in January and did not tell Biden or other U.S. leaders. Republicans said the fact that Biden was kept in the dark about Austin not being in command for days could have meant confusion or delays in military action, even though decision-making authorities had been transferred to the deputy defense secretary. Tuberville's hold comes a year after he came under intense criticism from colleagues in both parties for holding up hundreds of military promotions over a Pentagon abortion policy. The Senate finally approved 425 military promotions and nominations in November after Tuberville relented. Republican colleagues said they agreed with Tuberville on the abortion policy but openly pressured him to drop the holds, voicing concern about military readiness and the toll it was taking on service members and their families who had nothing to do with the regulations. A spokeswoman for Tuberville, Hannah Eddins, said Tuesday that the senator has concerns about Clark's role during Austin's hospitalization, including that he did not inform Biden. She said that Tuberville is waiting on an a report from the Pentagon's inspector general that will review the matter. 'As a senior commissioned officer, Lieutenant General Clark's oath requires him to notify POTUS when the chain of command is compromised,' Eddins said, using an acronym for the president of the United States. Majority Democrats could still bring Clark's nomination up for a vote, but Tuberville's hold likely delays his confirmation because several days of floor time would be needed to confirm him. The nomination will expire with the end of the congressional session and the next president would have to renominate Clark or someone else to the post if he is not confirmed by early January. Pentagon spokesperson James Adams said that Tuberville's new hold, which was first reported by The Washington Post, 'undermines our military readiness.' 'Lt. Gen. Clark is highly qualified and was nominated for this critical position because of his experience and strategic expertise,' Adams said in a statement. 'We urge the Senate to confirm all of our qualified nominees.' Austin has come under bipartisan criticism for initially keeping Biden in the dark about his health issues and hospitalization. Austin was admitted to intensive care for complications from prostate cancer surgery on January 1, but the White House was not told until January 4. Austin's senior staff were notified on January 2. The defense secretary later said he takes full responsibility and had apologized to Biden. Still, Austin insisted that there were no gaps in control of the department or the nation's security because 'at all times, either I or the deputy secretary was in a position to conduct the duties of my office.' An earlier Pentagon review of the matter blamed privacy restrictions and staff hesitancy for the secrecy, and called for improved procedures, which have been made. The White House also laid out a new set of guidelines to ensure it will be informed any time a Cabinet head cannot carry out their job. The new guidelines include a half-dozen instructions for Cabinet agencies to follow when there is a 'delegation of authority,' or when secretaries temporarily transfer their authority to a deputy when unreachable due to medical issues, travel or other reasons.	https://www.voanews.com/a/lone-us-senator-blocks-quick-promotion-of-top-aide-to-defense-secretary-austin/7778883.html	2024-09-10T12:04:45-07:00	
Zimbabwe rolls out hefty fines for poor telecommunications services	Harare, Zimbabwe — Zimbabwe’s government has introduced hefty fines of up to $5,000 for poor service in the country's telecommunications industry. In a statement Tuesday, Zimbabwe’s ICT Minister Tatenda Mavetera said the government will levy fines of between $200 and $5,000 per infringement for telecommunications companies and internet providers who fail to give reliable service. Willard Shoko, an independent high-speed internet consultant, said the new fines could result in a solid telecom industry that can compete in the entire southern African region. 'The motive behind that is to improve internet for the end user. But I think they should also consider improving the infrastructure sharing and also collaboration to improve internet, not only for the region but also for Zimbabwe, because this is the foundation of the digital economy,' Shoko said. 'I think they should also think about how the internet can be improved and the partnership that can help improve the internet.' Fungai Mandiveyi, media and corporate affairs executive at Econet Wireless, Zimbabwe’s biggest telecommunications company, said the new regulations will be easier to comply with than those that existed before. 'The new provisions introduce a new model of penalties, unlike the blanket penalty that existed in the previous statutory instrument,' Mandiveyi said. 'The new penalties are now linked to specific quality of service breaches, that have also been clearly spelled out. There is now more clarity in what constitutes a service breach, and what penalty goes with a specific breach of the quality of service.' However, Christopher Musodza, an independent digital policy consultant, said the pressure to maintain internet service during Zimbabwe’s frequent power outages may present challenges for telecom companies. 'For the telecoms provider, it’s going to be tough,' he said. 'The economy is not performing as anyone would want. We have got issues to do with long hours of load shedding, so service providers have to power their base stations for long hours to ensure that they meet the key performance indicators. So, imagine running generators for most of the day to ensure that you avoid a fine. (I’m) not sure what will cost more; trying to keep up with these economic factors or just paying the fine.' Zimbabweans have long complained about poor and expensive telecommunication service. Shoko said that is the reason they are welcoming the government's decision this month to approve Starlink’s license to operate in Zimbabwe. The U.S.-based satellite company, owned by Elon Musk, has established a presence in several other African countries, including Botswana, Kenya, Mozambique, Nigeria, Rwanda, and Zambia. 'They can now easily get internet anywhere in Zimbabwe at an affordable price, thereby bridging the digital divide. That’s one major thing for the end user,' Shoko said of Starlink’s presence. 'For the local ISPs [internet service providers], there is massive opportunity that Zimbabwe can take advantage of — investment in ground infrastructure,' he added. 'Currently in Africa, Nigeria has only two ground stations that are servicing the whole of Africa. If the Zimbabwe government and local ISPs can work together with Starlink to provide ground stations in Zimbabwe, this will allow local ISPs to provide internet to Starlink, and provide better latencies in the region. So this will improve Starlink internet for local Zimbabweans, as well as the region.'	https://www.voanews.com/a/zimbabwe-rolls-out-hefty-fines-for-poor-telecommunication-services/7778769.html	2024-09-10T10:25:07-07:00

Betrayed' rural Thais no longer guarantee votes for Shinawatra clan	Bangkok/Surin, Thailand — Rural voters may have permanently turned away from the Shinawatra family and its Pheu Thai party, former loyalists warn, after Thailand’s dominant political clan welcomed a fresh cohort of conservative one-time rivals into its coalition Cabinet. These include prominent royalists who have backed coups and deadly crackdowns on the Red Shirt protest movement, which emerged to protest a 2006 coup that deposed then-Prime Minister Thaksin Shinawatra. Tycoons and royalist generals have fought for two decades for control of the country’s politics and the economic spoils. In that time, political violence has claimed the lives of scores, if not hundreds, of people in clashes between rival factions. Red Shirts paid the highest price during a 2010 army crackdown on their rallies in Bangkok. Rivalry at the top has been set aside — for now — by a government led by Paetongtarn Shinawatra, the daughter of divisive billionaire Thaksin Shinawatra, who still wields vast influence over Thai politics despite having no formal role. Now, many Red Shirts say they feel abandoned by Thaksin, a figurehead they once adored. 'I used to feel sorry for Thaksin for all the things the establishment did to him and his family. But now that they’ve betrayed us, I’m heartsick,' said Napassorn Boonree, 61, a Red Shirt from Ubon Ratchathani, recalling the 2010 crackdown by security forces on demonstrators in Bangkok. 'People died for [the Shinawatra family], but they no longer care for us. Now we see their true colors. They’ve done everything all along only for their own gain.' Paetongtarn Shinawatra’s government has a new mission: to defeat the new reform movement which won the last polls in 2023 and has become the biggest threat to the political and economic interests of the establishment since Thaksin himself won his first election in 2001. The Move Forward Party was blocked from taking control of the government and subsequently dissolved by a court ruling. Its key executives were banned from politics. But it has been rebranded as the People’s Party and is determined to win the 2027 election. Too late for Pheu Thai? Thaksin’s daughter, Thailand’s youngest premier at age 38, is due to give her first policy briefing on September 12. She is expected to announce a timeframe for cash handouts of 10,00 baht ($295) to 50 million citizens alongside debt-reduction plans, hoping to renew faith in Pheu Thai among a poor, rural base who once voted unquestioningly for any Shinawatra candidate. But it may be too late. Red Shirts 'will express their disappointment at the ballot box,' predicted Thida Thavornseth on Thai TV, describing the 'merger' between Pheu Thai and its former enemies as the same as a business deal between tycoons. In any case, Paetongtarn’s government first must survive to contest the next polls. Coming into office after the shock court dismissal of predecessor Srettha Thavisin in an ethics probe last month, Paetongtarn will have to deal with powerful establishment enemies accumulated by her family over the years. 'Having Shinawatra as a last name is always a danger. ... The name is synonymous with political conflict in modern Thai history,' said Stithorn Thananithichot, director of the Office of Innovation for Democracy at King Prajadhipok's Institute. Thaksin was deposed in a 2006 coup, and the administration of his sister Yingluck was taken out by the army in 2014. Srettha last month joined a growing list of Shinawatra-backed premiers to be picked off by the conservative courts. 'We are seeing enemies becoming allies against a bigger threat — [the] People’s Party. The conservative elite has no other option than to use Thaksin’s service,' Stithorn told VOA. But Paetongtarn has 'to move fast,' he warned, to prove her government can win over an electorate burned by the seeming betrayal of their shifting alliances. A by-election on September 15 for a seat vacated by a banned Move Forward member may provide an early test of Pheu Thai’s popularity. Money problems Throughout villages of northeastern and northern Thailand, household debt is commonly sky high, and many working-age adults have migrated to cities or overseas for jobs that pay more than farm work. The COVID pandemic sank Thailand’s most vulnerable deeper into financial trouble. Previous Shinawatra governments gave generous farm subsidies, better education and access to basic healthcare and were rewarded with landslide poll victories in 2001, 2005 and 2011. Former Red Shirt Singthong Chaichuay says he is so tired of Thailand’s political turmoil that principles no longer matter. He just wants a better quality of life for the country’s poorest. 'Thai people are very forgiving, and if our country is really moving forward, then I don’t have a problem which side Pheu Thai joins, even if it is with former enemies,' the 61-year-old told VOA from his village in Surin, near the Cambodian border. 'Whoever can make our lives better is the answer for us now.' But there is a divergence with younger people. In the 2023 election, they voted in vast numbers for Move Forward, taking seats from Pheu Thai across what was once home ground for Shinawatra-linked lawmakers. 'During Thaksin times, it was the golden era for farmers. Everyone was driving new tractors, the price of rice was also high,' said Chatupat Sriwong, 31, who like many of her peers leaves her young child to be raised at home while working abroad. 'Fast forward to today … and we’re developing very little here. My only focus now is to make money and that means working overseas because there’s no way I can do that here.'	https://www.voanews.com/a/betrayed-rural-thais-no-longer-guarantee-votes-for-shinawatra-clan/7778707.html	2024-09-10T10:12:09-07:00

African nations boost gold reserves amid economic uncertainty	Nairobi, Kenya — Central banks in Africa are turning to gold to protect themselves from economic and geopolitical instability and to diversify their financial portfolios. In September 2023, the price of gold per ounce was $1,900. A year later, it is selling for $2,500. According to the World Gold Council, an international trade association for the gold industry, demand for the metal is expected to increase in the next 10 months despite the soaring prices. Some experts, such as Carlos Lopes, a professor at the Nelson Mandela School of Public Governance in South Africa, attribute the African central banks’ gold rush to the need to protect their local currencies. 'In the last few years, because of inflation and all these movements for stimulation packages and the rest, the returns are extremely low,' Lopes said. 'On the other hand, gold is going up in terms of price because these big banks are also going after gold as a protection. So, it is a very good investment to go to gold.' It helps that African gold production has grown by 60% since 2010, according to the World Gold Council, higher than a global increase of 26%. In 2022, Zimbabwe launched a gold-backed currency to curb inflation and volatility in foreign exchange rates. Ghana and Uganda have been buying gold from artisanal miners to bolster their shrinking foreign currency reserves. Ghana, Africa's largest gold producer, plans to buy oil from other countries and pay them in gold to ease pressure on local currency and lower high fuel prices. Some economists say gold cannot solve the economic problems of some African countries. According to the World Gold Council, countries should hold onto gold for its long-term value, performance during crises and its role as an effective portfolio diversifier. Bright Oppong Afum, a senior lecturer at the University of Mines and Technology in Ghana, said some African countries want to use gold to reduce their reliance on the global financial system. 'If sanctions are laid on you, an African country, we know the devastating effects that it will have,' he said. 'The African countries are developing, or they are young, and they do not want to receive some harsh sanctions that will negatively or strongly impact the economics. And because of that, they are strategically reducing their dependencies on these external countries.' Afum said that although some Africans know and understand the value of gold, many trade away the metal to satisfy their daily needs. 'So, they just find a mere buyer who will ... exploit them,' he said. The African Continental Free Trade Area introduced the Pan-African Payment and Settlement System, enabling countries to trade in local currencies. Experts say some continental payment systems, if implemented, can ease the economic pressures some countries are grappling with. That, in turn, might make them less dependent on gold.	https://www.voanews.com/a/african-nations-boost-gold-reserve-amid-economic-uncertainty/7778680.html	2024-09-10T09:55:54-07:00	
Russia, China kick off joint military exercises, challenging US-led coalition	Taipei, Taiwan — Russia says it launched massive naval and air drills Tuesday that span a huge swath of oceans and involve more than 400 naval vessels, at least 120 military aircraft and upwards of 90,000 troops. The large-scale military exercise, dubbed 'Ocean-2024,' includes forces from China and will run until September 16 with at least 15 countries invited to observe the maneuvers, according to the Russian Defense Ministry. Russian President Vladimir Putin said Russia pays 'special attention' to strengthening military cooperation with 'friendly states' and warned the United States not to try and outgun Moscow in Asia. 'Under the pretext of countering the allegedly existing Russian threat and containing the People's Republic of China, the United States and its satellites are increasing their military presence near Russia's western borders, in the Arctic, and in the Asia-Pacific region,' Putin said in a televised remark to Russian military officials on Tuesday. He said Washington and its allies are 'openly declaring their plans to deploy medium- and shorter-range missiles in the so-called forward zones.' Analysts say the joint naval and air drills are an effort by Russia and China to deepen military ties and counter increased security coordination between the United States and its allies in the Indo-Pacific region. 'Russia wants to demonstrate that they can engage in a full-scale war with Ukraine while deploying resources to the Indo-Pacific region and China wants to show that they can deepen its relationship with Russia and cause problems in the region, primarily in the South China Sea but also around Japan,' said Stephen Nagy, a regional security expert at the International Christian University in Japan. On Monday, the Chinese defense ministry said both countries would conduct joint naval and aerial exercises aimed at deepening bilateral strategic cooperation and strengthening their ability to respond to security threats in the waters and airspace near the Sea of Japan and the Sea of Okhotsk. In addition to the joint exercise near Japan, the Chinese defense ministry said Chinese and Russian naval fleets will conduct their fifth joint patrol in the Pacific Ocean as part of the 'Ocean-2024' strategic exercise. 'Russia hopes to increase pressure on the United States on the Pacific front through the joint military exercise with China, which may force Washington to reduce its military deployment to Europe,' said Lin Ying-yu, a military expert at Tamkang University in Taiwan. On the other hand, he added that China hopes to divert Japan’s attention from waters near the Taiwan Strait through its closer military partnership with Russia. 'Japan will have to prioritize threats to their security so they won’t have more bandwidth to focus on the situation across the Taiwan Strait,' Lin told VOA in a phone interview. China and Russia’s increased military cooperation near Japan in recent years has prompted Tokyo to characterize their joint activities as a 'grave concern.' 'These repeated joint activities are clearly intended for demonstration of force against Japan and are a grave concern from the perspective of the national security of Japan,' the Japanese defense ministry wrote in its annual defense white paper, which was released in July. For now, Nagy said Japan is more concerned with how the military cooperation may evolve, adding that there are still limits to what the two can do together when they conduct exercises. 'Japan will be concerned about whether the coordination between China and Russia will be used to destabilize sea lines of communication, to prop up North Korea, or to move towards some kind of forced reunification with Taiwan,' he told VOA in a phone interview. 'The Russians and Chinese will sail beside each other, fly next to each other, or coordinate how their boats move around but they haven’t developed interoperability and inter-command.' Enhancing logistics, communication collaboration While there are limits to their cooperation, other analysts say Russia and China will still use joint military exercises to enhance their cooperation in logistics, such as exchanging parts, fuel, or services or sharing data or communication channels. 'The ability for the Chinese and Russian armies to better understand one another and better support each other in the field is an important capability to develop for both countries,' Drew Thompson, a visiting senior research fellow at the Lee Kuan Yew School of Public Policy in Singapore, told VOA by phone. In addition to that, Lin in Taipei said China could also enhance its forces’ combat capabilities through joint military exercises with Russia since the Russian forces have accumulated real combat experiences from Moscow’s war in Ukraine. 'Since Russia’s navies have dealt with drone or anti-ship missile attacks launched by Ukraine, the Chinese navy could learn about how to deal with similar attacks in a potential war across the Taiwan Strait from their Russian counterparts,' he told VOA. Pushing back against NATO China and Russia’s upcoming military exercise near Japan is part of their growing efforts to push back against the United States and NATO allies. Since July, Beijing and Moscow have held at least three joint military drills in different parts of the world, including the South China Sea, the skies off coastal Alaska, and the Gulf of Finland. 'These increased military drills all over the world are part of Beijing and Moscow’s efforts to counter the deepening defense coordination between the U.S. and its allies, both in Europe and in the Pacific,' Sari Arho Havren, an associate fellow at the Royal United Services Institute, told VOA in a phone interview. Despite their attempt to challenge the U.S. and NATO through closer military cooperation, Nagy said China and Russia are unlikely to let their partnership escalate out of proportion. 'Russia and China will continue to reciprocate what the U.S. and its allies are doing, but not escalate since Beijing wants to maintain its narrative to the Global South that they are not a hegemonic power,' he told VOA. On Tuesday, Chinese authorities said the United States and China held theater-level commander talks for the first time when Admiral Sam Paparo, head of the U.S. Indo-Pacific Command, held a video telephone call with his counterpart Wu Yanan of the Southern Theater Command of the People's Liberation Army. The Indo-Pacific Command focuses on enhancing security and stability in the Asia Pacific region and hotspots including the South China Sea and Taiwan Strait.	https://www.voanews.com/a/china-russia-exercises-aim-to-challenge-us-led-indo-pacific-coalition-analysts-say/7778700.html	2024-09-10T09:28:14-07:00	
US imposes sanctions on Iran over supply of ballistic missiles to Russia	London — Washington is imposing new sanctions on Iran over its supply of missiles to Russia for use in Moscow's illegal invasion of Ukraine, U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken announced Tuesday. The U.S. State Department said the sanctions aimed to further constrain 'Iran's destabilizing activities' and target individuals and businesses based in Iran and Russia, including Iran's flagship airline, Iran Air, which the U.S. said was involved in the weapons transfer. Pentagon press secretary Major General Pat Ryder confirmed that Iran had transferred shipments of Fath-360 close-range ballistic missiles to Russia, and that they could be employed against Ukraine 'within weeks.' Prior to the transfer, Russian military personnel were trained in Iran to use this system, he said. Ryder called Iran's transfer of the short-range missiles, which can hit targets up to 120 kilometers away, a 'concerning development' that deepens Russia's military arsenal. 'One has to assume that if Iran is providing Russia with these types of missiles, that it's very likely it would not be a one-time deal [and] that this would be a source of capability that Russia would seek to tap in the future,' he added. Speaking in London, Blinken said the growing cooperation between Russia and Iran 'threatens European security and demonstrates how Iran's destabilizing influence reaches far beyond the Middle East.' 'For its part, Russia is sharing technology that Iran seeks,' Blinken told reporters. 'This is a two-way street, including on nuclear issues, as well as some space information.' Blinken added that Russian President Vladimir Putin was now relying increasingly on help from Iran and North Korea to get weapons, a clear violation of multiple U.N. Security Council resolutions, and was also getting aid from China. 'One of the reasons that Putin is able to continue this aggression is because of the provision of support from the People's Republic of China, the biggest supplier of machine tools, the biggest supplier of microelectronics, all of which are helping Russia sustain its defense industrial base.' Without specifically identifying ballistic missiles, Moscow confirmed Monday that Russia and Iran are cooperating in the 'most sensitive' areas. 'Iran is our important partner,' Kremlin spokesperson Dmitry Peskov told reporters in a phone call. 'We are developing our cooperation and dialogue in all possible areas, including the most sensitive ones.' When Blinken and British Foreign Secretary David Lammy visit Kyiv this week, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy will likely push for the Western allies to allow Kyiv to use their long-range missiles on targets inside Russia, said analyst Garret Martin, co-director of the Transatlantic Policy Center at American University in Washington. 'Generally, the U.K. has been often more at the forefront, maybe more at the vanguard, of being more supportive of Ukraine,' he told VOA. 'So, it's a question here — especially if you're thinking about the debates over long-range strikes — are they able now to come up on a sort of similar position?' Speaking to Sky News on Tuesday ahead of the visit to Kyiv, Blinken said that U.S. President Joe Biden is 'not ruling out' allowing Ukraine to use U.S.-supplied missiles to strike targets inside Russia. Ukraine has had 'what it needed, when it needed it, to be effective in repelling the Russian aggression,' Blinken said. British Prime Minister Keir Starmer is due to visit Biden in Washington Friday, with Ukraine and the Middle East at the top of the agenda. 'Particularly for Ukraine and for the Middle East, the next few weeks and months are critically important,' Starmer told the BBC on Sunday. 'And therefore, it's important for me to speak to President Biden about our shared response, the response of our allies to the pressing, immediate issues, but also to the more strategic long-term issues.' Last week, Britain announced the suspension of some arms sales to Israel over concerns its attacks on Hamas targets in Gaza breach humanitarian law, which Israel denies. The U.S. is continuing to supply weapons and says it does not believe Israel is breaking international law.

Alleged killer of Ugandan Olympian dies from burns, hospital says	Eldoret, Kenya — The man accused of dousing in gasoline and setting afire Olympic runner Rebecca Cheptegei has died from burns sustained during the fatal attack on the Ugandan athlete, a hospital official said on Tuesday. Cheptegei, 33, who competed in the marathon at the Paris Olympics, suffered burns to more than 75% of her body in the Sept. 1 attack and died four days later. Her former boyfriend, Dickson Ndiema Marangach, died at 1530 GMT on Monday, said Philip Kirwa, chief executive officer of the Moi Teaching and Referral Hospital in Eldoret in western Kenya where Marangach was being treated and where Cheptegei also died. 'He developed respiratory failure as a result of the severe airway burns and sepsis that led to his eventual death,' Kirwa said in a statement. Kirwa said Marangach had suffered over 41% burns following his assault on Cheptegei, which local media reported to have happened after she returned home from church with her children. Cheptegei, who finished 44th in Paris, is the third elite sportswoman to be killed in Kenya since October 2021. Her death has put the spotlight on domestic violence in the East African country, particularly within its running community. 'This guy is dead because he killed my daughter. He has died because of his actions,' Cheptegei's father, Joseph Cheptegei, told Reuters. Rights groups say female athletes in Kenya, where many international runners train in the high-altitude highlands, are at a high risk of exploitation and violence at the hands of men drawn to their prize money, which far exceeds local incomes. 'Justice really would have been for him to sit in jail and think about what he had done. This is not positive news whatsoever,' said Viola Cheptoo, co-founder of Tirop's Angels, a support group for survivors of domestic violence in Kenya's athletic community. 'The shock of Rebecca's death is still fresh,' Cheptoo told Reuters. Cheptoo co-founded Tirop's Angels in memory of Agnes Tirop, a rising star in Kenya's highly competitive athletics scene, who was found dead in her home in the town of Iten in October 2021, with multiple stab wounds to the neck. Ibrahim Rotich, Tirop's husband, was charged with her murder and has pleaded not guilty. The case is ongoing. Nearly 34% of Kenyan girls and women aged 15-49 years have suffered physical violence, according to government data from 2022, with married women at particular risk. The 2022 survey found that 41% of married women had faced violence. Globally, a woman is killed by someone in her own family every 11 minutes, according to a 2023 U.N. Women study. 'I don't wish bad things on anyone, but of course I would have loved for him to face the law as an example for others so that these attacks on women can stop,' Beatrice Ayikoru, secretary-general of the Uganda Olympic Committee, told Reuters.	https://www.voanews.com/a/alleged-killer-of-ugandan-olympian-dies-from-burns-hospital-says/7778550.html	2024-09-10T07:51:56-07:00	
First doses of mpox vaccine from US arrive in DR Congo	KINSHASA, Democratic Republic of Congo — Authorities in the Democratic Republic of Congo said that 50,000 doses of mpox vaccine from the United States arrived in the country on Tuesday, a week after the first batch arrived from the European Union. Adults in Equateur, South Kivu and Sankuru, the three most-affected provinces, will be vaccinated first, starting on October 2, said Cris Kacita Osako, coordinator of the DRC's Monkeypox Response Committee. Last week, the first batch of mpox vaccines arrived in the capital, Kinshasa, the center of the outbreak. The 100,000 doses of the JYNNEOS vaccine, manufactured by the Danish company Bavarian Nordic, were donated by the EU through HERA, the bloc's agency for health emergencies. Another 100,000 were delivered over the weekend. The 50,000 doses from the U.S. will be of the same JYNNEOS vaccine. The 250,000 doses are just a fraction of the 3 million doses authorities have said are needed to end the mpox outbreaks in the DRC, the epicenter of the global health emergency. EU countries pledged to donate more than 500,000 others, but the timeline for their delivery remained unclear. Since the start of 2024, there have been 5,549 confirmed mpox cases across the continent, with 643 associated deaths, representing a sharp escalation in infections and fatalities compared with previous years. The cases in the DRC constituted 91% of the total number. Most mpox infections in the DRC and Burundi, the second-most-affected country, are in children under age 15. Last week, the Africa Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and the World Health Organization launched a continentwide response plan to the outbreak of mpox, three weeks after the World Health Organization declared outbreaks in 12 African countries a global emergency. The DRC issued an emergency approval of the vaccine, which has already been used in Europe and the United States in adults. For the moment, the rollout will be reserved for adults, with priority groups being those who have been in close contact with infected people and sex workers, Africa CDC Director-General Dr. Jean Kaseya told reporters last week. The European Medicines Agency is examining additional data to be able to administer it to children ranging in age from 12 to 17, which could happen at the end of the month, HERA Director-General Laurent Muschel said. The next batch of mpox vaccines will come from Japan and could arrive as early as this weekend, Kacita Osako told the AP, without specifying how many doses.	https://www.voanews.com/a/first-doses-of-mpox-vaccine-from-us-arrive-in-dr-congo/7778489.html	2024-09-10T07:15:44-07:00

Google loses final EU court appeal against $2.7 billion fine in antitrust shopping case	London — Google lost its final legal challenge on Tuesday against a European Union penalty for giving its own shopping recommendations an illegal advantage over rivals in search results, ending a long-running antitrust case that came with a whopping fine. The European Union’s Court of Justice upheld a lower court’s decision, rejecting the company’s appeal against the $2.7 billion penalty from the European Commission, the 27-nation bloc’s top antitrust enforcer. 'By today’s judgment, the Court of Justice dismisses the appeal and thus upholds the judgment of the General Court,' the court said in a press release summarizing its decision. The commission's punished the Silicon Valley giant in 2017 for unfairly directing visitors to its own Google Shopping service to the detriment of competitors. It was one of three multibillion-dollar fines that the commission imposed on Google in the previous decade as Brussels started ramping up its crackdown on the tech industry. 'We are disappointed with the decision of the Court, which relates to a very specific set of facts,' Google said in a brief statement. The company said it made changes in 2017 to comply with the commission’s decision requiring it to treat competitors equally. It started holding auctions for shopping search listings that it would bid for alongside other comparison shopping services. 'Our approach has worked successfully for more than seven years, generating billions of clicks for more than 800 comparison shopping services,' Google said. At the same time, the company appealed the decision to the courts. But the EU General Court, the tribunal's lower section, rejected its challenge in 2021 and the Court of Justice’s adviser later recommended rejecting the appeal. European consumer group BEUC hailed the court's decision, saying it shows how the bloc's competition law 'remains highly relevant' in digital markets. 'Google harmed millions of European consumers by ensuring that rival comparison shopping services were virtually invisible,' director general Agustín Reyna said. 'Google’s illegal practices prevented consumers from accessing potentially cheaper prices and useful product information from rival comparison shopping services on all sorts of products, from clothes to washing machines.'	https://www.voanews.com/a/google-loses-final-eu-court-appeal-against-2-7-billion-fine-in-antitrust-shopping-case-/7778300.html	2024-09-10T04:31:49-07:00

Francis will be only the second pope to visit Singapore, one of the wealthiest nations	SINGAPORE — When Pope Francis arrives Wednesday in Asia's financial powerhouse Singapore for the last leg of a four-nation tour, he is expected to bring his message of unity and hope to one of the world's richest nations. The 11-day trip, which earlier took him to Indonesia,Papua New Guinea and East Timor, is the longest for the 87-year-old pontiff since becoming head of the Catholic Church in 2013. Francis will be the second pope to visit Singapore, after a five-hour stopover by the late John Paul II in 1986. Here's what to know about Pope Francis' three-day stay in Singapore: Why is Francis visiting Singapore? Singapore was originally part of Francis' travel plans to the region in 2020 but it was derailed by the COVID-19 pandemic. The island city-state at the tip of the Malay peninsula has a small population of just under 6 million people and lacks natural resources, but it is a heavyweight in regional and international affairs. Astute leadership, its strategic location and reputation as one of the most open and least corrupt economies had transformed Singapore into a bustling financial giant and maritime and aviation hubs in just 59 years after independence. Singapore is a strategic U.S. partner but also maintains close ties with China. Ethnic Chinese account for about three-quarters of its residents followed by minority Muslims and Indians. According to a 2020 Singapore population census, Buddhists make up about 31%. About a fifth of the population claimed no religious belief, while Christians account for almost 19% and Muslims about 15%. Singapore has four official languages: English, Malay, Mandarin and Tamil, reflecting its multicultural identity and heritage. 'Singapore and the Holy See share a common interest in promoting interfaith dialogue and understanding. Pope Francis' state visit is also the first papal visit to Singapore in almost 40 years,' Singapore's Foreign Ministry said. In a city ranked as one of the most expensive to live in, Singapore's Cardinal William Goh said that key themes frequently emphasized by Francis such as human dignity, inclusiveness, interreligious dialogue, family values, the need to manage artificial intelligence responsibly and care for the environment were of particular relevance. 'As such, Pope Francis' visit is highly anticipated and warmly welcomed not only by the Catholic faithful, but also by the wider society.' Goh said in a written response to The Associated Press. 'After the apostolic visit is done, I pray that Singapore will be filled with hope — a profound, divine hope.' What's on the pope's itinerary? After flying in from Dili, East Timor, on Wednesday, Pope Francis will hold a private meeting with members of the Society of Jesus (Jesuits). On Thursday, he will receive an official welcome at Parliament House and meet Singapore Prime Minister Lawrence Wong and President Tharman Shanmugaratnam. He will also meet government officials, civil society and the diplomatic corps at the National University of Singapore. The highlight will be a public Mass at the 55,000-seat National Stadium in the evening. Those attending include Catholics from neighboring Malaysia and Brunei. Francis will make a tour around the stadium pitch to greet the faithful in his Popemobile before delivering his homily. On the last day, Francis will visit elderly residents at the St. Theresa's Home. He will also hold an interreligious meeting with youths at the Catholic Junior College. How influential is the church in Singapore? The church marked 200 years in Singapore in 2021. The Archdiocese of Singapore was formed in 1972, seven years after Singapore's independence. Diplomatic relations with the Holy See were established in 1981. In Singapore's early years, Cardinal Goh said the church's work in education and health care were important contributors to national development. 'Many of the country's top leaders in both the public and private spheres were formed in Catholic schools; and many basic health care needs were provided by Church-run health care institutions,' he wrote on the Vatican News website. The church supports 395,000 Catholics in Singapore with its 29 parish churches, three devotional churches, 53 schools, 47 humanitarian organizations and two health care institutions. Goh said the church holds frequent dialogue with the government, which views it as an important contributor and shaper of Singapore's social fabric. Goh, Singapore's first cardinal installed by Francis in 2022, is a member of two Presidential Councils that advise the government on matters relating to racial and religious harmony and minority rights. 'As the final stop on this apostolic journey, Singapore stands as a testament to peaceful coexistence in a modern, multicultural, and multi-religious society,' Goh wrote in his reply to the AP. 'This reflects the spirit of unity and diversity that Pope Francis has emphasized throughout his pontification.'	https://www.voanews.com/a/francis-will-be-only-the-second-pope-to-visit-singapore-one-of-the-wealthiest-nations/7778210.html	2024-09-10T01:55:43-07:00	
Australia plans age limit to ban children from social media	SYDNEY — Australia will ban children from using social media with a minimum age limit as high as 16, the prime minister said Tuesday, vowing to get kids off their devices and 'onto the footy fields.' Federal legislation to keep children off social media will be introduced this year, Anthony Albanese said, describing the impact of the sites on young people as a 'scourge.' The minimum age for children to log into sites such as Facebook, Instagram, and TikTok has not been decided but is expected to be between 14 and 16 years, Albanese said. The prime minister said his own preference would be a block on users aged below 16. Age verification trials are being held over the coming months, the center-left leader said, though analysts said they doubted it was technically possible to enforce an online age limit. 'I want to see kids off their devices and onto the footy fields and the swimming pools and the tennis courts,' Albanese said. 'We want them to have real experiences with real people because we know that social media is causing social harm,' he told national broadcaster ABC. 'This is a scourge. We know that there is mental health consequences for what many of the young people have had to deal with,' he said. Australia's conservative opposition leader Peter Dutton said he would support an age limit. 'Every day of delay leaves young kids vulnerable to the harms of social media and the time for relying on tech companies to enforce age limits,' he said. 'Easy to circumvent' But it is not clear that the technology exists to reliably enforce such bans, said the University of Melbourne's associate professor in computing and information technology, Toby Murray. 'We already know that present age verification methods are unreliable, too easy to circumvent, or risk user privacy,' he said. Analysts warned that an age limit may not in any case help troubled children. It 'threatens to create serious harm by excluding young people from meaningful, healthy participation in the digital world,' said Daniel Angus, who leads the digital media research centre at Queensland University of Technology. 'There is logic in establishing boundaries that limit young people's access,' said Samantha Schulz, senior sociologist of education at the University of Adelaide. 'However, young people are not the problem and regulating youth misses the more urgent task of regulating irresponsible social media platforms. Social media is an unavoidable part of young people's lives.' The prime minister said parents expected a response to online bullying and harmful material present on social media. 'These social media companies think they're above everyone,' he told a radio interviewer. 'Well, they have a social responsibility and at the moment, they're not exercising it. And we're determined to make sure that they do,' he said. Australia has been at the forefront of global efforts to regulate social media platforms, with its online safety watchdog bumping heads notably with Elon Musk's X over the content it carries.	https://www.voanews.com/a/australia-plans-age-limit-to-ban-children-from-social-media/7778205.html	2024-09-10T01:47:03-07:00	
Top US, Chinese military brass hold first call to stabilize ties	BEIJING — The United States and China held theater-level commander talks for the first time on Tuesday, Chinese authorities said, amid efforts to stabilize military ties and avoid misunderstandings, especially in regional hot spots such as the South China Sea. Washington seeks to open new channels of regular military communication with Beijing since ties sank to a historic low after the United States downed a suspected Chinese surveillance balloon last year. Admiral Sam Paparo, head of the U.S. Indo-Pacific Command, held a video telephone call with his counterpart Wu Yanan of the Southern Theater Command of the People's Liberation Army (PLA). The U.S. Indo-Pacific Command's areas of responsibility include the South China Sea and the Taiwan Strait, two hot spots for regional tension that are also flashpoints in U.S.-China bilateral ties. Both sides had an 'in depth exchange of views on issues of common concern,' the Chinese defense ministry said in a readout. Paparo urged the PLA 'to reconsider its use of dangerous, coercive, and potentially escalatory tactics in the South China Sea and beyond,' the Indo-Pacific Command said in a statement that described the exchange as 'constructive and respectful.' He also stressed the importance of continued talks to clarify intent and reduce the risk of misperception or miscalculation. The call followed a meeting in Beijing last month between U.S. National Security Adviser Jake Sullivan and Chinese leader Xi Jinping's leading military adviser, at which the talks were agreed. U.S. and Chinese troops were also taking part in large-scale military exercises led by the Brazilian Armed Forces this week in the Brazilian city of Formosa in the state of Goiás. American and Chinese troops had not trained side by side since 2016, when Beijing participated in the Rim of the Pacific Exercise, or Rimpac, led by the U.S. Indo-Pacific Command. Most two-way military engagements between the U.S. and China were suspended for almost two years after Nancy Pelosi, then speaker of the U.S. House of Representatives, visited Taiwan in August 2022. 'I certainly worry about an unintended conflict between our military forces, an accident, an accidental collision,' Nicholas Burns, the U.S. ambassador to China, told the magazine Foreign Policy in an online interview. Later this week, the United States plans to send a senior Pentagon official to a major security forum in China.	https://www.voanews.com/a/top-us-chinese-military-brass-hold-first-call-to-stabilize-ties/7778191.html	2024-09-10T01:15:47-07:00	
Typhoon Yagi leaves 40 missing, 63 dead in Vietnam	HANOI, VIETNAM — Emergency workers raced to evacuate thousands of people from severe floods Tuesday after Typhoon Yagi swept through northern Vietnam, killing 63 people and leaving 40 missing. Yagi struck Saturday with winds in excess of 149 kilometers per hour, making it the most powerful typhoon to hit northern Vietnam in 30 years according to meteorologists. The storm downed bridges, tore roofs off buildings, damaged factories and triggered widespread flooding and landslides. The north of the country, densely populated and a major manufacturing hub for global tech firms including Samsung, is now battling historic flooding, meteorologists said. Authorities have issued flood and landslide warnings for 429 communes across 17 northern provinces. One-story homes in parts of Thai Nguyen and Yen Bai cities were almost completely submerged in the early hours of Tuesday, with residents waiting on the roofs for help. Rescue forces were trying to reach residential areas to retrieve older people and children. On social media, relatives of those stuck in floodwater posted desperate pleas for help and supplies. In Hanoi, communities along the swollen and fast-moving Red River, which flows through the capital, were also partially under water, with people forced to evacuate in boats. Downtown Hoan Kiem District was forced to relocate 460 people on Tuesday. Crops including bananas, guavas and corn, which are usually sold in nearby markets, were all flooded. 'Lost everything' Phan Thi Tuyet, 50, who lives close to the river, said she had never experienced such high water. 'I have lost everything, all gone,' she told AFP, clutching her two dogs. 'I had to come to higher ground to save our lives. We can not bring with us any of the furniture. Everything is under water now.' As well as the dead and missing, flooding and landslides have also injured at least 752 people, officials at the ministry of agriculture said Tuesday. Authorities stopped heavy vehicles crossing a major bridge over the Red River in central Hanoi Tuesday and suspended a train line across Long Bien bridge as the water level rose. The action followed the dramatic collapse of a bridge higher up the river in northern Phu Tho province Monday. Pictures showed half of the 375-meter Phong Chau bridge gone. Five people who were crossing the bridge at the time have been rescued, but eight others were still missing Tuesday, authorities said. Forecasters warned central Hanoi would be affected by flooding later Tuesday. Hanoi authorities said more than 25,000 trees in the city had been uprooted in the storm. Huge trunks blocked key roads in the city centre, creating large traffic jams. At least 24 people were killed as Yagi tore through southern China and the Philippines before hitting Vietnam. Typhoons in the region are forming closer to the coast, intensifying more rapidly, and staying over land longer due to climate change, according to a study published in July.	https://www.voanews.com/a/typhoon-yagi-leaves-40-missing-63-dead-in-vietnam/7778183.html	2024-09-10T00:39:43-07:00

North Korea's Kim vows to put his nuclear force ready for combat with US	SEOUL, South Korea — North Korean leader Kim Jong Un vowed to redouble efforts to make his nuclear force fully ready for combat with the United States and its allies, state media reported Tuesday, after the country disclosed a new platform likely designed to fire more powerful intercontinental ballistic missiles targeting the mainland U.S. Kim has repeatedly made similar pledges, but his latest threat comes as outside experts believe Kim will perform provocative weapons tests ahead of the U.S. presidential election in November. In recent days, North Korea has also resumed launches of trash-carrying balloons toward South Korea. In a speech marking the 76th founding anniversary for his government on Monday, Kim said North Korea faces 'a grave threat' because of what he called 'the reckless expansion' of a U.S.-led regional military bloc that is now developing into a nuclear-based one. Kim said such a development is pushing North Korea to boost its military capability, according to the official Korean Central News Agency. Kim said North Korea will 'redouble its measures and efforts to make all the armed forces of the state including the nuclear force fully ready for combat,' KCNA said. North Korea has been protesting the July signing of a new U.S.-South Korean defense guideline meant to integrate U.S. nuclear weapons and South Korean conventional weapons to cope with growing North Korean nuclear threats. North Korea said the guideline revealed its adversaries' plots to invade the country. U.S. and South Korean officials have repeatedly said they don't intend to attack the country. Since 2022, North Korea has significantly accelerated its weapons testing activities in a bid to perfect its capabilities to launch strikes on the U.S. and South Korea. The U.S. and South Korea have responded by expanding military drills that North Korea calls invasion rehearsals. Many analysts believe North Korea has some last remaining technological barriers to overcome to acquire long-range nuclear missiles that can reach the U.S. mainland, though it likely already possesses missiles that can hit key targets in South Korea and Japan. South Korean officials and experts say North Korea could conduct nuclear tests or ICBM test-launches before the U.S. election to increase its leverage in future diplomacy with the U.S. Observers say North Korea likely thinks a greater nuclear capability would help it win U.S. concessions like sanctions relief. North Korea as of Tuesday morning did not appear to have staged any major military demonstration to mark this year's anniversary. But the North's main Rodong Sinmun newspaper on Sunday published a photo of Kim inspecting what appeared to be a 12-axle missile launch vehicle, which would be the largest the country has shown so far, during a visit to a munitions plant. This sparked speculation that the North could be developing a new ICBM that is bigger than its current Hwasong-17 ICBM, which is launched on an 11-axle vehicle. When asked about the photo on Monday, Pentagon spokesperson Maj. Gen. Pat Ryder refused to provide a specific assessment of North Korea's missile capabilities and reiterated that Washington was working closely with Seoul, Tokyo and other partners to preserve regional security and deter potential attacks. 'It's not unusual for North Korea to use media reports and imagery to try to telegraph, you know, to the world,' he said. North Korea flew hundreds of huge balloons carrying rubbish toward South Korea for five straight days through Sunday, extending a Cold War-style psychological warfare campaign that has further stoked animosities on the Korean Peninsula. The balloons largely contained waste papers and vinyl, and there has been no repots of major damage. North Korea began its balloon campaign in late May, calling it a response to South Korean civilians flying propaganda leaflets across the border via their own balloons. South Korea later restarted its anti-Pyongyang propaganda loudspeaker broadcasts along the rivals' tense land border. Observers say North Korea is extremely sensitive to South Korean leafleting activities and loudspeaker broadcasts as they could hamper its efforts to ban foreign news to its 26 million people.	https://www.voanews.com/a/north-korea-s-kim-vows-to-put-his-nuclear-force-ready-for-combat-with-us/7778103.html	2024-09-09T18:40:13-07:00

Poland thanks military dogs for their service, giving them army ranks	NOWY DWOR MAZOWIECKI, Poland — The new privates received their ranks amid military pomp in a town near Warsaw where a Napoleonic fortress attests to a long military history. The group was made up of a German shepherd, a Dutch shepherd and two Belgian Malinois. The dogs — Einar, Eliot, Enzo and Emi — were bestowed with their ranks Friday as part of a new Polish program aimed at honoring the service of dogs used to detect explosives, a job valued for its role in protecting human life. General Wiesław Kukuła, chief of the general staff of the Polish army, decided last year that dogs serving in the army would qualify for six military ranks ranging from private through corporal to sergeant. The change has been welcomed by their loyal human handlers. 'The rank is meant to honor the hard work of the dog in service,' said Lance Corporal Daniel Kęsicki, who recently completed a five-month training course with Eliot, a 2-year-old Belgian Malinois. 'To me it’s a symbolic recognition that the dog is serving the homeland.' The dogs honored Friday belong to the 2nd Mazovian Engineer Regiment, which in 2007 became the first unit of Poland’s armed forces to introduce dogs into service, according to spokesperson Captain Dominik Płaza. He said none have died in action. During the ceremony, each dog's handler was handed a badge with the animal's rank, which was attached to the dog's harness. The ceremony occurred during the commemoration of the regiment's 80th anniversary. The dogs were given their ranks for having completed basic training and having served for more than a year. The ranks are a largely symbolic recognition 'so that we, too, are aware that such a dog is a member of the armed forces,' Płaza said. 'It is not just a tool for detecting explosives, but it is a living being,' he said. The unit was recently deployed to Paris for the Summer Olympic Games and the Paralympics, where the regiment's soldiers and four of its 16 dogs reinforced French security efforts in scanning facilities for explosives. Everything passed off peacefully. Polish army dogs have carried out service elsewhere in international missions, including Iraq and Afghanistan as part of the NATO nation's support for U.S.-led efforts. Poland, a close ally and neighbor of Ukraine, earlier this summer also announced that it was sending 12 trained dogs to support the Ukrainian military in clearing mines. The soldiers who work with the dogs volunteer for the assignment, and it becomes a commitment that lasts for the rest of the dog's life. Soldiers who were with their dogs Friday explained that they select their dogs, train with them, live with them, and care for them even after their four-legged charges retire. Kęsicki described Eliot as an obedient companion who has become integrated into his family life. 'The dog can already do a lot after the beginning course alone, and we still have a few more years of service ahead of us,' he said. Płaza, the spokesperson, laughed when asked if a dog could ever outrank his handler — or if a soldier might have to salute a dog. 'Soldiers do not salute dogs,' Płaza said. 'The handler will always be of a higher rank than his dog. It is simply impossible for a service dog to have a higher rank than his handler.' Though the master-dog hierarchy is preserved, great love and appreciation are clearly shown to creatures in Poland, where pets are everywhere and some even lay their beloved companions to rest in special pet cemeteries. The Polish government has in recent years also ensured retirement benefits to dogs and horses working in the police, border guard and fire departments. On Friday, as the sun beat down on a hot square in the middle of town, Kukuła interrupted the ceremony and ordered the overheated dogs removed — even as human soldiers continued to stand there in their uniforms and boots. Staff Sergeant Michał Młynarczyk served in Afghanistan with a dog named Elvis starting in 2011. Together they checked vehicles arriving at the base of an international force for explosives. Elvis died in 2018. Now Młynarczyk is paired with Kobalt, a German shepherd who received his private rank in April. Private Kobalt goes home with him at night and plays with his children. While he loves the entire family, he never loses sight of who is the master. 'All of the work the dog does is done for me,' Młynarczyk said. 'It’s a bond, it’s a friendship.'	https://www.voanews.com/a/poland-thanks-military-dogs-for-their-service-giving-them-army-ranks/7778065.html	2024-09-09T17:24:21-07:00	
Colombia is the deadliest country for environmentalists, rights group says	BOGOTA, Colombia — Colombia, host nation for this year's United Nations COP16 biodiversity conference, was the deadliest country for environmentalists and land rights defenders in 2023, with a record 79 killed according to U.K. advocacy group Global Witness. The number of murdered environmental activists was the highest Global Witness has ever recorded for a single country in any given year since it started monitoring such killings in 2012, it said in its annual report published on Monday. 'The figure is really chilling,' Laura Furones, senior adviser to Global Witness' land and environmental defenders campaign, said, adding that the report's findings were conservative and figures likely incomplete. Globally, 196 environmentalists and land activists were killed in 2023, Global Witness said, with Latin America overwhelmingly leading the way, accounting for 85% of the slayings. The findings on Colombia are a sharp contrast to promises from the government of President Gustavo Petro, who took office in 2022 and has pledged to end the country's 60-year conflict and pursue environmental justice for communities. Peace processes with various armed groups — which are sometimes implicated in environmentalists' killings — have faltered, and though deforestation fell to a 23-year low last year, the environment ministry has warned of an increase in 2024. Colombia was also the deadliest country for environmentalists in 2022, according to Global Witness, when at least 60 were killed. 'The figure is very embarrassing for us in the country,' said Astrid Torres, coordinator for Somos Defensores, a Colombian human rights group. Torres said the issue was not just the responsibility of the sitting government but also of state institutions, such as prosecutors and local authorities. A spokesperson for Colombia's government said it was working on a response. Last year a Reuters investigation found that murders of environmentalists in Colombia resulted in long-lasting negative effects on conservation and that some municipalities where activists were killed saw significant spikes in deforestation. At an event to launch the COP 16 agenda in Bogota in July, Colombia's vice president, Francia Marquez — a winner of the Goldman Environmental prize for activism in 2018 — said the conference would honor those killed. 'It fills my heart with emotion to see this dream that was held for so many years by environmental leaders, many who are not with us today, who were sadly murdered in our country,' she said. 'This global event is a tribute to those voices.'	https://www.voanews.com/a/colombia-is-the-deadliest-country-for-environmentalists-rights-group-says/7778061.html	2024-09-09T17:05:41-07:00	
Experts applaud US steps to disrupt Russian disinformation	washington — The U.S. Justice Department announced September 4 that two Russian nationals, Kostiantyn Kalashnikov and Elena Afanasyeva, had been charged with conspiracy to violate the Foreign Agents Registration Act and conspiracy to commit money laundering in the Southern District of New York. 'The Justice Department has charged two employees of RT, a Russian state-controlled media outlet, in a $10 million scheme to create and distribute content to U.S. audiences with hidden Russian government messaging,' said U.S. Attorney General Merrick Garland. 'The Justice Department will not tolerate attempts by an authoritarian regime to exploit our country’s free exchange of ideas in order to covertly further its own propaganda efforts, and our investigation into this matter remains ongoing.' That same day, the Justice Department announced the seizure of 32 internet domains used in the Russian government-directed 'Doppelganger' foreign malign influence campaign, which it said violated U.S. money-laundering and criminal trademark laws. Experts who study disinformation say disrupting the paid-influencer campaign is an important step in efforts to counter the Kremlin’s broader disinformation strategy of spreading propaganda that undermines support for Ukraine and stokes American political divisions. Disrupting the Doppelganger campaign 'Persistent efforts to impersonate authoritative news websites and promote their content at scale in a coordinated manner can have a tangible impact, casting propaganda narratives far and wide consistently,' wrote Roman Osadchuk and Eto Buziashvili, researchers at the Disinformation Research Lab of the Atlantic Council, a Washington think tank. According to an FBI affidavit, Russia’s 'Doppelganger' campaign created domains impersonating legitimate media sites, produced fake social media profiles and deployed 'influencers' worldwide. According to the Atlantic Council researchers, the primary method used by those involved in 'Doppelganger' is to post, on X and other social media platforms, links to fake news sites in replies to posts by politicians, celebrities, influencers and others with large audiences. Osadchuk told VOA that while the FBI's measures are unlikely to stop Russian influence activities, they will make them more costly, noting those involved in the Russian influence campaign will be forced 'to rewrite scripts, change the operation's infrastructure, etc.' At the same time, according to Osadchuk, the U.S. government’s moves against those involved in the influence campaign, which were widely covered in the U.S. and international media, will educate a broader audience. 'Researchers of the Russian disinformation have known about the Doppelganger campaign for some time,' he said. 'Now, Americans and people in other countries have learned about it and maybe will become more aware that not all information they consume is coming from legitimate sources and hopefully will be more attentive to the domain names and other signs that might indicate that the page they are reading is not The Washington Post or Fox News but a fake created by Kremlin-linked entities.' Influencers will be more aware In a statement it released after indicting the two RT employees, the Justice Department said that 'over at least the past year, RT and its employees, including Kalashnikov and Afanasyeva, deployed nearly $10 million to covertly finance and direct a Tennessee-based online content creation company [U.S. Company-1],' and that 'U.S. Company-1' had 'published English-language videos on multiple social media channels, including TikTok, Instagram, X and YouTube.' While the Justice Department did not specifically identify 'U.S. Company-1,' it is thought to refer to Tenet Media, a Tennessee company co-founded by entrepreneur Lauren Chen, who recruited six popular U.S. influencers with a large following. YouTube subsequently took down Tenet Media’s channel on the platform, along with four other channels that YouTube said were operated by Chen. Bret Schafer, a disinformation researcher at the Alliance for Securing Democracy, a political advocacy group set up under the auspices of the German Marshall Fund, a Washington think tank, told VOA that by financing the U.S. content creation company, Russia was able to create an information channel with a large audience, and to use it for such messages as blaming the U.S. and Ukraine for the March terrorist attack at a Moscow concert hall. Islamic State claimed responsibility for that attack. Shutting down that Russian information channel sent a powerful message to influencers and content creators to do 'due diligence about people funding their work and to try to figure out who's behind these companies and their motives,' Schafer added. Ben Dubow, a disinformation researcher affiliated with the Center for European Policy Analysis, a Washington-based research group, believes that influencers contracted by Tenet Media are unlikely to lose their existing followers, but that they might have difficulty attracting new ones. 'Hopefully, people who might otherwise explore those influencers will recognize their names and understand them as untrustworthy now,' he told VOA. The Justice Department’s indictment quotes RT’s editor-in-chief, Margarita Simonian, as saying in an interview on Russian television that RT built 'an enormous network, an entire empire of covert projects,' to influence Western audiences. The FBI affidavit also revealed that one of the sanctioned Russian companies had a list of 2,800 people active on social media in the U.S. and 80 other countries, including 'television and radio hosts, politicians, bloggers, journalists, businessmen, professors, think-tank analysts, veterans, professors and comedians,' whom the company refers to as 'influencers.' Concrete steps and good timing Several experts commended the U.S. government for taking concrete steps. 'They are sanctioning individuals and disrupting the supply chain of influence available to these threat actors,' noted Olga Belogolova, director of the Emerging Technologies Initiative at the Johns Hopkins School of Advanced International Studies. 'Punitive measures absolutely have to be part of the package,' said Jakub Kalenský, a senior analyst at the European Centre of Excellence for Countering Hybrid Threats in Helsinki. 'Otherwise, the aggressors have a free hand to continue their aggression unopposed. And in order to identify those who deserve to be punished, a proper investigation from the authorities is necessary.' Experts also said that the Justice Department's actions were taken early enough to prevent influence in the November U.S. elections and to signal to Russia and other foreign actors that the U.S. government is monitoring their actions and will respond aggressively. 'Of course, that was what the Obama administration was concerned about in 2016 and led to them not being as transparent as they probably should have been with the American public about what they knew about Russian interference,' Schafer said. In announcing their actions against the Russian disinformation campaign, U.S. government representatives did not mention which political party or candidate they thought that the Russians were trying to assist. 'I know that the U.S. government, including agencies and the Foreign Malign Influence Center at ODNI [Office of the Director of National Intelligence], have been doing a lot of thinking over the last few years about how to strategically communicate these actions without unintentionally amplifying the very campaigns they are trying to thwart or politicizing the topic. And I think they've actually done a good job of striking that balance, at least from what I've seen thus far,' Belogolova said. Ihor Solovey, who heads the Ukrainian government’s Center for Strategic Communication and Information Security, welcomed the U.S. government's actions but told VOA that more steps are needed to thwart Russian activities on social media. 'X, TikTok or even more so the Russian Telegram - they are unlikely to want to spend on the fight against bots, troll farms or planned disinformation,' he said, adding that only pressure by a state, or even a coalition of states, will be able to force these social media platforms to block intruders and malicious content.

Exiled Iran opposition group says Sweden offices firebombed	STOCKHOLM — An exiled Iranian opposition group said Monday that its offices in Stockholm were firebombed overnight, with police saying they had opened an investigation into arson. According to the National Council of Resistance of Iran (NCRI), the political wing of the People's Mujahedeen of Iran (MEK), the building had been hit 'with several Molotov cocktails' in what the group dubbed a 'terrorist attack.' 'Several windows of the building were shattered, and the outer wall caught fire,' the NCRI said in a statement. It said residents put out the fire and 'no one was injured.' Police said in a statement they had opened an investigation into arson, but police spokeswoman Anna Westberg told AFP she could not comment on details about how the fire was started. 'We are still gathering information, and a technical examination will be done during the day,' Westberg said, adding that no arrests had been made. In its statement, the NCRI accused agents of Iran's intelligence service of carrying out the attack. The MEK backed Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini in the 1979 revolution that ousted the shah but swiftly went into opposition and was blamed for a series of deadly attacks that rocked Iran in the early 1980s. The MEK has been exiled from Iran since then. It is far from having universal support among the Iranian diaspora but is backed by several high-profile former U.S. and European officials.	https://www.voanews.com/a/exiled-iran-opposition-group-says-sweden-offices-firebombed-/7777691.html	2024-09-09T15:37:08-07:00	
Smoke from Brazil fires cloud major cities, neighboring countries	Rio de Janeiro, Brazil — Smoke from intense wildfires in the Amazon rainforest and other parts of Brazil was choking major cities like Sao Paulo and Rio de Janeiro on Monday, and wafting into neighboring countries. Karla Longo, a researcher at the National Institute for Space Research (INPE), said that satellite images showed that 60% of Latin America's largest country had been affected by smoke. 'If we consider the areas affected in neighboring countries and in the Atlantic Ocean, the area affected on Sunday was around 10 million km2 [3.8 million square miles],' she added. Authorities in Argentina and Uruguay reported smoke from Brazil's fires impacting parts of their countries on Monday. Sao Paulo, the biggest city in Latin America, on Monday topped the ranking of the world's most polluted major cities, according to the air quality monitoring company IQAir. The rate of fine particles in the air — a measure of air quality — reached 69 micrograms per cubic meter, almost 14 times higher than the limit recommended by the World Health Organization. Residents of seaside city Rio de Janeiro were grappling with fine particle rates at five times the recommended limit. Authorities blame human action for most of the recent fires in the country, which are often linked to agricultural activity. The situation has been aggravated by the country's worst drought in seven decades, which experts attribute to climate change. Satellite images from the U.S. National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration showed a thick cloud of gray smoke along the Andes Mountain range toward the south of the continent on Monday. This is due to the 'wind that channels the smoke towards the south,' meteorologist Estael Sias told AFP. According to data from INPE, the number of fires in the Amazon since the beginning of the year has almost doubled compared to the same period in 2023. Other regions of Brazil have been battling terrible wildfires in recent days. The vast Chapada dos Veadeiros National Park, known for its numerous dramatic waterfalls some 250 kilometers (155 miles) outside the capital Brasilia, has lost some 10,000 hectares of vegetation to flames in recent days. Sias said the situation is not expected to improve 'without regular rainfall,' which is not likely 'before October or November.'	https://www.voanews.com/a/smoke-from-brazil-fires-cloud-major-cities-neighboring-countries/7777681.html	2024-09-09T15:31:09-07:00	
China's Xi, Spain's Sanchez seek to ease EU-China trade disputes	beijing — Chinese President Xi Jinping on Monday urged visiting Spanish Prime Minister Pedro Sanchez to play a 'constructive role' in improving strained ties between Bejing and the European Union. Sanchez for his part said he hoped the EU could avoid a trade war with China, even as Brussels weighs imposing tariffs on China-manufactured electric vehicles. In their meeting, Xi also talked up deepening commercial ties between China and Spain in sectors such as artificial intelligence, digital economy, new energy and other high-tech fields. The Chinese leader said Beijing wanted to work with Brussels to further develop a China-EU relationship where the two maintain their independence and autonomy but also succeed together and bring benefit to the world, a Chinese readout said. 'It is hoped Spain will continue to play a constructive role in this regard,' Xi added. Sanchez responded: 'Spain wants to work constructively so that relations between the two are closer, richer and more balanced.' Beijing in June said that frictions with the EU over its plans to impose tariffs of up to 36.3% on its electric vehicles (EVs) could trigger a trade conflict, days after China announced a retaliatory anti-dumping probe into European pork imports. China in August then raised the stakes by opening an investigation into the bloc's dairy subsidies. Prior to meeting Xi, Sanchez said at business events that Spain would work for a negotiated consensus to the EV dispute within the World Trade Organization and that a 'trade war would benefit no one,' a government source said. Spain in 2023 exported $1.5 billion worth of the pork products that China will investigate, Chinese customs data showed, dwarfing the outbound shipments from the Netherlands and Denmark, which rank second and third. Spain also sold just under $50 million worth of targeted dairy products to China last year. But in a promising sign for Spain's pork producers, a separate source with direct access to Xi's meeting with Sanchez said the two leaders had 'found harmony and understanding,' when asked about possible curbs on Spain's outbound pork shipments. 'The meeting went extremely well,' the source said, adding that both defended their positions while seeking agreements. Fair trade 'We want to build bridges together to defend a trade order that's fair,' Sanchez told China's second-ranking official, Premier Li Qiang, before meeting Xi. Spain had a trade deficit of 17.27 billion euros ($19.07 billion) in the first half of this year, according to government statistics. Sanchez will also want reassurance that China will not strike back at Brussels by raising its own tariffs on imported large-engined gasoline-powered vehicles, as state Chinese media have suggested it might. Spain could also be impacted by the Chinese EV tariffs. Last week SEAT-CUPRA's CEO said that an electric vehicle made in China and designed in Spain by CUPRA, which is owned by Germany's Volkswagen, would be 'wiped out' if the European Commission followed through with planned import tariffs on Chinese-made vehicles. Sanchez on Tuesday is expected to meet representatives of SAIC Motor, one of the Chinese automakers most affected by the EU tariffs, and sign a Memorandum of Understanding with greentech company Envision, which is building an EV battery plant in Spain. 'In this increasingly geopolitical and economic context, as you have pointed out, we must work together to resolve differences through negotiation,' Sanchez told Xi. In an advisory vote in July, Spain, France and Italy supported the European Commission's proposal to adopt additional duties on Chinese-made EVs on top of the bloc's standard 10% tariff. But Beijing has been urging the EU's member states to reject the curbs at a final vote on it in October. The tariffs would be implemented in addition to the EU's standard 10% import tariff unless a qualified majority of 15 EU members representing 65% of the EU population vote against them.	https://www.voanews.com/a/china-s-xi-spain-s-sanchez-seek-to-ease-eu-china-trade-disputes-/7777680.html	2024-09-09T15:24:08-07:00	
IAEA chief hopes to hold talks with Iranian president by November	VIENNA — U.N. nuclear watchdog chief Rafael Grossi hopes to hold talks with new Iranian President Masoud Pezeshkian by November on improving Iran's cooperation with his agency, he said Monday. Several long-standing issues are dogging relations between Iran and the International Atomic Energy Agency, including Tehran's barring of uranium-enrichment experts on the inspection team and its failure for years to explain uranium traces found at undeclared sites. 'He (Pezeshkian) agreed to meet with me at an appropriate juncture,' Grossi said in a statement to a quarterly meeting of his agency's 35-nation Board of Governors, referring to an exchange after Pezeshkian's election in July. 'I encourage Iran to facilitate such a meeting in the not-too-distant future so that we can establish a constructive dialog that leads swiftly to real results,' he said. With nuclear diplomacy largely stalled between the Iranian presidential election and the U.S. one on November 5, Grossi said he wanted to make real progress soon. Asked at a news conference if his reference to the 'not-too-distant future' meant before or after the U.S. election, Grossi said: 'No, hopefully before that.' IAEA board resolutions ordering Iran to cooperate urgently with the investigation into the uranium traces and calling on it to reverse its barring of inspectors have brought little change, and quarterly IAEA reports seen by Reuters on August 29 showed no progress. Iran responded to the latest resolution in June by announcing an expansion of its enrichment capacity, installing more centrifuges, machines that enrich uranium, at its Natanz and Fordow sites. At its Fordow site dug into a mountain where it is enriching to up to 60% purity, close to the 90% of weapons grade, it installed two of the eight new cascades, or clusters, of advanced IR-6 centrifuges within days of informing the IAEA of its plan. Two weeks later, it installed another two. By the end of the quarter, the latest IAEA reports showed Iran had completed installation of all eight new cascades but still not brought them online. At its larger underground site at Natanz, which is enriching to up to 5% purity, it had brought 15 new cascades of other advanced models online. 'What we see is that there is some work, but nothing that indicates a rush to a fast implementation of a big increase in terms of enrichment production,' Grossi said. Iran has stepped up nuclear work since 2019, after then-U.S. President Donald Trump abandoned an agreement reached under his predecessor Barack Obama under which Iran agreed to restrictions on its nuclear activities in return for the lifting of international sanctions. Western diplomats say there are plans for talks on fresh restrictions should Democrat Kamala Harris win the election.	https://www.voanews.com/a/iaea-chief-hopes-to-hold-talks-with-iranian-president-by-november-/7777642.html	2024-09-09T14:58:51-07:00	
China announces joint naval, air drills with Russia	Beijing — China’s Defense Ministry on Monday announced joint naval and air drills with Russia starting this month, underscoring the closeness between their militaries as Russia presses its grinding invasion of Ukraine. The ministry said the 'Northern United-2024' exercises would take place in the Sea of Japan and the Sea of Okhotsk farther north, but gave no details. It said the naval and air drills aimed to improve strategic cooperation between the two countries and 'strengthen their ability to jointly deal with security threats.' The notice also said the two navies would cruise together in the Pacific, the fifth time they have done so, and together take part in Russia’s 'Great Ocean-24' exercise. No details were given. China has refused to criticize Russia's full-scale invasion of Ukraine, now in its third year, and blamed the U.S. and NATO for provoking President Vladimir Putin. While China has not directly provided Russia with arms, it has become a crucial economic lifeline as a top customer for Russian oil and gas as well as a supplier of electronics and other items with both civilian and military uses. Russia and China, along with other U.S. critics such as Iran, have aligned their foreign policies to challenge and potentially overturn the Western-led liberal democratic order. With joint exercises, Russia has sought Chinese help in achieving its long-cherished aim of becoming a Pacific power, while Moscow has backed China's territorial claims in the South China Sea and elsewhere. That has increasingly included the 180-kilometer (110-mile) wide Taiwan Strait that divides mainland China from the self-governing island democracy that Beijing considers its own territory and threatens to invade. Based on that claim, the Taiwan Strait is Chinese. Though it is not opposed to navigation by others through one of the world's most heavily trafficked sea ways, China is 'firmly opposed to provocations by countries that jeopardize China’s sovereignty and security under the banner of freedom of navigation,' Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesperson Mao Ning said at a daily briefing on Friday. Mao was responding to a report that a pair of German navy ships were to pass through the strait this month for the first time in more than two decades. The U.S. and virtually every other country, along with Taiwan, considers the strait international waters.	https://www.voanews.com/a/china-announces-joint-naval-air-drills-with-russia/7777648.html	2024-09-09T14:57:52-07:00	
UN: Taliban’s morality laws targeting women deepen Afghanistan’s isolation	Islamabad, Pakistan — The United Nations rights chief expressed his 'abhorrence' Monday at the recent promulgation of 'so-called morality laws' in Taliban-controlled Afghanistan that silence women or order them to cover their faces and bodies in public. Volker Türk told a U.N. Human Rights Council session in Geneva that the new laws were implemented alongside bans on Afghan girls attending secondary school, prohibiting female students from accessing university education, and severely curtailing women's access to public life and employment opportunities. 'I shudder to think what is next for the women and girls of Afghanistan. This repressive control over half the population in the country is unparalleled in today’s world,' the U.N. Human Rights Commissioner stated. Türk denounced the morality laws as outrageous and amounting 'to systematic gender persecution.' He warned that the intensifying curbs on women are 'propelling Afghanistan further down a path of isolation, pain, and hardship.' It would also jeopardize the country’s future by 'massively stifling its development,' he added. Richard Bennett, the U.N. special rapporteur on the situation of Afghan human rights, also spoke and informed Monday’s session in Geneva that the Taliban had lately barred him from visiting the country to conduct assessments in line with his mandate. He added that the morality law 'marks a new phase in the ongoing repression of respect for human rights' since the Taliban regained control of the country three years ago. The 114-page, 35-article law enacted by the Taliban last month outlines various actions and specific conduct that the Taliban consider mandatory or prohibited for Afghan men and women in line with their strict interpretation of the Islamic law of Sharia. The restrictions prohibit Afghan women from traveling without a male guardian, require them to be silent in public, enforce mandatory covering of females from head to toe, including their faces, and forbid eye contact between women and unrelated men. The law empowers the Taliban’s contentious Ministry for Promoting Virtue and Preventing Vice to enforce it strictly. Ministry enforcers are ordered to discipline offenders, and penalties may include anything from a verbal warning to fines to imprisonment for offenses such as adultery, extramarital sex, lesbianism, taking pictures of living objects, and befriending non-Muslims. Taliban leaders did not comment on Monday’s U.N. assertions, but they have rejected previous international criticism of the morality laws. Zabihullah Mujahid, the Taliban spokesperson, recently stated that 'non-Muslims should educate themselves about Islamic laws and respect Islamic values' before rejecting or raising objections to them. 'We find it blasphemous to our Islamic Sharia when objections are raised without understanding it,' he said. No country has officially recognized the Taliban as the legitimate ruler of Afghanistan, citing human rights concerns, particularly the harsh treatment of women. 'Any normalization of engagement with the de facto authorities must be based on demonstrated, measurable, and independently verifiable improvements in human rights,' Bennett stressed in his speech Monday, urging the Islamist Taliban to reverse current policies.	https://www.voanews.com/a/un-taliban-s-morality-laws-targeting-women-deepen-afghanistan-s-isolation/7777637.html	2024-09-09T14:39:14-07:00	
US: Transfer of ballistic missiles from Iran to Russia would be 'dramatic escalation'	Washington — The transfer of ballistic missiles from Iran to Russia would signify a 'dramatic escalation' of Tehran's support for Moscow, and the United States is prepared to respond with 'significant consequences,' the State Department said Monday. U.S. media outlets reported last week that Washington believed Iran had transferred the weapons to Russia for use in Ukraine, and the European Union has said allies shared 'credible' intelligence that Tehran had done so. 'Any transfer of Iranian ballistic missiles to Russia would represent a dramatic escalation in Iran's support for Russia's war of aggression against Ukraine,' State Department spokesperson Vedant Patel told journalists. 'We have been clear ... that we're prepared to deliver significant consequences,' he said. Tehran has rejected the accusation that it transferred the missiles, but the Kremlin has not explicitly denied it. Faced with punishing Western sanctions, Moscow has turned to Iran and North Korea for weapons supplies to keep its war machine going in Ukraine. Ukraine says it has been attacked with Iranian-designed Shahed drones on an almost daily basis from Russia and has found fragments of North Korean missiles on its territory. The reported delivery of missiles to Russia comes as the Kremlin has once again stepped up its bombing campaign against Ukraine's key infrastructure ahead of winter.	https://www.voanews.com/a/us-transfer-of-ballistic-missiles-from-iran-to-russia-would-be-dramatic-escalation-/7777611.html	2024-09-09T14:13:09-07:00	
HRW calls for stronger Sudan arms embargo as UN weighs sanctions	Nairobi, Kenya — The United Nations Security Council is expected to vote Wednesday on whether to renew existing sanctions that prevent the transfer of military equipment to Sudan’s western Darfur region. The pending vote comes as Human Rights Watch calls on the council to expand an existing arms embargo, currently on the restive region, to the rest of the country. The western Darfur region has been the epicenter of Sudan’s current civil war, which pits the Sudanese armed forces, or SAF, the paramilitary Rapid Support Forces, or RSF, and other militias against each other. U.N. agencies and rights groups say the parties involved have committed war crimes and other human rights violations during the conflict, which has lasted nearly 18 months. Ahead of Wednesday’s vote, Human Rights Watch is urging the council to consider imposing an arms ban on the entire country to stop the ongoing rights violations and the suffering of the people. The Sudanese government opposes expansion of the embargo. Human Rights Watch investigators found that some of the weapons being used in the conflict were acquired after the civil war broke out in April of last year. Jean-Baptiste Gallopin is a senior researcher in Human Rights Watch's crisis, conflict, and arms division. 'We based our research on an analysis of photos and videos posted on social media and primarily taken by the fighters themselves, showing them in possession and using equipment such as attack drones, drone jammers, anti-tank guided missiles, as well as truck-mounted multiple rocket launchers systems and mortar munitions,' said Gallopin. The rights group’s report shows some of the mortars fired were manufactured in China last year. Companies in Iran, Russia, Serbia, and the United Arab Emirates have also produced some of the weapons used, according to the organization. In 2004, a year after the start of another Darfur conflict between ethnic militias and government-backed militias known as the Janjaweed, the U.N. imposed the arms embargo on Darfur. The embargo originally applied to non-governmental entities and was later extended to all parties in the conflict, including the Sudanese government. Ahmed Hashi is a Horn of Africa political and security commentator. He said the regional and international community is doing little to end the conflict, and said that in fact, RSF leader Mohamed Hamdan Dagalo, better known as Hemedi, is receiving strong foreign support. 'I think the United Arab Emirates and other proxy states are arming Mr. Hamedi. I think that the rebellion inside Sudan is foreign-led. I think that the people who caused the Janjaweed and caused international human rights, international crime are fighting in Sudan. I'm afraid that terrorism will rear its ugly head. It is the tragic human rights issue of the 21st century. And we are all, including me, ashamed as Africans that we have not done anything,' he said. The UAE has denied arming the RSF. Gallopin said imposing an arms ban in one region would not solve the conflict. He said a ban is needed nationwide. 'We believe that the existing embargo is not sufficient, that there needs to be a wholesale embargo on the sale of armed and military equipment to the whole of Sudan, because we documented, we and others documented very serious abuses carried out by the warring parties since last year, including widespread war crimes, crimes against humanity. We know we published a report on Darfur showing that ethnic cleansing was committed. And so we think it's urgent for the Security Council to broaden that arms embargo,' he said. The group also is calling on the Security Council to condemn governments that are violating the existing arms embargo on Darfur and take urgent measures to sanction individuals and entities that are also doing so.	https://www.voanews.com/a/hrw-calls-for-stronger-sudan-arms-embargo-as-un-weighs-sanctions/7777277.html	2024-09-09T12:59:29-07:00	
Kenya begins 3-day mourning over deaths of 21 children in school fire	Nairobi, Kenya — Kenya begins three days of national mourning Monday following the deaths of at least 21 students in a boarding school inferno in central Kenya. Distraught parents and relatives gathered to give samples for DNA testing Monday at the Naromoru hospital in Kenya, four days after the fire at Hillside Endarasha Academy, where some of the deceased were burned beyond recognition. The dormitory housed 156 students, the majority of whom escaped. However, officials say 17 children remain unaccounted for following the tragedy, which has devastated the school community. John Mwangi said he still does not know the whereabouts of his child, a student at the school. 'At least it’ll be a reprieve to 20 parents. I might be among them, I don’t know … that’s why we are here. We are hanging on hope,' he said. Some parents and relatives have been camping at the school to demand answers. Chief government pathologist Johansen Oduor said DNA testing will help families get closure. 'We’ll be undergoing a process of DNA collection from them at the hospital by the government chemist, then on Tuesday, we’ll start the autopsy,' Oduor said. 'During the autopsy, we’ll be documenting the cause of death and also taking samples for DNA which will later be reconciled so that at the end of the day, we’ll be able to unite the parents to their children.' The Red Cross and ministry of health have been offering support to those affected. 'We have the emergency disaster preparedness and response team,' said Deborah Barasa, Kenya's cabinet secretary for health. 'We have the counselors, or the mental health and psychosocial support. We have forensic teams on the ground and they are supporting in every way.' Officials have yet to determine the cause of the fire, with investigations ongoing. There have been a number of incidents of fires at Kenyan boarding schools in recent years, prompting national concerns about safety standards. A report released in 2020 by the country’s auditor general said many schools lack proper equipment to handle fires and many dormitories are not constructed in accordance with government regulations. Education cabinet secretary Julius Ogamba said a review of the rules is needed. 'Perhaps as a country it has reached that time when we need to relook at those rules and regulations, which are policies, and find out whether it is time for us to move them a step further and make them laws so that there are penalties that will attach to any person who violates them,' Ogamba said. Kenya’s deadliest school fire was in 2001 when at least 67 students died in a dormitory inferno at Kyanguli high school in the southeast of the country. As the country marks three days of mourning for another school fire, experts say the government needs to do more to ensure the safety of learners.	https://www.voanews.com/a/kenya-begins-3-day-mourning-over-deaths-of-21-children-in-school-fire/7777284.html	2024-09-09T12:58:38-07:00

4 migrants dead, others missing after boat capsizes off Senegal	DAKAR, Senegal — A boat carrying migrants capsized off the coast of Senegal over the weekend, leaving at least four people dead and several others missing, local authorities said Monday. The artisanal fishing boat left the town of Mbour, nearly 80 kilometers (50 miles) south of the capital, Dakar, heading to Europe on Sunday afternoon before capsizing a few miles off the coast, Amadou Diop, the district's prefect, told The Associated Press. Local fishermen rescued three people who were brought back to shore by naval authorities. Senegal’s navy is looking for those missing, Diop said, adding that the exact number of passengers remained unknown. In recent years, the number of migrants leaving West Africa through Senegal has surged with many fleeing conflicts, poverty and the lack of job opportunities. Most head to the Canary Islands, a Spanish archipelago off the coast of West Africa, which is used as a stepping stone to continental Europe. Since the beginning of the year, more than 22,300 people have landed on the Canary Islands, 126% more than the same period last year, according to statistics released by Spain’s Interior Ministry. Last month, the Senegalese army said it had arrested 453 migrants and 'members of smuggling networks' as part of a 12-day operation patrolling the coastline. More than half of the arrested were Senegalese nationals, the army said. In July, a boat carrying 300 migrants, mostly from Gambia and Senegal, capsized off Mauritania. More than a dozen died and at least 150 others went missing. The Atlantic route from West Africa to the Canary Islands is one of the deadliest in the world. While there is no accurate death toll because of the lack of information on departures from West Africa, the Spanish migrant rights group Walking Borders estimates the victims are in the thousands this year alone. Migrant boats that get lost or run into problems often vanish in the Atlantic, with some drifting across the ocean for months until they are found in the Caribbean and Latin America carrying only human remains.	https://www.voanews.com/a/migrants-dead-others-missing-after-boat-capsizes-off-senegal/7777308.html	2024-09-09T11:22:47-07:00	
Flooding in Morocco, Algeria kills more than a dozen people	RABAT, Morocco — Torrential downpours hit North Africa's normally arid mountains and deserts over the weekend, causing flooding that killed more than a dozen people in Morocco and Algeria and destroyed homes and critical infrastructure. In Morocco, officials said the two days of storms surpassed historic averages, in some cases exceeding the annual average rainfall. The downpours affected some of the regions that experienced a deadly earthquake one year ago. Meteorologists had predicted that a rare deluge could strike North Africa’s Sahara Desert, where many areas receive less than an inch of rain a year. Officials in Morocco said 11 people were killed in rural areas where infrastructure has historically been lacking, and 24 homes collapsed. Nine people were missing. Drinking water and electrical infrastructure were damaged, along with major roads. Rachid El Khalfi, Morocco’s Interior Ministry spokesperson, said Sunday in a statement that the government was working to restore communication and access to flooded regions in the 'exceptional situation' and urged people to use caution. In neighboring Algeria, which held a presidential election over the weekend, authorities said at least five died in the country's desert provinces. Interior Minister Brahim Merad called the situation 'catastrophic' on state-owned television. Algeria’s state-run news service APS said the government had sent thousands of civil protection and military officers to help with emergency response efforts and rescue families stuck in their homes. The floods also damaged bridges and trains in the area.	https://www.voanews.com/a/flooding-in-morocco-algeria-kills-more-than-a-dozen-people/7777179.html	2024-09-09T09:25:26-07:00

Under Yoon, calls for South Korean nukes 'normalized'	Seoul, South Korea — Less than two years after South Korean President Yoon Suk Yeol pledged his country would not seek nuclear weapons, his newly appointed defense minister is openly envisioning scenarios in which South Korea might reconsider that stance. The comments by Defense Minister Kim Yong-hyun, who took office on Friday, are the latest evidence that the once-taboo idea of nuclear armament has gone mainstream in Seoul, amid growing concerns about North Korea's rapidly expanding nuclear arsenal and the long-term reliability of U.S. protection. As an academic and retired military officer, Kim has long argued that South Korea may need nuclear weapons in some form to counter North Korea. In recently unearthed footage from a 2020 seminar, Kim warned South Korea has 'no survival or future' without such a deterrent. During his confirmation process last week, Kim stood by those comments, saying 'all options' should remain open if the U.S. nuclear umbrella proves insufficient. It appears to be the first time a sitting South Korean defense minister has publicly entertained the possibility of acquiring nuclear weapons, and marks a sharp departure from his predecessor, who repeatedly and firmly rejected the proposal under any condition. Contacted by VOA, a South Korean defense ministry spokesperson maintained there has been 'no change in the principle or position' that Seoul relies on U.S. extended deterrence and the U.S.-South Korea alliance to address the North Korean nuclear threat. 'However, if we cannot guarantee the survival and security of the state, all means and methods are open,' the spokesperson added, emphasizing the need to work closely with the United States. A spokesperson for Yoon’s presidential office declined to comment for this story. Most observers doubt South Korea will pursue nuclear weapons any time soon due to the massive economic and national security risks it would entail. Not only would South Korea risk enraging China, but Seoul could upend its alliance with the United States and invite painful international sanctions, all while possibly encouraging others in the region to consider nuclear weapons of their own. Despite the risks, Yoon continues to drive the once unthinkable idea further into the mainstream, raising concerns that the proposal could become more acceptable — and eventually turn into reality. Nuke calls now routine Yoon himself suggested last January that South Korea could develop nuclear arms if the North Korean threat escalated – raising alarm in Washington, where non-proliferation has long been a priority. Three months later, Yoon and U.S. President Joe Biden signed what is known as the Washington Declaration, which bolstered U.S. defense assurances while reaffirming South Korea’s commitments under the nuclear non-proliferation treaty. Yoon’s appointment of Kim, however, appears to contradict the spirit of that agreement, said Lee Sang-sin, a research fellow at the Korea Institute for National Unification. What stands out most, Lee said, is the lack of public reaction to Kim’s remarks. Kim’s appointment has drawn little attention from South Korean media and been largely ignored by Western outlets — a possible indication that calls for South Korea’s nuclear armament have become routine. 'That’s what I have warned about,' said Lee. '[This conversation] has been normalized.' When contacted by VOA, the White House National Security Council declined to directly comment on Kim's statements, instead emphasizing South Korea’s pledge under the non-proliferation treaty as outlined in the Washington Declaration. 'We will continue to work with our ROK allies to strengthen our alliance and ensure we are well-positioned to deter nuclear threats,' an NSC spokesman added. Driving the conversation Polls have long suggested a majority of South Koreans support acquiring nuclear weapons, although such views were once confined to the political fringes. Under Yoon’s presidency, the debate has become so entrenched that even some state-backed research institutions are exploring the possibility of nuclear armament. A June report by the state-run Institute for National Security Strategy recommended that Seoul consider government reviews and public debates on various options, including the redeployment of U.S. tactical nuclear weapons, NATO-style nuclear sharing, and South Korea developing its own arsenal. Such calls are not only coming from Seoul. A growing number of former Trump officials have expressed an openness to the idea, with some even highlighting the geopolitical advantages of South Korea getting its own weapons – an idea that Trump himself once teased. The possibility of Trump’s return, along with his 'America First' stance, has fueled concerns in Seoul that U.S. protection may be less reliable long-term, further accelerating the nuclear debate. Some in South Korea appear eager to capitalize on the trend. In an opinion piece this month, Choi Kang, president of the Asan Institute for Policy Studies, an influential conservative research group, argued South Korean nuclear weapons should be presented as beneficial to the U.S.-South Korea alliance. 'If a South Korean nuclear arsenal aligned with U.S. security interests and came to be regarded as a ‘common asset’ of the alliance, then the United States might accept it or even support it,' Choi wrote. Reality check? But many analysts caution that such statements downplay the risks of nuclear armament. 'There really needs to be greater questioning of whether more nukes and more countries with nukes truly increases any country’s security situation and a serious examination of what Seoul stands to lose by choosing that path,' said Jenny Town, a North Korea specialist with the Washington-based Stimson Center. Others, like Mason Richey, who teaches international politics at Seoul’s Hankuk University of Foreign Studies, argue it is unlikely South Korea would pursue nuclear weapons barring profound U.S.-South Korea alliance problems and/or severe regional instability. 'That said, every elite policymaker who engages the South Korea nuclear debate makes it easier to continue down the slippery slope of thinking about nuclear weapons, studying how to develop them, assuring a latent capability, deciding to develop them, and then actually building them,' he added. White House bureau chief Patsy Widakuswara contributed to this report.	https://www.voanews.com/a/under-yoon-calls-for-south-korean-nukes-normalized/7777068.html	2024-09-09T08:14:25-07:00	
Mourners attend funeral for American activist witness says was shot dead by Israeli troops	NABLUS, West Bank — The Western-backed Palestinian Authority held a funeral procession Monday for a U.S.-Turkish dual national activist who a witness says was shot and killed by Israeli forces while demonstrating against settlements in the occupied West Bank. Dozens of mourners — including several leading PA officials — attended the procession. Security forces carried the body of Aysenur Ezgi Eygi which was draped in a Palestinian flag while a traditional black-and-white checkered scarf covered her face. The 26-year-old's body was then placed into the back of a Palestinian ambulance. Turkish Foreign Ministry Spokesman Oncu Keceli said Turkey was working on repatriating Eygi's remains for burial in the Aegean coastal town of Didim as per her family's wishes, but 'because the land crossing from the Palestinian territories to Jordan was closed as of Sunday, the ministry was trying to have the body flown directly to Turkey.' U.S. officials did not respond to a request for comment. Jonathan Pollak, an Israeli peace activist who participated in Friday's protest, said Israeli forces shot her on Friday in the city of Nablus while posing no threat, adding that the killing happened during a period of calm after clashes between soldiers and Palestinian protesters. Pollak said he then saw two Israeli soldiers mount the roof of a nearby home, train a gun in the group's direction and fired, with one of the bullets striking Eygi in the head. The Israeli military said it was looking into reports that troops had killed a foreign national while firing at an 'instigator of violent activity' in the area of the protest. The West Bank has seen a surge of violence since the Israel-Hamas war began in October, with increasing Israeli raids, attacks by Palestinian militants on Israelis, and attacks by Israeli settlers on Palestinians.	https://www.voanews.com/a/mourners-attend-funeral-for-american-activist-witness-say-was-shot-dead-by-israeli-troops-/7776965.html	2024-09-09T07:29:42-07:00	
Attempts to keep up exchanges between Taiwanese, Chinese face obstacles	Taipei, Taiwan — Efforts to maintain exchanges between Taiwanese and Chinese citizens face new challenges after Beijing last month sentenced a Taiwanese activist to nine years in jail, a move that analysts say will create a chilling effect within Taiwan’s civil society. On September 6, China’s Taiwan Affairs Office (TAO) confirmed that a court in the eastern city of Wenzhou earlier had sentenced Taiwanese political activist Yang Chih-yuan to nine years in jail under secession charges. TAO said Yang, who was arrested in 2022 while teaching and participating in competitions for the board game Go, has long been involved in secessionist activities, playing a key role in organizations that advocate Taiwan’s independence. 'His acts are egregious and the court reached the decision according to law,' the office said in a statement. Taiwan’s Mainland Affairs Council, which oversees cross-strait exchanges, condemned the Chinese court’s ruling and asked Beijing to make public the verdict and the evidence that supports the charges. 'Beijing is trying to use Yang’s case to intimidate Taiwanese people and use the pretext of penalizing Taiwan independence as a way to exercise long-arm jurisdiction,' the MAC wrote in a statement released last week. Yang’s case marks the first time that China used secession charges against Taiwanese people. It comes after Beijing in June introduced 22 new guidelines to punish what they called 'die-hard Taiwan independence activists.' The maximum sentence could be the death penalty. Analysts say the sentencing of Yang represents Beijing’s attempt to take a 'more hardline stance' against Taiwanese who promote the island’s sovereignty. His case 'shows that Beijing means business when it comes to using legal instruments to crack down on what it regards as ‘separatism,’' said J. Michael Cole, a Taipei-based senior fellow at the Global Taiwan Institute. 'This will inevitably affect people-to-people and civil society exchanges [between Taiwan and China,]' Cole told VOA in a written statement. Indefinite delay of cross-strait academic exchanges, city-to-city forum Meanwhile, the scheduled visits by two academic delegations from China’s Xiamen University have reportedly been postponed as Taiwanese authorities review their paperwork. While some local media outlets said the postponement may be caused by 'obstacles' imposed by Taiwanese authorities, Taiwan’s Mainland Affairs Council said the review of the Chinese delegations’ applications is based on existing procedures, adding that Taipei has no intention to prevent certain groups from visiting Taiwan. Despite clarification from Taiwanese officials, China’s state-run tabloid Global Times characterized the postponement as the Taiwanese government’s attempt to 'block' the Chinese delegations from visiting Taiwan. 'The Xiamen University delegations have completed the preparations in terms of formalities and materials, but related ‘security authorities’ in Taiwan have put ‘a technical hold’ in place while they carry out a review,' Zhang Wensheng, deputy dean of the Taiwan Research Institute at Xiamen University, told the Global Times in an interview. Some experts say the delay in the Chinese delegation’s trips to Taiwan shows the Taiwanese government may be reviewing how to facilitate cross-strait exchanges amid growing military and political pressure from Beijing. 'In light of Beijing’s heightened pressure against Taiwan, the Taiwanese government may be reviewing what might be a more reciprocal approach to manage cross-strait academic exchanges,' Wen-ti Sung, a Taipei-based political scientist for the Australian National University, told VOA by phone. In addition to the delay of cross-strait academic exchanges, the annual Shanghai-Taipei City Forum, which remains one of the few occasions for municipal officials from Taiwan and China to meet, has yet to announce a date for a potential 2024 gathering. When asked in August about the forum, Taipei Mayor Chiang Wan-an told Taiwanese media outlets that at a time when cross-strait tensions are high, it is more necessary for Taiwan and China to maintain communication. 'Such delays serve as a clear reminder that even lower-level engagement is difficult to sustain when one side rejects core aspects of the other’s existence,' Timothy Rich, a political scientist at Western Kentucky University, told VOA in a written response. Since Taiwan President Lai Ching-te took office in May, Beijing has increased military pressure against Taiwan. Against this backdrop, Cole in Taipei said the lack of engagement between Taipei and Beijing may increase the risks of miscalculation, which could lead to accidents and escalation. In his view, Beijing will likely maintain a two-pronged approach against Taiwan in the near future. They will uphold 'a suspension of official dialogue with the Taiwanese government led by the Democratic Progressive Party while keeping the door open to sub-state interaction with other elements of Taiwan’s society, with the aim of dividing both,' he told VOA.	https://www.voanews.com/a/attempts-to-keep-up-exchanges-between-taiwanese-chinese-face-obstacles/7776929.html	2024-09-09T06:31:54-07:00	
Rubble and grief: Morocco’s High Atlas marks one year since record earthquake	IMI N'TALA, Morocco — The rescue crews and bystanders are long gone but the remnants of homes still sit in piles off to the side of the jagged roads. A year after nearly 3,000 people died when a record earthquake shook communities throughout Morocco's High Atlas, it still looks like a bomb just went off in villages like Imi N'tala, where dozens of residents died after a chunk of mountainside cracked off and flattened the majority of buildings. Broken bricks, bent rods of rebar and pieces of kitchen floors remain but have been swept into neater piles alongside plastic tents where the displaced now live. Some await funds to reconstruct their homes. Others await approval of their blueprints. The region shaken by the earthquake is full of impoverished agricultural villages like Imi N’tala, accessible only via bumpy, unmaintained roads. Associated Press reporters revisited half a dozen of them last week ahead of the first anniversary. In some places, residents who say they're awaiting governmental action have begun reconstructing buildings on an ad hoc basis. Elsewhere, people tired of the stuffiness of plastic tents have moved back into their cracked homes or decamped to larger cities, abandoning their old lives. Streets have been neatly swept in towns like Amizmiz and Moulay Brahim, although cracked buildings and piles of rubble remain, much as they were in the days after the quake. The rhythms of normal life have somewhat resumed in some of the province’s larger towns, where rebuilding efforts on roads, homes, schools and businesses are underway and some residents have been provided metal container homes. But many of those displaced from the more than 55,000 homes destroyed by the temblor remain vulnerable to summer’s heat and winter’s cold, living in plastic tents, impatient to return. Mohamed Soumer, a 69-year-old retiree who lost his son in last year's earthquake, is angry because local authorities have forbidden him from rebuilding his home on the same steep mountainside due to safety concerns. He now spends his days with his wife in a plastic tent near his now-rubbled home and fears moving elsewhere and restarting his life in a larger, more expensive area. 'Residents want to stay here because they have land where they grow vegetables to make a living,' he said. 'If they go somewhere else and abandon this place, they will not be able to live there.' The government early on promised households monthly stipends in the aftermath of the earthquake and additional funds for seismically safe reconstruction. It said last week that both had been provided to the majority of eligible families and households. 'Specific solutions are being deployed on the ground for difficult cases,' Morocco's Prime Minister's Office said in a statement. But on the ground, its disbursal has been uneven, residents say, with many still waiting for funds or reconstruction to commence. Anger has mounted against local authorities in towns like Amizmiz and villages like Talat N'Yaqoub, where residents have protested against their living conditions. They have criticized the slow pace of reconstruction and demanded more investment in social services and infrastructure, which has long gone neglected in contrast with Morocco's urban centers and coastline. Officials have said rebuilding will cost 120 billion dirhams ($12 billion) and take about five years. The government has rebuilt some stretches of rural roads, health centers and schools but last week the commission tasked with reconstruction acknowledged the need to speed up some home rebuilding.	https://www.voanews.com/a/rubble-and-grief-morocco-s-high-atlas-marks-one-year-since-record-earthquake-/7775893.html	2024-09-09T05:38:18-07:00	
Bomb blast hits Pakistan polio team amid national immunization drive	Islamabad — Authorities in northwestern Pakistan said Monday that a roadside bomb explosion injured at least 10 people, including anti-polio vaccinators and police personnel escorting them. The bombing in the South Waziristan district near the border with Afghanistan targeted a convoy carrying polio workers and their guards on the opening day of a nationwide immunization campaign. Area security and hospital officials reported that three health workers and six security personnel were among the victims. No group immediately claimed responsibility for the violence in a region where security forces are fighting militants linked to the outlawed Pakistani Taliban. Last week, Pakistan reported its 17th wild poliovirus case of the year from Islamabad, saying it paralyzed a child and marked the first infection in 16 years in the national capital. Pakistani health officials said in the lead-up to Monday’s polio campaign that it is designed to vaccinate more than 33 million children under five in 115 districts nationwide. Muhammad Anwarul Haq, coordinator of the National Emergency Operations Center for Polio Eradication, stated that the immunization drive would primarily focus on districts where 'the virus has been detected and the risk of continued transmission and spread is really high.' Haq encouraged all parents and caregivers to ensure their children get vaccinated, lamenting that 'parents have not always welcomed and opened their doors to the vaccinators when they visit their homes.' Pakistan and Afghanistan, which reported nine paralytic polio cases so far in 2024, are the only two remaining polio-endemic countries globally. Polio immunization campaigns have long faced multiple challenges in both countries, such as security and vaccine boycotts, dealing setbacks to the goal of eradicating the virus from the world.	https://www.voanews.com/a/bomb-blast-hits-pakistan-polio-team-amid-national-immunization-drive-/7776763.html	2024-09-09T04:13:30-07:00	
South America's rivers hit record lows as Brazil drought impact spreads	ASUNCION — South America's Paraguay River, a key thoroughfare for grains, has hit a record low in Paraguay's capital Asuncion, with water levels depleted by a severe drought upriver in Brazil that has hindered navigation along waterways in the Amazon. The depth of the Paraguay River, measured versus a 'zero' index rather than the riverbed, has dropped below minus 0.82 meter, breaking the previous record low in October 2021, data from the national Meteorology and Hydrology Directorate shows. The body expects the river will keep falling with no rain forecast. The Parana River in Argentina is also near year lows around grains hub Rosario. Both the Paraguay and Parana rivers start in Brazil, eventually joining and flowing into the sea near Buenos Aires. They are important routes for soy, corn and other trade. 'In the northern section [of the Paraguay waterway], navigation is practically halted due to the extreme drop in water levels,' the Paraguayan oilseed and grain crushing chamber CAPPRO told Reuters in written comments. The chamber, whose grain-trader members handle some 60% of Paraguay's soybean exports, said the low river was hitting shipments, though the impact was capped as it was not peak trading season. 'Vessels have had to transport volumes below the average of their normal cargo capacity,' said CAPPRO. 'This has generated delays and made travel times longer.' The chamber's members include ADM, Bunge and Cargill. Expected rains not enough The Paraguay-Parana system is a waterway of more than 3,400 kilometers that runs through Argentina, Brazil, Uruguay, as well as landlocked Paraguay and Bolivia. Paraguay is the world's No. 3 soybean exporter and roughly 80% of grains travel along waterways to seaports downriver. Argentina is the top exporter of processed soy, most of which goes down the Parana from around river port city Rosario. Paraguay's deputy director for the Meteorology and Hydrology Directorate, Jorge Sanchez, said the outlook for river levels in the coming months was not encouraging, even with the traditional October-November rainy season ahead. 'This would alleviate the level of the river, but it's not expected to be enough,' Sanchez said. Less rain than normal is expected in the second half of the year due to the La Nina weather phenomenon, which brings drier, cooler conditions in Paraguay and Argentina, though it usually heralds wetter weather farther north in Brazil. Sanchez said this year, however, La Nina was delayed and its effects would be seen only between October and November. 'There is a lot of variability due to climate change,' he added. In Brazil, where record wildfires have also occurred, the low water levels are leaving some communities in the Amazon isolated, as well as hitting soy and corn shipments in center-west states such as Mato Grosso, Brazil's number one grains growing area.	https://www.voanews.com/a/south-america-s-rivers-hit-record-lows-as-brazil-drought-impact-spreads-/7776746.html	2024-09-09T04:04:14-07:00	
El Salvador police director, accused embezzler killed in helicopter crash	SAN SALVADOR — The head of El Salvador's police forces and a man accused of a multi-million dollar embezzlement were killed when the military helicopter in which they were traveling crashed on Sunday night, the government said. Police director Mauricio Arriaza was escorting former cooperative manager Manuel Coto back to El Salvador. Coto, who was is accused of embezzling $35 million, had been arrested earlier on Sunday in Honduras after attempting to flee to the United States. He was subsequently handed over to Salvadoran police. According to the Salvadoran Armed Forces, the helicopter crashed in the Pasaquina district, in the southeast of the country near the border with Honduras. The total number of people in the helicopter when it crashed remains unknown. President Nayib Bukele said on X: 'What happened cannot remain a simple 'accident'. It must be investigated thoroughly and to the last consequences.' He praised Arriaza for his significant contribution to national security and his roles in various police operations.	https://www.voanews.com/a/el-salvador-police-director-accused-embezzler-killed-in-helicopter-crash-/7776737.html	2024-09-09T03:47:35-07:00

US Congress takes up a series of bills targeting China, from drones to drugs	WASHINGTON — How to curb and counter China's influence and power — through its biotech companies, drones and electric vehicles — will dominate the U.S. House's first week back from summer break, with lawmakers taking up a series of measures targeting Beijing. Washington views Beijing as its biggest geopolitical rival, and the legislation is touted as ensuring the U.S. prevails in the competition. Many of the bills scheduled for a vote this week appear to have both Republican and Democratic support, reflecting strong consensus that congressional actions are needed to counter China. The legislation 'will take meaningful steps to counter the military, economic and ideological threat of the Chinese Communist Party,' said Rep. John Moolenaar, chair of the House Select Committee on the Chinese Communist Party and a Michigan Republican. 'There's a bipartisan goal to win this competition.' Advocacy groups worry about the impact, warning against rhetoric that hurts Asian Americans and could create 'an atmosphere of guilt by association or fuel divisiveness,' said Christine Chen, executive director of Asian & Pacific Islander American Vote. The Chinese Embassy in Washington called the legislation 'new McCarthyism' that hypes the tensions in an election year. If passed, the bills 'will cause serious interference to China-U.S. relations and mutually beneficial cooperation, and will inevitably damage the U.S.'s own interests, image and credibility,' spokesman Liu Pengyu said in a statement. Among the bills are efforts to reduce U.S. reliance on Chinese biotech companies, ban Chinese EVs and drones, restrict Chinese nationals from buying farmland, toughen export restrictions and revive a program to root out spying on U.S. intellectual property. If approved, the measures would still need to clear the Senate. Here's a look at the key legislation: Targeting Beijing-linked biotech A bill seeks to ban a group of five biotechnology companies with Chinese ties from working with anyone that receives federal money. The companies include those that work to help doctors detect genetic causes for cancer or do research and manufacturing for American drugmakers, considered a key step in developing new medications. America's biotech companies have said the bill would disrupt their partnerships with Chinese contractors, resulting in delays in clinical trials for new drugs and higher costs. Supporters say the legislation is necessary to protect U.S. health care data and reduce the country's reliance on China for its medical supply chain. 'American patients cannot be in a position where we rely on China for genomic testing or basic medical supplies,' said Rep. Brad Wenstrup, an Ohio Republican who sponsored the bill. He called it 'the first step' in protecting Americans' genetic data. BGI, one of the Chinese companies named in the bill, called it 'a false flag targeting companies under the premise of national security.' The company, which offers genetic sequencing for research purposes in the U.S., said it follows the law and has no access to Americans' personal data. Banning Chinese drones Another bill would dub drones made by the Chinese company DJI, which dominates the global drone market, 'an unacceptable risk to U.S. national security' and cut its products from U.S. communications networks over data security concerns. The bill would protect Americans' data and critical infrastructure, said Republican Rep. Elise Stefanik of New York, who introduced it. 'Congress must use every tool at our disposal to stop' China's 'monopolistic control over the drone market,' she said. DJI argues that users have to 'opt in' to share data such as flight logs, photos and videos with the company. If users don't do so, the company said it won't have data to share with any government when compelled. It also has rejected allegations that it is a Chinese military company and has aided the persecution of members of ethnic Muslim minorities. Adam Bry, co-founder and CEO of major U.S. drone maker Skydio, told a congressional committee in June about losing business to China, where 'the Chinese government has tried to control the drone industry, pouring resources into national champions and taking aim at competitors in the U.S. and the West, tilting the playing field in China's favor.' Protecting intellectual property A challenge is likely against an attempt to revive a Trump-era program described as a way to stop Chinese efforts to steal intellectual property and spy on industry and research. The bill would direct the Justice Department to curb spying by Beijing on U.S. intellectual property and academic institutions and go after people engaged in theft of trade secrets, hacking and economic espionage. The Trump-era program, called the China Initiative, ended in 2022 after multiple unsuccessful prosecutions of researchers and concerns that it had prompted racial and ethnic profiling. Critics also say it chilled cooperation between the U.S. and China in science and technology meant to benefit the greater good. 'Our colleagues in the Republican Party sought to reinstate this failed program because they wanted to look like they were solving problems. But in reality, they were only stoking fear and hatred,' several Democratic lawmakers said in a statement in March, when they fought off another effort to restart the program. Restricting farm sales Another bill, which says it will protect U.S. farmland from foreign adversaries, has raised concerns about discrimination. It would add the agriculture secretary to the U.S. Committee on Foreign Investment, which reviews the national security implications of foreign transactions. The bill also flags as 'reportable' land sales involving citizens from China, North Korea, Russia and Iran. 'Food security is national security, and for too long, the federal government has allowed the Chinese Communist Party to put our security at risk by turning a blind eye to their steadily increasing purchases of American farmland,' said Rep. Dan Newhouse, a Republican from Washington state, who introduced the bill. The National Agricultural Law Center estimates 24 states ban or limit foreigners without residency and foreign businesses or governments from owning private farmland. The interest emerged after a Chinese billionaire bought more than 130,000 acres near a U.S. Air Force base in Texas and another Chinese company sought to build a corn plant near an Air Force base in North Dakota.	https://www.voanews.com/a/congress-takes-up-a-series-of-bills-targeting-china-from-drones-to-drugs/7776621.html	2024-09-08T21:49:26-07:00	
Republicans fault Biden administration in new report about Afghanistan withdrawal	WASHINGTON — Republicans on a U.S. House of Representatives committee issued a report Sunday criticizing the Biden administration for the chaotic August 2021 U.S. military and diplomatic withdrawal from Afghanistan after a nearly 20-year war. The report faulted President Joe Biden for failing to 'mitigate the likely consequences of the decision' to withdraw, while ignoring warnings that Taliban fighters were seizing key cities in Afghanistan faster than U.S. officials expected. In the last days of the withdrawal, a suicide bombing attack by an Islamic State terrorist killed 13 U.S. soldiers and about 170 Afghan civilians at the Kabul airport. Many Afghans clinging to the underbellies of departing aircraft leaving Afghanistan fell to their deaths. Former President Donald Trump initiated the withdrawal process in February 2020 by signing an agreement with the Taliban, a pact that Biden honored as he looked to end America’s longest war. The fateful withdrawal also played a role in Biden’s political fortunes. Until that time, Americans in national surveys approved of Biden’s performance during the first seven months of his presidency. But his approval rating dipped into negative territory after the chaotic troop withdrawal and the deaths of the 13 soldiers and has never again advanced into a favorable standing. The report from Republicans on the House Foreign Affairs Committee followed a three-year investigation and includes accusations that the Biden administration did not have adequate plans or security in place to safely carry out the withdrawal. Committee Chairman Michael McCaul said the Biden administration 'had the information and opportunity to take necessary steps to plan for the inevitable collapse of the Afghan government, so we could safely evacuate U.S. personnel, American citizens, green card holders, and our brave Afghan allies.' Previous investigations have faulted multiple U.S. administrations, including a 2023 report by the U.S. government watchdog for the U.S. in Afghanistan which cited both Trump’s and Biden’s determination to go forward with the withdrawal despite the Taliban breaking key commitments the militants made in the 2020 agreement. Congressman Gregory Meeks, the top Democrat on the committee, said in a letter to colleagues that Republicans 'cherry-picked witness testimony to exclude anything unhelpful to a predetermined, partisan narrative about the Afghanistan withdrawal.' In a lengthy statement, the U.S. State Department said, 'There are valid and important criticisms of the two-decade-long war in Afghanistan and how it concluded.' But the country’s top diplomatic agency said it 'has remained focused on evolving and growing from this moment, learning important lessons and making sustainable changes to crisis operations.' The State Department said the U.S. government successfully evacuated 120,000 Americans, Afghans, and third-country nationals from Afghanistan in the final two weeks of August 2021 and has resettled 165,000 Afghans across the U.S. The State Department said it 'stands ready to work alongside' lawmakers who have a 'serious interest' in finding legislative and administrative solutions to avoid the chaos of the withdrawal from the Afghan war zone. But the State Department said it would 'not stand by silently' as the agency and 'its workforce are used to further partisan agendas.' Some information for this story came from The Associated Press, Agence France-Presse and Reuters.	https://www.voanews.com/a/house-republicans-release-partisan-report-blaming-biden-for-chaotic-end-to-us-war-in-afghanistan/7776571.html	2024-09-08T18:13:49-07:00	
Germany’s Scholz calls for faster progress ending Russia's war on Ukraine	FRANKFURT, Germany — German Chancellor Olaf Scholz said Sunday he and Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy agree that Russia should be included in a future peace conference aimed at ending Russia's war against Ukraine. He called for stepped up efforts to solve the conflict. A previous peace conference June 15-16 in Switzerland ended with 78 countries expressing support for Ukraine’s 'territorial integrity' but otherwise left the path forward unclear. Russia did not participate. 'I believe that now is the moment when we must discuss how we get out of this war situation faster than the current impression is,' Scholz said in an interview with Germany's ZDF public television aired Sunday. 'There will certainly be a further peace conference, and the president and I agree that it must be one with Russia present,' Scholz said. Scholz is facing more political discontent at home over his government's support including money and weapons for Ukraine after populist parties that oppose arming Ukraine did well in state elections Sept. 1 at the expense of parties in his three-party governing coalition. Some members of his Social Democratic Party have also called for more emphasis on diplomacy toward Russia. Zelenskyy has presented a 10-point peace formula that calls for the expulsion of all Russian forces from Ukrainian territory and accountability for war crimes.	https://www.voanews.com/a/germany-s-scholz-calls-for-faster-progress-ending-russia-s-war-on-ukraine-/7776563.html	2024-09-08T17:43:15-07:00	
China’s Xi, Russia's Putin send greetings to North Korea's Kim Jong Un, KCNA says	Seoul, South Korea — Chinese President Xi Jinping and Russian President Vladimir Putin sent greetings to North Korean leader Kim Jong Un on the occasion of North Korea's founding anniversary, state media KCNA said on Monday. 'I am sure that the comprehensive strategic partnership between Russia and the DPRK will be strengthened in a planned way thanks to our joint efforts,' Putin said, according to KCNA. DPRK is short for the Democratic People's Republic of Korea, the North's official name. Xi called for deeper strategic communication and cooperation with North Korea in his message, KCNA said. Last year, Kim marked the country's founding day on Sept. 9 with a parade of paramilitary groups and diplomatic exchanges in which he vowed to deepen ties with China and Russia.	https://www.voanews.com/a/china-s-xi-russia-s-putin-send-greetings-to-north-korea-s-kim-jong-un-kcna-says/7776548.html	2024-09-08T17:13:04-07:00	
K-pop takes socialist Cuba by storm	Havana, Cuba — Socialist Cuba, the birthplace of salsa and other rhythms that have conquered the world, is now surrendering to the invasion of South Korean pop music. Thirteen thousand kilometers of distance separate the Asian nation and the communist-run island, as well as a different language and cultural traditions. However, all of these barriers would seem to vanish in a split second thanks to K-pop's infectious beat and elaborate choreography. Korean popular music, or K-pop, has spread far and wide from its Asian roots as boy bands like BTS and NCT and their female counterpart Blackpink rival Taylor Swift for downloads and album sales globally. But it was slow to catch on in Cuba, where salsa is king and internet speeds were glacial until recently. On Saturday, far from Seoul, dozens of teenagers clad in plaid, prep school skirts, baggy bomber pants and heavy black eyeliner busted their best moves as images of the genre's idols were projected on a large screen of a Havana dance club. 'K-pop has opened a new world to me,' said 24-year-old Fransico Piedra, who when not working with his father as a blacksmith dreams up meticulous dance steps. Known by his artistic name Ken he one day aspires to be a professional K-pop choreographer. 'It's a place where I can be myself, and share with friends the joy of laughter, song and dance.' Many of the teenagers hope to follow in the footsteps of two Cuban groups — Limitless and LTX — that before the pandemic traveled to South Korea to partake in the K-POP World Festival, an annual talent competition. K-pop — a catch all for musical styles ranging from R&B to rock — first penetrated the island when Cubans fell in love with South Korean soap operas about a decade ago. As internet speeds improved, and government controls eased, more young Cubans got online and started streaming videos like teenagers everywhere. While Cuban kids may be mesmerized by K-pop, an older generation of leaders have had frostier ties to South Korea. The two countries only restored diplomatic relations that were severed following the 1959 Cuban revolution this year and have yet to exchange ambassadors. Meanwhile, Cuba remains a staunch ally of North Korea, which views K-pop as a dangerous form of propaganda from a capitalist enemy with whom is has been locked in a military standoff since the 1950s.	https://www.voanews.com/a/k-pop-takes-socialist-cuba-by-storm/7776232.html	2024-09-08T16:54:56-07:00	
Russian troops take Ukrainian town in advance on Pokrovsk	Moscow — Russia said on Sunday its forces had taken full control of a town in eastern Ukraine as Moscow's forces advance on the strategically important city of Pokrovsk and seek to pierce the Ukrainian defensive front lines. Russian forces, which control about a fifth of Ukraine since invading in February 2022, are advancing in eastern Ukraine in an attempt to take the whole of the Donbas, which is about half the size of the U.S. state of Ohio. Russia's defense ministry said its forces had taken the town of Novohrodivka, which lies 12 kilometers from Pokrovsk, an important rail and road hub for Ukrainian forces in the area. The town had a population of 14,000 before the war. Yuri Podolyaka, an influential Ukrainian-born, pro-Russian military blogger, published maps showing Russian forces attacking beyond Novohrodivka in at least two places less than 7 kilometers from Pokrovsk. The General Staff of the Ukrainian military, in a report issued on Sunday evening, gave details of fighting throughout the Pokrovsk sector, including Novohrodivka. It said 29 attempted Russian advances had been repelled, with seven skirmishes continuing. 'Our troops are taking measures to maintain designated positions,' it said. But an interview with a Ukrainian officer broadcast last week by U.S.-funded Radio Liberty said Ukrainian forces had abandoned Novohrodivka on grounds that the positions there were not favorable for defending it. Popular Ukrainian war blog DeepState said Russian forces had captured the village of Nevelske, to the southeast. Reuters was unable to immediately verify battlefield reports from either side due to restrictions on reporting in the war. President Vladimir Putin said last week that a Ukrainian incursion into the Russian region of Kursk had failed to slow Russia's own advance in eastern Ukraine and had weakened Kyiv's defenses along the front line in a boost to Moscow. Ukraine's top military commander said on Thursday that Kyiv's incursion into the Kursk region was working. Russian forces, he said, had made no progress in their advance on Pokrovsk for the previous six days. He said that one of the objectives of the Kursk incursion was to divert Russian forces from other areas, primarily Pokrovsk and Kurakhove. Russia had diverted large numbers to Kursk but was also strengthening the Pokrovsk front, he added. Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy has said the Kursk operation was also to prevent Russian forces from crossing the border in the opposite direction. Russia currently controls about 80% of the Donbas. Given the speed of recent Russian advances in the east, some Russian war bloggers have raised concern about the army overreaching itself. Putin ordered tens of thousands of troops into Ukraine more than two and a half years ago in what he calls a special military operation. Ukraine and its Western backers have vowed to defeat Russian forces and expel all Russian troops.	https://www.voanews.com/a/russian-troops-take-ukrainian-town-in-advance-on-pokrovsk/7776225.html	2024-09-08T16:14:32-07:00

India isolates 'suspected mpox case'	New Delhi — India reported Sunday that it had put a 'suspected mpox case' into isolation, assuring that the world's most populous nation had 'robust measures' in place, the health ministry said in a statement. There have been no confirmed cases of mpox in India, a country of 1.4 billion people. 'A young male patient, who recently traveled from a country currently experiencing mpox transmission, has been identified as a suspect case of mpox,' the health ministry said in a statement. 'The patient has been isolated in a designated hospital and is currently stable,' it said, adding the samples 'are being tested to confirm the presence of mpox.' It gave no further details of where he may have contracted the disease. 'There is no cause of any undue concern,' the statement added. 'The country is fully prepared to deal with such (an) isolated travel related case and has robust measures in place to manage and mitigate any potential risk.' Mpox's resurgence and the detection in the Democratic Republic of Congo of a new strain, dubbed Clade 1b, prompted the World Health Organization to declare its highest international alert level on August 14. Mpox has also been detected in Asia and Europe.	https://www.voanews.com/a/india-isolates-suspected-mpox-case/7776214.html	2024-09-08T15:12:31-07:00	
Massive opposition rally in Pakistan calls for release of jailed ex-PM Khan	Islamabad — Thousands of supporters of Pakistan's imprisoned former prime minister, Imran Khan, rallied on the outskirts of Islamabad Sunday to denounce his 'illegal' incarceration and demand his immediate release. Khan's Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf, or PTI, party organized the public gathering, one of the largest in the Pakistani capital's history. The strong turnout came despite the police blocking the officially designated route for rally participants with shipping containers in an apparent bid to restrict convoys from other cities from reaching the venue. The administration also deployed riot police to prevent possible unrest. Social media videos and images showed PTI workers and leaders from elsewhere in Pakistan marching toward Islamabad. PTI activists were seen successfully removing containers to clear the way at several entry points. Police briefly clashed with and fired tear gas shells on PTI workers en route to the rally. Authorities later reported injuries to several police personnel due to stone pelting allegedly from Khan supporters, charges party leaders rejected. 'We will continue our efforts until Khan is freed from prison,' Hammad Azhar, a central PTI leader, told the rally. Critics observed that Sunday’s rally demonstrated once again that the 71-year-old former cricket star-turned-prime minister remains Pakistan’s most popular politician despite facing a series of state-backed criminal prosecutions and lawsuits. 'Strong turnout for PTI rally despite the state's tactics to limit numbers through roadblocks and containers, and despite the risk of violent crackdowns and arrests,' Michael Kugelman, the director of the South Asia Institute at Washington’s Wilson Center, said on X. 'Its size and popularity ensure its mobilization capabilities remain intact despite relentless attempts to curb it,' Kugelman wrote. Khan completed 400 days in prison on Sunday. The charges against him range from corruption to sedition to stoking violent anti-army protests. He rejects all the allegations as politically motivated and asserts that the powerful Pakistani military is behind them to block his return to power. Subsequently, appeals courts have overturned or suspended all his convictions for lack of evidence, but authorities quickly launched new charges to prevent him from leaving prison. The United Nations in July declared Khan’s detention arbitrary, saying there was no legal basis for keeping him in prison. Mushahid Hussain, who recently retired from Pakistan’s Senate, the upper house of parliament, criticized Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif’s government for 'barricading Islamabad' through containers and coercion and for creating an 'atmosphere of fear & force' in its attempt to block Sunday’s political rally. Hussain warned through a post on X that such efforts would impede political stability and economic recovery. '’Common Sense’ can be quite Uncommon!' he wrote. Sunday’s rally by the PTI in Islamabad was its first since parliamentary elections on February 8. Khan’s convictions at the time barred him from running, but his party candidates emerged winners of most seats in the National Assembly, the lower house of parliament, but not enough to form the government. The PTI alleged the vote was massively rigged to prevent its candidates from sweeping the polls. This allowed military-backed rival political parties to form a coalition administration with Sharif as prime minister. Hundreds of PTI workers and leaders, including women, have been jailed or under trial on charges defense attorneys reject as baseless and part of the state crackdown on the party. Khan served as Pakistan’s prime minister from 2018 until April 2022, when he was ousted through an opposition parliamentary no-confidence vote he alleges was planned by the military. Successive Pakistani governments and military officials have denied the allegations. Last month, his party announced that Khan had formally applied to run for chancellor of the University of Oxford in Britain from his prison cell. The election university website states that the new chancellor will be elected through an unprecedented online ballot process beginning on October 28. Khan, an Oxford graduate, served as the chancellor of University of Bradford from 2005 to 2014.	https://www.voanews.com/a/massive-opposition-rally-in-pakistan-calls-for-release-of-jailed-ex-pm-khan/7776212.html	2024-09-08T14:56:28-07:00	
China plans to allow wholly foreign-owned hospitals in some areas	Beijing — China said Sunday it would allow the establishment of wholly foreign-owned hospitals in nine areas of the country including the capital, as Beijing tries to attract more foreign investment to boost its flagging economy. In a document on the official website of China's commerce ministry, it said the new policy was a pilot project designed to implement a pledge the ruling Communist Party's Central Committee led by President Xi Jinping made at its July plenum meeting held roughly every five years. 'In order to ... introduce foreign investment to promote the high-quality development of China's medical-related fields, and better meet the medical and health needs of the people, it is planned to carry out pilot work of expanding opening-up in the medical field,' according to the document. The project will allow the establishment of such hospitals in Beijing, Tianjin, Shanghai, Nanjing, Suzhou, Fuzhou, Guangzhou, Shenzhen and Hainan — all relatively wealthy cities or provinces in eastern or southern China. The new policy excludes hospitals practicing traditional Chinese medicine and 'mergers and acquisitions of public hospitals,' the document read, adding that the specific conditions, requirements and procedures for setting up such foreign-owned hospitals would be detailed soon. The policy also allows companies with foreign investors to engage in the development and application of gene and human stem cell technologies for treatment and diagnosis in the pilot free-trade zones of Beijing, Shanghai, Guangdong, and Hainan. This includes registration, marketing and production of products that can be bought nationwide, according to the document. The removal of restrictions on foreign investment in these fields comes as the world's second-largest economy faces growing headwinds with flagging foreign business sentiment, one of the issues threatening growth.	https://www.voanews.com/a/china-plans-to-allow-wholly-foreign-owned-hospitals-in-some-areas/7776190.html	2024-09-08T13:53:24-07:00	
Thousands protest Mexican judicial reform	Mexico City — Thousands of Mexicans, mainly court employees and law students, protested in the capital Sunday against a controversial judicial reform that would see judges elected by popular vote. They gathered in Mexico City as the Senate prepared to debate the initiative pushed by outgoing President Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador and approved by the lower house, called the Chamber of Deputies, in which the ruling party holds sway. The proposed reform, which would see the election of judges of the Supreme Court and other tribunals as well as magistrates, has sparked diplomatic tensions with the United States, prompted protests by opponents, and upset financial markets. 'The judiciary will not fall,' changed protesters who marched on the Senate, expected to vote on the proposal Wednesday. Striking judicial workers have asked the Supreme Court to intervene in the matter, a request that Lopez Obrador has said had no legal basis. The United States, Mexico's main trading partner, has warned that the reforms would threaten a relationship that relies on investor confidence in the Mexican legal framework. Lopez Obrador, who will be replaced by his ally Claudia Sheinbaum on October 1, argues that the change was warranted because courts serve the interests of the political and economic elite.	https://www.voanews.com/a/thousands-protest-mexican-judicial-reform/7776191.html	2024-09-08T13:52:13-07:00	
Iran's president to visit Iraq on first foreign trip	Tehran, Iran — Iran's President Masoud Pezeshkian will visit neighboring Iraq on Wednesday, state media reported Sunday, in what will be his first trip abroad since he took office in July. Pezeshkian will head a high-ranking Iranians delegation to Baghdad to meet senior Iraqi officials. The visit comes at the invitation of Iraq's premier, Mohammed Shia al-Sudani, the official IRNA news agency quoted Iran's ambassador to Baghdad Mohammad Kazem Al-Sadegh as saying. The two countries will sign memoranda of understanding on cooperation and security, Sadegh said, without elaborating. He said the agreements were to have been signed during a planned visit to Iraq by Iran's late president, Ebrahim Raisi. But Raisi was killed in May along with the then-foreign minister, Hossein Amir-Abdollahian, when their helicopter crashed on a fog-shrouded mountainside in northern Iran. Since taking office, Pezeshkian has vowed to 'prioritize' strengthening ties with the Islamic republic's neighbors. Relations between Iran and Iraq, both Shiite-majority countries, have grown closer over the past two decades. Tehran is one of Iraq's leading trade partners and wields considerable political influence in Baghdad, where its Iraqi allies dominate parliament and the current government. In March 2023 the two countries signed a security agreement covering their common border, months after Tehran struck Kurdish opposition groups in Iraq's north. They have since agreed to disarm Iranian Kurdish rebel groups and remove them from border areas. Tehran accuses the groups of importing arms from Iraq and of fomenting 2022 protests that erupted after the death in custody of Iranian-Kurd woman Mahsa Amini. In January, Iran launched a deadly strike in northern Iraq's autonomous Kurdistan region, saying it had targeted a site used by 'spies of the Zionist regime (Mossad),' an apparent reference to Israel. On Saturday, an exiled Iranian Kurdish group said one of its activists, Behzad Khosrawi, had been arrested in Iraq's northern city of Sulaimaniyah and handed over to 'Iranian intelligence.' Local Asayesh security forces said Khosrawi was arrested 'because he did not have residency' in the Kurdish region, and denied he had any connection to 'political activism.'	https://www.voanews.com/a/iran-president-to-visit-iraq-on-first-foreign-trip/7776182.html	2024-09-08T13:42:21-07:00	
Anxiety, uncertainty build in Ukraine as US election nears	Many Ukrainians are hoping the outcome of the U.S. elections will help bring an end to Russia’s war on Ukraine.

At least 48 killed in Nigerian fuel truck explosion	MAIDUGURI — At least 48 people were killed Sunday in a fuel tanker truck explosion following a collision with another vehicle in Niger state in north-central Nigeria, the state's disaster management agency said. The State Emergency Management Agency in north-central Niger state said the fuel truck collided with a truck carrying travelers and cattle. Several other vehicles were also caught up in the accident, it said. Local media reported that two of the other vehicles — a crane truck and a pickup van —were involved in the accident and caught in the fire. The emergency management agency's spokesperson Hussaini Ibrahim put the death toll at 48 and officials were still trying to clear the scene of the incident. Nigeria's state-owned firm NNPC Ltd last week hiked the price of gasoline by at least 39%, the second major increase in more than a year but shortages have continued, forcing motorists to queue for hours in the country's major cities and towns.	https://www.voanews.com/a/at-least-48-killed-in-nigerian-fuel-truck-explosion-/7776114.html	2024-09-08T11:02:43-07:00

President Abdelmadjid Tebboune elected to serve second term leading gas-rich Algeria	ALGIERS — President Abdelmadjid Tebboune has been named the winner of Algeria's presidential election, granting him another term leading the gas-rich North African nation five years after pro-democracy protests led to the ouster of his predecessor. In a result that surprised few observers internationally or in Algeria, the country's independent election authority on Sunday announced that Tebboune had won 94% of the vote, far outpacing his challengers Islamist Abdelali Hassani Cherif, who won 3% and socialist Youcef Aouchiche, who won 2.1%. Election officials reported less than six million of the country's 24 million voters had turned out to vote on Saturday, perpetuating the low voter turnout rates that marred Tebboune's first term and raised questions about his popular support. Algeria is Africa's largest country by area and, with almost 45 million people, it's the continent's second most populous after South Africa to hold presidential elections in 2024 — a year in which more than 50 elections are being held worldwide, encompassing more than half the world's population. Throughout the campaign, activists and international organizations, including Amnesty International, railed against the campaign season's repressive atmosphere and the harassment and prosecutions of those involved in opposition parties, media organizations and civil society groups. Some denounced this election as a rubber stamp exercise that can only entrench the status quo. But Tebboune and his two challengers each urged political participation and specifically made overtures to the Algerian youth, who make up a majority of the population and disproportionately suffer from poverty and unemployment.	https://www.voanews.com/a/president-abdelmadjid-tebboune-elected-to-serve-second-term-leading-gas-rich-algeria-/7776077.html	2024-09-08T10:13:59-07:00	
For many leaving China, it's Japan — not the US — that's the bigger draw	TOKYO — One by one, the students, lawyers and others filed into a classroom in a central Tokyo university for a lecture by a Chinese journalist on Taiwan and democracy — taboo topics that can't be discussed publicly back home in China. 'Taiwan's modern-day democracy took struggle and bloodshed, there's no question about that,' said Jia Jia, a columnist and guest lecturer at the University of Tokyo who was briefly detained in China eight years ago on suspicion of penning a call for China's top leader to resign. He is one of tens of thousands of intellectuals, investors and other Chinese who have relocated to Japan in recent years, part of a larger exodus of people from China. Their backgrounds vary widely, and they're leaving for all sorts of reasons. Some are very poor, others are very rich. Some leave for economic reasons, as opportunities dry up with the end of China's boom. Some flee for personal reasons, as even limited freedoms are eroded. Chinese migrants are flowing to all corners of the world, from workers seeking to start businesses of their own in Mexico to burned-out students heading to Thailand. Those choosing Japan tend to be well-off or highly educated, drawn to the country's ease of living, rich culture and immigration policies that favor highly skilled professionals, with less of the sharp anti-immigrant backlash sometimes seen in Western countries. Jia initially intended to move to the U.S., not Japan. But after experiencing the coronavirus outbreak in China, he was anxious to leave and his American visa application was stuck in processing. So he chose Japan instead. 'In the United States, illegal immigration is particularly controversial. When I went to Japan, I was a little surprised. I found that their immigration policy is actually more relaxed than I thought,' Jia told The Associated Press. 'I found that Japan is better than the U.S.' It's tough to enter the U.S. these days. Tens of thousands of Chinese were arrested at the U.S.-Mexico border over the past year, and Chinese students have been grilled at customs as trade frictions fan suspicions of possible industrial espionage. Some U.S. states passed legislation that restricts Chinese citizens from owning property. 'The U.S. is shutting out those Chinese that are friendliest to them, that most share its values,' said Li Jinxing, a Christian human rights lawyer who moved to Japan in 2022. Li sees parallels to about a century ago, when Chinese intellectuals such as Sun Yat-sen, the founding father of modern China, moved to Japan to study how the country modernized so quickly. 'On one hand, we hope to find inspiration and direction in history,' Li said of himself and like-minded Chinese in Japan. 'On the other hand, we also want to observe what a democratic country with rule of law is like. We're studying Japan. How does its economy work, its government work?' Over the past decade, Tokyo has softened its once-rigid stance against immigration, driven by low birthrates and an aging population. Foreigners now make up about 2% of its population of 125 million. That's expected to jump to 12% by 2070, according to the Tokyo-based National Institute of Population and Social Security Research. Chinese are the most numerous newcomers, at 822,000 last year among more than 3 million foreigners living in Japan, according to government data. That's up from 762,000 a year ago and 649,000 a decade ago. In 2022, the lockdowns under China's 'zero COVID' policies led many of the country's youth or most affluent citizens to hit the exits. There's even a buzzword for that: 'runxue,' using the English word 'run' to evoke 'running away' to places seen as safer and more prosperous. For intellectuals like Li and Jia, Japan offers greater freedoms than under Chinese leader Xi Jinping's increasingly repressive rule. But for others, such as wealthy investors and business people, Japan offers something else: property protections. A report by investment migration firm Henley & Partners says nearly 14,000 millionaires left China last year, the most of any country in the world, with Japan a popular destination. A major driver is worries about the security of their wealth in China or Hong Kong, said Q. Edward Wang, a professor of Asian studies at Rowan University in Glassboro, New Jersey. 'Protection of private property, which is the cornerstone of a capitalist society, that piece is missing in China,' Wang said. The weakening yen makes buying property and other local assets in Japan a bargain. And while the Japanese economy has stagnated, China's once-sizzling economy is also in a rut, with the property sector in crisis and stock prices stuck at the level they were in the late 2000s. 'If you are just going to Japan to preserve your money,' Wang said, 'then definitely you will enjoy your time in Japan.' Dot.com entrepreneurs are among those leaving China after Communist Party crackdowns on the technology industry, including billionaire Jack Ma, a founder of e-commerce giant Alibaba, who took a professorship at Tokyo College, part of the prestigious University of Tokyo. So many wealthy Chinese have bought apartments in Tokyo's luxury high-rises that some areas have been dubbed 'Chinatowns,' or 'Digital Chinatowns' — a nod to the many owners' work in high-tech industries. 'Life in Japan is good,' said Guo Yu, an engineer who retired early after working at ByteDance, the parent company of TikTok. Guo doesn't concern himself with politics. He's keen on Japan's powdery snow in the winter and is a 'superfan' of its beautiful hot springs. He owns homes in Tokyo, as well as near a ski resort and a hot spring. He owns several cars, including a Porsche, a Mercedes, a Tesla and a Toyota. Guo keeps busy with a new social media startup in Tokyo and a travel agency specializing in 'onsen,' Japan's hot springs. Most of his employees are Chinese, he said. Like Guo, many Chinese moving to Japan are wealthy and educated. That's for good reason: Japan remains unwelcoming to refugees and many other types of foreigners. The government has been strategic about who it allows to stay, generally focusing on people to fill labor shortages for factories, construction and elder care. 'It is crucial that Japan becomes an attractive country for foreign talent so they will choose to work here,' Japanese Prime Minister Fumio Kishida said earlier this year, announcing efforts to relax Japan's stringent immigration restrictions. That kind of opportunity is exactly what Chinese ballet dancer Du Hai said he has found. Leading a class of a dozen Japanese students in a suburban Tokyo studio one recent weekend, Du demonstrated positions and spins to the women dressed in leotards and toe shoes. Du was drawn to Japan's huge ballet scene, filled with professional troupes and talented dancers, he said, but worried about warnings he got about unfriendly Japanese. That turned out to be false, he said with a laugh. Now, Du is considering getting Japanese citizenship. 'Of course, I enjoy living in Japan very much now,' he said.	https://www.voanews.com/a/for-many-leaving-china-it-s-japan-not-the-us-that-s-the-bigger-draw/7772102.html	2024-09-08T09:52:10-07:00

Venezuela opposition leader Gonzalez lands in Spain seeking asylum	CARACAS/MADRID — Venezuelan opposition presidential candidate Edmundo Gonzalez flew into Spain on Sunday to seek asylum, Madrid said, hours after quitting his country amid a political and diplomatic crisis over July's disputed election. Gonzalez — who has challenged President Nicolas Maduro's declaration of victory — arrived at the Torrejon de Ardoz military base with his wife, Spain's foreign ministry said in a statement. The exit of the 75-year-old — seen by the U.S., the EU and other powers in the region as the winner of the vote — came a week after Venezuelan authorities issued an arrest warrant for him, accusing him of conspiracy and other crimes. 'Today is a sad day for democracy in Venezuela,' European Union foreign policy chief Josep Borrell said in a statement. 'In a democracy, no political leader should be forced to seek asylum in another country.' Venezuelan Vice President Delcy Rodriguez said on Instagram authorities had given Gonzalez safe passage in a bid to restore 'political peace.' He left Venezuela after 'voluntarily seeking refuge in the Spanish embassy in Caracas several days ago,' she wrote. Spain's foreign ministry said there had been no talks between the Spanish and the Venezuelan governments on Gonzalez's exit. Venezuela's opposition say the July 28 election resulted in a resounding victory for Gonzalez, and published vote tallies online that they say show he won. Maduro has dismissed all such assertions and says there was a right-wing plot to sabotage his government. Gonzalez's move to Spain marked another jolting shift in the fortunes of the former diplomat who came out of retirement and took over the candidacy in March, initially as a placeholder after opposition leader Maria Corina Machado and then another replacement could not stand. Machado confirmed on X that Gonzalez was now in Spain, adding he had fled to protect his 'freedom, his integrity and his life.' 'The increasing threats, summons, arrest warrants and even the attempts at blackmail and coercion to which he has been subjected show that the regime has no scruples or limits in its obsession to silence him and try to break him,' she wrote. Gonzalez would continue to fight for the opposition from Spain, while she would continue to do so within Venezuela, Machado said, and vowed that on 10 January 2025, he would be sworn in as the country's president. Carmen Beatriz, a political communication and public opinion analyst at the University of Navarra told Reuters Gonzalez's role was important, but Machado is the leader of the process. 'He can become an articulator of international initiatives and interlocutor from the outside,' she said. Spain's foreign ministry said Gonzalez's asylum process would now start - 'the resolution of which will be favorable in view of Spain's commitment to the political rights and physical integrity of all Venezuelan men and women, especially political leaders.' Gonzalez had sought refuge in the Dutch and then the Spanish embassy in Venezuela after the election, Dutch and Venezuelan officials said. Dutch Foreign Minister Caspar Veldkamp said in a letter to his parliament on Sunday that Gonzalez had urgently requested refuge in the Dutch embassy the day after the election. 'At the beginning of September, Edmundo Gonzalez indicated that he ... wanted to leave and continue his fight from Spain,' Veldkamp added. Spanish officials, including former Prime Minister Jose Luis Rodriguez Zapatero, linked to diplomatic relations in the South American country in the past, were involved in a week of negotiations with Venezuelan authorities for Gonzalez to leave the country, a source with knowledge of the talks told Reuters, speaking on condition of anonymity. Opposition to keep protesting That Maduro allowed Gonzalez's departure despite the arrest warrant he was facing may soften some harsh recent international criticism of him. Machado, though, remains subject of an investigation and has largely been sequestered at an unknown location since the vote, emerging only occasionally to lead rallies. Gonzalez's departure came less than 24 hours after security forces surrounded Argentina's former embassy in Caracas, now being protected by Brazil, where six opposition staffers have been sheltering since warrants were issued for them in March. Attorney General Tarek Saab, who met with Gonzalez's lawyer this week and who has been one of the opposition's most strident accusers, is set to hold a press conference later on Sunday. The opposition is pressing for more street protests and international pressure for its victory to be recognized, but so far those tactics have borne no fruit, with military leaders lining up behind Maduro, and no stepped-up sanctions or other international action since the vote amid waning attendance at anti-government rallies.	https://www.voanews.com/a/venezuela-revokes-brazil-s-authorization-to-represent-argentine-interests-in-the-country-/7775494.html	2024-09-08T09:10:22-07:00

NATO member Romania says Russian drone violated its airspace	Kyiv, Ukraine — A Russian drone violated Romania's airspace during nighttime attacks on neighboring Ukraine, the NATO member reported Sunday, urging Moscow to stop what it described as an escalation. The incident occurred as Russia carried out attacks on 'civilian targets and port infrastructure' across the Danube River in Ukraine, Romania's Ministry of National Defense said. Romania deployed F-16 warplanes to monitor its airspace, and NATO allies were kept informed, the ministry said. Romanian emergency authorities also issued text alerts to residents of two eastern regions. Preliminary data indicates there may be an 'impact zone' in an uninhabited area near the Romanian village of Periprava, the ministry said. It added that an investigation is underway. Since Russia invaded Ukraine in February 2022, Romania has confirmed drone fragments on its territory on several occasions and as recently as July this year. The Romanian Defense Ministry strongly condemned the Russian attacks on Ukraine, calling them 'unjustified and in serious contradiction with the norms of international law.' Mircea Geoana, NATO's outgoing deputy secretary-general and Romania's former top diplomat, said the military alliance also condemned Russia’s violation of Romanian airspace. 'While we have no information indicating an intentional attack by Russia against Allies, these acts are irresponsible and potentially dangerous,' he wrote on X, formerly Twitter. Civilians reported killed in Ukraine In Ukraine, two civilians died and four more suffered wounds in a nighttime Russian airstrike on the northern city of Sumy, the regional military administration reported. Two children were among those wounded, the administration said. In the Kharkiv region in the east, overnight shelling killed two elderly women, according to local Governor Oleh Syniehubov. During the night, Ukrainian air defenses shot down one of four cruise missiles and 15 of 23 Iranian-made Shahed drones launched by Russia, Ukraine's air force reported. It added that none of the cruise missiles had hit targets. Later Sunday, three women were killed after Russian forces shelled a village in the eastern Donetsk region, Governor Vadym Filashkin reported on the Telegram messaging app. Elsewhere in the province, rescue teams pulled the bodies of two men from the rubble of a hotel that was destroyed Saturday evening in a Russian airstrike, according to Ukraine’s state emergency service. That same day, the death toll rose to 58 from the massive Russian missile strike that blasted a military academy Tuesday and a nearby hospital in the eastern city of Poltava, regional Governor Filip Pronin reported. More than 320 others were wounded. Since it launched a full-scale invasion of Ukraine in early 2022, the Russian military has repeatedly used missiles to smash civilian targets, sometimes killing scores of people in a single attack. Poltava is about 350 kilometers (200 miles) southeast of Kyiv, on the main highway and rail route between Kyiv and Ukraine’s second-largest city, Kharkiv, which is close to the Russian border. The attack happened as Ukrainian forces sought to carve out their holdings in Russia’s Kursk border region after a surprise incursion that began Aug. 6, as the Russian army hacks its way deeper into eastern Ukraine. Russian forces continued their monthslong grinding push toward the city of Pokrovsk, and ramped up attacks near the town of Kurakhove farther south, Ukraine's General Staff reported. Russia's Defense Ministry said Sunday its troops had taken Novohrodivka, a small town some 19 kilometers (11 miles) southeast of Pokrovsk. An update published Saturday evening by DeepState, a Ukrainian battlefield analysis site, said Russian forces had 'advanced' in Novohrodivka and captured Nevelske, a village in the southeast of the Pokrovsk district. Pokrovsk, which had a prewar population of about 60,000, is one of Ukraine’s main defensive strongholds and a key logistics hub in the Donetsk region. Its capture would compromise Ukraine’s defense and supply routes and would bring Russia closer to its stated aim of capturing the entire Donetsk region.	https://www.voanews.com/a/nato-member-romania-says-russian-drone-violated-its-airspace/7775995.html	2024-09-08T08:12:07-07:00	
UN official says Sudan's war has killed at least 20,000 people	Cairo — More than 16 months of war in Sudan has killed more than 20,000 people, a senior United Nations official said Sunday, a grim figure amid a devastating conflict that has wrecked the northeastern African country. Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, director general of the World Health Organization, gave the tally at a news conference in Sudan’s Red Sea city of Port Sudan, which serves as the seat of the internationally recognized, military-backed government. He said the death toll could be much higher. 'Sudan is suffering through a perfect storm of crisis,' Tedros said as he wrapped up his two-day visit to Sudan. 'The scale of the emergency is shocking, as is the insufficient action being taken to curtail the conflict.' Sudan was plunged into chaos in April last year when simmering tensions between the military and a powerful paramilitary group, the Rapid Support Forces, exploded into open warfare across the country. The conflict has turned the capital, Khartoum, and other urban areas into battlefields, wrecking civilian infrastructure and an already battered health care system. Without the basics, many hospitals and medical facilities have closed their doors. The conflict has created the world’s largest displacement crisis. More than 13 million people have been forced to flee their homes since fighting began, according to the International Organization for Migration. They include over 2.3 million who have fled to neighboring countries as refugees. The fighting has been marked by atrocities including mass rape and ethnically motivated killings that amount to war crimes and crimes against humanity, according to the U.N. and international rights groups. On Friday, U.N.-backed human rights investigators urged the creation of an 'independent and impartial force' to protect civilians, blaming both sides for war crimes including murder, mutilation and torture. Devastating seasonal floods in recent weeks have compounded the misery. Dozens of people have been killed and critical infrastructure has been washed away in 12 of Sudan’s 18 provinces, according to local authorities. A cholera outbreak is the latest calamity for the country. The disease has killed at least 165 and sickened about 4,200 others in recent weeks, the health ministry said in its latest update Friday. 'We are calling on the world to wake up and help Sudan out of the nightmare it’s living through,' Tedros said, adding that an immediate cease-fire is urgently required. 'The best medicine is peace,' he added.	https://www.voanews.com/a/sudan-rejects-un-call-for-impartial-force-to-protect-civilians-/7775918.html	2024-09-08T05:50:57-07:00	
Sudan rejects UN call for 'impartial force' to protect civilians	Port Sudan, Sudan — Sudan has rejected a call by U.N. experts for the deployment of an 'independent and impartial force' to protect millions of civilians driven from their homes by more than a year of war. The conflict since April last year, pitting the army against paramilitary forces, has killed tens of thousands of people and triggered one of the world's worst humanitarian crises. The independent U.N. experts said Friday their fact-finding mission had uncovered 'harrowing' violations by both sides, 'which may amount to war crimes and crimes against humanity. They called for 'an independent and impartial force with a mandate to safeguard civilians' to be deployed 'without delay.' The Sudanese foreign ministry, which is loyal to the army under General Abdel Fattah al-Burhan, said in a statement late Saturday that 'the Sudanese government rejects in their entirety the recommendations of the U.N. mission.' It called the U.N. Human Rights Council, which created the fact-finding mission last year, 'a political and illegal body', and the panel's recommendations 'a flagrant violation of their mandate.' The U.N. experts said eight million civilians have been displaced and another two million people have fled to neighboring countries. More than 25 million people upwards of half the country's population — face acute food shortages. World Health Organization chief Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, on a visit to Sudan on Sunday, said: 'The scale of the emergency is shocking, as is the insufficient action being taken to curtail the conflict and respond to the suffering it is causing.' In Port Sudan, where government offices and the United Nations have relocated to due to the intense fighting in the capital Khartoum, Tedros called on the 'world to wake up and help Sudan out of the nightmare it is living through'. The Sudanese foreign ministry statement accused the paramilitary Rapid Support Forces, led by Burhan's former deputy Mohamed Hamdan Daglo, of 'systematically targeting civilians and civilian institutions'. 'The protection of civilians remains an absolute priority for the Sudanese government,' it said. The statement added that the U.N. Human Rights Council's role should be 'to support the national process, rather than seek to impose a different exterior mechanism'. It also rejected the experts' call for an arms embargo.	https://www.voanews.com/a/sudan-rejects-un-call-for-impartial-force-to-protect-civilians/7776853.html	2024-09-08T05:50:21-07:00	
Family keeps up Beirut dessert tradition	Beirut — At a shop nestled in a busy, crowded Beirut district, Hasan El-Makary is weighing out containers of warm, fragrant mufataka, a traditional sweet in the Lebanese capital that is rarely found in stores. 'I've been in this shop for 50 years, but we started specializing in mufataka 30 years ago,' Makary said from the humble shop with its aging decor and low ceiling. A kind of rice pudding made with turmeric, tahini sesame paste, sugar and pine nuts, mufataka is traditional in Beirut but less known even outside the city. Makary, 73, said he used to sell other sweets but as demand grew for mufataka, he abandoned the rest and now he and his cousin – who is also his business partner – just make the yellow pudding. 'At the beginning you add turmeric, that's the main thing, then tahini, sugar and rice ... we cook it slowly on fire,' he said. The rice must be soaked overnight, and Makary said he comes to the shop at 5:00 a.m. to make the dish, which takes around four hours and requires regular stirring. He said his father started making mufataka despite initially believing people would not pay money for a dish that is normally prepared at home. Plastic containers of the pudding, which is eaten with a spoon, dotted trays and tables across the shop, waiting for customers who peered through a window to place their order from the busy street outside. Customer Iman Chehab, 55, was picking up mufataka for her mother, who used to make it herself. 'She is elderly now and she can't stir ... it takes a lot of work,' said Chehab, who works in human resources management. The dish is 'something traditional for us who are from Beirut,' she told AFP. Places like Makary's shop 'are the old face of Beirut that we love and always want to remember,' she added. 'Heritage' A few bustling neighborhoods away, Samir Makari, 35, is carrying on the family tradition. At a gleaming shop also selling Arabic sweets like baklava, Makari attends to a huge copper pot of mufataka behind the counter, stirring it with a long, wooden-handled implement. He weighs out and mixes the sugar, tahini paste and pine nuts in a second pot, later combining it all. Mufataka used to be made just once a year on the last Wednesday in April, with families gathering by the sea at Beirut's public beach, father and son said. The occasion was 'Job's Wednesday,' a reference to the biblical figure also mentioned in the Koran and who is renowned for his patience, the younger Makari said, noting the virtue is also required for making mufataka. On the wall of his shop, which he runs with his brother, were photos of his father and his grandfather at work. He said he sometimes makes mufataka twice a day depending on demand, with some customers taking it outside Beirut to introduce it to those who do not know the dish. At the original store, the elder Makary said he was happy his children had kept up the tradition. Mufataka is part of 'my heritage,' he said, and the family has 'taken it from generation to generation.'	https://www.voanews.com/a/family-keeps-up-beirut-dessert-tradition/7771087.html	2024-09-08T03:32:08-07:00	
Pakistan hasn't learned lessons from 2022 deadly floods, experts say	ISLAMABAD — Millions of people in Pakistan continue to live along the path of floodwaters, showing neither people nor the government have learned lessons from the 2022 devastating floods that killed 1,737 people, experts said Thursday, as an aid group said half of the 300 victims killed by rains since July are children. Heavy rainfall is drenching those areas that were badly hit by the deluges two years ago. The charity Save the Children said in a statement that floods and heavy rains have killed more than 150 children in Pakistan since the start of the monsoon season, making up more than half of all deaths in rain-affected areas. The group said that 200 children have also been injured in Pakistan because of rains, which have also displaced thousands of people. Save the Children also said that people affected by floods were living in a relief camp in Sanghar, a district in the southern Sindh province, which was massively hit by floods two years ago. 'The rains and floods have destroyed 80% of cotton crops in Sanghar, the primary source of income for farmers, and killed hundreds of livestock,' the charity said, and added that it's supporting the affected people with help from a local partner. Khuram Gondal, the country director for Save the Children in Pakistan, said that children were always the most affected in a disaster. 'We need to ensure that the immediate impacts of the floods and heavy rains do not become long-term problems. In Sindh province alone, more than 72,000 children have seen their education disrupted,' he said. Another charity, U.K.-based Islamic Relief, also said weeks of torrential rains in Pakistan have again triggered displacement and suffering among communities that were already devastated by the 2022 floods and are still in the process of rebuilding their lives and livelihoods. Asif Sherazi, the group's country director, said his organization is reaching out to flood-affected people. There was no immediate response from the country’s ministry of climate change and national disaster management authority. Pakistan has yet to undertake major reconstruction work because the government didn't receive most of the funds out of the $9 billion that were pledged by the international community at last year's donors' conference in Geneva. 'We learned no lessons from that 2022 floods. Millions of people have built mud-brick homes on the paths of rivers, which usually remain dry,' said Mohsin Leghari, who served as irrigation minister years ago. Leghari said that less rain is predicted for Pakistan for monsoon season compared with 2022, when climate-induced floods caused $30 billion in damage to the country's economy. 'But the floodwater has inundated several villages in my own Dera Ghazi Khan district in the Punjab province,' Leghari said. 'Floods have affected farmers, and my own land has once again come under the floodwater.' Wasim Ehsan, an architect, said Pakistan was still not prepared to handle any 2022-like situation mainly because people ignore construction laws while building homes and even hotels in urban and rural areas. He said the floods in 2022 caused damage in the northwest because people had built homes and hotels after slightly diverting a river. 'This is reason that a hotel was destroyed by the Swat River in 2022,' he said.	https://www.voanews.com/a/pakistan-hasn-t-learned-lessons-from-2022-deadly-floods-experts-say/7772534.html	2024-09-08T03:27:02-07:00	
Shooting attack at the West Bank-Jordan border crossing kills 3 Israelis	ALLENBY CROSSING, West Bank — Three Israelis were shot and killed Sunday at the border crossing between the West Bank and Jordan, Israeli officials said, in what appeared to be an attack linked to the 11-month-old war in Gaza. The military said the gunman approached the Allenby Bridge Crossing from the Jordanian side in a truck and opened fire at Israeli security forces, who killed the assailant in a shootout. It said the three people killed were Israeli civilians. Israel's Magen David Adom rescue service said they were all men in their 50s. Jordan is investigating the shooting, its state-run Petra News Agency reported. The Western-allied Arab country made peace with Israel in 1994, but is deeply critical of its policies toward the Palestinians. Jordan has a large Palestinian population and has seen mass protests against Israel over the war in Gaza. The Allenby crossing over the Jordan River, also known as the King Hussein Bridge, is mainly used by Israelis, Palestinians and international tourists. Authorities in Israel and Jordan said the crossing was closed until further notice, and Israel later announced the closure of both of its land crossings with Jordan, near Beit Shean in the north and Eilat in the south. Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu condemned the attack and linked it to Israel's larger conflict with Iran and allied militant groups, including Hamas in Gaza and Hezbollah in Lebanon. The Israeli-occupied West Bank has seen a surge of violence since Hamas' October 7 attack out of Gaza triggered the war there. Israel has launched near-daily military arrest raids into dense Palestinian residential areas, and there has also been a rise in settler violence and Palestinian attacks on Israelis. In Gaza, meanwhile, an Israeli airstrike early Sunday killed five people, including two women, two children and a senior official in the Civil Defense — first responders who operate under the Hamas-run government. The Civil Defense said the strike targeted the home of its deputy director for north Gaza, Mohammed Morsi, in the urban Jabaliya refugee camp. There was no immediate comment from the Israeli military. The army says it tries to avoid harming civilians and only targets militants. Gaza's Health Ministry says over 40,000 Palestinians have been killed in Gaza since the war began. It does not differentiate between fighters and civilians in its count. The war has caused vast destruction and displaced around 90% of Gaza's population of 2.3 million, often multiple times. Hamas-led militants killed some 1,200 people, mostly civilians, in their October 7 attack into southern Israel. They abducted another 250 and are still holding around 100 of them after releasing most of the rest in exchange for Palestinians imprisoned by Israel during a weeklong cease-fire last November. Around a third of the remaining hostages inside Gaza are believed to be dead. The United States, Qatar and Egypt have spent months trying to broker a cease-fire and the return of the hostages, but the negotiations have repeatedly bogged down. Israel captured the West Bank, Gaza and east Jerusalem — territories the Palestinians want for a future state — in the 1967 Mideast war. Israel withdrew soldiers and settlers from Gaza in 2005 but maintained control over its airspace, coastline and most of its land crossings. Along with Egypt, it imposed a blockade on Gaza after Hamas seized power from rival Palestinian forces in 2007.	https://www.voanews.com/a/shooting-attack-at-the-west-bank-jordan-border-crossing-kills-3-israelis/7775829.html	2024-09-08T01:45:02-07:00	
Typhoon Yagi kills 14 in Vietnam as officials warn of heavy rain that can cause flooding	HANOI, Vietnam — At least 14 people have died and 176 others injured in Vietnam after Typhoon Yagi slammed the country's north, state media said Sunday, as officials warned of heavy downpours despite its waning power. Described by Vietnamese officials as one of the most powerful typhoons to hit the region over the last decade, Yagi left more than 3 million people without electricity in northern Vietnam. It also damaged vital agricultural land, nearly 116,192 hectares where rice and fruits are mostly grown. Hundreds of flights were canceled after four airports were closed. The typhoon made landfall in Vietnam's northern coastal provinces of Quang Ninh and Haiphong with wind speeds of up to 149 kilometers per hour on Saturday afternoon. It raged for roughly 15 hours before gradually weakening into a tropical depression early Sunday morning. Vietnam's meteorological department predicted heavy rain in northern and central provinces and warned of floods in low-lying areas, flash floods in streams and landslides on steep slopes. Municipal workers along with army and police forces were busy in the capital, Hanoi, clearing uprooted trees, fallen billboards, toppled electricity poles and rooftops that were swept away, while assessing damaged buildings. Yagi was still a storm when it blew out of the northwestern Philippines into the South China Sea on Wednesday, leaving at least 20 people dead and 26 others missing mostly in landslides and widespread flooding in the acrchipelago nation. It then made its way to China, killing three people and injuring nearly a hundred others, before landing in Vietnam. Storms like Typhoon Yagi were 'getting stronger due to climate change, primarily because warmer ocean waters provide more energy to fuel the storms, leading to increased wind speeds and heavier rainfall,' said Benjamin Horton, director of the Earth Observatory of Singapore.	https://www.voanews.com/a/typhoon-yagi-weakens-after-killing-dozens-in-vietnam-china-philippines/7775815.html	2024-09-07T23:53:26-07:00

Brazil's X ban provokes Bolsonaro supporters to rally for 'freedom'	SAO PAULO — Supporters of former Brazilian President Jair Bolsonaro began flooding Sao Paulo's main boulevard for an Independence Day rally Saturday, buoyed by the government's blocking of tech billionaire Elon Musk's X platform, a ban they say is proof of their political persecution. A few thousand demonstrators, clad in the yellow-and-green colors of Brazil's flag, poured onto Avednia Paulista. References to the ban on X and images of Musk abounded. 'Thank you for defending our freedom,' read one banner praising the tech entrepreneur. Saturday's march is a test of Bolsonaro's capacity to mobilize turnout ahead of the October municipal elections, even though Brazil's electoral court has barred him from running for office until 2030. It's also something of a referendum on X, whose suspension has raised eyebrows even among some of Bolsonaro's opponents all the while stoking the flames of Brazil's deep-seated political polarization. 'A country without liberty can't celebrate anything this day,' Bolsonaro wrote on his Instagram account September 4, urging Brazilians to stay away from official Independence Day parades and instead join him in Sao Paulo. Supreme Court Justice Alexandre de Moraes ordered X's nationwide ban on Aug. 30 after months of feuding with Musk over the limits of free speech. The powerful judge has spearheaded efforts to ban far-right users from spreading misinformation on social media, and he ramped up his clampdown after die-hard Bolsonaro supporters ransacked Congress and the presidential palace on January 8, 2023, to overturn Bolsonaro's defeat in the presidential election. The ban is red meat to Bolsonaro's allies, who have accused the judiciary and President Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva's government of colluding to silence their movement. 'Elon Musk has been a warrior for freedom of speech,' staunch Bolsonaro ally and lawmaker Bia Kicis said in an interview. 'The right is being oppressed, massacred, because the left doesn't want the right to exist.' 'Our liberties are in danger; we need to make our voices heard. De Moraes is a tyrant, he should be impeached, and people on the streets is the only thing that will convince politicians to do it,' said retiree Amaro Santos as he walked down the thoroughfare Saturday, Musk, a self-proclaimed 'free speech absolutist,' has also urged Brazilians to turn out in droves for the rally, resharing someone else's post claiming that X's ban had awakened people 'to the fact that freedom isn't free and needs to be fought for.' He's also created an X account, named for the controversial jurist, to publish sealed court orders directing X to shut down accounts deemed unlawful. But De Moraes' decision to ban X was far from arbitrary, having been upheld by fellow Supreme Court justices. And while expression, online and elsewhere, is more easily censored under Brazil's laws than it is in the U.S., Musk has emerged as both a cause celebre and a mouthpiece for unrestricted free speech. Since 2019, X has shut down 226 accounts of far-right activities accused of undermining Brazil's democracy, including those of lawmakers affiliated with Bolsonaro's party, according to court records. But when it refused to act on some accounts, de Moraes warned last month that its legal representative could be arrested, prompting X to disband its local office. The U.S.-based company refused to name a new representative — as required to receive court notices — and de Moraes ordered its nationwide suspension until it did so. A Supreme Court panel unanimously upheld de Moraes' decision to block X days later, undermining Musk's efforts to cast him as an authoritarian bent on censoring political speech. The more controversial component of his ruling was the levy of a whopping $9,000 daily fine for regular Brazilians using virtual private networks (VPNs) to access X. 'Some of these measures that have been adopted by the Supreme Court appear to be quite onerous and abusive,' said Andrei Roman, CEO of Brazil-based pollster Atlas Intel. In the lead-up to Saturday's protest, some right-wing politicians defied de Moraes' ban and brazenly used a VPN to publish posts on X, calling for people to partake in the protests. The march in Sao Paulo is organized in parallel to official events to celebrate Brazil's anniversary of independence from Portugal. Commemorations have been fraught with tension in recent years, as Bolsonaro used them while in office to rally supporters and show political strength. Three years ago, he threatened to plunge the country into a constitutional crisis when he declared he would no longer abide de Moraes' rulings. He has since toned down the attacks — a reflection of his own delicate legal situation. Bolsonaro has been indicted twice since his term ended in 2022, most recently for alleged money laundering in connection with undeclared diamonds from Saudi Arabia. De Moraes is overseeing an investigation into the Jan. 8 riot, including whether Bolsonaro had a role in inciting it.	https://www.voanews.com/a/brazil-s-x-ban-provokes-bolsonaro-supporters-to-rally-for-freedom-/7775518.html	2024-09-07T16:59:51-07:00	
Proposed UN peacekeeping plan could replace Kenya-led police mission in Haiti	UNITED NATIONS — The United States and Ecuador circulated a draft resolution Friday asking the United Nations to begin planning for a U.N. peacekeeping operation to replace the Kenya-led mission now in the Caribbean nation helping police to quell gang violence. The proposed Security Council resolution, obtained by The Associated Press, says U.N. peacekeepers are needed 'in order to sustain the gains' made by the U.N.-backed multinational mission which has seen almost 400 Kenyan police deploy since June to help the Haitian National Police. The circulation of the short resolution to all 15 council members follows U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken's visit to Haiti on Thursday where he reaffirmed the U.S. government's commitment to the multinational mission and pushed for long-awaited general elections. America's top diplomat also said a U.N. peacekeeping force was an option to address a funding crisis for the Kenya-led mission, which depends on voluntary contributions. The U.S. and Canada have provided the bulk of funds so far. Peacekeeping operations, by contrast, are funded from a special U.N. budget. The United Nations has been involved in Haiti on and off since 1990. A 2004 rebellion had the country on the brink of collapse, leading to deployment of a U.N. force. It helped stabilize the impoverished nation after successful elections and a devastating 2010 earthquake that killed as many as 300,000 people and ended in October 2017. But U.N. peacekeepers left under a cloud, with troops from Nepal widely blamed for introducing cholera that has killed about 10,000 people in Haiti since 2010 and other troops implicated in sexual abuse, including rape and the targeting of hungry children. Since 2017, the U.N. has had a series of small missions in Haiti. The latest, political mission, BINUH, has a mandate to advance a Haitian-led political process toward elections, the rule of law and human rights. Many Haitians have rejected the proposal of another peacekeeping operation, given the introduction of cholera and sexual abuse cases that occurred when U.N. troops were last in Haiti. Some Haitians also see U.N. peacekeepers as an occupying force. Haiti asked for an international force to combat gangs in 2022, and U.N. Secretary-General António Guterres appealed for months for a country to lead the force before the Kenyans came forward and pledged 1,000 police. They are expected to be joined by police from the Bahamas, Bangladesh, Barbados, Benin, Chad and Jamaica, bringing the multinational force to 2,500 personnel. They would be deployed in phases that would cost roughly $600 million a year. Currently, the U.N. has $85 million in pledges for the mission, out of which $68 million has been received. The gangs have grown in power since the July 7, 2021, assassination of President Jovenel Moïse and are now estimated to control up to 80% of the capital. The surge in killings, rapes and kidnappings has led to a violent uprising by civilian vigilante groups. In February, gangs launched coordinated attacks on police stations and the main international airport, which remained closed for nearly three months. They also stormed Haiti's two largest prisons, releasing more than 4,000 inmates. The violence subsided somewhat before the first contingent of Kenyan police arrived in late June, with Blinken noting that economic activity has restarted in some areas of Port-au-Prince, and that joint operations have led to successes including regaining control of Haiti's biggest public hospital. However, gangs continue to attack communities surrounding Port-au-Prince. The draft resolution would determine that 'the situation in Haiti continues to constitute a threat to international peace and security and to stability in the region.' Extending gratitude to Kenya, it would extend the mandate of the Multinational Security Support mission until Oct. 2, 2025, while the U.N. plans a transition to a peacekeeping operation. Security Council experts held their first meeting on the text of the resolution Friday afternoon and negotiations are expected to continue, a council diplomat said, speaking on the condition of anonymity because discussions were private. No date has been set for a vote. U.N. spokesperson Stephane Dujarric reiterated Friday that any new peacekeeping force requires approval from the Security Council. U.N. member nations must then volunteer troops and needed equipment, and the force then needs to be deployed — all of which takes time, he said.	https://www.voanews.com/a/proposed-un-peacekeeping-plan-could-replace-kenya-led-police-mission-in-haiti/7775525.html	2024-09-07T16:47:08-07:00	
Iran's secret service plots to kill Jews in Europe, says France	paris — A Paris court in May detained and charged a couple on accusations that they were involved in Iranian plots to kill Jews in Germany and France, police sources told Agence France-Presse. Authorities charged Abdelkrim S., 34, and his partner Sabrina B., 33, on May 4 with conspiring with a criminal terrorist organization and placed them in pretrial detention. The case, known as 'Marco Polo' and revealed Thursday by French news website Mediapart, signals a revival in Iranian state-sponsored terrorism in Europe, according to a report by France's General Directorate for Internal Security (DGSI) seen by AFP. 'Since 2015, the Iranian (secret) services have resumed a targeted killing policy,' the French security agency wrote, adding that 'the threat has worsened again in the context of the Israel-Hamas war.' The alleged objective for Iranian intelligence was to target civilians and sow fear in Europe among the country's political opposition as well as among Jews and Israelis. Iran is accused of recruiting criminals, including drug lords, to conduct such operations. Abdelkrim S. was previously sentenced to 10 years in prison in a killing in Marseille and released on probation in July 2023. He is accused of being the main France-based operative for an Iran-sponsored terrorist cell that planned acts of violence in France and Germany. A former fellow inmate is believed to have connected the suspect with the cell's coordinator, a major drug trafficker from the Lyon area who likely visited Iran in May, according to the DGSI. The group intended to attack a Paris-based former employee at an Israeli security firm and three of his colleagues residing in the Paris suburbs. Three Israeli-German citizens in Munich and Berlin were also among the targets. Investigators believe that Abdelkrim S., despite his probation, made multiple trips to Germany for scouting purposes, including travels to Berlin with his wife. He denied the accusations and said he simply had purchases to make. French authorities are also crediting the cell with plots to set fire to four Israeli-owned companies in the south of France between late December 2023 and early January 2024, said a police source. Abdelkrim S. rejected the claims, saying he had acted as a go-between on Telegram for the mastermind and other individuals involved in a planned insurance scam, the source added.	https://www.voanews.com/a/iran-s-secret-service-plots-to-kill-jews-in-europe-says-france/7775516.html	2024-09-07T16:28:17-07:00	
Israeli strike kills three Lebanese medics, Hezbollah retaliates	cairo — Three Lebanese paramedics were killed and two others wounded, one critically, in an Israeli attack while they were extinguishing fires in the southern town of Faroun, Lebanon's health ministry said on Saturday. 'Israeli forces targeted a team from the Lebanese Civil Defense as they responded to fires sparked by recent Israeli airstrikes,' a ministry statement said, specifying that the strike hit a fire truck. The Israeli military said: 'Earlier today, the IDF (Israel Defense Forces) struck and eliminated terrorists from the Amal terrorist organization that operated within a Hezbollah military structure in the area of Froun in southern Lebanon.' Lebanese Prime Minister Najib Mikati condemned the attack as a violation of international law and announced an emergency meeting on Monday with Western ambassadors and international organizations to address the ongoing hostilities. 'To date, because of Israel's aggression, 25 paramedics from various ambulance teams have been killed, along with two health workers, and 94 paramedics and health workers have been injured,' the health ministry statement added. The health ministry also condemned the attack as a 'blatant strike' on an official Lebanese state apparatus, marking the second such attack on an emergency team in less than 12 hours. Hezbollah issued a statement, saying it launched a 'squadron of missiles' in response to the Faroun attack, targeting an Israeli military headquarters, causing casualties. Around 140 civilians have been killed by Israeli bombardment of Lebanon since October 8, when hostilities broke out between the Israeli military and Hezbollah in parallel with the war in Gaza. The intensity of fighting between Hezbollah and Israel has ratcheted up steadily, displacing tens of thousands of people on either side of the Lebanese Israeli frontier. According to the United Nations Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs, between October 8, 2023, and August 26, at least 133 civilians have been killed. According to the Lebanese Ministry of Public Health, the total number of casualties stands at 2,412, including 564 fatalities.	https://www.voanews.com/a/israeli-strike-kills-three-lebanese-medics-hezbollah-retaliates-/7775513.html	2024-09-07T16:04:39-07:00	
Fierce border clashes erupt between Pakistan and Afghanistan	Islamabad — Border security forces of Pakistan and Afghanistan were engaged in intense clashes Saturday, reportedly resulting in several casualties on both sides. The war zone is located between the southeastern Afghan border province of Khost and the adjoining Pakistani district of Kurram, as reported by security officials and residents on both sides. The conflict reportedly broke out when Taliban forces attempted to construct a security outpost on the Afghan side, prompting Pakistani troops to open fire to force the other side to stop the activity. Pakistani officials maintain neither side can construct new posts unilaterally under mutual agreements regarding the nearly 2,600-kilometer border between the two countries. Multiple sources reported that ongoing heavy clashes had injured at least five Pakistani soldiers, including an officer, and more than four Afghan border guards. Pakistan and Afghanistan authorities have not commented immediately on the fighting. This is the second time in as many days that the two countries have clashed over the construction of the disputed Afghan border outpost. The military tensions come amid Pakistan's persistent allegations that militants linked to the outlawed Tehrik-e-Taliban Pakistan, or TTP, have taken shelter on Afghan soil and are being facilitated by the country's Taliban leaders in orchestrating cross-border terrorist attacks. 'We have, on numerous occasions, presented evidence of the activities of these terror groups, which have hideouts and sanctuaries inside Afghanistan,' Mumtaz Baloch, the Pakistani foreign ministry spokesperson, reiterated Thursday. 'We urge the government of Afghanistan to take action against these terror groups and to ensure that these terror groups do not stage terror attacks against Pakistan,' she told a weekly news conference in Islamabad. Taliban authorities deny foreign militant groups, including TTP, are present in Afghanistan, saying no one is being allowed to threaten neighboring countries from their territory. However, recent United Nations assessments disputed the Taliban claims and backed Pakistan's concerns that TTP operatives had intensified cross-border violence with the help of the de facto Afghan government in Kabul, which no country has officially recognized. Since the Taliban regained power three years ago, bilateral ties have been strained due to increasing TTP attacks inside Pakistan and occasional border skirmishes, significantly undermining trade and transit ties between Pakistan and landlocked Afghanistan.	https://www.voanews.com/a/fierce-border-clashes-erupt-between-pakistan-and-afghanistan/7775511.html	2024-09-07T15:56:01-07:00

Ukraine voices concern at reports of Iranian ballistic missiles to Russia	KYIV, UKRAINE — Ukraine's foreign ministry said Saturday it was deeply concerned by reports about a possible impending transfer of Iranian ballistic missiles to Russia. In a statement emailed to reporters, the ministry said the deepening military cooperation between Tehran and Moscow was a threat to Ukraine, Europe and the Middle East, and called on the international community to increase pressure on Iran and Russia. CNN and The Wall Street Journal reported Friday that Iran had transferred short-range ballistic missiles to Russia, citing unidentified sources. Reuters reported in August that Russia was expecting the imminent delivery of hundreds of Fath-360 close-range ballistic missiles from Iran and that dozens of Russian military personnel were being trained in Iran on the satellite-guided weapons for eventual use in the war in Ukraine. On Friday, the United States, a key ally of Ukraine, also voiced concern about the potential transfer of missiles. 'Any transfer of Iranian ballistic missiles to Russia would represent a dramatic escalation in Iran's support for Russia's war of aggression against Ukraine,' White House National Security Council spokesperson Sean Savett said. Iran's mission to the United Nations in New York said Friday that Tehran's position on the Ukraine conflict was unchanged. 'Iran considers the provision of military assistance to the parties engaged in the conflict — which leads to increased human casualties, destruction of infrastructure, and a distancing from cease-fire negotiations — to be inhumane,' it said. 'Thus, not only does Iran abstain from engaging in such actions itself, but it also calls upon other countries to cease the supply of weapons to the sides involved in the conflict.'	https://www.voanews.com/a/ukraine-voices-concern-at-reports-of-iranian-ballistic-missiles-to-russia/7775391.html	2024-09-07T10:18:34-07:00	
Chrysler-parent Stellantis recalls 1.46 million vehicles worldwide	WASHINGTON — Chrysler parent Stellantis said Saturday it is recalling 1.46 million vehicles worldwide due to a software malfunction in the anti-lock brake system that can increase the risk of a crash. The recall includes nearly 1.23 million Ram 1500 trucks from the 2019 and 2021-2024 model years in the United States, as well as about 159,000 vehicles in Canada, 13,000 in Mexico and 61,000 outside North America. The National Highway Traffic Safety Administration said a software malfunction might result in the anti-lock brake system control module disabling the electronic stability control system. The issue means the vehicles do not comply with a federal motor vehicle safety standard on electric stability control systems. Stellantis said if the issue occurs, the ABS, ESC, adaptive cruise control and forward collision warning indicator lights will be illuminated at vehicle start up, indicating the systems are not working. Foundational braking would be working, it added. The company said it is unaware of any related injuries or crashes. Stellantis also said Saturday it is recalling about 33,000 Jeep Gladiator models from 2020-2024 and Jeep Wrangler vehicles from 2018-2024 due to a potential internal short circuit issue in the instrument panel cluster.	https://www.voanews.com/a/chrysler-parent-stellantis-recalls-1-46-million-vehicles-worldwide/7775333.html	2024-09-07T08:39:10-07:00

Chinese activist risks deportation after Denmark rejects asylum bid	STOCKHOLM, SWEDEN — Chinese dissident Liu Dongling is at risk of deportation back to China after Denmark rejected her asylum application in June, a situation some rights advocates say reflects challenges Chinese dissidents face when seeking refuge abroad, especially in Europe. Liu has been leading the 'Ban the Great Firewall' online campaign against China’s internet censorship regime since August 2023, when founder Qiao Xinxin was deported back to China from Laos and detained on subversion charges. Danish immigration authorities informed Liu in June they rejected her asylum application following a two-year review and would repatriate her back to China in seven days. Fearing similar charges if deported to China, Liu fled to Sweden with her teenage son the next day. 'I’ve been in Sweden for more than two months, and I still can’t work here since I don’t have a proper legal status,' she told VOA in an interview in Stockholm. Lui cannot apply for asylum in Sweden due to the Dublin Regulation, an agreement between European Union countries that establishes that a single country is responsible for examining an applicant's request for asylum. Contacted by VOA, the Danish Immigration Service and Danish Return Agency said they could not comment on individual cases, citing confidentiality required by law. Human rights advocates contacted by VOA said that based on Qiao’s detention, Liu will likely face imprisonment if the Danish authorities deport her. 'Apart from leading the online free speech campaign, Liu has also been collecting information about human rights violations for the China Human Rights Accountability Database, so she would definitely be given prison sentences if she were sent back to China,' Lin Shengliang, a Chinese activist based in the Netherlands and the founder of the human rights database, told VOA by phone. Seeking asylum in Denmark Liu has been an activist since 2014, when she helped forced eviction victims seek compensation through legal channels. She said she started being followed and her son started being banned by teachers from participating in activities he enjoyed. 'My son began to refuse to go to school so I decided to move to Thailand and let him go to school there,' Liu told VOA. In June 2019, she began documenting human rights violations for the Chinese news website Boxun, which covers activism and human rights violations in China. But soon, Chinese prosecutors in China’s Henan province started repeatedly contacting her, increasing her concern over her safety. She nevertheless returned to China twice in 2019 to renew her Thai visa. At the time, she wasn’t arrested or detained by local authorities. In June 2022, fearing deportation back to China considering the Thai detention and repatriation of Chinese dissidents, Liu applied for a Danish tourist visa and flew there with her son, applying for asylum when they arrived. As Danish authorities began to review her asylum application in March 2023, she also became involved with the online free speech campaign. She tried to spread information about how to bypass China’s internet censorship through virtual private networks to Chinese people while informing Chinese people working in the cybersecurity sector that they might be assisting the Chinese government with violating Chinese people’s basic human rights. Two months after she joined the campaign, movement co-founder Qiao Xinxin went missing in Laos. In August 2023, his family confirmed he had been detained in a Chinese prison under subversion charges. Despite Qiao’s and her extensive history of activism, Liu said Danish authorities repeatedly questioned whether she was at risk of arrest if she returned to China, citing her successful returns to China in 2019 as proof that she could freely leave the country. 'The Refugee Appeals Board finds that the applicant left China legally for Thailand in 2018 and later, she traveled back and forth between China and Thailand legally twice without experiencing issues,' the Danish Refugee Appeals Board wrote in an official case document seen by VOA. The Danish immigration authorities ultimately determined that Liu had not provided 'credible evidence' to prove that she had faced persecution in China and that if she returned to China, she would be persecuted by Chinese authorities. Some analysts say while Liu has a long track record of criticizing the Chinese government and engaging in human rights issues, some missing pieces of evidence made it difficult for her to prove the authenticity of her claims to the Danish authorities. However, several human rights organizations, including Madrid-based Safeguard Defenders, are trying to push the Danish immigration authorities to reassess her case. 'We have prepared all the paperwork to support the reassessment of her case,' said Peter Dahlin, the director of Safeguard Defenders. He told VOA that Denmark’s rejection of Liu’s asylum application shows the need for Chinese dissidents to be well-prepared before applying for asylum in a foreign country. 'If Chinese dissidents are going to seek asylum abroad, they need to prepare all necessary paperwork and evidence to back up their claims,' he said in a phone interview. Dahlin said if the Danish authorities decided to follow through on deporting Liu to China, human rights organizations will consider filing an interim measure requesting the European Court of Human Rights to weigh in on the decision. 'I don't think Denmark wants the embarrassment of having been told by the European Court of Human Rights to stop their action,' he told VOA. While human rights organizations are pushing Danish authorities to reassess Liu’s initial asylum application, she and her son may need to wait months before the Danish government finishes reassessment of her case. 'They will live in Sweden with no legal rights, and that’s not an easy situation to be in especially when Sweden and Denmark are hardening their stance on asylum and immigration,' Dahlin said. Since it remains unclear whether Danish authorities would reassess her case, Liu said she is still haunted by her possible deportation back to China. 'I have no clue what my next step is, and the only thing I could do now is to lay low and wait to see if Danish authorities reassess my asylum application,' she told VOA.	https://www.voanews.com/a/chinese-activist-risks-deportation-after-denmark-rejects-asylum-bid/7775272.html	2024-09-07T07:33:00-07:00	
Kyrgyzstan follows regional trend, takes Taliban off terrorist list	washington — Shunned by the West for over three years, Afghanistan's Taliban scored a diplomatic victory of sorts this week when the small Central Asian nation of Kyrgyzstan quietly removed the group from its list of banned terrorist organizations. The move underscores warming ties between the Taliban, in power since August 2021, and the countries of Central Asia. While the United States has led an international campaign to deny the Taliban government legitimacy, over a dozen regional countries, led by China and Russia, have embraced the self-styled 'Islamic Emirate of Afghanistan.' 'It fits with the broader trend of governments in the region and internationally warming up to the idea of having to work with the Taliban,' said Lucas Webber, a senior threat intelligence analyst at Tech Against Terrorism and a research fellow at the Soufan Center. 'Generally, there is a recognition that the Taliban is not going anywhere, so you have to work with whoever is ruling Afghanistan for economic and security reasons.' Taliban reaction The government of Kyrgyzstan, once considered a close U.S. ally in the region, did not publicize its decision to delist the Taliban, but the Taliban's Foreign Ministry quickly seized on it as the latest breakthrough in its regional diplomacy. 'Aligning with actions of other countries, the step taken by Kyrgyzstan signifies a growing political recognition of the Islamic Emirate of Afghanistan on both regional and international levels, and removes a barrier to strengthening bilateral relations between the Islamic Emirate of Afghanistan & other countries,' it said Thursday in a statement. The Taliban, which first ruled Afghanistan from 1996 to 2001 before waging a 20-year insurgency, has appeared on various international terrorist lists over the years. While the U.S. has not officially labeled them a 'foreign terrorist organization,' it considers members 'specially designated global terrorists.' Kyrgyzstan is the second Central Asian country to delist the Taliban in recent months. In December, Kazakhstan took the group off its own terrorist list as part of its growing economic engagement with the Taliban. In May, Russia said it, too, was considering such a move as it decides whether to recognize the Taliban's government. Although no country has extended official recognition to the Taliban, more than a dozen, including all six of Afghanistan's neighbors, have allowed Taliban diplomats to take charge of Afghan embassies or consulates. Among them, three have accepted accredited Taliban envoys: China in January, followed by Kazakhstan and the United Arab Emirates last month. In pursuing ties with the Taliban, Central Asian countries are taking their cues from Russia and China, both of which have deepened their engagement with Afghanistan's de facto government in recent years. 'They're pursuing practical policies, and they're also given a kind of umbrella by two of the major great powers — Russia and China — who are working with the Taliban quite closely,' Webber said. A 'necessary evil' In a report on the Taliban's regional diplomacy, analysts at the International Crisis Group noted how various countries pursue disparate agendas. Afghanistan neighbors such as Iran, Pakistan and Uzbekistan view dealing with the Taliban as a 'necessary evil if they are to address core concerns,' the analysts wrote. Those concerns include extremist threats as well as trade. For Kyrgyzstan and Tajikistan, a planned project designed to carry surplus power to Afghanistan and Pakistan is a priority. Regional powers China, India and Russia use engagement to contain 'any spillover' from Afghanistan, the analysts said. Russia regards the Taliban as a bulwark against the Islamic State's local branch. And while China has signed lucrative investment deals with Afghanistan, it, too, is motivated by fear of terrorism. Countries farther afield, such as the UAE and Qatar, aim 'to challenge the Taliban's Islamic exceptionalism but [are] also spurred by the need to balance their own regional rivalries,' they wrote. Strategic interests vs. human rights Significantly, none of the countries that have established diplomatic ties with the Taliban were classified as 'free' by Freedom House, the freedom and democracy advocacy group. All but two are labeled 'not free,' according to a VOA review. Only Pakistan and Turkey are designated as 'partly free.' This suggests that the Taliban can ward off international isolation if enough countries prioritize strategic interests over human rights and democracy, according to experts. While human rights haven't always been a U.S. foreign policy priority, the Biden administration, along with its Western allies, have made Taliban recognition contingent on respect for human rights, women's rights and an inclusive government. 'Given the issues related to the treatment of women and other human rights issues, it's more difficult for liberal democratic governments to recognize and work with the Taliban than it is for less democratic governments or nondemocratic governments, where they can be more practical in terms of pursuing their national interests solely and then working with the Taliban on this basis,' Webber said. The implications for Afghanistan's future and U.S. diplomacy are immense. Increased political and economic engagement could embolden the Taliban to keep their harsh policies, such as their ban on girls' education after sixth grade, experts say. It could also force Washington to reassess its dual policy of engaging and isolating the Taliban. Since the Taliban takeover, U.S. and European diplomats have held ongoing talks with Taliban officials in Qatar, where they maintain their Afghanistan embassy operations. Biden administration officials have also reportedly weighed working with the Taliban to combat the Afghan-based Islamic State Khorasan terror group, even while refusing to establish diplomatic ties. 'There is going to be pressure as more governments recognize that this kind of resistance to working more closely with the Taliban doesn't hold up,' Webber said. 'But it will be hard to do so publicly and officially, given the humanitarian violations and problems that we see with the Taliban government.' The Biden administration defends its Afghanistan policy. Asked about the Taliban's growing diplomatic footprint, a State Department spokesperson noted that no country has said that it recognizes the Taliban as the government of Afghanistan. 'The Taliban seek recognition as Afghanistan's government,' the spokesperson said in a statement to VOA. 'The United States and the international community have been clear with the Taliban that our ability to take meaningful steps toward normalization will be based on the Taliban's own actions.' These include respecting the rights of women and minorities, fulfilling anti-terror obligations and starting a political process for inclusive governance, the spokesperson said.	https://www.voanews.com/a/kyrgyzstan-follows-regional-trend-takes-taliban-off-terrorist-list/7775060.html	2024-09-07T03:53:02-07:00	
China stops short of African debt relief at triennial summit	NAIROBI, KENYA/BEIJING — China stopped short of providing the debt relief sought by many African countries this week, but pledged $50.7 billion over three years in credit lines and investments. The Forum on China-Africa Cooperation, or FOCAC, launched in 2000 took on an enhanced role after the 2013 inception of President Xi Jinping's Belt and Road Initiative, which aims to recreate the ancient Silk Road for the world's second-largest economy and biggest bilateral lender to Africa. 'China is moving back on to the front foot in terms of overseas deployment of capital in the emerging markets,' said Tellimer's Hasnain Malik, while adding it was not yet at pre-COVID levels. China has also sought to use FOCAC to counter growing competition in Africa from the United States, the European Union, Japan and others. In Beijing, diplomats and delegates from around the world mingled in the Great Hall of the People in Tiananmen Square as leaders from more than 50 African countries and Chinese officials led by Xi gathered for a group photo. The new financial pledge is more than what Beijing promised at the last FOCAC, in 2021, but below the $60 billion of 2015 and 2018, which marked the peak of lending to Africa under the Belt and Road Initiative. During those peak years, Beijing bankrolled the construction of roads, railways and bridges. But a drying up of funds since 2019 has left Africa with stalled construction projects. The new funds will go toward 30 infrastructure projects to improve trade links, China said, without giving details. The 54-nation continent of more than 1 billion people has an annual infrastructure funding deficit estimated at $100 billion and needs transport links to make a new giant pan-African trade bloc a reality. Beijing has in recent years cut funding for such projects as it shifted focus to 'small and beautiful' projects, mainly due to its own domestic economic pressures and an increase in debt risks among African countries. Asked how the new commitments fit into China's current cautious overseas lending strategy, a foreign ministry spokesperson said there was no contradiction. 'The cooperation between China and African countries, including the specific implementation of projects, is discussed and determined by both sides,' Mao Ning, a foreign ministry spokesperson, told a news conference on Friday. China also said it will launch 30 clean-energy projects in Africa, offer cooperation on nuclear technology and tackle a power deficit that has delayed industrialization efforts. 'The outcomes of the FOCAC summit signal an impetus for green projects and especially for renewable energy installations,' said Goolam Ballim, head of research at South Africa's Standard Bank. China has become a global leader in wind and solar energy, Ballim said, controlling significant supply chains and reducing production costs. Others were skeptical. 'The issue is not so much about the size of the investments, it's been about the lack of transparency around the terms of the debt,' said Trang Nguyen, global head of emerging markets credit strategy at French bank BNP Paribas. Success was less clear-cut for countries owing a large share of their debt to China, which made no express offer of assistance to those struggling with repayments. Beijing instead urged other creditors 'to participate in the handling and restructuring of African countries' debts under the principle of joint actions and fair burden-sharing.' African leaders hoping to bask in large deals for their countries had to settle for less splashy announcements. Ethiopia and Mauritius announced new currency swap lines with China's central bank. Kenya said it made progress on talks to reopen the lending taps for key projects such as its modern railway to link the region. Still, there was optimism from some, as they welcomed China's increased commitments to Africa's security, humanitarian challenges and other nonfinancial affairs. 'After nearly 70 years of hard work, China-Africa relations are at their best in history,' Tanzanian President Samia Suluhu said on her X account.	https://www.voanews.com/a/china-stops-short-of-african-debt-relief-at-triennial-summit/7775175.html	2024-09-07T03:41:02-07:00	
DR Congo leaders want more from Beijing than mineral sales	Kinshasa, DRC — Officials from the Democratic Republic of Congo will be heading home from the two-day Forum on China-Africa Cooperation in Beijing with limited success in their bid to expand economic relations beyond the mineral exports that have dominated trade, analysts say. 'The Chinese will continue to want to consolidate their position in Congo, including on minerals,' says Jean-Pierre Okenda, a Congolese consultant on mining issues. Although the DRC has a trade surplus with China, while most African countries have large deficits, almost all of it is from minerals China is buying to feed its manufacturers that are hungry for raw materials. The central African nation is the world’s largest producer of copper and cobalt, a metal used in electronics and a key material for batteries used in electric vehicles. The DRC has about 70% of the planet’s cobalt reserves. Expanding trade, investment? China’s customs authority shows trade flows to the DRC dropped 13% last year to $18.75 billion compared with 2022, the vast majority of it due to China's decreased imports from the DRC, which dropped by nearly 14% to $14.27 billion. While the drop was largely due to fluctuating prices, it underscored how deeply the DRC, one of the poorest countries in the world, relies on China. China is by far its largest single trading partner, representing nearly half of its merchandise exports and more than a quarter of its imports, according to 2022 data from the World Trade Organization. Congolese President Felix Tshisekedi was the first African leader to meet with Chinese President Xi Jinping ahead of the conference. According to a statement from his office, Tshisekedi made it clear he wants to see bilateral trade expanded to other sectors 'such as agriculture, renewable energy and especially industrialization through the local processing of the DRC's mineral wealth.' China’s Ministry of Foreign Affairs said ahead of the forum that Xi declared his nation is ready to 'deepen cooperation in agriculture, mineral products processing, vocational training and other fields.' Many in the Congolese leadership were hoping to come away from the conference with large pledges of Chinese investment in the country. Julien Paluku, the DRC’s trade minister, on Thursday published a plea for Kinshasa to be given a large chunk of the $50 billion that Xi promised at the conference to invest in Africa over the next three years. 'We focused our arguments on DRC's pivotal role in the Belt and Road Initiative, highlighting its strategic location as a connectivity point from North to South and East to West across the African continent,' he wrote on X. Business climate Christian-Geraud Neema, a Congolese researcher on China-Africa relations and the Francophone Africa Editor of the China Global South Project, says complaints about the investment climate in the DRC are an issue. 'There is a sort of reluctance to increase projects,' he says, referring to Chinese investments in Congo. 'China will make promises, but not very committed promises.' The DRC is one of the most corrupt countries in the world, ranking 162 out of 180 countries in Transparency International’s corruption perceptions index. Chinese businesses have also come under increasing pressure under Tshisekedi’s administration, with the government working to renegotiate long-standing deals with Chinese mining firms. In January, the Congolese government concluded talks on renegotiating a deal with the Chinese consortium running Sicomines, a copper-cobalt mine in Congo’s southeast. That renegotiation saw the investors behind the consortium agree to spend a massive $7 billion on developing infrastructure, such as badly needed roads and bridges, in the DRC. Another Chinese company, CMOC, which runs the largest copper-cobalt mine in the world, situated in the DRC, agreed to pay $2 billion to the Congolese state last year after a commercial dispute. Although many analysts believe those mining deals are still favorable to China, the uncertain business environment and the costs associated with rampant corruption have caused unease, say analysts. 'The operating conditions in Congo, everyone knows what they’re like,' says Okenda, explaining that Chinese firms were among the few willing to brave Congo’s tough business environment. Defense cooperation Defense is another area where some in the Congolese administration had been hoping for more cooperation in light of the country’s struggle to end the brutal conflict in eastern DRC. Tshisekedi’s office said that he discussed security concerns with Xi and that he 'praised China's influence on the lifting of the [U.N.] arms embargo on the DRC while it is unjustly attacked by Rwanda and M23 terrorists.' The M23, a Rwandan-backed rebel group, has captured swathes of territory in the region since launching a rebellion in late 2021 and displaced more than 1 million people from their homes. The DRC’s army, which critics say is weak and plagued with corruption, has struggled to fight back, losing battles and territory. But the DRC army did purchase nine high-tech Chinese CH-4 Rainbow attack drones, which it has used effectively in battle despite some being shot down. Jean-Pierre Bemba, who was the DRC’s defense minister before moving to the transport portfolio in April, said in Beijing this week that he hoped China and the DRC could go beyond their traditional areas of cooperation and work more closely on defense. Analysts are skeptical the defense relationship will go much further. Okenda, the mining consultant, said that 'China’s interest isn’t in defense,' and that Beijing's overriding concern was natural resources. Neema, the researcher, said that the prospect of a minerals-for-arms deal with Chinese firms had been a vague idea for years, but that Congolese leaders had never pursued it for fear of angering the United States, another important diplomatic partner. He said closer defense cooperation remained unlikely, unless the situation in the eastern DRC deteriorates further. 'Expediting military factors could push the Congolese government to make a deal,' he said. China’s Ministry of Foreign Affairs, in their statement on Xi’s meeting with Tshisekedi, indicated he made no reference to defense cooperation and gave only a boiler plate comment about working together for peace.	https://www.voanews.com/a/7775160.html	2024-09-07T01:57:18-07:00	
Typhoon Yagi kills at least 4 in Vietnam, 3 in China	HANOI, Vietnam — Vietnamese authorities say Typhoon Yagi has killed at least four people and injured 78 others after making landfall Saturday afternoon in the north of the country. The typhoon, described by Vietnamese meteorological officials as 'one of the most powerful typhoons in the region over the past decade,' made its way to the Southeast Asian country after it left three people dead and nearly a hundred others injured in the Chinese province of Hainan. Earlier, the government issued several alerts, and those vulnerable to floods or landslides were evacuated. Four airports were shuttered, including in the capital, Hanoi, and the city of Haiphong. Yagi landed at Vietnam's coastal provinces of Quang Ninh and Haiphong with wind speeds of up to 149 kilometers per hour (92 miles per hour), state media reported. Before landing, strong winds felled a tree, killing a woman in Hanoi, local media said Saturday. Quang Ninh is home to the UNESCO World Heritage site Ha Long Bay, known for its many towering limestone islands. Hundreds of cruises were canceled at the popular site before the typhoon landed, according to local media. Haiphong is an industrial hub, home to large factories, including electric vehicle maker VinFast and Apple supplier Pegatron. The typhoon also triggered power outages in large parts of Quang Ninh and Thai Binh provinces. Earlier, the government issued several alerts, and those vulnerable to floods or landslides were evacuated. Authorities pruned trees in Hanoi to make them less susceptible to falling, but wind and rain knocked over several along with billboards in northern cities. Local media reported that many moored boats were swept out to sea. China Yagi struck the Chinese city of Wenchang in Hainan province on Friday afternoon with wind speeds of up to about 245 kph (152 mph) near its center. Authorities said that the typhoon left three people dead and injured at least 95 others and that it affected over 1.2 million people as of noon Saturday, according to the local Global Times newspaper. Some 420,000 Hainan residents were relocated before the typhoon's landfall. Another half-a-million people in Guangdong province were evacuated before Yagi made a second landfall in the province's Xuwen County on Friday night. Meanwhile, the meteorological observatory of the city of Haikou downgraded its typhoon signal from red to orange on Saturday, as it moved further away. Before leaving Hong Kong, Yagi forced more than 270 people to seek refuge at temporary government shelters on Friday, and over 100 flights in the city were canceled due to the typhoon. Heavy rain and strong winds felled dozens of trees, and trading on the stock market, bank services and schools were halted. Philippines Yagi was still a storm when it blew out of the northwestern Philippines into the South China Sea on Wednesday, leaving at least 20 people dead and 26 others missing, mostly in landslides, and widespread flooding. More than 2.3 million people in northern and central provinces were affected. More than 82,200 people were displaced from their homes in Philippine provinces, and classes, work, inter-island ferry services and domestic flights were disrupted for days, including in the densely populated capital region, metropolitan Manila. Warm water in oceans power storms, and as they become warmer because of climate change, intense typhoons are becoming more common, especially in Southeast Asia, a U.N. climate change report warned.	https://www.voanews.com/a/super-typhoon-yagi-head-to-vietnam-2-reported-dead-in-china-s-hainan/7775139.html	2024-09-06T23:47:21-07:00	
US, UK spy chiefs urge support for Ukraine in joint essay	LONDON — The heads of the American and British foreign intelligence agencies said in a joint essay published Saturday that ongoing support for Ukraine in its conflict with Russia is essential. They pledged to enhance cooperation between their agencies and address other global challenges. CIA Director William Burns and Richard Moore, head of Britain's MI6 secret intelligence service, wrote the opinion piece in the Financial Times newspaper. This marks the first time the leaders of the two agencies have co-written an essay. The spy chiefs highlighted that their partnership is a cornerstone of the 'special relationship' between the U.S. and Britain. They noted that their agencies have collaborated for 75 years and are united in opposing Russia's aggression against Ukraine. 'Staying the course in Ukraine is more vital than ever,' they wrote. Russian President Vladimir Putin, they said, 'will not succeed in extinguishing Ukraine's sovereignty and independence.' They committed to continuing support for Ukrainian intelligence. Russian forces are making slow progress in eastern Ukraine, while Ukrainian troops continue their activities in Russia's Kursk region. Kyiv has been seeking additional air defense support from the U.S. and its allies. The spy chiefs also addressed Russian intelligence operations, accusing them of sabotage and disinformation across Europe. Russia has denied those allegations. Burns and Moore said their agencies have reorganized to confront a growing challenge from China, which they described as the principal intelligence and geopolitical concern of the 21st century. They also emphasized their efforts to use intelligence to promote restraint and de-escalation in the Middle East, including working toward a cease-fire in the Israel-Hamas war in Gaza. Burns is leading U.S. negotiations to resolve the conflict and address humanitarian issues. On Friday, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy urged military allies to provide more weaponry to strengthen Ukraine's defense as Russia continues its invasion. Speaking at Germany's Ramstein Airbase during the Ukraine Defense Contact Group (UDCG) meeting, Zelenskyy stressed the need for improved air defense systems and permission to use U.S.-supplied long-range weapons to target locations in Russia and Russian-occupied Ukrainian territory. Zelenskyy highlighted the urgent need for additional air defense systems due to recent drone and missile attacks. He noted that while some support has been provided, several promised systems have not yet arrived. U.S. policy currently restricts Ukraine from using U.S. weapons to strike deep within Russia. White House national security spokesperson John Kirby confirmed that the policy remains unchanged but noted that discussions with Ukrainian officials are ongoing. Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin, speaking at the UDCG meeting, reiterated support for Ukraine's immediate needs, including air defense and armor. He also emphasized the importance of Ukraine boosting its own defense production for long-term security. NATO Secretary-General Jens Stoltenberg, in a related development, called for continued military support for Ukraine, echoing Zelenskyy's appeal. He stressed that a strong Ukraine is crucial for ending the war and urged all allies to maintain their support during this critical period. Some information for this report was provided by The Associated Press, Reuters and Agence France-Presse.	https://www.voanews.com/a/britain-us-spy-chiefs-call-for-staying-the-course-on-ukraine/7775130.html	2024-09-06T23:36:13-07:00

Cockpit audio indicates deicing system was failing before plane crashed in Brazil	sao paulo, brazil — The pilots of a Brazilian passenger plane that crashed last month, killing all 62 people aboard, reported failure in the system to remove ice from the plane, according to a preliminary report made public Friday by Brazilian authorities. Investigators were careful to avoid saying this was the cause of the accident, stressing there was more work to be done. Still, their report lent further credence to aviation experts' main hypothesis: that the lift loss had been caused by ice formation on the plane's wings and failure of its deicing system. Weather reports from the day of the accident predicted ice formation in the region where the plane went down. Audio from the cockpit's voice recorder included comments from pilots indicating ice was accumulating and the deicing system was failing, Paulo Froes, an investigator in the air force's center for the investigation and prevention of air accidents, told reporters in Brasilia. 'There are still many doubts. This accident shouldn't have happened, not in the conditions in which the plane was flying and was being operated. It had protection equipment,' Carlos Henrique Baldin, head of the center's investigation division, told reporters. Operated by the airline Voepass, the flight departed August 9 from the city of Cascavel, in Parana state, bound for Sao Paulo's Guarulhos international airport. It crashed into the backyard of a home in a gated community in the city of Vinhedo, about 80 kilometers northwest of Sao Paulo. Footage of the ATR 72 twin-engine turboprop plunging while in a flat spin horrified people across Brazil.	https://www.voanews.com/a/cockpit-audio-indicates-deicing-system-was-failing-before-plane-crashed-in-brazil/7774776.html	2024-09-06T16:56:36-07:00	
Man charged with plotting shooting at NYC Jewish center on Hamas attack anniversary	new york — A Pakistani man was arrested in Canada this week for plotting a mass shooting at a Jewish center in Brooklyn on the one-year anniversary of the October 7 attack by Hamas that sparked the latest conflict in the Middle East, federal authorities announced Friday. U.S. Attorney General Merrick Garland said Muhammad Shahzeb Khan had attempted to travel from Canada, where he lives, to New York City with the 'stated goal of slaughtering, in the name of ISIS, as many Jewish people as possible.' The 20-year-old, who is also known as Shahzeb Jadoon, was apprehended on September 4 and charged with attempting to provide material support and resources to the terror group, which stands for the Islamic State of Iraq and al-Sham. 'As I said to Canada's minister of public safety yesterday, we are deeply grateful to our Canadian partners for their critical law enforcement actions in this matter,' Garland said in a statement. 'Jewish communities — like all communities in this country — should not have to fear that they will be targeted by a hate-fueled terrorist attack.' It was unclear if Khan has a lawyer. There was no listing for the case in the online federal court system. Edward Kim, a spokesperson for the Manhattan federal prosecutor's office, which is handling the case, declined to respond to follow-up questions, including where Khan was being held and when he would be brought to the U.S. to face the charges. He deferred to Canadian authorities, who didn't immediately respond to emails seeking comment. U.S. authorities said Khan began sharing ISIS propaganda videos and expressing his support for the terror group in social media posts and communications with others on an encrypted messaging app last November. In conversations with two undercover law enforcement officers, he confirmed that he and another ISIS supporter based in the U.S. had been planning to carry out attacks against Jewish centers in America and needed to obtain AR-style assault rifles, ammunition and other materials, according to the Justice Department. Khan also provided details about how he would cross the border from Canada into the U.S. and that he was considering conducting the attacks on either the October 7 anniversary or on October 11, which is the Jewish holiday of Yom Kippur, authorities said. Then on August 20, he told the undercover officers that he had settled on targeting New York City because of its sizable Jewish population and sent a photograph of the specific area inside a Jewish center where he planned to carry out the attack, according to the Justice Department. Using three separate vehicles, Khan began traveling to the U.S. but was stopped around Ormstown, a town in the Canadian province of Quebec that is about 12 miles (19 kilometers) from the U.S. border, federal authorities said.	https://www.voanews.com/a/pakistani-man-charged-in-alleged-new-york-city-plot-linked-to-islamic-state/7774703.html	2024-09-06T15:08:19-07:00	
US adversaries step up efforts to influence results of next election	washington — Russia, Iran and China are ramping up efforts to impact the outcome of the U.S. presidential election and down-ballot races, targeting American voters with an expanding array of sophisticated influence operations. The latest assessment from U.S. intelligence agencies, shared Friday, warns that Russia remains the preeminent threat, with Russian influence campaigns seeking to boost the chances of Republican presidential candidate and former U.S. President Donald Trump over Democratic candidate Vice President Kamala Harris. Russian actors, led by networks created by the Kremlin-backed media outlet RT, 'are supporting Moscow's efforts to influence voter preferences in favor of the former president and diminish the prospects of the vice president,' a senior intelligence official told reporters, briefing on the condition of anonymity to discuss sensitive information. 'RT has built and used networks of U.S. and other Western personalities to create and disseminate Russia-friendly narratives while trying to mask the content in authentic Americans' free speech,' the official said. And RT, the official added, is just part of a growing Kremlin-directed campaign that is looking to impact not just the race for the White House, but smaller elections across the United States, with an added emphasis on swing states. 'Russia's influence apparatus is very large and it's worth highlighting that they have other entities that are active,' the official said. 'Russia is working up and down ballot races, as well as spreading divisive issues.' Tracking the Russian influence efforts has become more difficult, with U.S. officials saying that there is a greater degree of sophistication and an increased emphasis on amplifying American voices with pro-Russian views rather than seeding social media with narratives crafted in the Kremlin. 'It's not just about Russian bots and trolls and fake social media persona, although that's part of it,' White House national security spokesperson John Kirby told VOA Friday. 'We're not taking anything for granted,' he added. 'There's no question that [Russian President Vladimir] Putin has every intent to try to sow discord here in the United States, to try to pump disinformation and Russian propaganda through to the American people, through what he believes were our credible sources, be they online or on television and we have to take that seriously.' The intelligence officials declined to share additional specifics about Russia's network of influence operations. But indictments Wednesday from the U.S. Justice Department have shed some light on the scope of the Kremlin's recent operations. In one case, the U.S. charged two employees of RT with using fake personas and shell companies to funnel almost $10 million to Tenet Media, a Tennessee-based company producing videos and podcasts for a stable of conservative political influencers. The aim, prosecutors said, was to produce and disseminate content promoting what Moscow viewed as pro-Russian policies. In a separate action, the U.S. seized 32 internet domains linked to an operation directed by a key aide to Putin. The aim, U.S. officials said, was to mimic legitimate U.S. news sites to spread Russian-created propaganda. RT publicly ridiculed the allegations while some of the influencers working with Tenet posted statements on the X social media platform saying they were unaware of the company's links to Moscow. As for the latest U.S. intelligence allegations, the Russian Embassy in Washington has yet to respond to VOA's request for comments, though it has described previous accusations as 'Russophobic.' Requests for comment to the Trump and Harris campaigns have also, so far, gone unanswered. But earlier U.S. intelligence assertions of Russian support for Trump have raised the ire of the Trump campaign, which has pointed to public statements by Russia's Putin supporting Trump's opponents. 'When President Trump was in the Oval Office, Russia and all of America's adversaries were deterred, because they feared how the United States would respond,' national press secretary for the Trump campaign, Karoline Leavitt, told VOA in an email this past July. U.S. intelligence officials, however, said it would be a mistake to put any faith in Putin's words, including public comments Thursday expressing support for Harris. The U.S. intelligence community 'does not take Putin's public statements as representative of Russia's covert intentions,' the senior official said. 'There are many examples over the past several years where Putin's public statements do not align with Russian actions. For example, his comments that he would not invade Ukraine.' Experts say Iran, China trying to influence results U.S. intelligence agencies Friday emphasized Russia is not alone in its effort to shape the outcome of the U.S. elections in November, warning both Tehran and Beijing are sharpening their influence campaigns with just about 60 days until America voters go to the polls. 'Iran is making a greater effort than in the past to influence this year's elections, even as its tactics and approaches are similar to prior cycles,' the intelligence official said, describing a 'multi-pronged approach to stoke internal divisions and undermine voter confidence in the U.S. democratic system. U.S. intelligence agencies previously assessed that Iran has focused part of its efforts on denigrating the Trump campaign, seeing his election as likely to worsen tensions between Tehran and Washington. U.S. officials last month also blamed Iran for a hack-and-leak operation targeting the Trump campaign, though they said that Iran-linked actors have also sought to infiltrate the Harris campaign. As for China, U.S. intelligence officials said it appears Beijing is still content to stay out of the U.S. presidential race, seeing little difference between Trump and Harris. But there are indications China is accelerating its efforts to impact other political races. U.S. intelligence 'is aware of PRC [People's Republic of China] attempts to influence U.S. down-ballot races by focusing on candidates it views as particularly threatening to core PRC security interests,' the official said. 'PRC online influence actors have also continued small scale efforts on social media to engage U.S. audiences on divisive political issues, including protests about the Israel-Gaza conflict and promote negative stories about both political parties,' the official added. 'Malicious speculations against China' The Chinese Embassy in Washington, Friday, rejected the U.S. intelligence assessment. 'China has no intention and will not interfere in the U.S. election, and we hope that the U.S. side will not make an issue of China in the election,' spokesperson Liu Pengyu told VOA in an email. Liu added that accusations Beijing is using social media to sway U.S. public opinion 'are full of malicious speculations against China, which China firmly opposes.' While U.S. intelligence officials have identified Russia, Iran and China, as the most prominent purveyors of disinformation, they are not alone. Officials have said countries like Cuba are also engaging in influence operations, though at a much smaller scale. And other countries are edging closer to crossing that line. 'We are seeing a number of countries considering activities that, at a minimum, test the boundaries of election influence,' according to the U.S. assessment. 'Such activities include lobbying political figures to try to curry favor with them in the event they are elected to office.'

Sergio Mendes, Grammy-winning Brazilian music legend, dies at 83	RIO DE JANEIRO — Sergio Mendes, the celebrated Brazilian musician whose 1966 hit 'Mas Que Nada' made him a global superstar and helped launch a long, Grammy-winning career, has died after months battling the effects of long COVID. He was 83. The death Thursday of the Brazilian pianist, songwriter and arranger was confirmed in a statement by his family. 'His wife and musical partner for the past 54 years, Gracinha Leporace Mendes, was by his side, as were his loving children,' the statement said Friday. 'Mendes last performed in November 2023 to sold out and wildly enthusiastic houses in Paris, London and Barcelona.' Mendes was born in Niteroi, Rio de Janeiro's sister city, and studied classical music at a conservatory before joining jazz groups. In the late 1950s and early 1960s, he began playing Bossa Nova as the genre was heating up in Rio's nightclub scene with Antonio Carlos Jobim, Joao Gilberto and others. In 1962, they traveled to New York for a Bossa Nova festival at Carnegie Hall. During the trip, Cannonball Adderley invited Mendes to collaborate on the album 'Cannonball Adderley and The Bossa Rio Sextet,' leading to his first American record, 'The Swinger from Rio,' after signing with Atlantic Records. Two years later, Mendes moved to California and formed Brazil '64, which evolved into Brazil '66 after he added two female vocalists. The group's debut album, produced by Herb Alpert, featured 'Mas Que Nada.' Sung entirely in Portuguese, 'Mas Que Nada' was a mid-tempo Samba number originally released in 1963 by composer Jorge Ben Sor and updated three years later by Mendes, who had been playing the song in clubs and gave it a jazzier, more hard-hitting feel. 'I put a band together called Brasil '66,' he told The Guardian in 2019. 'I'd always had instrumental groups, but when I added the two female singers — Lani Hall and Bibi Vogel — it made a different kind of sound. We recorded the song in Los Angeles, with me, the drums, bass and guitar all performing live.' Mendes' version was a worldwide hit that helped perpetuate the Brazilian music boom of the 1960s. In 2006, a modern version of the song topped U.S. charts, as performed by the Black Eyed Peas. It was included in his album 'Timeless,' produced by will.i.am and also featuring Stevie Wonder, Justin Timberlake and John Legend, among others. 'Sergio Mendes was my brother from another country,' trumpet player Alpert wrote on Facebook, along with a photo from decades ago, sitting next to Mendes at the piano. 'He was a true friend and extremely gifted musician who brought Brazilian music in all its iterations to the entire world with elegance.' Mendes' other hits were an eclectic blend ranging from covers of the Beatles' 'The Fool on the Hill' and 'With a Little Help from My Friends,' to his own Brazilian chant, 'Magalenha.' Mendes also composed the soundtrack for the film 'Pele,' featuring saxophonist Gerry Mulligan, and even produced an album recorded by the great Brazilian soccer player. Mendes won the 1992 Grammy Award for Best World Music Album for 'Brasileiro' and two Latin Grammy Awards. He also received an Oscar nomination in 2012 for Best Original Song for 'Real in Rio,' from the animated film 'Rio.' 'Brazilian soul was there,' pianist, singer, and songwriter Marcos Valle told GloboNews about Mendes' music. Valle also noted that it was Mendes who helped open doors for other Brazilian artists of his generation, including himself, to reach foreign audiences.	https://www.voanews.com/a/sergio-mendes-grammy-winning-brazilian-music-legend-dies-at-83/7774658.html	2024-09-06T14:15:13-07:00	
US to continue to enforce sanctions after aircraft linked to Venezuela’s Maduro seized, Blinken says	Santo Domingo, Dominican Republic — U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken said on Friday that the United States will continue enforcing sanctions against Venezuelan President Nicolas Maduro following the seizure and investigation of two aircraft linked to him earlier this week in the Dominican Republic. On Friday, Blinken held discussions with Dominican President Luis Abinader during his first official visit to Santo Domingo as the top U.S. diplomat. Blinken underscored the U.S. commitment to continued collaboration with the Dominican Republic to promote inclusive economic growth, strengthen democratic institutions, uphold human rights, and improve governance and security. On Monday, U.S. authorities seized a plane used by Maduro, the equivalent to the U.S. Air Force One. The aircraft, undergoing maintenance in the Dominican Republic, was seized for being illegally purchased through a shell company and smuggled out of the United States, violating U.S. export control and sanctions laws. After the controversial reelection of Maduro on July 28, Venezuela suspended commercial flights to and from the Dominican Republic. A second plane linked to Maduro is under investigation in the Dominican Republic. This aircraft is similar to the one seized on Monday and is listed among the sanctioned assets by the U.S. Treasury as belonging to Maduro. 'With regard to the plane seizures, we've been very clear. We'll implement our sanctions, and if we find violations of them, we will act. That's what we did, and that's what we'll continue to do,' Blinken told reporters during a joint press conference with Abinader at the National Palace. The Dominican Republic will host the 2025 Summit of the Americas, where Western Hemisphere leaders will address shared challenges and policy issues facing the region. On August 16, Abinader was sworn in for a second four-year term, vowing to enhance security by increasing police training over the next four years. His administration has also implemented policies barring migrants from neighboring Haiti. The U.S. has urged the Dominican Republic to establish a path toward normalization with Haiti, as border tensions continue to escalate. Blinken said he and Abinader are committed to support the Haitians to build security and 'make sure the people are treated humanely.' Abinader told reporters his country will continue moving forward and normalizing the relationship with Haiti, such as opening air flights, but the security and safety of citizens of the Dominican Republic is still the priority. The U.S. and the Dominican Republic signed a historic Open Skies agreement on August 2. Once in effect, the agreement will expand opportunities for airlines, travel companies and people-to-people exchanges. More than 4 million U.S. citizens visit the Dominican Republic each year. The Dominican Republic is a crucial partner for the U.S. in hemispheric affairs, due to its position as the second-largest economy in the Caribbean, after Cuba, and the third-largest country by population, behind Cuba and Haiti. The U.S. is its primary trading partner. Additionally, the Dominican Republic is home to Pueblo Viejo, one of the world’s largest gold mines, and serves as a major global supplier of ferronickel, used for making stainless steel. The Dominican Republic and the United States, along with five Central American countries, are parties to the Dominican Republic-Central America Free Trade Agreement, known as CAFTA-DR. This agreement enhances economic opportunities by eliminating tariffs, opening markets, reducing barriers to services and promoting transparency. The U.S. Agency for International Development is investing more than $9.5 million to strengthen the Dominican Republic’s existing justice system and to reduce crime and violence. Blinken also announced on Friday 'the first phase of a supply chain investment through USAID, an initial $3 million that will help the Dominican government improve its workforce training, build industrial parks, attract high-tech industries here to the Dominican Republic.'	https://www.voanews.com/a/us-to-continue-to-enforce-sanctions-after-aircraft-linked-to-venezuela-s-maduro-seized-blinken-says/7774618.html	2024-09-06T13:40:08-07:00	
Death of persecuted journalist brings attention to Turkmenistan’s media repression	Washington — The death of a former journalist who experienced beatings and inhumane treatment in prison shows the harassment that media workers and their families endure in Turkmenistan, analysts said. Khudayberdy Allashov was 35 years old when he died in August, after what watchdogs said was eight years of persecution and physical assault by Turkmen authorities. No cause of death was listed on his death certificate. 'The beatings and torture that Allashov was subjected to and the impossibility of providing him with rehabilitation and medical care led to the death of a brave and honest man,' Farid Tuhbatullin, the head of the Turkmen Initiative for Human Rights, told VOA via email. Known as one of the most closed-off countries, Turkmenistan has little space for independent reporting. Nearly all media outlets are state-owned, and ministries monitor content, according to watchdogs. Journalists such as Allashov who try to report independently — and their families — are subject to arrest and harassment, according to Reporters Without Borders, or RSF. Azatlyk, which is run by VOA’s sister outlet Radio Free Europe/Radio Liberty’s Turkmen Service, provides a rare source of news. When Allashov was initially detained in 2016, he had been working for Azatlyk for about three months. That reporting was critical of the government, focusing on social problems such as food shortages, salary delays and forced labor, according to an Amnesty International report published at the time of Allashov’s first arrest. 'All of this is forbidden to be mentioned in the local media,' Tuhbatullin told VOA in an email. 'The very word ‘problem’ is taboo.' He, too, had been arrested and exiled from Turkmenistan. Allashov, his mother and his wife were all arrested under charges of possessing chewing tobacco, a commonly used substance in Turkmenistan. There are no other known criminal charges of possessing chewing tobacco; the maximum punishment is typically a fine, Farruh Yusupov, director of Azatlyk, told VOA. In captivity, Allashov was tortured with electric shock. The severity of the torture during Allashov’s 74-day arrest caused him to declare he would no longer work as a journalist. But even after his release and quitting the profession, authorities continually detained and harassed him up until his death, journalists and experts who spoke with VOA said. He faced violent interrogations in 2019, 2020 and 2023. 'Authorities never left him or his family alone,' Yusupov told VOA. 'They told him they would not relent until they chased him to his grave. They were true to their promise.' The Turkmenistan Embassy in Washington did not respond to VOA’s email requesting comment. Despite having ceased his reporting, Allashov was denied any medical treatment due to his status as a target of the authorities, according to RSF. He leaves a wife and two children. RSF condemned the targeted harassment of independent journalists. 'Allashov should never have lived through this nightmare,' Jeanne Cavelier of RSF said in a statement. 'Under the Turkmen dictatorship, the lives of journalists and former journalists — and the lives of their families — continue to be at risk because of their work.' Turkmenistan ranks 175 out of 180 countries on the RSF World Press Freedom Index, where 1 shows the best media environment. 'This is a country where the authorities can do anything to any citizen who expresses any form of dissent,' Gulnoza Said, a program coordinator at the Committee to Protect Journalists, told VOA. Yusupov told VOA that while there are no 'concrete numbers' available for how many journalists have been attacked by authorities, there are many well-documented instances. In 2006, reporter Ogulsapar Muradova died in prison after being denied legal representation. The United Nations recognized the Turkmen government as the responsible party in her death. In 2013, authorities detained journalist Rovshen Yazmuhamedov without cause, according to RSF. Most recently, in 2023, journalist Soltan Achilova was beaten by police officers and banned from leaving the country. Only a small number of independent journalists still operate in the country, and those who do all work under pseudonyms, said Tuhbatullin of the Turkmen Initiative for Human Rights. Turkmen authorities also harass the families of journalists. Allashov’s wife and mother were arrested with him in 2016, and his mother was detained for three months and beaten. She was taken in for questioning again in 2019, when she was beaten and passed away two days later from heart failure, according to Yusupov. Authorities also harassed the mother of journalist Yazmuhamedov, banning her from leaving the country to see her other children. 'This is one of the tools authoritarian governments use to silence independent reporting,' Said told VOA. The Committee to Protect Journalists has reached out to Turkmen authorities after every government attack on a journalist. The government has never responded, Said told VOA. Yusupov told VOA that government repression 'makes the work of journalists like Allashov even more important.' 'It’s important to tell the truth in the face of an oppressive regime and provide independent reporting to society,' he said.	https://www.voanews.com/a/death-of-persecuted-journalist-brings-attention-to-turkmenistan-s-media-repression/7774539.html	2024-09-06T13:02:21-07:00	
At UN, growing calls for reversal of latest Taliban edict against women	New York — A dozen U.N. Security Council ambassadors strongly condemned on Friday the Afghan Taliban’s recent 'morality law' which further erodes the rights of women and girls in that country and called for its reversal. 'On top of the existing edicts, this new directive confirms and extends wide-ranging and far-reaching restrictions on personal conduct and provides inspectors with broad powers of enforcement, thus deepening the already unacceptable restrictions on the enjoyment by all Afghans of human rights and fundamental freedoms,' said Japan’s U.N. ambassador, Yamazaki Kazuyuki. 'Day by day, Afghan women and girls lose their opportunities and hope for their future,' he added. 'This is unacceptable.' Envoys from Ecuador, France, Guyana, Malta, Mozambique, Republic of Korea, Sierra Leone, Slovenia, Switzerland, the United Kingdom and the United States joined him as he read the statement before reporters. The only Security Council members not to lend their support to the statement were Algeria, China and Russia. On August 21, the Taliban announced the ratification of a detailed 'Law on the Promotion of Virtue and the Prevention of Vice,' which includes among its restrictions a prohibition on Afghan women using their voices in public and orders them to completely cover their bodies and faces outdoors. Women are also forbidden from interacting with non-Muslims, using public transport alone, and looking at men who are not their husband or blood relative. The Taliban government, which is officially not recognized by any country, has dismissed U.N.-led foreign criticism of the law as offensive. Zabihullah Mujahid, the chief Taliban spokesperson, asserted this week that 'non-Muslims should first educate themselves about Islamic laws and respect Islamic values' before expressing concerns or rejecting the law. 'We find it blasphemous to our Islamic Sharia when objections are raised without understanding it,' he said. The United States, European Union, United Nations and others have condemned the edict, the latest in a series that have eroded the rights of Afghan women and girls. 'Today, we once again urge the Taliban to swiftly reverse all the policies and practices that restrict the enjoyment by women and girls of their human rights and fundamental freedoms,' Ambassador Kazuyuki said. 'The Taliban need to listen and respond to the voices of Afghan women and girls by respecting their rights to education and for women to work, as well as the freedoms of expression and movement. It is a prerequisite for a stable, peaceful and prosperous Afghanistan.' The Japanese envoy noted that the 15-nation Security Council has repeatedly discussed the worsening human rights situation in Afghanistan since the Taliban took over in August 2021 and have 'raised a united voice on multiple occasions.' Last year, the council unanimously adopted Resolution 2681 which calls for the full, equal, meaningful and safe participation of women and girls in Afghanistan. The 12 Security Council members also called on those countries with influence over the Taliban to promote the 'urgent reversal' of the policy, which violates Afghanistan’s obligations under international human rights treaties to which it is a signatory. They also urged the Taliban to allow the U.N. special rapporteur on the situation of human rights in Afghanistan to visit the country. The Taliban have publicly said they will not allow Richard Bennett entry. The U.N.’s agency for gender equality and women’s empowerment, U.N. Women, warned in a statement on August 28 that the new law is 'effectively erasing women from public life and granting broad enforcement powers to the morality police.' U.N. political chief Rosemary DiCarlo warned last month that the law would only impede Afghanistan’s return to the international fold. The Security Council plans to next discuss Afghanistan in a meeting on September 18.

Venezuela says detained US sailor entered 'without any type of document'	Caracas, Venezuela — A U.S. Navy sailor held in Venezuela since late last month was arrested for entering 'without any type of document,' the South American country's attorney general said Thursday. An American official on Wednesday announced the sailor had been detained at a time of soaring tensions between Washington and Caracas in the aftermath of disputed elections in Venezuela, with the opposition party claiming it can prove were stolen. In his first comments on the matter, Venezuelan Attorney General Tarek William Saab said the sailor 'entered without any type of document, without any means of subsistence for what he came to do in the country.' He said the sailor held dual U.S. and Mexican nationalities. For its part, the Pentagon said the sailor had been in Venezuela on 'personal travel.' 'This wasn't something that was authorized,' Deputy Pentagon Press Secretary Sabrina Singh told reporters. 'The U.S. Navy is looking into this. We're working with the State Department,' she said, adding that: 'Of course, we'd like to see the sailor returned home.' Venezuela was rocked by protests after President Nicolas Maduro was declared the winner of a disputed July 28 election, with 25 civilians and two soldiers killed and more than 2,400 people arrested. The opposition claims it won by a landslide, and the United States, the European Union and several Latin American countries have refused to recognize Maduro's claimed victory without seeing detailed voting results. On Monday, Washington seized Maduro's plane in the Dominican Republic and flew it to Florida, a move the Venezuelan leader condemned as 'piracy' but which Washington said was necessary due to sanctions violations. The following day, Washington denounced an arrest warrant issued for opposition presidential candidate Edmundo Gonzalez Urrutia and warned of further action against Maduro. The U.S. State Department has warned Americans against traveling to Venezuela for reasons including crime, unrest and wrongful detention.	https://www.voanews.com/a/venezuela-says-detained-us-sailor-entered-without-any-type-of-document-/7773758.html	2024-09-06T02:19:02-07:00	
Indian opposition parties name LGBTQ+ activists to key posts	NEW DELHI — India's main opposition Congress party this week set up a new internal group to promote LGBTQ+ rights while another party has named a person from the community as its spokesperson, in the first such political recognition after many setbacks. The country's top court in 2018 decriminalized homosexuality but greatly disappointed the LGBTQ+ community last year when it declined to legalize same-sex marriage and left it to parliament to decide. Prime Minister Narendra Modi's government has also said the legislature is the right platform to rule on the contentious issue, and this week invited the public to share views on how best to ensure that policies for the community are inclusive and effective. Same-sex relations are mostly a taboo in the largely conservative country of 1.42 billion people, and the government told the Supreme Court last year that such marriages were not 'comparable with the Indian family unit concept of a husband, a wife and children'. Congress, whose political clout has risen after doing much better than expected in the April-June general election, this week named LGBTQ+ activist Mario da Penha as the head of its new unit for the community under its All India Professionals’ Congress division. This follows Congress's poll promise to bring in a law to legalize civil unions between same-sex couples. Da Penha said on X it was the 'only representative framework for queer people within any recognised national political party in India'. Anish Gawande, who last month became the first person from the community to become the spokesperson for a big party, the opposition Nationalist Congress Party - Sharadchandra Pawar, said da Penha's appointment was 'a major moment for queer inclusion in Indian politics.' Gawande earlier said on social media of the Nationalist Congress appointment: 'If you'd told me 10 years ago that it would be possible to be out and in Indian politics, I would have scoffed in disbelief.' The federal government says it has taken a host of measures for the community, which includes enabling same-sex couples to access government food programs as families, open joint bank accounts and choose each other as nominees, and seek medical and other care without discrimination. The Department of Social Justice and Empowerment said in a statement on Sunday it had invited inputs from the public to ensure that policies and initiatives for the community are inclusive and effective. It did not mention any law to recognize marriages between same-sex couples. A spokesperson for the ministry did not immediately respond to a request for comment.	https://www.voanews.com/a/indian-opposition-parties-name-lgbtq-activists-to-key-posts/7773745.html	2024-09-06T01:45:18-07:00	
In Haiti, Blinken announces $45 million in new aid, calls for renewed security mission mandate	Port-au-Prince, Haiti — During a trip to Haiti on Thursday, U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken announced $45 million in new humanitarian aid for the Caribbean nation, which has been wracked by violence for years. He also called for the renewal of the United Nations mandate for the Multinational Security Support, or MSS, mission to combat the armed gangs that dominate much of the capital. 'At this critical moment, you do need more funding. We do need more personnel to sustain and carry out the objectives of this mission,' Blinken told a news conference on a rare visit to Port-au-Prince. The top U.S. diplomat said he plans to convene a ministerial meeting at the coming U.N. General Assembly to encourage greater international contributions to address Haiti's security, economic, and humanitarian needs. The MSS mandate is set to expire at the beginning of October. U.S. President Joe Biden's administration is reportedly exploring the possibility of changing the mission into a traditional U.N. peacekeeping operation, a move that would ease funding, provide more equipment and enable use of military forces rather than only police officers. Blinken said that while the MSS mission itself needs to be renewed, it also needs to ensure that it is 'reliable' and 'sustainable.' 'A peacekeeping operation would be one such option. I think there are others,' he told reporters on Thursday. Blinken's visit to Port-au-Prince underscores U.S. support for Haiti as the country grapples with gang violence. On Thursday, Blinken met with Edgard Leblanc Fils from Haiti's Transitional Presidential Council. 'Both concurred on the critical need to make timely advancements on election preparations,' State Department spokesperson Matthew Miller said. Apart from Fils, Blinken also held talks with Prime Minister Garry Conille, MSS head Godfrey Otunge and Normil Rameau, head of the Haitian National Police. The United States and Canada are the top funders of the MSS in Haiti. The first-year estimated cost for the mission is $589 million. The U.S. has already provided $309 million — $200 million toward the MSS mission base and $109 million in financial support. Gang-related violence and drug trafficking have fueled political instability and insecurity in Haiti, leading to unbearable conditions for Haitians. At least 80% of Port-au-Prince is no longer under Haitian authorities’ control, with violence spreading to other parts of the country. In the past year, displacement in Haiti has tripled as gang violence grips the Caribbean nation. The U.N. says at least 578,000 people have been displaced because of violence, including murders, kidnappings and rapes. The situation is further exacerbated by widespread hunger, with nearly half the 11.7 million population facing acute food insecurity. After Haiti, Blinken arrived in Santo Domingo later Thursday. His visit follows the start of Dominican Republic President Luis Abinader's second term in mid-August. The Dominican Republic will host the 2025 Summit of the Americas, where Western Hemisphere leaders will address shared challenges and policy issues facing the region.

Sanctions complicate Iran-Pakistan gas pipeline project	Islamabad — Pakistan Federal Minister for Petroleum Musadik Malik said Wednesday that international sanctions have caused complications for the Iran-Pakistan cross-border natural gas pipeline project. Media outlets reported that Iran had warned Pakistan to complete its part of the project or face an $18 billion penalty — news that sparked a debate days later in Pakistan's lower house, the National Assembly. Responding to a question by a lawmaker on the floor of the house regarding Iran's final notice, Malik said, 'This is a deeply complicated matter and involves international sanctions.' Malik did not provide more details about sanctions, but said the government is available to discuss the complications. He rejected the penalty figure of $18 billion, saying, 'I do not know where it has come from.' In response to a query regarding reports of Iran's notice, Pakistan Foreign Ministry spokesperson Mumtaz Zahra Baloch said last week that Pakistan had taken note of the development. 'Pakistan and Iran have robust channels of communications including this matter. We have always said that we would like to resolve all issues [with Iran] through friendly consultations,' she said during a briefing. Petroleum Minister Malik, during an informal conversation on the gas pipeline project with local journalists in March, confirmed that Pakistan would present its case to the U.S. and seek an exemption from sanctions. 'We cannot bear American sanctions. We will present our stance to the U.S. We want to complete this project but without any sanctions,' Malik told journalists. However, Pakistan Foreign Ministry spokesperson Baloch, also in March, said that the project is progressing 'in conformity with our commitment to the Iran-Pakistan pipeline.' She emphasized that Pakistan perceives no grounds for objections from external parties as the construction activities are confined within Pakistani territory. During a briefing Tuesday, U.S. State Department spokesperson Matthew Miller said that helping Pakistan address its energy shortage was a priority for the United States. He added, however, that 'we will continue to enforce our sanctions against Iran. We also advise anyone considering a business deal with Iran to be aware of its possible ramifications.' Pakistan experts say Pakistan failed to meet its commitment to build its part of the pipeline for several reasons, including a volatile security situation in Balochistan, where the pipeline is supposed to pass. Gas pipelines are not safe in restive Balochistan and Baloch insurgents frequently target gas pipelines in the resource-rich southwestern province bordering Iran. 'In my opinion, however, Pakistan’s real worry is U.S. sanctions,' said Naveed Hussain, an editor of the Pakistan English daily newspaper The Express Tribune. 'It has declared force majeure, but Iran says Pakistan had signed the agreement while being fully cognizant of [the] U.S. sanctions risk, especially when India had withdrawn from the project for the same reason.' Khaleeq Kiani, who writes about the economy for the Pakistan English daily newspaper Dawn, told VOA, 'The U.S. stance is clear, and recently it imposed sanctions on companies providing equipment to Pakistan missile programs, that was a clear indication to Pakistan to not proceed with the pipeline project.' In April, the U.S. imposed sanctions on four entities — one based in Belarus, and the other three in China — for supplying missile‐applicable items to Pakistan’s ballistic missile program, including its long-range missile program. Despite that precedent, Pakistan's foreign minister, Mohammad Ishaq Dar, said at a May press briefing that Pakistan would not succumb to international pressure on the pipeline project. 'We will not let anyone use their veto,' Dar said, without naming the United States. Dar's remarks came weeks after Donald Lu, the U.S. assistant secretary of state for South and Central Asian Affairs, told a U.S. House Foreign Affairs Committee hearing that importing gas from Iran would expose Pakistan to U.S. sanctions. Pakistan is facing gas shortages and relies on subsidized gas, putting pressure on the national exchequer, Petroleum Minister Malik said on the house floor Wednesday. Originally envisaged as the Iran-Pakistan-India pipeline, the project was reduced to a bilateral agreement after India pulled out in 2008. Tehran and Islamabad signed a 25-year contract in 2009 to export gas from Iran through a 2,400-kilometer gas pipeline to be built jointly by both countries. While Iran has completed its pipeline section, Pakistan keeps dragging its feet on the project. In 2019, the two countries revised their contract, and Islamabad committed to building its portion of the pipeline by 2024.

Excessive rain, changing patterns, dozens of deaths mark Pakistan monsoon	ISLAMABAD — As monsoon season nears its end in Pakistan, higher than average rainfall and rain-related accidents leave behind a trail of deaths, nearly half of them children. Monsoon season runs from July to September in Pakistan. Since the beginning of July, the country has counted at least 337 rain-related deaths, according to the National Disaster Management Authority. One-hundred-seventy children are among the dead. Thousands also have been displaced as floodwaters inundated villages. Pakistan’s meteorological department recorded rains 60% higher than average in the first two months of the monsoon season. August saw 137% more rain than the month’s average after slightly below average rainfall in July. Weather officials expect mostly normal rainfall in September. The data shows that rainfall patterns in Pakistan are changing. 'The shift that we are seeing is that monsoon used to go to the upper areas, that trend is lessening a bit,' Sahibzad Khan, director general of PMD, told VOA. 'Now it’s shifting more to the south.' Rain that was twice as heavy as normal battered Pakistan’s two southern provinces, Sindh and Balochistan, over the last two months, while the northern, mountainous regions saw average-to-below-average rain, according to the national weather agency. Just in Sindh, 72,000 children saw their education disrupted by the severe weather, Save the Children said in a statement Wednesday. Despite heavy rains, flooding, and displacement in parts of the country, experts say Pakistan escaped extensive damage this monsoon season, partly because of lessons learned from the devastating floods in 2022. 'We are working more on anticipatory approaches. Looking at past patterns, we are predicting the scale and velocity of upcoming floods,' said Shafqat Munir Ahmad, deputy executive director of the Resilience Development Program and Policy Outreach at the Sustainable Development Policy Institute in Islamabad. In 2022, historic rains submerged nearly a third of the country at one time, affecting 33 million Pakistanis and causing nearly $30 billion in damage. Since then, Pakistan incorporated technology to plan scenarios and issue early severe weather warnings to communities, said Ahmad, adding that improved coordination and response time also reduced damage. This year, Pakistan also used lightning detectors that China provided last year. 'China has collaborated with us. With their help, we have 26 lightning detector stations that tell us about the type and severity of lightning and thunder,' said weather chief Khan. Pakistan still lacks sufficient long-term planning, however, to tackle the impact of climate change, experts say. The Germany-based Global Climate Risk Index ranks Pakistan the 8th most vulnerable country. A web app created at the University of Maryland that predicts what a city’s weather will be like in 60 years shows summers and winters in several Pakistani cities will be much warmer than they are at present. While projects to mitigate climate change may attract funding, Ahmad said efforts to help vulnerable communities adapt to changing climate lack necessary financial support in Pakistan. Several communities across the South Asian nation are still awaiting funds to rebuild homes devastated by the 2022 weather calamity. Just last July, the Asian Development Bank approved a $400 million loan to fund the reconstruction of homes and infrastructure in Sindh. At a donor conference in January 2023, donors pledged more than $9 billion to help Pakistan build back after the 2022 floods. Still, the country has barely tapped the funds that were largely designated as project loans. As authorities and charitable organizations rush to provide food, water and shelter to communities displaced by this year’s rains and floods, Save the Children urged increased support to prevent the current impact of the floods from becoming long-term problems. 'Governments must tackle the underlying causes of these climate driven disasters, including channeling funding and support to children and their families in Pakistan to adapt, recover and rebuild their lives,' the statement said, quoting country director Khuram Gondal.	https://www.voanews.com/a/excessive-rain-changing-patterns-dozens-of-deaths-mark-pakistan-monsoon/7772643.html	2024-09-05T08:33:00-07:00	
At least 81 killed in Nigeria in suspected Boko Haram attack, officials say	Kano, Nigeria — At least 81 people died and several were missing after an attack by suspected Boko Haram militants in Nigeria's northeastern Yobe State, local officials told AFP on Tuesday. 'Around 150 suspected Boko Haram terrorists armed with rifles and RPGs [rocket-propelled grenades] attacked Mafa ward on more than 50 motorcycles around 1600 hours on Sunday,' said Abdulkarim Dungus, a Yobe state police spokesperson. 'They killed many people and burnt many shops and houses. We are yet to ascertain the actual number of those killed in the attack.' Dungus said it appeared to be a revenge attack 'for the killing of two Boko Haram terrorists by vigilantes from the village.' Bulama Jalaluddeen, a local official, said at least 81 people were killed in the attack. Fifteen bodies had already been buried by their relations by the time soldiers reached Mafa for the evacuation of the corpses, said the official. 'In addition to these, some unspecified number of dead victims from nearby villages who were caught up in the attack were taken and buried by their kinsmen before the arrival of the soldiers,' added the official. 'Many people are still missing and their whereabouts unknown.' Boko Haram and other extremist groups have waged a 15-year insurgency in northeastern Nigeria that has killed more than 40,000 people. Central and northwestern Nigeria have been plagued for years by gangs of criminals known as 'bandits' who raid villages, kill and abduct residents, and burn homes after looting them. By working alongside these gangs, militant groups have increasingly established a presence in central Niger state, officials and analysts say.	https://www.voanews.com/a/at-least-81-killed-in-nigeria-in-suspected-boko-haram-attack-officials-say-/7770651.html	2024-09-03T18:46:50-07:00	
Iran court upholds death penalty for Guard volunteer in protest killing	DUBAI, United Arab Emirates — Iran's Supreme Court has upheld a death sentence imposed on a member of the all-volunteer wing of the country's paramilitary Revolutionary Guard who stormed a house during the 2022 protests over the death of Mahsa Amini and killed a 60-year-old man, a lawyer said Tuesday. The sentence imposed on the Basij member marks a rare moment for Iran to hold accountable its security forces, who waged a bloody, monthslong crackdown on all dissent over Amini's death. More than 500 people were killed and more than 22,000 were detained. Since then, Iran has put to death multiple protesters who were detained in the crackdown and accused of killing security forces, after closed-door trials criticized by activists abroad. Lawyer Payam Derafshan, who represented a protester detained in 2022, told The Associated Press that the Supreme Court reached its verdict on August 26 over the killing of Mohammad Jamehbozorg, a carpet seller in the city of Karaj. The convicted Basij member and others stormed Jamehbozorg's home in Karaj, some 40 kilometers northwest of the capital, Tehran, looking for demonstrators taking part in the Amini protests, including his son. The Basij member, identified only by initials, shot Jamehbozorg in the head, killing him. Two other Guard members also received prison sentences. Iran's government and state media did not report the ruling. Amini, 22, died after being arrested by Iran's morality police over allegedly improperly wearing her hijab, or headscarf. In March, a United Nations fact-finding mission said Iran was responsible for the 'physical violence' that led to Amini's death and concluded that Tehran committed 'crimes against humanity' through its actions in suppressing the protests. There has been another case of a security force member receiving the death penalty over a killing in the Amini protests. In 2023, a military court sentenced Colonel Jafar Javanmardi, the police chief of northern port city of Bandar Anzali, for killing a young man while not observing the country's laws related for using live ammo. The Supreme Court is still reviewing Javanmardi's initial death sentence. Cases involving security forces accused of brutality have been a particular focus of Iran's new reformist President Masoud Pezeshkian. Last week, Pezeshkian ordered an investigation into the death of a man in custody after activists alleged he had been tortured to death by police officers.	https://www.voanews.com/a/iran-court-upholds-death-penalty-for-guard-volunteer-in-protest-killing-/7770161.html	2024-09-03T14:00:38-07:00

UN experts: Iran executed more than 400 people this year	Geneva — U.N. experts voiced alarm Monday at a surge in executions in Iran last month that pushed the total in the country so far this year to over 400. At least 81 people were put to death in Iran in August alone, significantly more than the 45 reported in July, a group of 11 independent United Nations rights experts said in a statement. The reported number of executions since the start of 2024 rose above 400, including those of 15 women, they said. 'We are deeply concerned by this sharp rise in executions,' said the experts, who are appointed by the U.N. Human Rights Council but do not speak on behalf of the United Nations. Iran executes more people per year than any other nation except China, according to rights groups including Amnesty International. The U.N. experts, including the special rapporteurs on the rights situation in Iran and on extrajudicial, summary and arbitrary executions, said 41 of the executions last month had been of people convicted of drug offenses. 'Executions for drug offences violate international standards,' they said. The experts lamented a substantial rise in executions for drug offences in Iran since 2021, with more than 400 drug-related executions carried out last year alone. They also said they had received reports indicating that death penalty trials in Iran often fail to meet due-process guarantees. They pointed to the case of Reza Rasaei, a Kurdish protester, who was executed on August 6 for the murder of an Islamic Revolution Guards Corps member at an event where he had brandished a sign reading: 'Women, Life, Freedom.' His conviction was based on a confession reportedly obtained through torture, and despite co-defendants retracting their testimonies implicating him in the murder and forensic evidence challenging his involvement, the experts said. 'Reports of serious violations of fair trial and due process rights mean that the death penalty as it is currently practiced in the Islamic Republic of Iran amounts to unlawful execution,' they said. The experts said they were 'extremely concerned that innocent individuals may have been executed' and called for a halt to executions.	https://www.voanews.com/a/un-experts-iran-executed-more-than-400-people-this-year/7768808.html	2024-09-02T15:46:19-07:00	
Iran brings new charges against jailed reformist	Tehran — Jailed Iranian activist and former Cabinet member Mostafa Tajzadeh, a prominent figure of the Islamic Republic's reformist camp, has been charged with 'propaganda' against the state, local media said Monday. Tajzadeh, jailed since July 2022 in Tehran's notorious Evin prison, served as deputy interior minister under the presidency of Mohammad Khatami, a reformist who oversaw a rapprochement with the West between 1997 and 2005. He was sentenced to five years in prison in October 2022 on charges of 'plotting against state security' among others, his lawyer said at the time. Reformist daily Ham-Mihan said Monday that new charges had been brought against Tajzadeh, accusing him again 'of plotting against state security' and 'propaganda against the Islamic Republic.' He had already spent a total of seven years behind bars, having been arrested in 2009 alongside other reformist leaders following the reelection of hard-line President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad in a vote contested by the opposition. Tajzadeh, an outspoken commentator on national politics via social media channels operated by his relatives, said in a letter 'that he would not appear in court' in the new case, according to Ham-Mihan. If convicted, Ham-Mihan said, Tajzadeh could face up to six more years in jail. In recent years, he has urged democratization and called on authorities to enact 'structural changes' in the Iranian political system.	https://www.voanews.com/a/iran-brings-new-charges-against-jailed-reformist/7768408.html	2024-09-02T09:28:33-07:00	
Iranians loom over Paralympic sitting volleyball competition	Paris — Sitting volleyball is a Paralympic sport played close to the ground: Players scoot around the court and hit over a net that stands jus 1.15 meters tall. So having the world’s second-tallest man at the front of that net can make quite the difference for an already-dominant Iranian team. Standing at 2.46 meters and measuring 1.8 meters seated with his arms raised, Morteza Mehrzadselakjani has helped Iran cruise to the sitting volleyball semifinals in Paris. Iran will begin the semifinals Thursday at North Paris Arena. The International Paralympic Committee says Mehrzadselakjani, the tallest ever Paralympian, was diagnosed with acromegaly, a condition that stems from excessive growth hormone. An injury from a bicycle accident when he was 15 caused his right leg to stop growing, and it is now 15 centimeters shorter than his left leg. The Iranians have yet to lose a set in two matches, beating Brazil in three straight sets Sunday after doing the same to Ukraine on Friday to open group play. Iran, now sitting atop its group with six points, gets one more group match against Germany before chasing a third straight gold medal in the sport. It would also be Iran’s eighth Paralympic gold since it started competing in sitting volleyball 10 Paralympics ago. Zubkovska makes it 5 straight golds in long jump Ukraine's Oksana Zubkovska’s long jump career has stretched over 17 years, but she said the fifth gold she has won since Beijing in 2008 stood out. 'Every medal I have won is very important, but this one is special because of what is happening back home,' she said. Her best five jumps exceeded the marks of any of her opponents, and her winning mark was 5.78 meters. Zubkovska competes in the T12 classification, for individuals with partial vision impairment. US wheelchair basketball closes pool play undefeated The United States men's wheelchair basketball team finished pool play with a 76-69 victory over Australia. This marked the third victory for the Americans, two-time defending gold medalists who have outscored opponents 202-159 over the course of the tournament. 'We came to finish our group play strong,' said player Fabian Romo. 'But our focus is quarterfinals. Now, whoever it may be, we just have to make sure that we’re ready.' The Americans' quarterfinal opponent depends on the outcome of matches Sunday and Monday but France is a possibility. 'If it turns out to [be] France, what a great environment, said American veteran Nate Hinze. 'I mean, it has been fantastic already. Paris is doing a fantastic job filling the stadium and making it loud. The opportunity to play a host country is always fun, we did it in (London) 2012 for a bronze medal. We did it in 2020 in Tokyo so it’s always fun to play the host country.'	https://www.voanews.com/a/iranians-loom-over-paralympic-sitting-volleyball-competition/7767481.html	2024-09-01T13:35:00-07:00
