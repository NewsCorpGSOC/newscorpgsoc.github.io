Sorrow, frustration as US condemns deportation of Uyghurs to China	Washington — For Sweden-based independent Uyghur researcher Nyrola Elima, Feb. 27, 2025, stands as a day of deep sorrow. After years of relentless work to help resettle more than 40 Uyghurs held in Thailand’s immigration facilities since 2014, her efforts came to a devastating close Thursday when all of them were loaded onto buses and put on a flight to the city of Kashgar in China’s northwest region of Xinjiang, home to 12 million Uyghurs. 'I don’t want to speak right now,' Elima said in a trembling voice message to VOA. 'I’ve talked to them so much over the past two-and-a-half years. Now, I feel like someone who’s lost loved ones and somehow survived. This pain – it’s more than I can bear.' Just two weeks ago, Elima testified before a judge in Thailand on behalf of the 43 Uyghur men detained in a Thai prison. A glimmer of hope emerged for them when the court set a March 27 date to hear from the Thai Immigration Bureau on why the Uyghurs were detained for nearly 11 years. The Thai government’s decision to deport the Uyghurs before that hearing has sent shockwaves through communities of Uyghurs overseas and rights advocates. U.S. Secretary of State Marco Rubio condemned the deportation and said in a statement, 'we are alarmed by this action,' and added, 'We call on Chinese authorities to provide full access to verify the well-being of the returned Uyghurs on a regular basis. The Thai government must insist and fully verify continuously that Chinese authorities protect the Uyghurs’ human rights.' ‘Complex factors’ 'On February 27th, 40 Chinese nationals who had illegally entered Thailand were repatriated to Xinjiang, China on a chartered flight of China Civil Aviation Company [Southern Airlines],' posted the Chinese Embassy in Bangkok on Facebook. The embassy’s post continued, 'a concrete measure between China and Thailand in collaboratively tackling immigration crimes and protecting the rights and interest of Chinese nationals in accordance with the two countries' laws and international protocols,' blaming the group’s decade-long detention on 'complex factors in international relations.' Thai Deputy Prime Minister and Defense Minister Phumtham Wechayachai defended the move Thursday, telling reporters that successive Thai governments had sought third-country resettlement, informing the U.S. and EU of stalled efforts. 'This is a beautiful, nice ending for them, for their families. And Thailand is no longer burdened,' he declared. 'Thailand should even get praises for handling this issue decisively for the best interest of humanity and them [the Uyghurs]. It is a cause for happiness as they are free from detention and reunite with their parents, brothers and sisters and children and wives.' At a Thursday press conference, Thai officials showcased photos and videos of a few Uyghurs reuniting with their families when they arrived in China. Elima, responded to the images with a post on X, saying, 'So far, only these 3 men and their families have been used as propaganda material. I don’t believe all 40 men's families were summoned to Kashgar – some have relatives who are deceased or imprisoned,' the post said. 'The whereabouts of the remaining 37 individuals and their families remain unknown,' casting doubt on the legitimacy of the reunion. Julie Millsap, a U.S.-based activist who has urged Washington to intervene, posted on X, '...can't explain how painful it is to watch them be used for propaganda, knowing how terrified they must be. Our brave men. Brave enough to seek a new life. How we’ve let you down.' Until this week, 48 Uyghurs were detained in Thailand and languished in legal limbo despite their pleas for asylum. They were among more than 350 men, women, and children intercepted by Thai police in 2014 after being smuggled from China’s Yunnan province by human traffickers. A year later, Bangkok and Ankara agreed to resettle more than 170 Uyghurs – mostly women and children – in Turkey. Yet weeks later, Thailand deported 109 mostly male asylum seekers to China. In interviews with VOA, one resettled Uyghur who wished to remain anonymous for fear of repercussions to his family in China, described the escape from Xinjiang’s tightening repression. 'We had to put our lives in harm’s way,' citing China’s refusal to issue passports as a reason of their flight without documents in 2013 and 2014. Their stories echo findings from the U.N. Human Rights Office and groups like Amnesty International, which estimates that since 2017, more than one million people – mostly Uyghurs – have been confined in Xinjiang’s internment camps. China has described these facilities as 'Vocational and Skills Training Centers' to counter extremism, but a 2022 U.N. report cited 'credible' evidence of torture, forced labor, and inhumane conditions, based on survivor accounts – allegations Beijing has repeatedly rejected as fabrications. Since 2014, of the 53 remaining Uyghur detainees in Thailand, five received prison sentences for attempting to escape. Five others, including two minors, died in custody. Chinese state media reported Thursday that forty Uyghurs were just deported to China, leaving the whereabouts of eight Uyghurs detained in Thailand unknown. 'Even when other countries offered resettlement, Thailand refused to release them,' Elima told VOA. 'They applied for UNHCR [U.N. refugee agency] protection, but UNHCR has no access to them. They are barred from seeing their families, lawyers, [and] UNHCR. They are not even allowed to be bailed,' which VOA confirmed with UNHCR. 'This is a clear violation of the principle of non-refoulement and the Royal Thai Government’s obligations under international law,' said UNHCR’s Assistant High Commissioner for Protection Ruvendrini Menikdiwela. Non-refoulement, a cornerstone of international law, bars returning people to persecution—a duty Thailand holds under the U.N. Convention Against Torture, despite not signing the 1951 Refugee Convention. Sophie Richardson, former China director at Human Rights Watch, blasted the U.N.’s response on X as 'inexcusably weak or non-existent,' arguing it enabled 'China and Thailand govts’ blatant violations of human rights law.'

Pakistan's opposition alliance demands elections, political prisoners' release	ISLAMABAD — An alliance of opposition parties in Pakistan called for new national elections Thursday, accusing Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif’s government of suppressing political rivals, curtailing dissent and violating human rights. The Tehreek-i-Tahaffuz-i-Ayeen-i-Pakistan, or the Movement to Safeguard the Constitution, concluded a two-day conference in Islamabad by demanding the release of all political prisoners and rejecting the outcome of parliamentary elections held last year. 'The results of the rigged February 8, 2024, elections bear direct responsibility for the country's prevailing political, economic, and social crisis,' the declaration stated. It asserted that Pakistan’s parliament lacked 'moral, political, or legal standing' because it stemmed from a manipulated vote, and 'the only way to resolve the current political crisis is through free, fair, and transparent elections.' Sharif’s government, believed to be backed by the powerful military, rejects opposition allegations, claiming they are aimed at hindering efforts it is making to reform and stabilize the economy. Leaders from imprisoned former Prime Minister Imran Khan’s Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf party, journalists and civil society representatives were also among the attendees of Thursday’s conference. The conference occurred a day after U.S. Republican Representative Joe Wilson announced on X that he was 'nearly finished drafting' a bill seeking 'to restore democracy in Pakistan.' US concerns Wilson wrote that his proposed bill 'mandates a 30-day determination of sanctions' on Pakistan’s military chief, General Asim Munir, and 'reviews all generals & gov[ernment] officials & their families for sanctions.' He did not provide further details. On Tuesday, Wilson and Republican Representative August Pfluger wrote a letter to U.S. Secretary of State Marco Rubio, urging him to engage with 'the military regime of Pakistan to free Imran Khan.' VOA contacted the spokesperson for the Pakistani Foreign Ministry for a response to U.S. lawmakers’ claims but did not receive an immediate reply. Michael Kugelman, who directs the South Asia Institute at the Wilson Center in Washington, cautioned that Wilson’s proposed bill could be troubling for Pakistan. 'It’s a really big deal if it’s passed. It’s one thing to condemn the assaults on democracy in Pakistan, but it’s a whole new ballgame to threaten sanctions,' Kugelman told VOA in written comments. 'Of course, Congressional action does not represent U.S. policy, but the leadership in Pakistan would not want to see the broader mood on Pakistan in Washington reflected in this way,' he said. Khan's removal from power Khan has repeatedly accused Munir of being behind his prosecutions and crackdown on his political party. The 72-year-old former prime minister was removed from power in April 2022 after failing to secure a vote of confidence from parliament, a move widely viewed as an attempt by the powerful military to silence a popular politician. His ouster plunged the South Asian nation of more than 240 million people into ongoing political turmoil, undermining Sharif’s attempts to attract foreign and domestic investment to overcome economic woes. In August 2023, the former cricket star-turned-deposed prime minister was convicted on contested graft charges and jailed. Khan remains embroiled in dozens of other lawsuits that he rejects as politically motivated and alleges the military is behind them to keep him from returning to power. Khan accuses the Pakistani military of manipulating last year’s elections to prevent his party from winning the vote and enabling Sharif to form a coalition government, charges the military and Sharif reject. Authorities have also carried out a crackdown on the jailed leader’s party, rounding up hundreds of his workers and leaders, including women, with many of them remaining in custody for nearly two years without being formally charged.	https://www.voanews.com/a/pakistan-opposition-alliance-demands-elections-political-prisoners-release/7990414.html	2025-02-27T10:24:59-08:00	
Israel's army admits failures in staving off Oct. 7, 2023, Hamas attack	TEL AVIV, ISRAEL — An investigation by the Israeli military has determined that U.S.-designated terror group Hamas was able to carry out the deadliest attack in Israeli history on Oct. 7, 2023, because the much more powerful Israeli army misjudged the militant group's intentions and underestimated its capabilities. The findings, released Thursday, could pressure Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu to launch a widely demanded broader inquiry to examine the political decision-making that preceded the attack. Many Israelis believe the failures of Oct. 7 extend beyond the military and blame Netanyahu for a failed policy of deterrence and containment in the years leading up to the attack. That approach included allowing Qatar to send suitcases of cash into Gaza and sidelining Hamas' rival, the internationally recognized Palestinian Authority. The prime minister has not taken responsibility, saying he will answer tough questions only after the war, which has been paused for nearly six weeks by a tenuous ceasefire. Despite public pressure, including from the families of the roughly 1,200 people killed in the Oct. 7 attack and the 251 taken as hostages into Gaza, Netanyahu has resisted calls for a commission of inquiry. The military's main findings were that the region's most powerful and sophisticated military misread Hamas' intentions, underestimated its capabilities and was wholly unprepared for the surprise attack in the early morning hours of a major Jewish holiday. The military's findings are in line with past conclusions reached by officials and analysts. The military released only a summary of the report and military officials outlined its findings. 'Oct. 7 was a complete failure,' said one military official, who spoke on condition of anonymity in line with regulations. A central misconception was that Hamas, which seized control of Gaza from the Palestinian Authority in 2007, was more interested in governing the territory than fighting Israel, the inquiry found. The military also misjudged its capabilities. Military planners had envisioned that, at worst, Hamas could stage a ground invasion from up to eight border points, the official said. In fact, Hamas had more than 60 attack routes. Intelligence assessed in the aftermath of the attack has shown Hamas came close to staging the offensive on three earlier occasions but delayed it for unknown reasons, the official said. The official said that in the hours before the attack, there were signs that something was amiss, including when Hamas switched their phones over to Israeli SIM cards. The perception that Hamas did not want war guided decision makers away from taking action that might have thwarted the attack. The Israeli military official said intelligence shows that Yahya Sinwar, a mastermind of the Oct. 7 attack who was killed last October, had begun planning it as early as 2017. With the military off guard on a holiday weekend, Hamas launched a heavy wave of rockets that allowed thousands of fighters to burst through the security fence or fly over it on hang gliders. They knocked out surveillance cameras and quickly overwhelmed hundreds of soldiers stationed along the border. From there they advanced to key highway intersections and attacked troops dispatched to the area, including some senior officers, disrupting the military's command and control, according to a second military official, who also spoke on condition of anonymity. For the first three hours after the attack, Hamas marauded through border communities and a music festival with little resistance. That was when most of the 251 hostages were taken and most people were killed, the official said. The official said the chaos led to friendly fire incidents, although he said there were not many, without disclosing a figure. It took hours for the military to regain control and days until the area was fully cleared of militants. According to the first official, the report blamed the military for being overconfident in its knowledge and not showing enough doubt in its core concepts and beliefs. It did not place blame on any individual soldiers or officers, but is likely to pave the way for a reckoning in the military and eventual dismissals. Some high-ranking officers have already resigned, including the former head of military intelligence and Israel's top general, Lt. Gen. Herzi Halevi, who steps down next week.	https://www.voanews.com/a/israel-s-army-admits-failures-in-staving-off-oct-7-2023-hamas-attack/7990394.html	2025-02-27T10:04:30-08:00	
As US tariffs expand, Chinese firms' workarounds come into focus	WASHINGTON — As U.S. President Donald Trump moves forward with an expanding net of tariffs, including an additional 10% for Chinese imports starting next week, industry insiders and experts say closing existing loopholes and workarounds that companies use to avoid trade taxes is also key. One practice that so far has helped companies from China — and others — to avoid being hit with tariffs is transshipment, or the transfer of goods to a second country, where the 'Made in China' label is switched for another. Berwick Offray, a ribbon manufacturer in the northeastern state of Pennsylvania, has first-hand experience with the practice. Founded in 1945, the company prides itself on its pledge to keep its products 'Made in the USA' and its position as one of the largest manufacturers of ribbons in the world. Earlier this month, the company sued a U.S. importer, TriMar Ribbon, for allegedly buying ribbons produced in China that were shipped to the United States through India to illegally avoid being subject to tariffs. Ribbons made in China are cheaper and sold at below market value prices in the United States. 'The current allegations allege that TriMar imported ribbons from China into the United States through transshipment in India, and did not declare the correct country of origin upon entry,' said a notice issued from U.S. Customs and Border Protection, or CBP, when the agency agreed to investigate the case. Daniel Pickard, an expert on international trade and an attorney at Buchanan Ingersoll & Rooney, which represents Berwick Offray, said there have been numerous cases of transshipment, especially when it comes to products from China. 'We have assisted several clients in submitting allegations to CBP against importers of products that have been transshipped from China through third countries such as Thailand, India and Canada,' Pickard told VOA. 'Our clients typically are the U.S. manufacturers of those products that are competing against the Chinese imports that are engaged in evasion of duties.' According to CBP data, there are currently 221 investigations of Chinese-made products suspected of transshipment tariff evasion. Tariffs and loopholes In early February, the Trump administration rolled out 10% blanket tariffs on all Chinese goods. On March 4, Chinese imports will face an additional 10% tariff. While Trump has worked to reduce potential workarounds, including his executive order on reciprocal tariffs on trading partners, U.S. lawmakers have introduced measures to close the loopholes that would allow Chinese products to evade the president’s increased fees. Republican Senator Rick Scott introduced the Stopping Adversarial Tariff Evasion Act on Jan. 31, aiming to strengthen enforcement mechanisms to ensure foreign manufacturers comply with customs and duties. The legislation builds on efforts from Congresswoman Ashley Hinson, who introduced a bill in December intended to hold China accountable for tariff evasion by establishing a task force and reporting mechanisms to deal with instances of financial crime. Jayant Menon, a senior fellow at the ISEAS Yusof Ishak Institute in Singapore, said the second Trump presidency will foster even more efforts to monitor tariff evasion and inspect products for compliance. 'While it is increasingly difficult to determine where a product is really made these days, given increasing globalization and widespread production under global supply chain, increased scrutiny can help with identifying bypass attempts,' Menon said. 'If bypass attempts are suspected, rightly or wrongly, then the country as a whole may be penalized with new tariffs,' he said. Pickard said he expects more investigations will be launched by the new administration. He also looks forward to more efforts to counter discriminatory practices affecting U.S. companies. 'We anticipate CBP will increase its enforcement efforts as to the widespread customs fraud involving Chinese products,' he said. Many stakeholders in the industry, Pickard said, are hoping to see these issues met with criminal prosecutions.	https://www.voanews.com/a/as-us-tariffs-expand-chinese-firms-workarounds-come-into-focus/7990360.html	2025-02-27T09:42:55-08:00	
Experts: Europe could not replace US as guarantor of Ukraine's security	Friedrich Merz, who is set to become Germany’s chancellor after his Christian Democratic Union party won the country’s Feb. 23 parliamentary elections, has said that Europe may have to establish an 'independent' defense capability because the U.S. has become 'largely indifferent' to Europe’s fate. A top priority of any new European defense mechanism would be protecting Ukraine, now in its fourth year of trying to fight off the Russian invasion. The country has survived thus far in large part because of a heavy flow of U.S. military aid provided by then-president Joe Biden. New President Donald Trump has said he wants to end the war and recoup Washington’s costs, going so far as to demand Ukraine give the U.S. access to the country’s mineral wealth in return for the tens of billions of dollars the U.S. has spent on Ukraine’s defense. Voice of America’s Russian Service asked experts to assess the ability of European countries to help Ukraine to withstand, both militarily and economically, the Russian invasion, and to rebuild its destroyed infrastructure. Andriy Zolotarev, director of the Third Sector Analytical Center, a Kyiv-based think tank, told VOA that U.S. military aid is uniquely important to Ukraine’s defense. 'In particular, the U.S. has huge stockpiles of weapons, they are a supplier of critically important intelligence information,' he said. 'All the European countries taken together do not have satellite groupings like the United States. In addition, the U.S. has extremely important and truly irreplaceable types of weapons for Ukraine — Patriot [missile defense] systems, ATACMS [long-range guided missiles], HIMARS [multiple launch rocket systems], as well as spare parts for armored vehicles and artillery systems, and much more. This cannot be discounted in any way.' According to Zolotarev, while Europe produces advanced weapons and other military equipment, the European Union together with Great Britain can only partially compensate for what Ukraine would lose if the U.S. stopped providing assistance. 'Their efforts can soften the negative effect, but will not avoid unpleasant consequences,' he said. 'This will simply delay the inevitable end. Europe is currently far from being in the best economic and military shape.' Mark Feigin, a self-exiled Russian human rights activist and former lawyer, noted in an interview with VOA that while Europe includes two countries with nuclear arsenals, Great Britain and France, and is collectively far richer than Russia, the continent’s military potential is hampered by the fact that it is not 'a single entity.' 'The strength of the United States is that it makes this or that decision in a centralized manner, which is then consistently implemented,' he said. 'Europe's potential is dispersed ... In addition, the political situation in the EU countries is very volatile. ... All this keeps the Europeans from effectively using their obvious advantages [in the confrontation with Russia].' Rebuilding Ukraine Experts believe that Ukraine’s post-war reconstruction will ultimately be financed by private European investment. According to some estimates, that may carry a $500 billion to $2 trillion price tag. However, the longer the war continues, the more difficult the financing of Ukraine's reconstruction becomes. But the main question remains — who will pay for it? 'Well, ideally, it should be Russian money,' said economist Alexey Bayer. 'It should be either some reparations or some taxes, like on Russian exports, on the export of oil and gas and other minerals.' However, Bayer told VOA it is 'unlikely' that any Russian government, 'even a post-Putin one, will agree to voluntarily pay reparations to Ukraine.' While Russian assets frozen in Western banks — including tens of billions of dollars in foreign currency and gold reserves held by Russia’s central bank — could be used to rebuild Ukraine, that would require their complete expropriation. Many experts say neither the U.S. government nor European governments would take such a step, despite the heated discussion of this option in the press. 'It’s one thing to freeze assets; it’s another thing to confiscate assets,' said Alexander Cooley, a professor of political science at Barnard College. 'This is the legal struggle at the moment that’s happening in the U.S. and across EU and Western countries, and this is being constantly litigated, and it is uncertain territory. … I think you will find the Trump administration less favorable to seizing Russian assets, especially as it is moving to settle the conflict, and one of the primary Russian asks is the unfreezing of their assets and the removal of most of the sanctions,' he said. Cliff Kupchan, chairperson of the Eurasia Group, a New York-based political risk consultancy, agreed that Europe is unlikely to support seizing frozen Russian assets. 'I think the Europeans are going to remain averse to the idea of breaking international norms on reserves and fear that Russia will then, as I think they would, seize Western governmental assets and Western private assets,' he said. And while Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy and various Western officials and experts have called for a 'Marshall Plan' to rebuild Ukraine — a reference to the massive U.S. aid program to rebuild Western Europe after World War II — Kupchan said a U.S. initiative on that scale for Ukraine’s reconstruction is unlikely. 'Right now, the U.S. is not only not interested, but it’s actively opposed to the idea. Trump thinks that Ukraine is yet another example of Europe free-riding on American money.' Still, Kupchan said European investment for reconstruction eventually will flow into Ukraine, especially if there is a ceasefire that ultimately holds and there are Western peacekeeping forces to ensure it. 'I don’t think it will be that slow,' he said in reference to Ukraine’s post-war reconstruction. 'As fast as it would be if there were a Marshall Plan? No. Stagnant? Also no.'	https://www.voanews.com/a/experts-europe-could-not-replace-us-as-guarantor-of-ukraine-security/7990323.html	2025-02-27T09:07:39-08:00	
Katy Perry, Gayle King to join Blue Origin spaceflight	CAPE CANAVERAL, FLORIDA — Katy Perry and Gayle King are headed to space with Jeff Bezos’ fiancee, Lauren Sanchez, and three other women. Bezos’ rocket company, Blue Origin, announced the all-female celebrity crew on Thursday. Sanchez, a helicopter pilot and former TV journalist, picked the crew who will join her on a 10-minute spaceflight from west Texas, the company said. They will blast off sometime this spring aboard a New Shepard rocket. No launch date was given. Blue Origin has flown tourists on short hops to space since 2021. Some passengers have gotten free rides, while others have paid a hefty sum to experience weightlessness. It was not immediately known who’s footing the bill for this upcoming flight. Sanchez invited singer Perry and TV journalist King, as well as former NASA rocket scientist Aisha Bowe, research scientist Amanda Nguyen and movie producer Kerianne Flynn. This will be Blue Origin’s 11th human spaceflight. Bezos climbed aboard with his brother for the inaugural flight.	https://www.voanews.com/a/katy-perry-gayle-king-to-join-blue-origin-spaceflight/7990239.html	2025-02-27T08:38:21-08:00	
UN rights chief warns of 'mass deaths from famine' in Sudan	GENEVA — The U.N. human rights chief warned of the risk of a further escalation of the war in Sudan on Thursday and said there was a growing risk of deaths from starvation on a wide scale. Volker Türk's warning came a day after the U.N. World Food Program has temporarily stopped distributing food aid in a famine-struck camp for displaced people in Sudan's North Darfur amid escalating violence. 'Sudan is a powder keg, on the verge of a further explosion into chaos, and at increasing risk of atrocity crimes and mass deaths from famine,' he told the Human Rights Council in Geneva. 'The danger of escalation has never been higher.' War erupted in April 2023 amid a power struggle between the Sudanese Armed Forces and the paramilitary Rapid Support Forces ahead of a planned transition to civilian rule, triggering the world's largest displacement and hunger crisis. Already, famine conditions have been reported in at least five locations in Sudan, including displacement camps in Darfur, according to the United Nations. Türk said that recent moves by the RSF towards establishing governing authority in areas it controls were likely to 'further entrench divisions and the risk of continued hostilities.' He also noted continued supplies of weapons to the warring parties from outside the country, including more advanced arms.	https://www.voanews.com/a/un-rights-chief-warns-of-mass-deaths-from-famine-in-sudan/7990219.html	2025-02-27T08:35:57-08:00	
Outcry builds as Thailand deports Uyghurs to China after 10 years in detention	BANGKOK — The United Nations led criticism Thursday of Thailand’s government over its deportation to China of 40 Uyghurs held for more than a decade in detention in Bangkok. The deportation came despite warnings that the Uyghurs face persecution and the risk of torture if handed over to Chinese authorities. U.N. human rights chief Volker Türk has called the deportation 'a clear violation of international human rights laws and standards.' The deportation 'violates the principle of non-refoulement for which there is a complete prohibition in cases where there is a real risk of torture, ill-treatment, or other irreparable harm upon their return,' Türk said in a statement. Campaigners say the fate of the group, which had been held at an immigration detention center in the Thai capital and unable to apply for asylum in Thailand, highlights a failure of Thai authorities to meet their own human rights commitments — as well as the reach of China to get its allies to act on its behalf. Thailand’s police chief late Thursday confirmed 40 Uyghurs had been sent on a chartered jet to China after images emerged before dawn of several police trucks with blacked-out windows rushing from the detention center to the airport. 'The Chinese government sent a letter to the Thai government stating their intention to look after the safety of this group of Uyghur people,' Police General Kitrat Phanphet told reporters. 'They reiterated that they will sincerely take care of their safety, their accommodation, as well as allow their family members of these Uyghurs to welcome them home,' he said. Uyghurs in China Uyghurs, a Turkic-speaking Muslim minority from China’s remote western region of Xinjiang, have faced oppression by Beijing that governments, including the United States and U.K., have described as genocide. Since 2017, China has put more than a million Uyghurs into internment camps, according to Amnesty International. In 2022, the U.N. High Commissioner for Human Rights said Beijing’s treatment of ethnic minorities in Xinjiang may constitute 'crimes against humanity.' Uyghurs fleeing China to Thailand have long been a delicate issue for the Southeast Asian kingdom. Successive governments have faced intense pressure from Beijing to return them. In July 2015 more than 100 detainees were deported to China against their will. A few weeks later, a bomb blast killed 20 people at a downtown shrine in Bangkok — an attack some security experts have linked to Uyghur diaspora groups. The Thai government has never publicly confirmed that connection. Until Thursday, 53 remaining Uyghurs were languishing in a legal limbo in detention since that bomb attack, despite pleas for asylum. Five died in that time. It was not immediately clear what has happened to the eight who were not confirmed among the 40 sent to China on Thursday. The Chinese Embassy in Bangkok said that '40 Chinese nationals' were deported after a decade detained in Thailand 'due to complex international considerations.' 'This is a formal measure between China and Thailand in combating smuggling and protecting the rights and interests of Chinese citizens in accordance with the laws of both countries,' it said in a statement, promising to return them 'back to their normal lives.' Criticism at home and abroad After years of lobbying, Thailand in January joined the U.N. Human Rights Council for a three-year term. The deportation has raised concerns over Thailand’s priorities. Ruvendrini Menikdiwela, assistant high commissioner for protection at the UNHCR — the UN’s refugee arm — said the deportation of the 40 was a 'clear violation of the principle of non-refoulement' and admonished the Thai government for breaching its 'obligations under international law.' While Thai Prime Minister Paetongtarn Shinawatra refused to be drawn into the issue, opposition lawmakers led condemnation. 'Today I feel utterly upset and sad,' Kannavee Suebsang, a member of parliament for the Fair Party who was also a field officer with UNHCR, told parliament. 'But I will not cry for the Uyghur brothers and sisters. … Instead, I will cry for the inhumane handling of this government for pushing these people back to face calamity.' Shinawatra traveled to China earlier this month promising tighter cooperation to crack down on cross-border crimes, principally a massive scam crisis. But concerns have been raised about what other deals may have been struck. Rangsiman Rome, a prominent opposition lawmaker, said, 'Deporting these Uyghurs to China violates the kingdom’s anti-torture law — which is our own domestic law, as well as international law' due to the risks they face in China. Rights campaigners who have urged Thailand to provide sanctuary to the Uyghurs said Thailand has done the 'unthinkable' in sending them back to China, where they can face torture. 'This massive human rights violation blows apart any pretense the Prime Minister Paetongtarn Shinawatra and her Thai government has made to be a rights-respecting member of the U.N. Human Rights Council,' said Phil Robertson, director of Asia Human Rights and Labor Advocates. 'The Thai government should resign its seat on the Council to show responsibility for its outrageous and unacceptable action,' he said.	https://www.voanews.com/a/outcry-builds-as-thailand-deports-uyghurs-to-china-after-10-years-in-detention/7990187.html	2025-02-27T07:54:39-08:00	
China flexes military muscle in Indo-Pacific, testing US and allies	TAIPEI, TAIWAN — China has held a series of live-fire military drills across the Indo-Pacific region over the past week, from the Taiwan Strait to the Tasman Sea. Analysts say the exercises, which included 'extremely capable' weapons systems, were aimed at testing the United States and regional countries’ responses to military threats. 'China understands there is a strategic window to demonstrate its ability to conduct military exercises [in areas near some U.S. allies] because the bandwidth of the Trump administration is spread quite thin by global issues that it has to deal with,' said Stephen Nagy, a professor of politics and international studies at Tokyo's International Christian University. 'These drills are predatory because when China senses gaps, it will move in and fill those vacuums,' he told VOA by phone. On Wednesday, the People’s Liberation Army, or PLA, conducted 'shooting training' in waters 74 kilometers (46 miles) off Taiwan’s southwestern coast, prompting Taipei to deploy military aircraft and naval vessels to monitor the situation. In addition to the 'shooting training,' which Taiwanese authorities said was unannounced and posed threats to commercial flights and shipping, the Chinese military also conducted a 'joint combat readiness drill' in waters and airspace near Taiwan, deploying 45 Chinese military aircraft and 14 naval vessels. 'During this period it even blatantly violated international practice by setting up a drills area in waters about 40 nautical miles (74 kilometers) off the coast ... without prior warning, claiming that it would carry out 'shooting training,'' Taiwan’s defense ministry said in a statement released on Wednesday. While the Chinese defense ministry has yet to comment on the military drills, the Chinese Communist Party’s fourth-ranked official, Wang Huning, 'called for resolute efforts to advance the cause of national reunification' during an annual meeting on works related to Taiwan on Tuesday. During the Chinese defense ministry’s monthly press conference Thursday, spokesperson Wu Qian described the 'shooting training' near Taiwan as 'routine drills.' He added that Taiwanese authorities’ criticism was 'pure hype.' 'We request that they stop playing this kind of game to attract interest,' he said. Gulf of Tonkin and Tasman Sea In addition to Taiwan, the PLA conducted live-fire drills in the Gulf of Tonkin near Vietnam and the Tasman Sea between Australia and New Zealand. The live-fire drills carried out by three Chinese naval vessels in the Tasman Sea prompted Canberra and Wellington to express serious concerns. New Zealand’s defense minister, Judith Collins, said the Chinese vessels were equipped with 'extremely capable' weapons, such as anti-ship ballistic missiles that could potentially hit Australia. 'We’ve certainly never seen a task group of this capability undertaking this sort of work. It’s certainly a change,' she told Radio New Zealand on Monday, adding that the Chinese military didn’t inform Wellington about the planned exercises. Meanwhile, New Zealand’s foreign minister, Winston Peters, told Chinese Foreign Minister Wang Yi during a meeting in Beijing that the naval drills were 'a failure' in the bilateral relationship and Wellington hopes it could be 'corrected into the future.' Despite concerns expressed by New Zealand and Australia, the Chinese defense ministry said Canberra 'has unjustly criticized China and deliberately exaggerated the issue, and we are astonished and strongly dissatisfied with this.' ‘Disruptive and destabilizing’ Some experts describe the Chinese live-fire drills as 'disruptive and destabilizing' and say the activities show Beijing has no intention of improving relations with countries in the Indo-Pacific region through dialogue. 'It’s difficult to fathom why China would conduct military-to-military dialogue with Australia after a five-year gap and then conduct live-fire exercises as far from China’s shores,' Drew Thompson, a senior fellow at the S. Rajaratnam School of International Studies in Singapore and a former Pentagon official, told VOA by phone. 'It sends a very mixed signal and the message is that China is choosing violence, not peace,' he added. Alessio Patalano, professor of war and strategy in East Asia at King's College London, said these exercises also reflect 'a great sense of maturity' in the Chinese military’s capabilities. 'They've been able to conduct repeated exercise on top of a very intense daily activity, particularly in areas around Taiwan,' he told VOA by phone. While regional countries are alarmed by the Chinese military drills, Thompson said they need to recognize that their 'diplomatic efforts' have failed to deter China’s aggression and start investing more in their defense capabilities. 'For these countries to ensure their security, they need to invest much more heavily in their own defense,' he told VOA. In an interview with New Zealand’s 1News on Sunday, New Zealand’s Collins said the country needed to 'spend a lot more' in defense. In addition to increasing defense spending, Nagy in Japan said regional countries should consider documenting and highlighting the Chinese military’s aggressive behavior in their nearby areas. Efforts to document and 'share activities that the Chinese military engages in with the global community does put China in a position where they have to explain their bad behavior, which is not something they do very well,' he told VOA. Since the Trump administration remains focused on facilitating peace negotiations between Russia and Ukraine, Patalano said he expects China to keep conducting 'short-term, not-too-much-pre-announced' military exercises across the Indo-Pacific in the coming months.	https://www.voanews.com/a/china-flexes-military-muscle-in-indo-pacific-testing-us-and-allies/7990197.html	2025-02-27T07:44:12-08:00	
Andrew Tate, accused of rape, trafficking in Romania, leaves for US	BUCHAREST, ROMANIA — Influencer brothers Andrew and Tristan Tate, who are charged with human trafficking in Romania, left for the United States after authorities lifted travel restrictions imposed as part of the case, an official said Thursday. The brothers — who are dual U.S.-British citizens and have millions of online followers — were arrested in late 2022 and indicted last year on charges they participated in a criminal ring that lured women to Romania, where they were sexually exploited. Andrew Tate was also charged with rape. They deny the allegations. In December, a court ruled that the case couldn’t go to trial because of multiple legal and procedural irregularities on the part of the prosecutors. The case, however, remained open, and there is also another ongoing investigation against them in Romania. Romania’s anti-organized crime agency, DIICOT, said in a statement Thursday that prosecutors approved a request to change the travel restrictions on the Tates but didn't say who made the request. The brothers are still required to appear before judicial authorities when summoned. 'The defendants have been warned that deliberately violating these obligations may result in judicial control being replaced with a stricter deprivation of liberty measure,' the statement said. Andrew Tate, 38, a former professional kickboxer and self-described misogynist who has amassed more than 10 million followers on X, has repeatedly claimed that prosecutors in Romania have no evidence against him and that there is a political conspiracy to silence him. He and Tristan Tate, 36, are vocal supporters of U.S. President Donald Trump. The Tates’ departure came after Foreign Minister Emil Hurezeanu said this month that an official in the Trump administration expressed interest in the brothers’ case at the Munich Security Conference. The minister insisted no pressure was applied to lift restrictions on the Tates after a Financial Times report on the meeting caused a stir in Romania. The Bucharest Court of Appeal’s decision that the Tate case could not proceed was a huge setback for DIICOT, but it didn’t mean the defendants could walk free, and the case hasn’t been closed. Last August, DIICOT also launched a second case against the brothers, investigating allegations of human trafficking, the trafficking of minors, sexual intercourse with a minor, influencing statements and money laundering. They have denied those charges as well. The Tate brothers’ legal battles aren't limited to Romania. Late last year, a U.K. court ruled that police can seize more than $3.3 million to cover years of unpaid taxes from the pair and freeze some of their accounts. Andrew Tate called it 'outright theft' and said it was 'a coordinated attack on anyone who dares to challenge the system.' In March, the Tate brothers appeared at the Bucharest Court of Appeal in a separate case after U.K. authorities issued arrest warrants over allegations of sexual aggression in a case dating back to 2012-2015. The appeals court granted the U.K. request to extradite the Tates, but only after legal proceedings in Romania have concluded.	https://www.voanews.com/a/andrew-tate-accused-of-rape-trafficking-in-romania-leaves-for-us/7990115.html	2025-02-27T06:49:21-08:00	
Imprisoned Kurdish leader urges PKK to disarm and disband as part of peace effort with Turkey	Istanbul — Imprisoned Kurdish leader Abdullah Ocalan called on his militant group on Thursday to lay down its arms and dissolve as part of a new bid to end a four-decade long conflict that has claimed tens of thousands of lives. In a message from his prison on an island off Istanbul on Thursday, Ocalan said the Kurdistan Workers' Party, or PKK, should hold a congress and decide to disband. 'Convene your congress and make a decision. All groups must lay their arms and the PKK must dissolve itself,' Ocalan said, according to a message that was relayed by pro-Kurdish party politicians who visited Ocalan earlier in the day. Ocalan's momentous announcement is part of a new effort for peace between the group and the Turkish state, that was initiated in October by President Recep Tayyip Erdogan's coalition partner, Devlet Bahceli. The far-right politician suggested Ocalan could be granted parole if his group renounces violence and disbands. Ocalan, 75, has been imprisoned on the island of Imrali, off Istanbul, since 1999 after being convicted of treason. Despite his incarceration, he continues to wield significant influence over the PKK. The group's leadership is widely expected to heed any call Ocalan makes, although some factions within the group could resist, analysts say. The peace effort comes at a time when Erdogan may need support from the DEM party in parliament to enact a new constitution that could allow him to stay in power. The Turkish Constitution doesn't allow Erdogan, who has been in power since 2003 as prime minister and later as president, to run for office again unless an early election is called — something that would also require the support of the pro-Kurdish party. The DEM party has long pressed for greater democracy in Turkey and rights for the country's Kurdish population, and also to improve conditions for the imprisoned Ocalan. Founded by Ocalan in 1978, the PKK has led an insurgency in Turkey's southeast since 1984. The group is considered a terrorist organization by Turkey and its Western allies. Previous peace efforts with the PKK have ended with failure — the most recent in 2015. Even amid the latest peace efforts, Erdogan's government has widened a crackdown on the opposition, arresting journalists and politicians. Several elected Kurdish mayors have been ousted from office and replaced with state-appointed officials. Thursday's meeting was the third time DEM party officials have met with Ocalan as part of the peace efforts. The officials have also met with Selahattin Demirtas, an imprisoned former pro-Kurdish party leader, and traveled to Iraq for talks with Kurdish leaders there.	https://www.voanews.com/a/imprisoned-kurdish-leader-urges-pkk-to-disarm-and-disband-as-part-of-peace-effort-with-turkey/7990140.html	2025-02-27T06:47:18-08:00	
On Moscow streets, Russians welcome thaw in relations with Washington	Anticipation is growing in Russia for a summit - yet to be scheduled - between U.S. President Donald Trump and Vladimir Putin. On the streets of Moscow, many Russians welcome what they see as a thaw in relations with Washington, and what some hope is the beginning of the end of their country's isolation from the West. Jonathan Spier narrates this report.	https://www.voanews.com/a/on-moscow-streets-russians-welcome-thaw-in-relations-with-washington/7990118.html	2025-02-27T06:40:27-08:00	
Ethiopia PM visits Somalia as neighbors try to improve relations	Washington — Ethiopian Prime Minister Abiy Ahmed met with Somali President Hassan Sheikh Mohamud in Mogadishu Thursday, as their nations try to mend relations strained by Ethiopia’s deal for sea access with Somaliland – a breakaway republic Somalia considers part of its territory. Abiy flew into the Somali capital Thursday, as Somali forces, backed by African Union peacekeepers, beefed up security at Mogadishu’s Aden Ade International Airport and along the road leading to the presidential place. Mogadishu’s main roads were closed, and vehicular traffic was restricted. VOA reporters said that Ethiopian flags were flying at the airport, as the Somali National Music Band and traditional folklore dancers greeted Abiy at the airport. After meeting at the Somali presidential palace, the two leaders issued a joint statement affirming their commitment to enhancing cooperation for mutual benefit. 'This visit follows consecutive engagements over the past few months and reinforces the normalization of bilateral relations between the two nations,' the statement said. 'Ethiopia and Somalia are interdependent nations with a common destiny and a shared vision for regional stability and prosperity.' The leaders also welcomed the start of technical talks in Turkey’s capital aimed at resolving the standoff over the Ethiopian-Somaliland deal. Under that deal, landlocked Ethiopia would lease 20 kilometers of Somaliland seafront for 50 years, in return for diplomatic recognition of Somaliland. Even though Somaliland has run its affairs separate from Somalia since 1991, no country has recognized it as an independent nation, in part due to ardent opposition from Somalia. Details of the agreement have not been made public, but the Somali government said Ethiopia's plan was to build a naval base. After months of high diplomatic tension, Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan mediated an agreement between Somalia and Ethiopia in December in which the countries reaffirmed their respect for each other’s sovereignty, unity, independence and territorial integrity. The Ankara agreement calls for Somalia to give Ethiopia access to a commercial port. Details are being discussed at the technical talks. However, Ethiopia has not officially left the Somaliland deal. In January, Somali President Hassan Sheikh Mohamud paid a surprise visit to Ethiopia’s capital, Addis Ababa, where he met with the Ethiopian prime minister. Analysts say that such high-profile visits are aimed at 'confidence building' before Turkish President Erdogan makes a planned visit to Somalia and Ethiopia some time this year. 'Somalia and Ethiopian leaders need to build confidence and encourage the technical talks aimed at reaching a potential agreement that upholds Somalia’s territorial integrity while allowing Ethiopia access to the sea under the Ankara Agreement,' said Virginia-based analyst Abdiqafar Abdi Wardhere. Meanwhile, this week an Ethiopian delegation led by military chief Field Marshal Birhanu Jula, accompanied by Ethiopian intelligence chief Redwan Hussien, met with Somali officials in Mogadishu, where the two sides signed an agreement that secured the participation of Ethiopian troops in the new African Union mission in Somalia, known as AUSSOM.	https://www.voanews.com/a/ethiopia-pm-visits-somalia-as-neighbors-try-to-improve-relations/7990067.html	2025-02-27T06:00:18-08:00

Cybercrime laws risk 'steady criminalization' of journalists, analysts warn	washington — As more countries enact cybercrime legislation, analysts warn that efforts to combat legitimate concerns could also allow for easier targeting of critics. Analysts have warned that amendments in Pakistan and Myanmar in recent months could add to already repressive environments. Some point to Nigeria as a test case. Since passing its cybercrime law in 2015, watchdogs have documented 29 cases of journalists being charged, including four who were charged in a Lagos court in September. 'What we are seeing is a steady criminalization of journalists around the world, and it’s a huge threat to press freedom,' said Jonathan Rozen, a senior researcher at the Committee to Protect Journalists, or CPJ. In Pakistan, the government in January amended the Prevention of Electronic Crimes Act of 2016 (PECA). Authorities said the changes would curb cybercrime, online harassment and the spread of hateful content that could instigate violence. Pakistan’s federal information minister, Attaullah Tarar, said the law was needed 'to regulate social media.' 'Countries across the world have some codes or standards under which social media operate, but there was none in our country,' he told reporters last month. The amendment led to protests by journalists and civil society, who said the changes would make it easy for authorities to prosecute people whose opinions are not in line with those of the government. Analysts pointed to broad terms, including definitions of 'unlawful' content and 'person,' with the latter now including state institutions and corporations. Another amendment proposed the creation of a Digital Rights Protection Authority that can remove content from social media platforms. Critics and media rights groups worry this could expose journalists and social media users to increased restrictions and legal action, restrict dissent and open doors for the powerful military establishment to target and harass civilians. Before the reforms, watchdogs recorded more than 200 cases of journalists being investigated since PECA was passed. Joshua Kurlantzick, a senior fellow at the Council on Foreign Relations, said the changes in Pakistan’s cybercrime law would make an 'already repressive online atmosphere even worse and restrictive.' Pakistan’s military has imposed a 'much tougher crackdown' in the past year, said Kurlantzick. 'They have gone well out of their way to target individuals, civil rights activists, journalists, and use anti-freedom laws to target those people, and often put them in jail,' he said. Pakistan’s Ministry of Information did not respond to VOA’s request for comment. Similar concerns are shared in Myanmar, where the junta last July passed an expansive cybercrime law. The law targeted virtual private networks, or VPNs, that allow internet users to circumvent blocked websites and censorship. The junta said the new law was needed to protect against cyberattacks and cybercrimes that could threaten the country's stability. Since seizing power in a coup in February 2021, Myanmar’s military has revoked broadcast licenses, blocked access to websites and jailed journalists. The country is the third worst jailer of journalists, with 35 detained, according to the latest CPJ data. An expert with the Myanmar Internet Project, a digital rights group, told VOA at the time that the law was more focused on suppressing rights than protecting the public. 'All the provisions of the law are designed to suppress rather than protect the public,' the expert, who asked to be identified only as U Han, said. 'We believe that the junta will use this bill as a weapon prepared for this purpose.' Kurlantzick, however, believes the military would struggle to restrict the online space. 'Myanmar’s military has no power to restrict online dissent anymore, as 70% of the country is in control of the opposition groups,' he said. 'The government, which can’t provide power, water or other services even in the biggest cities, doesn’t have the ability to crack down on the internet now.' In Nigeria, the 2015 Cybercrimes (Prohibition, Prevention, Etc) Act has been used to file cases against journalists who investigate corruption. But the government has made some reforms based on civil society and press freedom group recommendations. Two sections of the cybercrime law had been of particular concern because of the 'very broad and vague wording' that allowed the arrest of journalists for sending what were deemed 'annoying' or 'defamatory' messages, said CPJ’s Rozen. Changes made in 2024 narrowed the language. 'It constrained the opportunity for authorities to arrest journalists only if the messages were knowingly false, or if it was causing a breakdown of law or causing a threat to life,' said Rozen, who added that other areas remain 'overly broad and could be abused.' One section he cited allows for law enforcement to access information from service providers without a court order. Nigeria’s police have used this to access data of journalists, said Rozen, noting that four journalists are currently facing prosecution under the cybercrime act. Rozen agrees that 'misinformation and disinformation are challenges for society, but what is being observed,' he said, 'is a criminalization of journalists on accusations that they are sharing false information, and in many cases, this is used as a shorthand to smother or crush' dissenting voices. With more reporting and publishing taking place online, the tools some governments use to suppress journalists are adapting to the modernization of the industry, Rozen said.	https://www.voanews.com/a/cybercrime-laws-risk-steady-criminalization-of-journalists-analysts-warn/7989674.html	2025-02-27T05:13:04-08:00	
US, Russian diplomats meet to discuss embassy operations	U.S. and Russian diplomats met Thursday in Istanbul for talks about the operations of their respective embassies in Moscow and Washington. The meeting is the latest in a series of engagements between the two sides, including a phone call earlier this month between U.S. President Donald Trump and Russian President Vladimir Putin. Working to restore U.S.-Russia relations was on the agenda last week for talks between U.S. Secretary of State Marco Rubio and Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov. The U.S. State Department said after those talks in Riyadh that the two sides had agreed to create 'a consultation mechanism to address irritants to our bilateral relationship with the objective of taking steps necessary to normalize the operation of our respective diplomatic missions.' Diplomatic relations between Russia and the United States declined during the past decade, with both sides expelling diplomats.

Actor Gene Hackman, wife found dead at New Mexico home	Oscar-winning American actor Gene Hackman and his wife were found dead Wednesday at their home in the southwestern U.S. state of New Mexico. Authorities said they were investigating what caused their deaths but that foul play was not suspected as a factor. Authorities said they went to the home to do a welfare check and found the 95-year-old Hackman and his wife, 64-year-old pianist Betsy Arakawa, dead along with their dog. Hackman had a lengthy career on stage and screen, including appearing in Broadway shows, on television and in more than 80 films. He won an Oscar for best actor for his role in the 1971 film The French Connection and a best supporting Oscar for the 1992 film Unforgiven. Hackman’s resume featured three other Oscar nominations, including his breakout role in Bonnie and Clyde in 1967 as well as I Never Sang for My Father in 1970 and Mississippi Burning in 1988. His work crossed genres as he appeared in action movies, thrillers and offbeat comedies. In addition to his award-nominated works, he was also known for roles in films such as The Poseidon Adventure, Young Frankenstein, Superman, Hoosiers, The Birdcage, and The Royal Tenenbaums. His last film was Welcome to Mooseport in 2004.

Australia discusses security, aid with Vanuatu amid competition with China	SYDNEY — Australia pledged to remain the South Pacific's largest aid donor on Thursday during security and economic talks with Vanuatu, as Canberra reviews the potential Pacific impact of U.S. President Donald Trump's foreign aid cuts. 'Australia will always be there for you,' Australia's Minister for International Development Pat Conroy told a news conference in the Vanuatu capital Port Vila. Conroy, who held talks with Vanuatu Prime Minister Jotham Napat, pledged another $3.2 million in direct budget support for Vanuatu after an earthquake in December flattened commercial buildings and killed 16 people. 'There is geostrategic competition occurring in the Pacific as great powers get interested in our region, but we are proud to be the biggest development partner,' Conroy said. Australia was there 'well before any other countries, be it the United States or China, became interested in the Pacific,' he added. China is the second-biggest bilateral donor to the Pacific Islands after Australia, a Lowy Institute report on aid to the region found in November 2024. Australia and its main security ally the United States have been concerned at China's growing influence in the South Pacific and Trump's order to cut foreign aid has worried the region's small island nations. Australian officials said Canberra was reviewing any potential impact from the Trump administration's funding cuts to the U.S. Agency for International Development (USAID). In recent years Vanuatu has moved closer to China, which is its largest external creditor after a decade of infrastructure loans for construction including a new president's office last year. China's navy, which upset Canberra by holding live fire drills in the Tasman Sea between Australia and New Zealand in recent days, has made repeated port visits to Vanuatu, where Beijing funded the expansion of a wharf. A security treaty signed by Australia and Vanuatu in 2022 has not yet been ratified by Vanuatu's parliament, which has experienced a period of high political instability. Napat is the fourth prime minister since 2022. Napat told reporters he had discussed economic cooperation and security with Australia.	https://www.voanews.com/a/australia-discusses-security-aid-with-vanuatu-amid-competition-with-china/7989847.html	2025-02-27T01:25:35-08:00	
Sri Lanka reports massive tolls in human-elephant conflicts	COLOMBO, SRI LANKA — Sri Lanka vowed Thursday to urgently tackle costly clashes between villagers and wild elephants after reporting the deaths of nearly 1,200 people and more than 3,500 animals in a decade. Environment minister Dammika Patabendi told parliament that they will build more electrified fences and deploy additional staff to help reduce elephant raids on villages near wildlife sanctuaries. 'We are allocating more money to reduce the human-elephant conflict, and are hopeful that within a short period of time we will be able to mitigate the situation,' Patabendi said. Between 2015 and 2024, 1,195 people and 3,484 wild elephants were killed, he said. In January this year, three more people and 43 elephants were killed. Opposition legislator Nalin Bandara said the toll was 'shocking' and urged authorities to protect people, while also ensuring that the wild animals were not harmed. He noted that disposing of the carcasses of wild elephants had cost the state about $11.6 million over a decade, while compensation to victims of elephant attacks was about $4 million over the same period. Killing or harming elephants is a criminal offense in Sri Lanka, which has an estimated 7,000 wild elephants, which are considered a national treasure, partly due to their significance in Buddhist culture. However, the massacre continues as desperate farmers struggle with elephants raiding their crops and destroying livelihoods. Many elephants have been electrocuted, shot and poisoned. Sometimes fruits packed with explosives are used to injure the animals, often ending in painful deaths. Elephants are also killed by trains running through their habitats. Seven elephants, including four calves, were killed when they were run over by an express train in the island's eastern Habarana region a week ago. It was the worst such accident recorded in the country. Asian elephants are recognized as endangered by the International Union for Conservation of Nature. An estimated 26,000 of them live in the wild, mostly in India, surviving for an average of 60-70 years outside captivity.	https://www.voanews.com/a/sri-lanka-reports-massive-tolls-in-human-elephant-conflicts/7989844.html	2025-02-27T01:11:12-08:00	
School helps migrants in Mauritania; can it keep them from leaving for Europe?	NOUADHIBOU, MAURITANIA — Eager students from throughout west Africa raise their hands as teachers guide them through math and classical Arabic. Then they race outdoors to meet their parents, who clean houses, drive informal taxis or gut sardines in Chinese factories. Outside, government billboards urge these families and others to fight 'migrant smuggling,' showing overcrowded boats navigating the Atlantic's thrashing waves. Inside, posters warn the ocean can be deadly. Such messaging is hard to escape in Nouadhibou, Mauritania's second-largest city and a launch point on an increasingly popular migrant route toward Europe. As authorities strengthen security measures on long-established routes, migrants are resorting to longer, more perilous ones. From Mauritania, they risk hundreds of kilometers of sea and howling winds to reach Spain's Canary Islands. The route puts new strain on this port city of 177,000 people at the edge of the Sahara. Outdated infrastructure and unpaved roads have not kept pace as European and Chinese investment pours into the fishing industry, and as migrants and their children arrive from as far away as Syria and Pakistan. The school for children of migrants and refugees, set up in 2018 as an early response to the growing need, is the kind of program envisioned as part of the $219 million accord the European Union and Mauritania brokered last year. The deal — one of several that Europe has signed with neighboring states to deter migration — funds border patrol, development aid and programs supporting refugees, asylum-seekers and host communities. It's a response to rising alarm and anti-migration politics in Europe. Nearly 47,000 migrants arrived on boats in the Canaries last year, a record 'fueled by departures from Mauritania, even as flows from other departure points declined,' according to the EU border agency Frontex. Almost 6,000 were unaccompanied children under 18. Tracking deaths at sea is difficult, but the Spanish nonprofit Walking Borders says at least 6,800 people died or went missing while attempting the crossing last year. Conditions are so harsh that boats drifting off course can end up in Brazil or the Caribbean. Though many praise initiatives that fulfill migrants and refugees' overlooked needs, few believe they will be effective in discouraging departures for Europe — even the head of the group that runs the Nouadhibou school. 'We can't stop migration,' said Amsatou Vepouyoum, president of the Organization for the Support of Migrants and Refugees, the city's leading migrant aid group. 'But through raising awareness, we want to improve the conditions under which people leave.' Preparing for an uncertain future The organization years ago surveyed the migrant population and found that education was one of the biggest barriers to integration in Mauritania. Bill Van Esveld, a children's rights researcher at Human Rights Watch, said that's true around the world. Many countries that migrants and refugees pass through erect bureaucratic hurdles to school access, he said. 'Without literacy or numeracy, how can you advocate for yourself as someone who has human rights in today's world?' Van Esveld said. Mauritania's Education Ministry in a January directive affirmed that refugee children have the right to attend public school. But that hasn't applied for many migrants who don't qualify as refugees and face difficulty enrolling because they lack birth certificates, residency papers or school records. The school for Nouadhibou's migrant and refugee children ages 5 to 12 runs parallel to Mauritania's school system and teaches a similar curriculum as well as Arabic, aiming to integrate children into public classrooms by sixth grade. Families often don't plan to stay in Mauritania, but parents still describe the school as a lifeline for kids' futures, wherever they will be. 'Sometimes life's circumstances leave you somewhere, so you adapt, and what ends up happening leads you to stay,' Vepouyoum said. Weak oversight and worried parents From Europe's perspective, funneling aid toward such initiatives is part of a larger effort to persuade people not to migrate. Some experts say it also demonstrates a disconnect between political goals and on-the-ground realities. 'The European Union always announces these big sums, but it's very difficult to figure out how the money is actually spent,' said Ulf Laessing, the Sahel program director at the Konrad Adenauer Foundation, a German think tank. Both the school and the Organization for the Support of Migrants and Refugees have had their work highlighted by the EU and member states, along with United Nations agencies. None have said how much money they have spent on the school or on other programs aimed at migrants in Mauritania. The school said it also charges students based on what families can afford so it can pay rent on its two-story cinderblock building and utilities, Vepouyoum said. But four parents, who spoke on condition of anonymity because they worried about their children getting kicked out, said the baseline monthly fee of $15 per child was too much. 'If you can't pay, they'll kick you out,' a father of two students from Mali said. He said many parents want to give children opportunities they lacked in their home countries. He has heard from other parents that enrolling in school is easier in the Canary Islands, but limited access to education is also a problem there. The school in Nouadhibou says it has educated over 500 students. It has not tracked the number who continue on toward Europe. Pressures to move on Times are changing in Nouadhibou. Community leaders and business owners worry that increasing competition for jobs has fueled suspicion toward foreign-born communities. That includes workers from neighboring Senegal and Mali who settled in the city years ago. Aid groups say outreach is easier among long-term migrants because newcomers worry about drawing attention to themselves — sometimes because they're looking for smugglers to help them move on, said Kader Konate, a community leader from Mali. Many migrants say they just need help. 'We are doing this because we feel have no other choice,' Boureima Maiga said. The 29-year-old graduate with a teaching degree fled Mali as extremist violence escalated. On many days, he waits at the Nouadhibou port alongside hundreds of other migrants, hoping for work in fish factory 'cold rooms.' But without residency or work visas, they are often turned away, or have pay withheld — an abuse they fear would bring retaliation if reported. Maiga feels trapped in a country where deep racial divisions between Arab and Black Africans make integration nearly impossible, with discrimination by employers widespread. He is unsure where to go next. 'Just let me work. I can do a lot of jobs,' he said. 'Everyone knows how to do something.' Meanwhile, every day, he picks up his nieces at a Catholic school, hoping it will give them a life beyond such worries.	https://www.voanews.com/a/school-helps-migrants-in-mauritania-can-it-keep-them-from-leaving-for-europe-/7989837.html	2025-02-27T00:50:24-08:00	
Mauritius, La Reunion brace for 'dangerous' cyclone	PORT LOUIS, MAURITIUS — The Indian Ocean tourist meccas of Mauritius and La Reunion braced Thursday for an intense tropical storm, Cyclone Garance, which was labelled a 'direct threat' to the islands. Mauritius shut its main airport the previous day, while the nearby French island of La Reunion was set to do the same on Thursday. Garance was labeled a class 3 cyclone by Mauritius -- the second-highest alert level -- with gusts of up to 70 kph expected. The Mauritius Meteorological Service said the cyclone was 310 kilometers northwest of the island and had increased to become an 'intense tropical storm.' The cyclone is 'dangerously approaching Mauritius and constitutes a direct threat,' it said, adding that flooding was expected. Garance was heading east but has curved south to pass between Mauritius and the French island of La Reunion, whose local prefect said it was set to declare a red alert and close its airport on Thursday. The peak intensity of the cyclone was expected late in the day or into the night, French weather service Meteo-France said. The 'expected scenario is a direct impact on Reunion Island,' said Celine Jauffray, of Meteo-France, on Wednesday, but said its intensity and path could still change. Gusts of more than 150 kph were expected on the highest points of La Reunion, accompanied by heavy rain and rough seas. A red alert would require the population to stay indoors and only emergency services could move around the island. Schools were already closed from Wednesday afternoon. Air Mauritius said all flights had been suspended 'until further notice.'	https://www.voanews.com/a/mauritius-la-reunion-brace-for-dangerous-cyclone/7989831.html	2025-02-27T00:10:20-08:00	
Japan's births fell to record low in 2024	TOKYO — The number of babies born in Japan fell to a record low of 720,988 in 2024 for a ninth consecutive year of decline, the health ministry said on Thursday, underscoring the rapid aging and dwindling of the population. Births were down 5% on the year, despite measures in 2023 by former Prime Minister Fumio Kishida's government to boost child-bearing, while a record number of 1.62 million deaths meant that more than two people died for every new baby born. Although the fertility rate in neighboring South Korea rose in 2024 for the first time in nine years, thanks to measures to spur young people to marry and have children, the trend in Japan has yet to show an upturn. Behind Japan's childbirth decline are fewer marriages in recent years, stemming from the COVID-19 pandemic, said Takumi Fujinami, an economist at the Japan Research Institute. Although the number of marriages edged up 2.2% to 499,999 in 2024, that came only after steep declines, such as a plunge of 12.7% in 2020. 'The impact could linger on in 2025 as well,' Fujinami said. Unlike some Western countries, only a few of every 100 babies in Japan are born out of wedlock, suggesting a stronger correlation between marriages and births. News this week that South Korea's fertility rate rose to 0.75 in 2024 from 0.72 in 2023 suggested the neighboring nation's demographic crisis might have turned a corner. In Japan, the most recent data shows the corresponding figure for the average number of babies a woman is expected to have during her reproductive life came in at 1.20 in 2023. While it was too early for any meaningful comparison between the figures in the two countries, Fujinami warned, it was important for both to improve job opportunities and close the gender gap to encourage young people to marry and have children. Experts believe South Korea's positive turn resulted from government support in the three areas of work-family balance, childcare and housing, as well as a campaign for businesses to nudge employees towards parenthood.	https://www.voanews.com/a/japan-s-births-fell-to-record-low-in-2024/7989816.html	2025-02-26T22:50:14-08:00	
North Korea behind $1.5 billion crypto theft, FBI says	WASHINGTON — The U.S. FBI on Wednesday accused North Korea of being behind the theft of $1.5 billion worth of digital assets last week, the largest crypto heist in history. '(North Korea) was responsible for the theft of approximately $1.5 billion in virtual assets from cryptocurrency exchange, Bybit,' the FBI said in a public service announcement. The bureau said a group called TraderTraitor, also known as the Lazarus Group, was behind the theft. It said they were 'proceeding rapidly and have converted some of the stolen assets to Bitcoin and other virtual assets dispersed across thousands of addresses on multiple blockchains.' 'It is expected these assets will be further laundered and eventually converted to fiat currency,' the FBI added. Lazarus Group gained notoriety a decade ago when it was accused of hacking into Sony Pictures as revenge for The Interview, a film that mocked North Korean leader Kim Jong Un. North Korea's cyber-warfare program dates back to at least the mid-1990s. It has since grown to a 6,000-strong cyber-warfare unit known as Bureau 121 that operates from several countries, according to a 2020 U.S. military report.	https://www.voanews.com/a/north-korea-behind-1-5-billion-crypto-theft-fbi-says/7989814.html	2025-02-26T22:26:23-08:00	
Vietnam jails leading journalist over Facebook posts	HANOI, VIETNAM — A Vietnamese court on Thursday sentenced a leading independent journalist to 30 months in prison over Facebook posts that criticized the government, state media said. Huy Duc worked for influential state-run newspapers before authoring one of Vietnam's most popular blogs and Facebook accounts, where he criticized the country's communist leaders on issues such as corruption, media control and relations with China. The court in Hanoi convicted the 63-year-old of 'abusing democratic freedoms to infringe upon the interests of the state' through posting 13 articles on Facebook, according to Vietnam News Agency. The trial lasted just a few hours. 'These articles have a large number of interactions, comments, and shares, causing negative impacts on social order and safety,' the indictment read, according to state media. Shortly before his arrest last June, Huy Duc -- which is the journalist's pen name -- took aim online at Vietnam's most powerful leader To Lam, as well as his predecessor Nguyen Phu Trong. It is unclear if the charges related to these particular posts. Vietnam, a one-party state, has no free media and clamps down hard on any dissent. It is one of the world's top jailers of journalists, according to the Reporters Without Borders (RSF) press freedom campaign group. The trial in Hanoi came just months after blogger Duong Van Thai -- who had almost 120,000 followers on YouTube, where he regularly recorded livestreams critical of the government -- was jailed for 12 years on charges of publishing anti-state information. In January, a prominent former lawyer was jailed for three years over Facebook posts. 'Invaluable source of information' Huy Duc, whose real name is Truong Huy San, is a former senior army lieutenant. He was fired from a state news outlet in 2009 for criticizing past actions by Vietnam's former communist ally, the Soviet Union. Huy Duc spent a year at Harvard University on a Nieman Fellowship in 2012. During his time abroad, his account of life in Vietnam after the end of the war with the United States, The Winning Side, was published. RSF said previously that his articles were 'an invaluable source of information enabling the Vietnamese public to access censored information by the Hanoi regime.' Rights campaigners say the government has in recent years stepped up a crackdown on civil society. 'No country can develop sustainably based on fear,' Huy Duc wrote on Facebook in May, the month before he was arrested. In December, Vietnam enacted new rules requiring Facebook and TikTok to verify user identities and hand over data to authorities. Under 'Decree 147,' all tech giants operating in Vietnam must verify user accounts by phone numbers or Vietnamese identification numbers and store that information alongside their full name and date of birth.	https://www.voanews.com/a/vietnam-jails-leading-journalist-over-facebook-posts/7989811.html	2025-02-26T22:16:36-08:00	
US Supreme Court pauses federal judge's order on Trump administration foreign aid funding	U.S. Supreme Court Chief Justice John Roberts on Wednesday paused a federal judge's order requiring President Donald Trump's administration to pay foreign aid funds to contractors and grant recipients. Roberts issued an interim order placing on hold Washington-based U.S. District Judge Amir Ali's action that had imposed a deadline of 11:59 p.m. on Wednesday night. Roberts provided no rationale for the order, known as an administrative stay, which will give the court additional time to consider the administration's more formal request to block Ali's ruling. Roberts asked for a response from the plaintiffs -- organizations that contract with or receive grants from the U.S. Agency for International Development and the State Department -- by noon on Friday. The order came after Trump's administration said in a court filing on Wednesday it had made final decisions terminating most U.S. foreign aid contracts and grants, while maintaining that it cannot meet Ali's court-ordered deadline. The administration is cutting more than 90% of the U.S. Agency for International Development's foreign aid contracts and over $58 billion in overall U.S. assistance around the world, a State Department spokesperson said separately, calling the cuts part of Trump's 'America First agenda.' The foreign aid funding dispute arose from a pair of lawsuits brought by the aid organizations, alleging that the agencies have illegally frozen all foreign aid payments. The Trump administration has kept those payments largely frozen despite a Feb. 13 temporary restraining order from Ali that they be released, and multiple subsequent orders that the administration comply, culminating in the Wednesday night deadline. Lawyers for the U.S. Justice Department have maintained that the administration has a right to suspend its agreements while it reviews them to determine whether they comply with administration policy. That review is now complete, the administration said in its new filing. It said USAID has made final decisions to cancel nearly 5,800 awards, while keeping more than 500, and that the State Department has canceled about 4,100 awards, while keeping about 2,700. An administration official said in an earlier court filing that grounds for terminating contracts include that they were related to diversity, equity, inclusion and accessibility efforts, or were deemed wasteful. Trump has taken a hard line on programs related to diversity, equity and inclusion, signing an executive order in his second day in office last month directing federal agency chiefs to dismantle DEI policies. The administration said on Wednesday that Secretary of State Marco Rubio had ordered that past-due invoices from the plaintiffs for work before Jan. 24, when the payment freeze began, to be 'expedited for payment without the ordinary vetting procedures, in a good-faith effort to comply' with Ali's order. It said that while some money would be paid on Wednesday, full payments could take weeks. Funding freeze undermines relief efforts Trump, a Republican, ordered a 90-day pause on all foreign aid on his first day in office last month. That order, and ensuing stop-work orders halting USAID operations around the world, have jeopardized the delivery of life-saving food and medical aid, throwing global humanitarian relief efforts into chaos. USAID administers some 60% of U.S. foreign assistance and disbursed $43.79 billion in fiscal 2023. According to a Congressional Research Service report this month, its workforce of 10,000, of which about two-thirds serves overseas, assisted about 130 countries. Trump's administration on Sunday said it was placing all but leaders and critical staff at USAID on paid administrative leave and eliminating 1,600 positions. Employee unions have sued to challenge the cuts, though a judge last week allowed them to go ahead. Ali, who was appointed by Trump's Democratic predecessor, former President Joe Biden, issued his temporary restraining order to prevent irreparable harm to the plaintiffs while he considers their claims. The plaintiffs allege Trump has exceeded his authority under federal law and the U.S. Constitution by effectively dismantling an independent agency and canceling spending authorized by Congress. The plaintiffs have said the administration has not done anything to comply with the restraining order, and some have said they will shut down within days if they are not paid. 'The lengths that the government is willing to go to flout a court order, all for the goal of ending life-saving humanitarian assistance, is staggering,' said Allison Zieve, a lawyer representing two plaintiffs, AIDS Vaccine Advocacy Coalition and Journalism Development Network, on Wednesday. Other plaintiffs include international development company DAI Global and refugee assistance organization HIAS. Both Ali and a Rhode Island federal judge in a separate case over a broader federal payment freeze have castigated the Trump administration for failing to follow their orders. The administration in both cases has maintained it is trying in good faith to interpret and comply with the orders.	https://www.voanews.com/a/us-supreme-court-pauses-federal-judge-s-order-on-trump-administration-foreign-aid-funding/7989808.html	2025-02-26T22:07:10-08:00	
Transgender US service members to be separated from military, Pentagon memo shows	WASHINGTON — Transgender service members will be separated from the U.S. military unless they receive an exemption, according to a Pentagon memo filed in court on Wednesday, essentially banning them from joining or serving in the military. President Donald Trump signed an executive order last month that took aim at transgender troops in a personal way -- at one point saying that a man identifying as a woman was 'not consistent with the humility and selflessness required of a service member.' This month, the Pentagon had said that the U.S. military will no longer allow transgender individuals to join and will stop performing or facilitating procedures associated with gender transition for service members. Wednesday's late-evening memo goes further. The memo said that the Pentagon must create a procedure to identify troops who are transgender within 30 days and then within 30 days of that, must separate them from the military. 'It is the policy of the United States Government to establish high standards for service member readiness, lethality, cohesion, honesty, humility, uniformity, and integrity,' said the memo, dated Feb. 26. 'This policy is inconsistent with the medical, surgical, and mental health constraints on individuals with gender dysphoria or who have a current diagnosis or history of, or exhibit symptoms consistent with, gender dysphoria,' it added. The military has about 1.3 million active-duty personnel, according to Department of Defense data. Although transgender rights advocates say there are as many as 15,000 transgender service members, officials say the number is in the low thousands.	https://www.voanews.com/a/transgender-us-service-members-to-be-separated-from-military-pentagon-memo-shows-/7989803.html	2025-02-26T21:54:17-08:00	
North Korea opens to a group of international travelers for the 1st time in years	SEOUL, SOUTH KOREA — A small group of foreign tourists has visited North Korea in the past week, making them the first international travelers to enter the country in five years except for a group of Russian tourists who went to the North last year. The latest trip indicates North Korea may be gearing up for a full resumption of its international tourism to bring in much-needed foreign currency to revive its struggling economy, experts say. The Beijing-based travel company Koryo Tours said it arranged a five-day trip from Feb. 20 to Feb. 24 for 13 international tourists to the northeastern North Korean border city of Rason, where the country's special economic zone is located. Koryo Tours General Manager Simon Cockerell said the travelers from the U.K., Canada, Greece, New Zealand, France, Germany, Austria, Australia and Italy crossed by land from China. He said that in Rason, they visited factories, shops, schools and the statues of Kim Il Sung and Kim Jong Il, the late grandfather and father of current leader Kim Jong Un. 'Since January of 2020, the country has been closed to all international tourists, and we are glad to have finally found an opening in the Rason area, in the far north of North Korea,' Cockerell said. 'Our first tour has been and gone, and now more tourists on both group and private visits are going in, arranging trips,' he added. After the pandemic began, North Korea quickly banned tourists, jetted out diplomats and severely curtailed border traffic in one of the world's most draconian COVID-19 restrictions. But since 2022, North Korea has been slowly easing curbs and reopening its borders. In February 2024, North Korea accepted about 100 Russian tourists, the first foreign nationals to visit the country for sightseeing. That surprised many observers, who thought the first post-pandemic tourists would come from China, North Korea's biggest trading partner and major ally. A total of about 880 Russian tourists visited North Korea throughout 2024, South Korea's Unification Ministry said, citing official Russian data. Chinese group tours to North Korea remain stalled. This signals how much North Korea and Russia have moved closer to each other as the North has supplied weapons and troops to Russia to support its war against Ukraine. Ties between North Korea and China cooled as China showed its reluctance to join a three-way, anti-U.S. alliance with North Korea and Russia, experts say. Before the pandemic, tourism was an easy, legitimate source for foreign currency for North Korea, one of the world's most sanctioned countries because of its nuclear program. North Korea is expected to open a massive tourism site on the east coast in June. In January when President Donald Trump boasted about his ties with Kim Jong Un, he said that 'I think he has tremendous condo capabilities. He's got a lot of shoreline.' That likely refers to the eastern coast site. A return of Chinese tourists would be key to making North Korea's tourism industry lucrative because they represented more than 90% of total international tourists before the pandemic, said Lee Sangkeun, an expert at the Institute for National Security Strategy, a think tank run by South Korea's intelligence agency. He said that in the past, up to 300,000 Chinese tourists visited North Korea annually. 'North Korea has been heavily investing on tourism sites, but there have been not much domestic demand,' Lee said. 'We can assess that North Korea now wants to resume international tourism to bring in many tourists from abroad.' The restrictions that North Korea has typically imposed on foreign travelers — such as requirements that they move with local guides and the banning of photography at sensitive places — will likely hurt its efforts to develop tourism. Lee said that Rason, the eastern coast site and Pyongyang would be the places where North Korea feels it can easily monitor and control foreign tourists.	https://www.voanews.com/a/north-korea-opens-to-a-group-of-international-travelers-for-the-1st-time-in-years/7989799.html	2025-02-26T21:07:37-08:00

British PM Starmer to meet Trump at the White House	WASHINGTON — British Prime Minister Keir Starmer is set to meet with President Donald Trump at the White House on Thursday to address the ongoing conflict in Ukraine and bilateral trade ties, amid the U.S. leader’s tariff threats on Europe and demands that the continent rely less on Washington for its security. Ahead of their meeting, Trump, who wants NATO members to boost defense spending to 5% of their Gross Domestic Product, reiterated his stance that Europe should 'step up.' He told reporters at the White House on Wednesday that American taxpayers 'shouldn't be footing the bill than – more than the Europeans are paying.' In what appears to be a move to appease Trump, on Tuesday, Starmer announced an unexpected increase in the U.K. defense budget to 2.5% of the nation's GDP by 2027, then to 2.6% the following year. 'This week when I meet President Trump, I will be clear: I want this relationship to go from strength to strength,' Starmer told members of the British Parliament, underscoring what he calls his country’s 'most important bilateral alliance,' with the U.S. Starmer told reporters Tuesday that the increase in defense spending was 'three years in the making,' following Russia’s 2022 invasion of Ukraine. The increase will be funded by cutting Britain’s already depleted foreign aid budget to just 0.3% of the country’s GDP. He acknowledged that the decision to ramp up defense spending was 'accelerated' as Trump moves to negotiate with Moscow without the involvement of Ukraine or Europeans and made clear he is reducing U.S. support for Europe’s security. 'President Trump thinks we should do more, and I agree with him. It chimes with my thinking on this,' Starmer said. He said he also aims to further increase defense spending to 3% in the next Parliament, which will begin in 2029 at the latest after the next general election. A key message for Starmer to reinforce is that Europeans must be part of any discussions on Ukraine, said Gesine Weber, a fellow on the German Marshall Fund’s Geostrategy team. 'Because it would be very odd to have a situation where you have the burden shift to Europeans, but not the strategic responsibility and the strategic reflections,' she told VOA. In 2023, the U.S. spent 3.4% of its GDP on defense, according to U.S. government data compiled by the Stockholm International Peace Research Insititute. European peacekeeping Starmer’s meeting comes on the heels of Emmanuel Macron's White House visit on Monday. The French president has proposed creating a European peacekeeping force in Ukraine as a security guarantee against future Russian aggression, a plan endorsed by Starmer. Under this scenario, the United States 'would do less in normal times, but be available as sort of a backstop,' when a crisis breaks, said Michael O’Hanlon of the Brookings Institution. It remains to be seen whether the plan will come to fruition considering the various interests within NATO and European Union, O’Hanlon told VOA. 'The most important thing, do these guys get along? Do they have a common vision?' he said of Trump and Starmer, because that could signal the emergence of a Western strategy to end the war with NATO’s support. 'If that's the case, then we're in a good position to try to promote a negotiation between Russia and Ukraine,' he added. On Wednesday Trump signaled Ukraine should 'forget about' a path toward NATO membership and that it should not expect much from Washington. 'I’m not going to make security guarantees beyond very much — we’re going to have Europe do that because we’re talking about Europe is their next-door neighbor.' Aside from negotiating with Moscow, Trump is also pushing Kyiv for a deal that would allow American access to Ukraine's rare earth minerals and recoup funds given by the Biden administration to support the country’s war efforts. Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy is set to meet Trump at the White House on Friday. Tariff threats The visit is a challenge for Starmer as he seeks to balance the U.K.'s interests with those of its European allies while engaging with an unpredictable U.S. administration. He is keen to secure favorable terms amid potential U.S. tariffs that could impact British exports as the U.S. hits European countries with 25% tariffs on steel and aluminum. Trump is threatening more, saying the European Union has been 'very unfair' to America. Starmer is 'in a bit delicate position' as the U.K. is not part of the European Union single market, said GMF’s Weber. 'So for him, the question is basically averting the situation where there are U.S. tariffs and of course also trying to appease Washington in that regard, while he’s also not going on a super confrontational line with the European Union,' she said. British finance minister Rachel Reeves said on Wednesday she was confident that U.S.-U.K. trade and investment would not be derailed amid Trump’s tariff threats.	https://www.voanews.com/a/british-pm-starmer-to-meet-trump-at-the-white-house/7989786.html	2025-02-26T20:05:45-08:00	
Trump $5 million 'gold card' plan sparks immigration confusion	Immigration law experts expressed confusion on Wednesday, the day after President Donald Trump announced that the U.S. would begin selling a gold card visa for $5 million that would allow wealthy foreigners to live and work in the U.S. and provide them with 'a route to citizenship.' In remarks in the Oval Office on Tuesday, Trump and Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick said the program would begin in two weeks and replace the EB-5 visa program that allows foreign investors to live and work in the U.S. if they invest in companies that create jobs for Americans. The EB-5 visa program, however, was created by an act of Congress in 1990, and it is unclear whether Trump has the authority to do away with it or to establish a new visa program without congressional action. 'We have it all worked out from the legal standpoint. It's totally legal to do,' Trump said. Questions about legality Immigration lawyers flatly disagreed. 'The truth is the president would need Congress to pass an act allowing for this new vehicle,' said Michael Wildes, a practicing immigration law attorney who also teaches the subject at Cardozo Law School in New York City. Wildes, who has represented first lady Melania Trump and members of her family in immigration matters, said that so little information has been made available about the program that it is difficult to gauge how large an impact it is likely to have. The information that has been released, however, reflects the president's approach to issues such as immigration, he said. 'He will treat people with deeper pockets more handsomely than others,' Wildes told VOA. 'This is consistent with his ethic.' 'If the administration is proposing to rework the terms of the EB-5 program, that is blatantly illegal,' Jorge Loweree, managing director of programs and strategy for the American Immigration Council, told VOA. 'The parameters of that program were designed by our legislative branch. The president can’t rewrite them on a whim.' David J. Bier, director of immigration studies at the Cato Institute, wrote 'Selling green cards is good in theory, but Trump’s specific proposal has some problems.' One, he wrote, is that 'President Trump cannot lawfully eliminate Congress’s EB‑5 investor program.' The White House did not respond to a request for comment from VOA. Oval Office announcement Trump revealed the plan to a group of reporters in the Oval Office on Tuesday, saying that the new offering would be superior to the document currently issued to foreigners with permanent residency status, commonly known as a green card. 'We're going to be selling a gold card,' Trump said. 'You have the green card? This is a gold card. We're going to be putting a price on that card of about $5 million, and that's going to give you green card privileges plus. It's going to be a route to citizenship, and wealthy people will be coming into our country by buying this card.' The president did not explain what privileges a gold card holder would enjoy that green card holders do not. He also did not explain what he meant by a 'route to citizenship.' Trump said that in addition to wealthy foreigners who want to live in the United States, he believes that U.S. corporations will be willing to buy the cards so that they can hire talented workers from outside the country. 'Companies will pay for people to get in and to have long-term status in the country,' he said. There are already several pathways available to foreigners who want to come work in the U.S. The H1-B visa program allows thousands of skilled workers into the country every year. In addition, there are several visa programs that allow executives of international companies to live and work in the U.S. if they are transferred to a U.S. office or affiliate. EB-5 program targeted Commerce Secretary Lutnick said Tuesday that the administration plans to discontinue the existing EB-5 visa program, which he described as 'full of nonsense, make-believe and fraud.' The EB-5 program provides green card status to foreigners who invest $1,050,000 in companies in the U.S. that create at least 10 jobs. The amount can be lowered to $800,000 if the investment is made in certain types of infrastructure or in parts of the country the government has targeted for economic development. Lutnick appeared to say that the $5 million fee for a gold card would not have to go toward job-creating investment; instead, it would go directly into federal coffers. 'We can use that money to reduce our deficit,' he said. Higher bar for entry Shereen Chen, an immigration attorney who practices in New Jersey, told VOA that for many wealthy foreigners hoping to come to the U.S., the new rules could complicate the process. The current rules include a 'stringent vetting program' to ensure that money invested under the EB-5 program was earned legitimately, Chen said. The process is lengthy and difficult and will only become more so, Chen said, if the amount of money being vetted increases fivefold. The new program would have dire implications for Chinese nationals hoping to come to the U.S. While many Chinese have made use of the EB-5 program, tighter monetary controls in China have made doing so increasingly difficult. 'Right now, it's very hard for Chinese nationals to use the EB-5 program, even at $1,050,000, because it's very hard for them to get money out of China,' Chen said. Common practice The U.S. is far from alone in having policies on its books that allow wealthy foreigners to trade investment for residency privileges. Henley & Partners, a London-based consultancy that advises clients seeking international residency and citizenship options, tracks programs in more than 100 countries that offer some sort of investment-for-residence program. About 30 jurisdictions offer citizenship in exchange for investment, a deal commonly known as a 'golden passport.' In recent years, the European Union has been pressing member states with such programs to eliminate them out of concern that they abet illegal activity such as tax evasion and money laundering.	https://www.voanews.com/a/trump-5-million-gold-card-plan-sparks-immigration-confusion/7989783.html	2025-02-26T19:45:03-08:00	
Survey: Decline in number of US Christians is leveling off	WASHINGTON — The number of Americans who identify as Christian has declined steadily for years, but that drop shows signs of slowing, according to a new survey Wednesday from the Pew Research Center. The Religious Landscape Study finds 62% of U.S. adults call themselves Christians. While a significant dip from 2007, when 78% of Americans identified as Christian, Pew found the Christian share of the population has remained relatively stable since 2019. The rapid rise of the religiously unaffiliated — the so-called 'nones' — has also reached at least a temporary plateau, according to Pew. Approximately 29% of U.S. adults identify as religiously unaffiliated, including those who are atheist (5%), agnostic (6%) or 'nothing in particular' (19%). 'It's striking to have observed this recent period of stability in American religion after that long period of decline,' said Pew's Gregory Smith, one of the study's co-authors. 'One thing we can't know for sure is whether these short-term signs of stabilization will prove to be a lasting change in the country's religious trajectory.' By some measures, the U.S. remains overwhelmingly spiritual. Many Americans have a supernatural outlook, with 83% believing in God or a universal spirit and 86% believing that people have a soul or spirit. About seven in 10 Americans believe in heaven, hell or both. Young adults are less religious than their elders Despite this widespread spirituality, there are harbingers of future religious decline. Most notably, Pew found a huge age gap, with 46% of the youngest American adults identifying as Christian, compared to 80% of the oldest adults. The youngest adults are also three times more likely than the oldest group to be religiously unaffiliated. 'These kinds of generational differences are a big part of what's driven the long-term declines in American religion,' Smith said. 'As older cohorts of highly religious, older people have passed away, they have been replaced by new cohorts of young adults who are less religious than their parents and grandparents.' Michele Margolis, a University of Pennsylvania political scientist not affiliated with the Pew survey, has studied how religious involvement changes over a lifetime. Young adults frequently move away from religion. 'Then when you get married and have kids, this is a time where scholars have noted that religion is more likely to become important,' Margolis said. Margolis said one question going forward is whether the youngest American adults firmly reject organized religion, or if some of them will return to the religious fold as they age. Between 2007 and 2024, Pew religious landscape studies haven't indicated that Americans are growing more religious as they get older. Smith at Pew said 'something would need to change' to stop the long-term decline of American religion, whether that's adults becoming more religious with age or new generations becoming more religious than their parents. How partisan politics intertwines with religious identity The long-term decline of U.S. Christianity and rise of the 'nones' has occurred across traditions, gender, race, ethnicity, education and region. But it is much more evident among political liberals, according to Pew. The survey shows 51% of liberals claim no religion, up 24 points from 2007. Only 37% of U.S. liberals identify as Christian, down from 62% in 2007. Penny Edgell, a University of Minnesota sociologist and expert adviser for the Pew study, said this religious and political sorting aligns with whether people 'support traditional, patriarchal gender and family arrangements.' Edgell also notes that Black Americans defy the assumption that all Democrats are less religious than Republicans. 'More Black Americans percentagewise are Democrats, but their rates of religious involvement are still really high,' Edgell said. 'That has something to do with the way that religious institutions and politics have been intertwined in historically unique ways for different groups.' Roughly seven in 10 Black Protestants told Pew that religion is very important to them — about the same rate as evangelicals and members of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints. But Black Protestants are likely to identify as Democrats (72%), whereas evangelicals and Latter-day Saints are likely to identify as Republican (70% and 73%, respectively). The Pew survey tracks many religious traditions It's been nearly 10 years since the last Religious Landscape Study, which tracks religious data that the U.S. census does not. The new survey found that a majority of immigrants to the U.S. are Christian (58%), but they also follow the upward trend of the religiously unaffiliated, with a quarter of foreign-born U.S. adults claiming no religion. The number of Americans who belong to religions besides Christianity has been increasing, though it's still a small portion of the population (7%). That includes the 2% who are Jewish, and the 1% each who are Muslim, Buddhist or Hindu. Of U.S. Christian adults, 40% are Protestant and 19% are Catholic. The remaining 3% in Pew's survey include Latter-day Saints, Orthodox Christians, Jehovah's Witnesses and smaller Christian groups. The two largest Protestant denominations in the Pew survey remain the Southern Baptist Convention and the United Methodist Church – though both have lost many members since the first Religious Landscape Study in 2007. The Pew Religious Landscape Study was conducted in English and Spanish between July 2023 and March 2024, among a nationally representative sample of 36,908 respondents in all 50 states and the District of Columbia. The survey's margin of error for results based on the full sample is plus or minus 0.8 percentage points.	https://www.voanews.com/a/survey-decline-in-number-of-us-christians-is-leveling-off/7989782.html	2025-02-26T19:30:40-08:00	
Nigeria's counterterrorism center warns of threats, launches review of strategy	ABUJA, NIGERIA — Nigeria's National Counter Terrorism Center (NCTC) warns that terrorist groups are getting more sophisticated — using new technologies and exploiting political and economic grievances to expand their operations. In response, authorities have launched a review of the national anti-terrorism strategy to address emerging threats. The official anti-terror strategy document was first developed in 2014 and revised two years later. Authorities say this latest revision is necessary to reflect evolving security threats and ensure counterterrorism measures remain effective. 'The tactics used by non-state actors keep evolving and have become highly unpredictable,' said Major General Adamu Garba Laka, the national coordinator of the Counter Terrorism Center. 'Nigeria is grappling with the challenges of insecurity, thanks to the efforts made by personnel and agencies in charge of securing the lives of citizens, which has ensured the decline in the number of such incidences.' The review comes three months after Nigerian authorities warned that a new terror group, Lakurawa, has emerged in the northwest region. Authorities say terrorist organizations are increasingly using advanced technology — such as encrypted messaging apps, social media recruitment campaigns and drones — to enhance their operations. They also exploit poverty, political grievances and weak law enforcement in remote areas to recruit fighters and spread their ideology. Laka said the updated strategy will redefine the roles of government agencies involved in counterterrorism efforts. For well over a decade, Nigeria has struggled to curb violence from terrorist groups, including Boko Haram and its offshoot, the Islamic State West Africa Province (ISWAP). Since 2009, more than 35,000 people have been killed, and at least 2 million have been displaced. Although the overall number of terrorism-related deaths has declined in recent years, threats persist because of persistent poverty and poor governance. Security analyst Chidi Omeje said the increasing sophistication of terror groups is not surprising. 'I don't see it as something that we didn't expect. That's the reality of emerging security,' said Omeje. 'They have these links with terror networks, so they'll naturally grow in these proficiencies. So, it's up to us to devise ways to counter those technologies they're using.' Last month, terrorists attacked a military base near Nigeria's border with Niger, killing 20 soldiers. Security analyst Ebenezer Oyetakin argues that beyond reviewing counterterrorism strategies, authorities need to uncover terrorism financiers. 'When you take a look at the operation of al-Qaida, you compare it with ISIS — the way they move in their convoy — and then you compare it with Boko Haram, you'll see the semblance, which means they're too dynamic, they're not just a bunch of illiterates that are trying to make ends meet,' said Oyetakin. 'We should look for those behind them rather than contending with policies that are not sincerely being implemented.' Africa has become the global epicenter of terrorism, accounting for the highest number of terror-related deaths in 2023. Last April, Nigeria hosted the African Counter-Terrorism Summit, bringing together hundreds of experts and policymakers to develop a continent-wide strategy against terror groups. But for now, Nigerian authorities say their focus remains on strengthening the country's resilience against terrorism.	https://www.voanews.com/a/nigeria-s-counterterrorism-center-warns-of-threats-launches-review-of-strategy-/7989743.html	2025-02-26T18:53:14-08:00	
NYC resists federal call to stop its tolls to prevent traffic congestion	The Trump administration wants New York City to end its congesting pricing, an automatic toll program designed to reduce the bumper-to-bumper traffic in the city’s business area from 60th Street and below. But New York’s governor is fighting back. In a letter dated Feb. 20 and made public Wednesday, Gloria Shepherd, executive director of the Federal Highway Administration (FHWA), informed New York City and state transportation officials that FHWA officials would contact them 'to discuss the orderly cessation of toll operations' under the Central Business District Tolling Program. Shepherd said termination of the program should be effective March 21. New York Governor Kathy Hochul and the Metropolitan Transit Authority have filed a lawsuit to prevent ending the toll operation that the federal authorities approved and that has yielded millions of dollars for New York City since it began in January. Hochul told a recent MTA board meeting that while the federal government has called for an 'orderly cessation' of the program, she is proposing 'orderly resistance.' 'I guarantee that the president has never had to endure missing a child's sporting event because they were stuck on a delayed train. Never had to stand in a flooded subway station because we were not able to make the repairs. Not sitting in traffic, missing an important meeting because you couldn't get around,' Hochul told the MTA board. The congestion pricing program began Jan. 5. The revenue from the tolls from Jan. 5 to Jan. 31 totaled $48.66 million, with a net of $37.5 million. The toll program is on track to generate about $500 million for the MTA by year's end, MTA CEO Janno Lieber said, allowing the authority to progress with its plans for bus, subway and transit improvements. Some information for this report came from The Associated Press.	https://www.voanews.com/a/nyc-resists-federal-call-to-stop-its-tolls-to-prevent-traffic-congestion/7989739.html	2025-02-26T18:06:27-08:00	
Hamas returns bodies of 4 hostages; Israel releases more Palestinian prisoners	KHAN YOUNIS, GAZA STRIP — Hamas, a U.S.-designated terrorist group, delivered the bodies of four hostages to the Red Cross early Thursday in exchange for Israel's release of hundreds of Palestinian prisoners, days before the first phase of the ceasefire in the Gaza Strip will end. An Israeli security official confirmed that Hamas handed the bodies to the Red Cross. The official spoke on condition of anonymity pending a formal announcement. Around the same time, a Red Cross convoy carrying dozens of Palestinian prisoners left Israel's Ofer prison. Crowds of cheering families, friends and supporters of the prisoners were gathered in Beitunia, jostling for a glimpse of the bus that was on its way. Israel had delayed the release of more than 600 Palestinian prisoners since Saturday to protest what it called the cruel treatment of hostages during their handover by Hamas. The terrorist group had called the delay a 'serious violation' of the ceasefire and said talks on a second phase weren't possible until the Palestinians were freed. Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's office said Wednesday that the release of the bodies would be carried out without a ceremony, as opposed to past Hamas releases with stage-managed events in front of crowds. Israel, along with the Red Cross and U.N. officials, have called the ceremonies humiliating for the hostages. Israel releases hundreds Among those leaving Israel early Thursday were hundreds of detainees arrested from Gaza, held on suspicion of militancy after Hamas' October 7, 2023, attack, without charge for months. They included 445 men, 21 teenagers and one woman who were all arrested after the terror attack, according to lists shared by Palestinian officials that did not specify their ages. Only around 50 Palestinians were being released into the occupied West Bank and east Jerusalem in this round. Dozens sentenced to life over deadly attacks against Israelis will be exiled out of the Palestinian territories, taken to Egypt at least temporarily until other countries accept them. The handover will complete both sides' obligations under the ceasefire's first phase, during which Hamas returned 33 hostages, including eight bodies, in exchange for nearly 2,000 Palestinian prisoners. The family of a hostage in Gaza said it was notified he is dead, and his body was among those to be returned to Israel. The family did not say who informed them. Notifications typically come from Israel's military. Tsachi Idan was taken from Kibbutz Nahal Oz. His eldest daughter, Maayan, was killed as Hamas shot through the door of the safe room. French President Emmanuel Macron posted on X about Israeli French hostage Ohad Yahalomi, whose body was also expected to be released, 'In these suspended hours of pain and anguish, the nation stands by their side.' The ceasefire's six-week first phase expires this weekend. U.S. President Donald Trump's Middle East envoy, Steve Witkoff, has said he wants the sides to move into negotiations on the second phase, during which all remaining hostages held by Hamas would be released and an end to the war would be negotiated. Talks on the second phase were supposed to begin the first week of February. The ceasefire, brokered by the United States, Egypt and Qatar, ended 15 months of war that erupted after Hamas' 2023 attack on southern Israel that killed about 1,200 people. About 250 people were taken hostage. Israel's military offensive has killed more than 48,000 Palestinians, according to Palestinian health officials, who say over half the dead have been women and children. The fighting also displaced an estimated 90% of Gaza's population and decimated the territory's infrastructure and health system. Israel buries mother, sons killed in captivity On Wednesday, tens of thousands of Israelis lined highways as the bodies of a mother and her two young sons, killed in captivity in Gaza, were taken for burial on Wednesday. The bodies of Shiri Bibas and her sons, 9-month-old Kfir and 4-year-old Ariel, were handed over earlier this month. Israel says forensic evidence shows the children were killed by their captors in November 2023, while Hamas says the family was killed along with their guards in an Israeli airstrike. The husband and father, Yarden Bibas, was abducted separately and released alive in a different handover. His wife and their children were buried in a private ceremony near Kibbutz Nir Oz near Gaza, where they were living when they were abducted. They were buried in a joint grave next to Shiri's parents, who were killed in the attack. Infant dies of hypothermia in Gaza With people living in tent camps and damaged buildings in Gaza in chilly weather, health officials said another infant had died of hypothermia Wednesday, bringing the toll to seven over the past two weeks. Dr. Munir al-Boursh, director general of Gaza's Health Ministry, said the baby, less than 2 months old, died because of the 'severe cold wave' that has hit the Palestinian enclave. Temperatures have been below 10 degrees Celsius (50 degrees Fahrenheit) at night, and the last few days have been particularly cold.	https://www.voanews.com/a/hamas-returns-bodies-of-4-hostages-israel-releases-more-palestinian-prisoners-/7989697.html	2025-02-26T17:55:38-08:00	
Trump ends permit to export Venezuelan oil to US	CARACAS, VENEZUELA — A permit issued by the United States government allowing energy giant Chevron Corp. to pump and export Venezuelan oil will be terminated this week, President Donald Trump announced Wednesday, ending what became a financial lifeline for the South American country. Trump's announcement in his Truth Social network accused the government of President Nicolás Maduro of not meeting democratic conditions for last year's July presidential election as well as of not moving fast enough to transport back to Venezuela immigrants set for deportation. 'We are hereby reversing the concessions that Crooked Joe Biden gave to Nicolas Maduro, of Venezuela, on the oil transaction agreement,' Trump wrote. Trump's post did not specifically mention California-based Chevron nor the permit, formally known as a general license, that exempts the company from economic sanctions and allows it to export and sell Venezuelan oil in the U.S. But it is the only Venezuela-related license whose issuance and renewal information match the dates Trump did mention in his social media post. The administration of President Joe Biden authorized the license in 2022 after Maduro agreed to work with Venezuela's political opposition toward a democratic election. But the election, which took place in July 2024, was neither fair nor free, and Maduro was sworn in last month for a third six-year term despite credible evidence that his opponent got more votes. Biden's government resisted for months calls from Venezuela's opposition and others to rescind the license, whose goal the U.S. initially said was 'to support the restoration of democracy.' The opposition has estimated that Maduro's government has received about $4 billion through the permit, which was set to be renewed Saturday. Over time, the license has become responsible for roughly a quarter of Venezuela's oil production. 'We are aware of today's announcement and are considering its implications,' Chevron spokesperson Bill Turenne said in a statement. 'Chevron conducts its business in Venezuela in compliance with all laws and regulations, including the sanctions framework provided by U.S. government.' Venezuela sits atop the world's largest proven oil reserves and once used them to power Latin America's strongest economy. But corruption, mismanagement and eventual U.S. economic sanctions saw production decline steadily. More than 7.7 million Venezuelans have left their homeland since 2013, when the oil-dependent economy came undone, and Maduro became president. Most settled in Latin America and the Caribbean, but after the pandemic, they increasingly set their sights on the U.S. Chevron, which first invested in Venezuela in the 1920s, does business in the country through joint ventures with the state-owned company Petroleos de Venezuela S.A., commonly known as PDVSA. The joint ventures produced about 200,000 barrels of oil a day in 2019. The following year, U.S. sanctions imposed by Trump's first administration to try to topple Maduro forced Chevron to wind down production. When the company got the license to export oil to the U.S. in November 2022, the joint ventures quickly began producing 80,000 barrels a day, and by 2024, they topped their daily output from 2019. The terms of the license bar Chevron from directly paying taxes or royalties to Venezuela's government. But the company sends money to the joint ventures, which are majority-owned by PDVSA. It is unclear how Maduro's government used that money, because it stopped publishing almost all financial data several years ago. On Wednesday, opposition leader Maria Corina Machado in a podcast interview with Trump's son, Donald Trump Jr., accused Maduro of using the funds for 'for repression, persecution and corruption.' 'This is a huge step, and it sends a clear, clear, firm message that Maduro is in huge trouble,' she said.	https://www.voanews.com/a/trump-ends-permit-to-export-venezuelan-oil-to-us/7989727.html	2025-02-26T17:50:21-08:00	
Trump orders large federal layoffs; Musk to seek deeper spending cuts	washington — U.S. President Donald Trump's administration on Wednesday ordered federal agencies to undertake more large-scale layoffs of federal workers, as downsizing czar Elon Musk vowed at Trump's first Cabinet meeting to pursue deeper spending cuts. A new administration memo instructed agencies to submit plans by March 13 for a 'significant reduction' in staffing to the federal workforce. It did not specify numbers of desired layoffs. The memo, signed by White House budget director Russell Vought and Office of Personnel Management acting head Charles Ezell, represents a major escalation in Trump and Musk's campaign to slash the size of the U.S. government. Thus far, the layoffs have focused on probationary workers, who have less tenure in their current roles and enjoy fewer job protections. The next round would target the vastly bigger pool of veteran civil servants. At the Cabinet meeting, Trump said Lee Zeldin, the Environmental Protection Agency administrator, plans to cut up to 65% of his more than 15,000 employees. On Tuesday, an Interior Department source told Reuters that bureaus such as the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service and the Bureau of Indian Affairs should prepare for workforce reductions ranging from 10% to 40%. About 100,000 of the nation's 2.3 million civilian federal workers have been fired or taken buyouts since Trump took office. Trump gave Musk an extraordinary sign of support for the cost-cutting campaign by inviting the billionaire to the Cabinet meeting and asking him to speak about the work of his Department of Government Efficiency, which is overseeing the overhaul. DOGE is not a Cabinet-level department. Musk expressed confidence that he could cut the $6.7 trillion budget by $1 trillion this year. Such an ambitious target would likely entail significant disruption of government programs. Without such deep spending cuts, Musk said, 'the country will go de facto bankrupt.' Later Wednesday, Trump signed an executive order directing agencies to work with DOGE to review and terminate all 'unnecessary' contracts and instructing the General Services Administration, which manages the government's real estate, to create a plan for disposing of any unneeded property. Thus far, Trump and Musk have failed to slow the rate of spending. According to a Reuters analysis, the government spent 13% more during Trump's first month in office than during the same time last year, largely because of higher interest payments on the debt and rising health and retirement costs incurred by an aging population. Trump reiterated his promise to refrain from cutting popular health and retirement benefits that account for nearly half of the budget. 'We're not going to touch it,' Trump said. Trump is simultaneously pushing Congress to extend the 2017 tax cuts, the signature legislative accomplishment of his first term, which are set to expire at year's end. The nonpartisan Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget estimates the 2017 cuts added $2.5 trillion to the nation's debt — now $36 trillion. It estimated that extending the tax cuts could cost more than $5 trillion over a decade. Republicans are weighing cuts to health care and food aid for the poor to help pay for the tax cuts, though specifics have not yet emerged. Workers ‘on the bubble’ Some of the Cabinet secretaries were taken by surprise over the weekend when federal workers received an email requiring them to list their accomplishments for the week, a demand that Musk said would result in termination if ignored. Some agencies told employees to ignore the directive, prompting days of confusion over whether Musk and Trump could make good on the threat. Musk, the world's richest person, told the Cabinet meeting his email was an attempt to find out whether government paychecks were going to actual workers. 'We think there are a number of people on the government payroll who are dead,' he said, without providing evidence. Trump suggested that the roughly 1 million workers who did not respond to Musk's email might be at risk of losing their jobs. 'They are on the bubble,' he said, using a term that refers to a situation that has an uncertain outcome. Trump and Musk's unprecedented government overhaul has also frozen foreign aid and disrupted construction projects and scientific research. The GSA, informally known as the government's landlord, plans to terminate 1,100 leases for office space by the end of the year, according to a person briefed on the matter.	https://www.voanews.com/a/trump-orders-large-federal-layoffs-musk-to-seek-deeper-spending-cuts/7989725.html	2025-02-26T17:41:00-08:00	
A Ukrainian village works to recover after Russian occupation	Three years after Russian troops drove everyone in the village into a school basement for a month, the people of Yahidne, Ukraine, continue to repair and rebuild their homes. Lesia Bakalets visited this community about 90 kilometers north of Kyiv.

In Ukraine, resilience is key to three years of war coverage	WASHINGTON — In a flash protest to mark the third anniversary of Russia’s full-scale invasion of Ukraine, 20 coffins are laid out in Republic Square in Paris. The coffins —19 open and one closed — symbolize journalists held by Russia. The sealed coffin is a reference to Victoria Roshchyna, who died while in Russian detention under unclear circumstances. Overall, the conflict has contributed to 13 deaths of local and foreign journalists and 47 cases of journalists being injured as they cover the war, according to Reporters Without Borders, known as RSF. One Ukrainian journalist remains missing. Cases include Russian strikes on TV stations, gunfire, shelling and journalists being hit by Russian drones while covering Ukrainian military operations. Among those affected is Fox News journalist Benjamin Hall, who was seriously injured in an attack that killed two of his colleagues in March 2022. Hall told VOA the road to recovery has been hard. 'For the first six or seven months, I was at a military hospital in Texas. And when you are going through the traumatic recovery, and you're in the ICU, it's brutal,' Hall said. 'The amount of pain — you don't know what's coming ahead. But I found those to be some of the easiest moments.' Returning home, he says, and coming to terms not only with life-changing injuries, including an amputation, but also with the trauma has been harder than the immediate treatment for his injuries. The veteran correspondent was traveling to the village of Horenka outside of Kyiv with his colleagues, French video journalist Pierre Zakrzewski and Ukrainian journalist Oleksandra Kuvshynova, when a Russian mortar attack hit the vehicle two times. Hall was the only survivor. 'I had one goal, and that was to get home. And it was to get better and walk again, learn to walk again,' he said. 'Before, I was just this journalist. Suddenly, you are someone who was injured, and people see you in a different way. And I found that part of that recovery was a bit harder,' Hall added. Returning to journalism was a priority for his recovery. 'And so, as soon as I could, I was trying to get back in the field, and I returned to Ukraine,' he said. On Nov. 20, 2023, Hall returned to Ukraine and interviewed President Volodymyr Zelenskyy. The journalist traveled by train and said it was a milestone in his recovery. When he was evacuated after the shelling, he left on a train in critical health. Now he was returning on one. 'That in particular meant a lot to me,' he said. Covering the war in Ukraine changed Hall’s life, but he said the biggest impact is being made by local journalists on the ground — 'all journalists who cover conflict.' As a foreign correspondent, 'you go somewhere for a little bit, but you leave. I can only imagine the weight of being there day in, day out, and having to continue reporting for three years,' Hall said. That is where resilience comes in, said Pauline Maufrais, the Ukraine area manager for RSF. Local journalists put their lives at risk, work under very dangerous conditions and are under constant threat of being hit by shelling, drones or being kidnapped in occupied territories. 'All of them basically became war correspondents, in 2022,' Maufrais said. In wartime, it is hard to find accountability. Russia’s Defense Ministry informed Roshchyna’s family in October 2024 that she had died in custody. 'Since then, we are asking for answers. We're asking Russia to give us an explanation about what happened to Victoria,' Maufrais said. Russia has not yet given clarification on the cause of her death nor returned her body to her family. 'We want to know what happened. We want Russia to explain what happened to Victoria Roshchyna. And it is important that we continue working on that, and we [will] continue asking those questions until we have answers,' she added. Roshchyna, an International Women’s Media Foundation awardee for courage in journalism, disappeared in August 2023 while traveling to report on Russian-occupied territories. It was eight months before her family learned that she had been imprisoned. The 27-year-old journalist was due to be returned when her death was announced. In addition to journalists’ risks of physical safety are economical and logistical challenges, Maufrais said. 'Media outlets lacking professional journalists, many left Ukraine in exile; economic challenges; the destruction of communication towers and TV stations; as well as pressure from the Ukrainian government for those journalists who are covering corruption within the country,' said Maufrais. Maufrais said at least 329 media outlets have closed since the invasion, often because of a decrease in advertising revenue. For foreign correspondents like Hall, the experiences of covering the war have shaped his life. He recalled interviewing a young woman taken hostage on the Oct. 7, 2023, Hamas terrorist attack and held for months. 'I realized that throughout my whole career, I had never quite been able to understand people who had gone through these traumatic events, who had been in wars. But finally, I did. So, I think it made me a much better journalist,' Hall said.	https://www.voanews.com/a/in-ukraine-resilience-is-key-to-three-years-of-war-coverage/7989677.html	2025-02-26T16:21:26-08:00

UN voices concern over Sudan paramilitary's 'charter'	united nations — U.N. Security Council members expressed deep concern Wednesday over the announcement earlier this week by the Sudanese paramilitary Rapid Support Forces that it plans to establish a parallel governing authority in parts of the country under its control. 'This is a dangerous step that fuels further fragmentation in Sudan and derails ongoing efforts toward peace and dialogue,' said Algeria’s Deputy Ambassador Toufik Koudri on behalf of the three African members of the council plus Guyana. 'We call for these actions to be reversed and urge the RSF and their allies to put the unity and national interests of Sudan above all other considerations.' The RSF and allied political and armed groups signed a 16-page 'charter' in Kenya over the weekend to establish a governing authority. The rebels control much of western Sudan, including most of the Darfur region. Council diplomats said the African members — Algeria, Sierra Leone and Somalia — have proposed a draft statement for the council’s consideration expressing 'grave concern' over the development, reaffirming its commitment to Sudan’s unity and urging the parties to engage in negotiations. It would require the consensus of all 15 members. U.N. Secretary-General Antonio Guterres warned on Monday that the RSF’s move could deepen the nearly two-year-old civil war. Nearly every council member expressed concern and disapproval of the RSF’s move, which comes as the Sudanese Armed Forces (SAF) have been making progress in its bid to recapture districts in the greater Khartoum area, including Omdurman and Khartoum North. 'We support the restoration of civilian governance in a peaceful, unified Sudan. In this regard, we support efforts to promote a civilian political dialogue to foster a political process,' said U.S. political coordinator John Kelley. 'Attempts by the RSF and aligned actors to establish a government in RSF-controlled territory in Sudan are unhelpful for the cause of peace and security in Sudan and risk a de facto partition of the country.' 'Respect for Sudan’s [U.N.] Charter rights — its unity, sovereignty and territorial integrity — is vital and will be necessary for a sustainable end to this war,' said British Ambassador Barbara Woodward. She said Foreign Secretary David Lammy plans to convene 20 states and international organizations in London in April for talks on supporting a peaceful way forward for Sudan. South Korea’s envoy warned of the potential consequences of a fragmented Sudan, which is the continent’s third-largest country by size and home to 50 million people. 'The disintegration of such a vast, large nation would have profound and lasting ramifications and repercussions on the peace and prosperity of neighboring states and the wider region,' said Ambassador Hwang Joonkook. Sudan’s envoy, Al-Harith Idriss al-Harith Mohamed, criticized Kenya for allowing the signing of the RSF’s charter in its country, saying the agreement seeks to dismantle his country. 'I reiterate that neither President William Ruto nor the government of Kenya has recognized any independent entity in the Sudan or elsewhere,' Kenya’s Ambassador Erastus Lokaale responded in the council. 'Kenya believes strongly in availing the opportunity for dialogue and negotiations to diverse groups of Sudanese society and has remained consistent in its commitment to facilitate the expansion of Sudanese consensus across the political divide towards achieving a swift end to the conflict in the Sudan,' said Lokaale. Fighting continues The SAF-backed authorities have presented their own road map for ending the war that includes an inclusive national dialogue, the formation of a caretaker transitional government and the selection of a civilian prime minister. 'We call on the United Nations and the [U.N. secretary-general’s personal Sudan] envoy to support this road map, because it's the practical and realistic means to end the crisis,' Mohamed said. On Monday, the RSF announced a new assault on North Darfur’s embattled capital, El-Fasher, which is still held by the Sudanese military. 'But any ceasefire is rejected if El Fasher’s siege is not lifted,' Mohamed added. 'The rebels, within any agreement, must withdraw from the areas they continue to occupy because they target civilians and deliberately kill them.' The fighting in El Fasher, specifically in and around Zamzam displaced person’s camp, has caused the World Food Program to temporarily pause its distribution of critical food and nutrition assistance to the famine-affected camp. WFP said Wednesday that Zamzam’s market was destroyed by shelling, further hurting residents’ ability to access food. About a half million people live in the camp.

VOA Mandarin: Housing rents fall in major cities across China	TAIPEI, TAIWAN — A new survey by Chinese media shows that housing rents in Beijing, Shanghai and Shenzhen have fallen to 2015–2017 levels, while rents in Guangzhou, Chengdu and Tianjin have dropped to the early 2010s levels. Analysts attribute the decline in rents to falling household incomes, which have weakened demand.

VOA Mandarin: Xi's meeting with tech tycoons signals policy shift — but for how long?	WASHINGTON — Chinese President Xi Jinping's recent meeting with tech executives, including Jack Ma, signals a shift from regulatory crackdowns to a more supportive stance toward China's private sector. This follows China's cyclical pattern of tech regulation: initial leniency, strict crackdowns, and eventual relaxation to restore market confidence. The policy shift stems from economic concerns as China faces slowing growth and needs for the private sector to drive innovation and employment. While the tech sector enters a period of regulatory easing, the duration remains uncertain as China's regulatory pendulum could swing back if new economic or political concerns emerge.

Industry hails overdue Botswana-De Beers diamond deal	GABORONE, BOTSWANA — Experts have welcomed the signing of a long-delayed rough diamond sales agreement between Botswana and South African mining giant De Beers. Representatives of the Botswana government and De Beers put pen to paper Tuesday on a 10-year deal following six years of negotiations. Under the new agreement, Botswana will keep 30% of rough diamonds mined from a joint venture between the government and De Beers, up from 25% under the previous deal. In the following five years, Botswana’s share of the stones will rise to 40%. Meanwhile, De Beers’ mining licenses in Botswana have been extended to 2054. Local economist Keith Jefferis said concluding the deal was critical to the global diamond industry. '[It is] a very positive move that the deal has finally been reached,' Jefferis said. 'It will certainly help to bring some certainty to the global diamond industry. Overall, it’s a good deal for Botswana. To me, the most important part of that is the agreement that extends mining leases up to 2054 for the major mines, that is Jwaneng and Orapa [mines.]' President Duma Boko, speaking at the contract signing, said Botswana made a good deal. 'We are happy,' Boko said. 'We have traveled a long path of negotiations, and I have said, I have continued to maintain, that when you negotiate, you know that you have achieved a reasonable, equitable and fair outcome when all the parties to the negotiation come out of the negotiation crying and celebrating in equal measure.' Diamonds are the cornerstone of Botswana’s economy, accounting for around 80% of total export revenues. De Beers chief executive Al Cook said under the new contract, the diamond company will invest an initial $75 million in a diamond for development program. Cook emphasized Botswana and De Beers will work together to market the precious stones. 'Key to the partnership that we are agreeing today is a marketing partnership, a partnership for the first time,' he said, 'putting the resources, the brains, the capabilities of the Botswana government together with the brains, the people of the resources of De Beers, a marketing partnership that can tell the story of diamonds of Botswana.' The Kimberley Process Civil Society Coalition is an umbrella body that observes the global diamond trade to prevent the sale of so-called blood diamonds. Coalition coordinator Jeff Bamenjo said the signing of the deal is welcome but must bring tangible gains to the communities where the diamonds are mined. 'We have always said when diamonds are exploited, we expect benefits for the country and also for the local community,' Bamenjo said. The newly signed agreement comes as the diamond industry reels from a global slump in sales, amid sanctions on stones mined in Russia, the world’s largest producer.	https://www.voanews.com/a/industry-hails-overdue-botswana-de-beers-diamond-deal/7989389.html	2025-02-26T14:52:39-08:00	
Uzbekistan, Pakistan pledge to advance proposed railway link via Afghanistan	ISLAMABAD — Uzbekistan and Pakistan agreed to establish a tripartite committee with Afghanistan to address issues that are hindering the implementation of a proposed railway project connecting the three countries. Uzbek President Shavkat Mirziyoyev reported the development after delegation-level talks with Pakistan Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif in Tashkent, emphasizing the need to coordinate joint efforts to advance the trans-Afghan railway link. The three neighboring countries signed an agreement in February 2021 to construct a 573-kilometer (356-mile) railway line through Afghanistan, connecting landlocked Central Asia to Pakistani seaports, with an estimated cost of $4.8 billion to enhance regional economic connectivity. 'For the first time, we conducted comprehensive discussions [on the project],' Mirziyoyev said in remarks through his official interpreter broadcast live Wednesday on Pakistani state television. He noted that both sides agreed to form a tripartite committee to evaluate opportunities and address project challenges. The Uzbek leader stated that it was also central to discussions his government recently hosted with officials from Afghanistan. 'Now, we will have the tripartite [committee] meeting on resolving the problems,' said Mirziyoyev without elaborating. 'We know that this [project] is our future,' he added, calling it crucial for regional trade and travel. The Taliban’s return to power in Afghanistan in August 2021 and subsequent Western financial sanctions on the country briefly deterred Uzbekistan and Pakistan from advancing discussions on the railway connectivity project. Lately, Pakistan has accused the Taliban government, which is not recognized by any country, of harboring and facilitating militants responsible for terrorist attacks in the country. The ongoing violence has strained bilateral relations and prevented Islamabad from pursuing any meaningful economic partnership with Kabul, according to Pakistani officials. The Taliban reject allegations that foreign militant groups operate on their territory, saying that no one is allowed to use Afghan soil to threaten other countries. Sharif, speaking alongside Mirziyoyev, reiterated concerns about cross-border terrorism, emphasizing that militant groups should not use Afghan soil to launch attacks against other nations, including Pakistan. The Uzbek and Pakistani leaders announced Wednesday that they had also agreed to increase annual trade from more than $400 million to $2 billion and signed several agreements to deepen bilateral economic and trade ties. The two sides stated that they had discussed enhancing collaboration in agricultural, pharmaceuticals, machinery, geology, mineral resources, textiles, leather and other industries by exporting finished products to third-country markets. Islamabad and Tashkent also agreed to enhance air links with new flights planned between the largest Pakistani city of Karachi and the historic Uzbek cities of Samarkand and Bukhara.	https://www.voanews.com/a/uzbekistan-pakistan-pledge-to-advance-proposed-railway-link-via-afghanistan/7989378.html	2025-02-26T14:28:45-08:00	
US lawmakers seek compromise on government funding bills	U.S. President Donald Trump addressed concerns Wednesday that legislation funding the federal government past a March 14 deadline would include controversial cuts to social safety net programs such as Medicaid and Social Security. 'We're not going to touch it,' Trump told reporters, 'Now we are going to look for fraud. I'm sure you're OK with that, like people that shouldn't be off, people that are illegal aliens and other criminals.' Those cuts are one of the issues lawmakers are racing to resolve before a short-term spending bill runs out in just over two weeks. The House of Representatives passed a budget resolution 217-215 late Tuesday when Speaker of the House Mike Johnson secured enough votes from within his party. 'We promised to deliver President [Donald] Trump's full agenda, not just a part of it, not just a little bit of it now and return for the rest,' Johnson told reporters earlier Tuesday. The House and Senate bills will now have to be compromised to be signed into law. Before the vote, several members of the House Republican conference were still concerned about the size of the spending measure, how and when to enact a proposed extension of the 2017 tax cuts, and the political impact of cutting social safety net programs that benefit many American voters. 'Not only are we working to find savings for the American taxpayer, a better, more efficient use of their dollar, which we are morally obligated to do, we also have a moral obligation to bend the curve on the debt,' Johnson said Tuesday. Trump has called for lawmakers to pass 'one big, beautiful bill' that will be a key part of enacting his domestic policy agenda. Despite Trump expressing his preference for the House version of the budget, the Senate last week passed a funding resolution that provides $150 billion in military funding and $175 billion for border security. That measure also avoids the controversial Medicaid cuts of the House version. In a statement Wednesday, Senate Budget Committee Chairman Lindsey Graham warned, 'Time is of the essence when it comes to border security. ICE will run out of money in weeks, not months. Stalling President Trump's border security agenda is not only bad politics, it is dangerous.' Trump posted on Truth Social last week that 'The House and Senate are doing a SPECTACULAR job of working together as one unified, and unbeatable, TEAM, however, unlike the Lindsey Graham version of the very important Legislation currently being discussed, the House Resolution implements my FULL America First Agenda, EVERYTHING, not just parts of it!' If lawmakers cannot reach a compromise by March 14, there will be a partial government shutdown, leaving millions of federal employees temporarily without pay and suspending some nonessential government services. Senate Majority Leader John Thune did not rule out the possibility of another short-term spending bill to give lawmakers more time to work. 'We're keeping all the options on the table, but we are running out of time,' Thune told reporters Tuesday. The Senate moved forward with a vote on its version of the budget due to uncertainty over the potential success of the vote on the House version. Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer characterized the vote as a first step toward hurting voters. 'Last night, almost every single House Republican signed their names to what would be the largest Medicaid cuts in American history. The havoc, the damage that would do to tens of millions of American families would be almost unprecedented when it comes to Medicaid,' Schumer said on the Senate floor Wednesday. 'The Republican agenda is quickly taking shape: Under Donald Trump's Republican Party, billionaires win, American families lose,' Schumer said.	https://www.voanews.com/a/us-lawmakers-seek-compromise-on-government-funding-bills/7989287.html	2025-02-26T13:12:55-08:00	
What we know about Congo illness that has sickened 400, killed 50	KINSHASA, CONGO — Unidentified illnesses in northwestern Congo have killed more than 50 people over the past five weeks, nearly half of them within hours after they felt sick. The outbreaks in two distant villages in Congo's Equateur province began on Jan. 21 and include 419 cases and 53 deaths. Health officials still do not know the cause, or whether the cases in the two villages, which are separated by more than 190 kilometers (118 miles), are related. It's also unclear how the diseases are spreading, including whether they are spreading between people. The first victims in one of the villages were children who ate a bat and died within 48 hours, the Africa office of the World Health Organization said this week. More infections were found in the other village, where at least some of the patients have malaria. Outbreaks in two remote villages Illnesses have been clustered in two remote villages in different health zones of Equateur province, which is 640 kilometers (398 miles) from Kinshasa. The first outbreak began in the village of Boloko after three children ate a bat and died within 48 hours. More than two weeks later a second and larger outbreak was recorded in the village of Bomate, where more than 400 people have been sickened. According to WHO's Africa office, no links have been established between the cases in the two villages. Dr. Serge Ngalebato, medical director of Bikoro Hospital, a regional monitoring center, and one of the government experts deployed to respond to the outbreak, says the situations in the two villages are somewhat different. 'The first one with a lot of deaths, that we continue to investigate because it's an unusual situation, (and) in the second episode that we're dealing with, we see a lot of the cases of malaria,' said Ngalebato. The WHO Africa office said the quick progression from sickness to death in Boloko is a key concern, along with the high number of deaths in Bomate. What are the symptoms? Congo's Ministry of Health said about 80% of the patients share similar symptoms including fever, chills, body aches and diarrhea. While these symptoms can be caused by many common infections, health officials initially feared the symptoms and the quick deaths of some of the victims could also be a sign of a hemorrhagic fever such as Ebola, which was also linked to an infected animal. However, Ebola and similar diseases including Marburg have been ruled out after more than a dozen samples were collected and tested in the capital of Kinshasa. The WHO said it is investigating a number of possible causes, including malaria, viral hemorrhagic fever, food or water poisoning, typhoid fever and meningitis. What is being done in response? Congo's government says experts have been sent to the villages since Feb. 14, mainly to help investigate the cases and slow the spread. Ngalebato said patients have been responding to treatments that target the different symptoms. The remote location of the villages has hindered access to patients while the weak health care infrastructure has made it difficult to carry out surveillance and manage patients. Such challenges are common in disease outbreaks in Congo. In December, an unknown illness killed dozens. In the latest outbreaks, several victims died before experts could even reach them, Ngalebato said. There needs to be urgent action 'to accelerate laboratory investigations, improve case management and isolation capacities, and strengthen surveillance and risk communication,' the WHO Africa office has said. The United States has been the largest bilateral donor to Congo's health sector and supported the training of hundreds of field epidemiologists to help detect and control diseases across the vast country. The outbreaks were detected as the Trump administration put a freeze on foreign aid during a 90-day review. Is there a link to Congo's forests? There have long been concerns about diseases jumping from animals to humans in places where people regularly eat wild animals. The number of such outbreaks in Africa has surged by more than 60% in the last decade, the WHO said in 2022. Experts say this might be what is happening in Congo, which is home to about 60% of the forests in the Congo Basin, home to the largest expanse of tropical forest on Earth. 'All these viruses are viruses that have reservoirs in the forest. And so, as long as we have these forests, we will always have a few epidemics with viruses which will mutate,' said Gabriel Nsakala, a professor of public health at Congo's National Pedagogical University, who previously worked at the Congolese health ministry on Ebola and coronavirus response programs.	https://www.voanews.com/a/what-we-know-about-congo-illness-that-has-sickened-400-killed-50/7989291.html	2025-02-26T13:01:18-08:00	
Security experts highlight pros, cons of Ukraine-US minerals deal	Ukraine and the United States are set to sign a landmark minerals agreement, marking a significant step toward strengthening economic ties between the two nations. However, security experts tell VOA that concerns persist about the broader implications of the deal. Ukraine’s Cabinet of Ministers approved the agreement Wednesday and U.S. President Donald Trump confirmed that Ukrainian leader Volodymyr Zelenskyy will visit the White House on Friday to sign it. The deal includes provisions for the co-ownership and management of a post-war reconstruction fund for Ukraine, to which Ukraine will allocate 50% of future revenues from the country’s natural resources. The agreement states that the U.S. will maintain a 'long-term financial commitment to the development of a stable and economically prosperous Ukraine.' The deal makes no direct reference to efforts to end Russia’s invasion of Ukraine, though, or about future security arrangements for the Eastern European country, apart from a single line: 'The Government of the United States of America supports Ukraine’s efforts to obtain security guarantees needed to establish lasting peace.' While the deal aims to unlock Ukraine’s mineral wealth and bolster its economic recovery, security experts warn it may fall short in addressing Ukraine’s ongoing security challenges amid continued Russian aggression. American business perspective Andy Hunder, president of the American Chamber of Commerce in Ukraine, explained to VOA by telephone that the deal aims to establish a new American-Ukrainian fund, focusing on state-owned enterprises and Ukraine's rich subsoil resources, including gas, oil, and critical minerals. A representative of American business in Ukraine, Hunder expressed optimism about the agreement's potential impact: 'We’re excited. Professional fund managers can turn these enterprises profitable very quickly. This is a win-win for both Ukrainian and American taxpayers,' he told VOA on Wednesday. Hunder said the fund could unlock profits rapidly by introducing professional management to Ukraine's state-owned enterprises, which currently face mismanagement issues. 'Ukraine has the second highest number of state-owned enterprises in the world, many of which are being managed, or some are being mismanaged, by the Ukrainian state. So, I think we get new professional fund managers into these entities, and this is where you could seal profits and turn them around very, very quickly,' he said. Hunder revealed that discussions about Ukrainian economic potential were high on the agenda between the two countries in 2024, '[s]tarting when Senator Lindsey Graham came in March and May of 2024, and we have looked into this, and we see opportunity.' 'To take advantage of this opportunity, the war must end, and this deal, in his view, is a step toward a peaceful solution. I think this is really what the new administration under President Trump is focusing on — finding ways to stop the killing of Ukrainians by the Russians. We do expect a ceasefire this year, in 2025, and now is the time when Ukraine will present the biggest opportunity, the largest recovery, and the reconstruction of a nation in Europe since World War II,' he said to VOA. Roman Opimakh, former general director of the Ukrainian Geological Survey. agrees the deal could benefit both countries. It will help the U.S. to diversify its rare metal supply and 'decrease dependence on China,' he said. For Ukraine, he said, the deal could enable post-war re-industrialization and economic growth. We can renew the industrial potential of our country and actually increase the role of Ukraine globally,' Opimakh said by phone. While the deal indicates strong U.S. interest in Ukraine's economic future, security experts caution that it is not a comprehensive solution to Ukraine’s security challenges. Former defense minister Andriy Zagorodnyuk, now the chairman of the Center for Defense Strategies in Ukraine, told VOA in a phone call the deal has broader implications: 'The U.S. framed this deal as a demonstration of vested interest in Ukraine, signaling support for Ukrainian stability. Investments of this scale serve as anchor investments, potentially attracting more resources to Ukraine’s economy.' Zagorodnyuk cautioned that economic ties are 'not enough' to guarantee Ukrainian sovereignty in the face of Russian aggression. To deter future attacks, Ukraine needs military power — either on its own or in partnership with NATO and European allies, he stated to VOA. 'We recognize that Russia might be attempting to manipulate the situation and convey to Trump's administration that even if they continue their aggression for any reason, they would still respect American interests or something like that,' he said. Asked by VOA what Ukraine needs from the U.S. for long-term security, Zagorodnyuk said ideally, the country would have NATO. However, 'if NATO isn’t an option, there should be a package that enables Ukraine to defend against aggression. This package must be robust, and that strength needs to be clear to [Russian President Vladimir] Putin,' he said. Agreement details According to VOA sources, who cannot be named because they are not authorized to speak about the matter, negotiations concerning the details of the deal continued right up to the Cabinet ministers’ meeting late Wednesday afternoon, Kyiv time. According to news reports, Ukraine negotiated more favorable terms than the U.S. originally proposed, bringing down an initial U.S. demand for a $500 billion claim on its natural resources. The deal does not include explicit U.S. security guarantees, which Kyiv had originally sought. The U.S. will maintain decision-making authority within the fund under its own legal framework, with ownership terms to be defined in later agreements. Geopolitical ramifications Despite praising the agreement as a step toward strengthening Ukraine's economy, Trump sparked controversy recently by labeling Zelenskyy a 'dictator' without elections and pressuring him to finalize the deal quickly. The U.S. administration has described the deal as a way for the U.S. to recover tens of billions of dollars in military aid sent to Ukraine. The question remains whether this economic partnership also can foster lasting peace and stability in Ukraine.	https://www.voanews.com/a/security-experts-highlight-pros-cons-of-ukraine-us-minerals-deal-/7989174.html	2025-02-26T11:50:15-08:00

US, Ukraine near minerals deal, but security issues unsettled	The United States said Wednesday it is nearing a deal on Ukraine’s lucrative rare earth minerals needed for technology products to compensate Washington for the more than $100 billion worth of munitions it has sent to Kyiv to defend itself against Russia’s three-year war of aggression. 'We’re very close to the finish line,' White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt told reporters. In Kyiv, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy said at a news conference that the framework of an economic deal is complete, but that U.S. security guarantees for Ukraine that the Kyiv government views as vital have yet to be settled. Zelenskyy is expected to visit Washington on Friday for talks with President Donald Trump, who has long expressed skepticism about continued U.S. military support for Ukraine. In recent weeks, he has refused to say he wants Ukraine to win the war and has initiated talks with Russian President Vladimir Putin without Kyiv’s involvement to settle the conflict that started with Russia’s invasion three years ago this week. Trump said Tuesday of Zelenskyy, 'Certainly, it’s okay with me if he’d like to' visit the White House. 'He would like to sign [the economic deal] together with me. I understand that. It’s a big deal.' Trump has called Zelenskyy a dictator, without blaming Putin for the invasion. The U.S. leader has said he is particularly peeved that his predecessor, former President Joe Biden, agreed to the Ukraine military assistance without any provision that Ukraine would pay back the cost. Biden led the coalition of Western allies in providing the military aid to fight Russian aggression without sending their own troops to fight alongside Ukrainian forces. Zelenskyy says the U.S. military aid was a grant and not a loan that needed to be repaid. Zelenskyy said he expects to have wide-ranging substantive discussions with Trump. 'I want to coordinate with the U.S.,' Zelenskyy said. The Ukrainian leader said he wants to know whether the U.S. plans to halt military aid and, if so, whether Ukraine would be able to purchase weapons directly from the U.S. He also wants to know whether Ukraine can use frozen Russian assets for weapons investments and whether Washington plans to lift its economic sanctions on Russian entities and high-level associates and friends of Putin. Elements of the deal Earlier, Ukrainian Prime Minister Denys Shmyhal told the country’s public television channel that Ukraine and the United States had reached preliminary agreement on the broad rare earth minerals deal and that it would be signed. The preliminary agreement sets out the terms and conditions of an investment fund for the rebuilding of Ukraine, Shmyhal said. Under terms of the deal, the plan would include investing 50% of proceeds from Ukraine’s minerals, oil and gas to create a 'stable and economically prosperous Ukraine' if the war is ended, and half to a U.S.-controlled fund. The New York Times reported the economic agreement includes a line that says the U.S. 'supports Ukraine’s effort to obtain security guarantees needed to establish lasting peace' but does not spell out details on what that might entail. British Prime Minister Keir Starmer is meeting with Trump on Wednesday in Washington to spell out a European initiative for a 30,000-person peacekeeping force to enforce a Russian ceasefire with Ukraine if such a truce can be reached, although no peace talks have been scheduled. European leaders have said a peacekeeping force would require an American 'backstop' of military assistance, such as American satellite surveillance, air defense or air force support. Trump has not committed the U.S. to such a plan.

New app lets homebuyers know about future neighbor’s politics	Most homebuyers get to know the people who live next door after they move in. But a new real estate app allows future homebuyers to learn a potential neighbor’s political leanings before they make what, for many people, is the biggest purchase of their life. 'The purpose of Oyssey [the app] is to democratize data for buyers in their home search experience … to get you, as a prospective buyer, a feel for the area and community,' says Darian Kelly, co-founder of Oyssey. 'It's to get you to the understanding of, when I move here, these are the type of people that I might be inviting over for dinner. The type of people that I will be raising my child alongside.' The Oyssey data is pulled from sources like election results, campaign contributions and information from marketing research firms. The app has only launched in Florida and New York so far, but its founders say they expect to take it nationwide later this year. Realtors subscribe to Oyssey and then give their homebuyer clients access to the service. For the initial launch, the platform breaks down political affiliation block by block, but Kelly says potential homebuyers will eventually be able to look up whether their prospective new neighbor is a registered Democrat or Republican. Ben McCartney, an assistant professor of commerce at the University of Virginia, co-authored a study published in 2024 that found that 1 of every 100 moves is politically motivated, and that the people most likely to relocate for this reason tend to be less involved in politics. 'They don't want politics to be part of their everyday life, but then they get a new neighbor, and that new neighbor is not only very politically vocal, but also affiliated with the opposite party, and there's where we see the strongest tensions arise,' McCartney says. The study found that current residents are slightly more likely to move away if they get new neighbors with different political views than if the new neighbor is affiliated with the same political party. 'So, political polarization isn't just a social media phenomenon but is affecting real economic decisions, as well,' McCartney says. The study found the numbers of Democrats and Republicans who wanted to move away from neighbors with different political views to be roughly even. That’s why an app like Oyssey makes sense to McCartney. 'People do seem to care about the political identities of their new neighbors, so I'm not surprised that some company is now selling that information, or providing that information, to would-be buyers,' he says. 'And I tend to be supportive of policies that make it easier for people to make informed decisions.' The Oyssey platform also provides other data relating to quality of life for the individual homebuyer, such as where to find the most dog parks. 'Where is the area with the most registered dogs throughout their state or county?' Kelly says. 'And we can try to get an idea and figure out where do the dogs live, because as a pet owner, that’s where I want to be.' He dismisses any suggestion that Oyssey could contribute to deepening America’s political divide. 'I actually get upset by the question. … I think the question makes the assumption that you shouldn't be the driver, you shouldn't be the writer of your own story,' Kelly says. 'We believe that we're giving people the data and the information to control their own destiny and do what they will with that information. The data already exists.' Oyssey’s stated goal is to make that public information easier to find.	https://www.voanews.com/a/new-app-lets-homebuyers-know-about-future-neighbor-s-politics-/7988658.html	2025-02-26T09:42:22-08:00

First measles death reported in West Texas outbreak that's infected more than 120 people	LUBBOCK, TEXAS — A person who was hospitalized with measles has died from measles in West Texas, the first death in an outbreak that began late last month. Texas Tech University Health Sciences Center spokesperson Melissa Whitfield confirmed the death Wednesday. It wasn't clear the age of the patient, who died overnight. Covenant Children's Hospital in Lubbock didn't immediately respond to a request for comment. The measles outbreak in rural West Texas has grown to 124 cases across nine counties, the state health department said Tuesday. There are also nine cases in eastern New Mexico. Measles is a respiratory virus that can survive in the air for up to two hours. Up to 9 out of 10 people who are susceptible will get the virus if exposed, according to the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. Most kids will recover from the measles if they get it, but infection can lead to dangerous complications like pneumonia, blindness, brain swelling and death. The outbreak is largely spreading in the Mennonite community in an area where small towns are separated by vast stretches of oil rig-dotted open land but connected due to people traveling between towns for work, church, grocery shopping and other day-to-day errands.	https://www.voanews.com/a/first-measles-death-reported-in-west-texas-outbreak-that-s-infected-more-than-120-people/7988850.html	2025-02-26T07:39:01-08:00	
US will spend up to $1 billion to combat bird flu, USDA secretary says	WASHINGTON — The U.S. will invest up to $1 billion to combat the spread of bird flu, including increasing imports of eggs, agriculture secretary Brooke Rollins said on Wednesday. A three-year bird flu outbreak in U.S. poultry has killed 166 million chickens since 2022, according to USDA data. The virus has also infected nearly 1,000 dairy herds and almost 70 people, including one death, since early 2024. The USDA will spend up to $500 million to provide free biosecurity audits to farms and $400 million to increase payment rates to farmers who need to kill their chickens due to bird flu, Rollins said at a conference of state agriculture officials. Some of the money will come from cuts to USDA spending by Elon Musk's Department of Government Efficiency, Rollins said in a Wednesday Wall Street Journal op-ed. The USDA is exploring vaccines for chickens but is not yet authorizing their use, Rollins said. The poultry industry is divided on whether to vaccinate chickens because of potential trade implications. The administration plans to increase imports and decrease exports of eggs to boost domestic supply and combat record high egg prices, Rollins said. Turkey has said it will export 15,000 tons of eggs to the U.S. through July. In May, the administration of former president Joe Biden allocated more than $800 million to combat bird flu in livestock. About $450 million of that money is still available, a USDA official said on Tuesday at the National Association of State Departments of Agriculture conference.	https://www.voanews.com/a/us-will-spend-up-to-1-billion-to-combat-bird-flu-usda-secretary-says/7988809.html	2025-02-26T07:13:29-08:00	
WFP pauses food aid in famine-hit Sudan refugee camp	ROME — The U.N. World Food Program said Wednesday that it was forced to suspend operations in and around the famine-hit Zamzam displacement camp in Sudan’s North Darfur because of escalating violence. 'Intense fighting in Zamzam camp in Sudan’s North Darfur region has forced' the Rome-based agency 'to temporarily pause the distribution of life-saving food and nutrition assistance in the famine-hit camp for displaced people.' 'Over the past two weeks escalating violence left WFP’s partners with no choice but to evacuate staff for safety,' it said in a statement. Fighting between the army and the paramilitary Rapid Support Forces, or RSF, intensified this month in the camp, which the United Nations says shelters more than half a million people. 'Without immediate assistance, thousands of desperate families in Zamzam could starve in the coming weeks,' said Laurent Bukera, WFP’s regional director for Eastern Africa and acting country director for Sudan. 'We must resume the delivery of life-saving aid in and around Zamzam safely, quickly and at scale. For that, the fighting must stop and humanitarian organizations must be granted security guarantees,' Bukera said. The RSF stormed Zamzam on Feb. 11, triggering two days of clashes with the army and allied militias and forcing about 10,000 families to flee, according to the International Organization for Migration. 'The recent violence left Zamzam’s Central Market destroyed by shelling, pushing residents of the camp ... further away from accessing essential food and supplies,' the WFP statement said. Famine was first declared in Zamzam in August and has since spread to two more displacement camps near the North Darfur capital of El-Fasher. It is expected to expand to five more areas, including El-Fasher itself, by May, according to a U.N.-backed assessment. Before the latest violence, around 1.7 million people were displaced in North Darfur alone, with 2 million civilians facing extreme food insecurity, the United Nations said. Established in 2004, Zamzam has received waves of displaced Sudanese during the current war.	https://www.voanews.com/a/wfp-pauses-food-aid-in-famine-hit-sudan-refugee-camp/7988796.html	2025-02-26T07:11:42-08:00	
IAEA: Iran’s stock of near-bomb-grade uranium grows sharply	VIENNA — Iran’s stock of uranium enriched to near weapons grade has grown sharply since it announced a dramatic acceleration in December and there has been no progress on resolving outstanding issues, two reports by the U.N. nuclear watchdog showed on Wednesday. The stock of uranium enriched to up to 60% fissile purity, close to the roughly 90% of bomb grade, has been a long-standing concern for Western powers, which say there is no civil justification for enriching uranium to such a high level. Iran says it seeks only peaceful nuclear energy. While U.S. President Donald Trump’s administration has said it plans to pressure Iran over its nuclear program, the International Atomic Energy Agency has said time is running out for diplomacy to impose new restrictions on Iran’s activities. Two quarterly reports sent by the IAEA to member states showed that while the stock of 60% material has grown by around half, there has been no real progress on resolving long-running issues with Iran, including the unexplained presence of uranium traces found at undeclared sites. 'The significantly increased production and accumulation of high enriched uranium by Iran, the only non-nuclear weapon state to produce such nuclear material, is of serious concern,' the IAEA said in a passage that, unusually, was included in both reports. The stock of uranium refined to up to 60% in the form of uranium hexafluoride grew by 92.5 kilograms in the past quarter, to 274.8 kilograms, one of two confidential IAEA reports said. That is enough in principle, if enriched further, for six nuclear bombs, according to an IAEA yardstick. There is enough for more weapons at lower enrichment levels. One of the reports also spelled out the lack of progress on the outstanding issues such as explaining the uranium traces, which the IAEA has been asking the Islamic Republic to do for years. 'Iran states that it has declared all of the nuclear material, activities and locations required under its Safeguards Agreement. This is inconsistent with the Agency’s assessments of the unexplained nuclear-related activities that took place at all four of the undeclared locations in Iran referred to above,' the report said. 'The Agency is, therefore, at an impasse with regard to resolving these outstanding safeguards issues.'	https://www.voanews.com/a/iaea-iran-s-stock-of-near-bomb-grade-uranium-grows-sharply/7988745.html	2025-02-26T06:36:46-08:00	
Manbij will never have rest,' Syrian resident says amid war in north	Since the Syrian civil war mostly ended in December, fighting has continued outside the city of Manbij, where car bombs have killed dozens.

EU will ask India to cut tariffs on cars, wine to boost ties, reduce reliance on China	NEW DELHI — The European Union plans to urge India to lower its high tariffs on cars and wine to boost trade, as it seeks to reduce its reliance on China, a senior official from the bloc said, ahead of a visit by the European Commission president to New Delhi. Echoing U.S. President Donald Trump's threat of reciprocal tariffs, the official said the EU would press India to cut tariffs on some goods and broaden market access for its products, while offering flexibility on agriculture issues to expedite free trade agreement talks. 'The Indian market is relatively closed, especially to key products of commercial interest to the European Union and our member states’ industries, including cars, wines and spirits,' said the official, who requested anonymity due to the confidential nature of the discussions. EC President Ursula von der Leyen's two-day visit from Thursday, accompanied by leaders of EU member nations, coincides with escalating geopolitical tensions, with Brussels and New Delhi set to outline key areas for deeper cooperation under their strategic partnership. Leyen will meet Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi on Friday, followed by discussions with trade minister Piyush Goyal. The next trade negotiations round is scheduled for March 10-14 in Brussels. The EU's call for lower tariffs comes amid Trump's threats to impose reciprocal tariffs from early April, which has caused anxiety for India's exporters. Analysts from Citi Research estimate potential losses of about $7 billion annually. The EU is India's largest trading partner in goods, with trade nearing $126 billion in 2024, marking an increase of about 90% over the past decade. Reducing reliance on China As part of its 'de-risking' strategy, the EU aims to strengthen economic and security ties with India, diversify supply chains, and reduce reliance on key products from China. The EU also views India as a vital ally in addressing security challenges, the official said, including cyber threats and tensions in the South China Sea and Indo-Pacific. Leyen is also expected to seek India's support for a 'peaceful and just deal' for Ukraine's security, the official said. The EU and India could sign an agreement to share classified security information to tackle common threats such as cyber attacks and terrorism, while exploring defense equipment trade. Despite these potential benefits, trade analysts said the visit may not yield tangible results. For substantial cooperation, the EU should acknowledge India as a data-secure country, said Ajay Srivastava, founder of the Delhi-based think-tank Global Trade Initiative, and India's former negotiator on trade talks with the EU. 'While both parties have concerns about China, neither sees it as a top priority,' Srivastava said, adding India is focused on border tensions with China, while the EU is more concerned with the Ukraine-Russia conflict and NATO matters.	https://www.voanews.com/a/eu-will-ask-india-to-cut-tariffs-on-cars-wine-to-boost-ties-reduce-reliance-on-china-/7988575.html	2025-02-26T03:49:27-08:00	
Philippine police rescue kidnapped teen, hunt ex-gambling site operators	Manila — A young kidnap victim clad in pajamas and missing a finger was rescued from the side of a busy Manila thoroughfare this week after his abductors ditched him during a police pursuit, Philippine authorities said Wednesday. The kidnappers, like their teenaged target, were Chinese nationals, said the interior department's Juanito Victor Remulla, and part of a 'sophisticated' syndicate with ties to the now-banned offshore gambling sites known locally as POGOs. Notorious as fronts for human trafficking, money laundering and fraud, POGOs were banned by President Ferdinand Marcos last year, sending those who worked for them in search of new income streams. 'We are definite that the syndicate behind the kidnapping were former POGO operators,' Remulla told reporters, adding those involved had lost a lucrative living when the sites were shuttered. The kidnappers tried and failed to obtain a ransom -- at one point sending the parents a video of the victim's finger being severed -- before they were tracked down on Tuesday and pursued by police who homed in on their cellphone signal. 'The choice was pursuing the vehicle or securing the child. Obviously, the [police] prioritized the child,' Remulla said. A manhunt remains underway. The boy's driver, who had picked him up outside an exclusive private school days earlier, was found murdered inside another vehicle in Bulacan province north of Manila. 'These [cases] arose in January after all POGOs were closed; they got into kidnapping,' Remulla said, without providing statistics. AFP is aware of at least two other kidnapping cases involving Chinese nationals living in the Philippines this year. While describing the incident as 'Chinese against Chinese' crime, Remulla said disaffected former Filipino police or soldiers were likely used as foot soldiers in some cases. Gilberto Cruz, chief of the Philippines' anti-organized crime commission, told AFP that government figures showed there were still about 11,000 Chinese nationals in the country after the gambling sites they worked for were shuttered. 'Some have turned to other crimes, but we can't provide numbers as of now,' he said, before adding that some had likely ventured into 'kidnapping operations.' At a press conference on Wednesday, the immigration department said about 300 foreign nationals linked to POGOs were being held at a detention facility built for 100 while awaiting deportation. In a separate statement, the department said 98 Chinese nationals had been repatriated to China aboard a chartered Philippine Airlines flight on Tuesday night. The Chinese embassy said the joint repatriation marked 'another step in the law enforcing cooperation of the two countries after the ban on POGOs.'	https://www.voanews.com/a/philippine-police-rescue-kidnapped-teen-hunt-ex-gambling-site-operators-/7988566.html	2025-02-26T03:36:34-08:00	
Sudanese army plane crashes in residential area, 46 killed	DUBAI, United Arab Emirates — Forty-six people were killed when a Sudanese army plane crashed in a residential area near a military airport in the capital's twin city Omdurman, the Khartoum state media office said, and military sources said a senior commander was among the dead. The crash took place late on Tuesday near the Wadi Sayidna military airport in northern Omdurman. The Sudanese army had said several military personnel and civilians were killed, but did not provide further details. Military sources said the plane crash was most likely due to technical reasons. The media office said 10 people were also injured. Among those killed was Major General Bahr Ahmed, a senior commander in Khartoum who previously served as the commander of the army across the entire capital, military sources said.	https://www.voanews.com/a/sudanese-army-plane-crashes-in-residential-area-46-killed/7988539.html	2025-02-26T02:49:48-08:00	
Absences and disputes mar G20 finance chiefs' talks	CAPE TOWN, South Africa — A number of finance ministers skipped a gathering of the Group of 20 top economies in South Africa on Wednesday, and other top officials curtailed trips to a meeting marred by disputes over the main issues of climate, debt and inequality. Agreeing on a declaration has always been tough for a gathering that includes China, Russia, the European Union and the United States. But differences are starker than ever and some finance ministers were too consumed with domestic politics to show up for the two-day meeting in Cape Town. Finance ministers from many of the G20's biggest economies - the U.S., China, Japan, India and Canada - canceled their attendance at the event, which is meant to bring them and central bankers together to discuss global economic challenges. The EU's senior economic official also stayed away. Their absences reduced what was already a small chance of agreeing on a communique. There also seemed little hope of accord on issues that the host, South African President Cyril Ramaphosa, sees as key: scant climate finance from rich nations, reform of a financial system that penalizes poor countries and widening inequalities. 'At this time of global uncertainty and escalating tension, it is now more important than ever that the members of the G20 work together,' he said in his opening remarks. 'The erosion of multilateralism presents a threat to global growth and stability.' South Africa's central bank governor, Lesetja Kganyago, said a number of recent G20 meetings had finished without agreement on a communique and that the fact that some countries were being represented by deputy ministers was not a problem. 'There is no one in the room then saying ... 'I'm going to make this point, but I think I am too junior so they might ignore it',' he told Reuters. Alex van den Heever, political scientist at the University of Witwatersrand in Johannesburg, said the absence of the United States from G20 talks - it also declined to send its top diplomat to a meeting of G20 foreign ministers last week - 'makes it very difficult to see how people will move forward.' South Africa had hoped to make the G20 a platform for putting pressure on rich countries to do more to tackle climate change, and to give more toward poorer countries' transitions to green energy and adaptation to worsening weather. 'Those most responsible for climate change have a duty ... to support those least responsible,' Ramaphosa said last week. Energy Minister Kgosientsho Ramokgopa told Reuters on Tuesday that 'what the American presidency does, effectively, is reconfigure the conversation (on green energy by) ... reintroducing elements we thought were resolved.' 'Where it leads is anyone's guess,' he said, adding that some countries might reconsider the scale and pace of their transition from fossil fuels to green energy as a result. Some analysts said the retreat of the G20's biggest economy from the discussions raised questions about its relevance. Others saw an opportunity for moving ahead without the U.S. 'There could very well be synergies between large portions of what's left by excluding the U.S. on particular issues,' said Daniel Silke, director of the Political Futures Consultancy. 'It's an opportunity for South Africa to take its leadership role.'	https://www.voanews.com/a/absences-and-disputes-mar-g20-finance-chiefs-talks/7988524.html	2025-02-26T02:17:29-08:00	
France wants Europe cooperation on visas over expulsion of undocumented migrants	PARIS — France's foreign minister said Wednesday that he wanted 'all' European countries to cooperate and start cutting back visas available to nationals of countries that refuse to take back illegal migrants expelled by Paris. Jean-Noel Barrot spoke after an Algerian-born man went on a stabbing rampage in the eastern French city of Mulhouse at the weekend, killing one person and wounding several others in what President Emmanuel Macron called an 'Islamist terrorist act.' The 37-year-old suspect was on a terrorism watch list and subject to a deportation order. France had attempted to expel him multiple times, but Algeria refused to cooperate, French authorities say. 'If a country does not cooperate with the French authorities, I will propose that all European countries restrict the issuing of visas at the same time,' Barrot told broadcaster France 2. 'When we do it on a national level, it doesn't work unfortunately,' he added. But if foreign governments cooperate, the European Union also could consider reducing customs tariffs for such countries, Barrot proposed. 'It is a particularly powerful lever,' he said. French authorities are seeking to tighten immigration policies and border controls, in a move emblematic of the right-ward shift in French politics. 'If we want our migration policy to be as effective as possible, there are many things that will be much more effective if we do it at a European level,' he said. Prime Minister Francois Bayrou was set later Wednesday to chair a meeting on immigration controls. Bayrou has called for a national debate on immigration and what it means to be French, suggesting that immigrants were 'flooding' France.	https://www.voanews.com/a/france-wants-europe-cooperation-on-visas-over-expulsion-of-undocumented-migrants/7988502.html	2025-02-26T01:19:08-08:00	
Power restored to most homes after Chile's massive blackout	SANTIAGO, CHILE — Chilean authorities said they restored power to most homes on Wednesday, hours after a massive, rare blackout caused transport chaos in the capital and forced the president to declare a state of emergency and curfew across much of the country. Chile's worst blackout in well over a decade struck on Tuesday afternoon, leaving millions without power. President Gabriel Boric blamed private companies that manage the grid for the system's failure. 'This is outrageous! The daily life of millions of Chileans can't be impacted like this by companies that don't do their job,' Boric said in a statement issued by his office. Early Wednesday, '90 percent of (electricity) consumption was restored' to homes, the power system's operator said in a statement. According to the Senapred disaster response agency, the outage affected an area stretching all the way from Arica in the long, narrow South American country's north to Los Lagos in the south, an area home to over 90% of Chile's 20 million people. The blackout disrupted transport in the capital Santiago, where thousands were evacuated from the metro and people jostled to board overflowing buses. President Boric had activated 'a state of emergency due to a catastrophe' and announced a curfew until 6 a..m. Wednesday. Attack ruled out Interior Minister Carolina Toha ruled out sabotage as the reason for the power loss, which began at 3:16 p.m .in the middle of the southern hemisphere summer. 'There is no reason to assume that this is an attack,' she said on Tuesday, telling reporters it was more likely 'a failure in the system's operation.' The metro company, which transports 2.3 million passengers every day, said workers were deployed to all stations 'to support safe evacuations.' Out-of-service traffic lights caused major gridlock, with some people having to walk for hours under the hot sun to reach their homes. Shops and offices closed early. 'They let us leave work because of the power cut, but now I don't know how we will get home because all the buses are full,' worker Maria Angelica Roman told AFP in Santiago. 'At the bank where I work, all operations had to stop,' 25-year-old clerk Jonathan Macalupu said. Dramatic rescues The Chilevision broadcaster showed video of people trapped on a mechanical ride several meters high at an amusement park in Santiago before being rescued. An AFP photographer saw firefighters rescue a distraught elderly woman, who had been trapped inside an elevator. The country's hospital system and prisons were operating on emergency generators. Boric flew over the capital by helicopter to assess the situation. In the coastal city of Valparaiso, witnesses also reported shops and businesses closing early and traffic chaos. Chile boasts one of the best power networks in South America and has not had a blackout this big in about 15 years. In 2010, damage to a power plant in southern Chile plunged hundreds of thousands of people into darkness for several hours. That outage happened a month after a massive 8.8-magnitude earthquake killed more than 500 people and rocked the national power grid.	https://www.voanews.com/a/power-restored-to-most-homes-after-chile-s-massive-blackout/7988495.html	2025-02-26T00:42:03-08:00	
China holds 'shooting' drills off Taiwan's coast, vows 'reunification' push	TAIPEI/BEIJING — China's military held 'shooting training' on Wednesday off Taiwan's southwest coast in a move Taipei described as provocative and dangerous, while a senior Chinese leader vowed unswerving efforts to bring the island under Beijing's control. Democratically governed Taiwan, which China views as its own territory, has repeatedly complained of Chinese military activities, including several rounds of full-scale war games over the past three years. From shortly before 9 a.m. local time, Taiwan's defense ministry said in a statement, it had detected 32 Chinese military aircraft carrying out a 'joint combat readiness drill' with Chinese warships in the Taiwan Strait area. 'During this period it even blatantly violated international practice by setting up a drills area in waters about 40 nautical miles (74 km) off the coast ... without prior warning, claiming that it would carry out 'shooting training,'' it added. Taiwan's major southwestern population centers of Kaohsiung and Pingtung that figured in the ministry's statement are both home to important naval and air bases. The exercises endanger the safety of international flights and shipping and is a 'blatant provocation' to regional peace and stability, the ministry said in a statement, adding that it had dispatched its own forces to keep watch. There was no immediate confirmation from China that it was carrying out new drills around Taiwan and its defense ministry did not respond to a request for comment. China's other recent military activity in the region, such as that off Australia's coast, gave 'proof that China is the only, and the greatest, threat to peace and stability in the Taiwan Strait and the Indo-Pacific,' Taiwan's ministry said. China has never renounced the use of force to bring Taiwan under its rule, and has denounced both President Lai Ching-te, who took office last year, as a 'separatist,' and the United States for its support for Taiwan. Earlier on Wednesday, China's official Xinhua news agency said the ruling Communist Party's fourth ranked leader, Wang Huning, had called this week for greater effort in the cause of Chinese reunification. China must 'firmly grasp the right to dominate and take the initiative in cross-strait relations, and unswervingly push forward the cause of reunification of the motherland,' it quoted Wang as telling an annual meeting on work related to Taiwan. Taiwan's government rejects Beijing's sovereignty claims, saying only the island's people can decide their future.	https://www.voanews.com/a/china-holds-shooting-drills-off-taiwan-s-coast-vows-reunification-push/7988492.html	2025-02-26T00:34:08-08:00	
Ukrainian officials say deadly drone attack hits Kyiv region	Ukrainian officials said Wednesday a Russian drone attack killed at least one person and injured two others in the Kyiv region. Kyiv Governor Mykola Kalashnyk said on Telegram that the attack also damaged five houses and four multi-story residential buildings. Fragments from destroyed drones damaged apartment buildings, a university building, and a theater in the Kharkiv region in eastern Ukraine, the regional governor said Wednesday. Ukraine’s military said Wednesday it shot down 110 of the 177 drones that Russian forces used in their latest overnight attacks. Russia’s Defense Ministry said Wednesday its air defenses destroyed 130 Ukrainian drones, more than half of which were shot down over the Krasnodar region located along the Black Sea. Krasnodar Governor Veniamin Kondratyev said on Telegram that the attacks damaged homes in three districts but did not hurt anyone. Russian air defenses also shot down drones over Russia-occupied Crimea, the Sea of Azov, the Black Sea and Russia’s Bryansk and Kursk regions, the Defense Ministry said.

Thailand bus overturns in ditch killing at least 18 passengers	BANGKOK — At least 18 people were killed and 23 injured in eastern Thailand on Wednesday after the brakes failed on a tour bus and it rolled upside down into a ditch, police said. 'It was a downhill road and the brakes failed, and the driver lost control of the vehicle before it overturned,' said Colonel Sophon Phramaneehe, adding that those who died were adults on a study trip. There were 49 people on the bus, all Thai, including the driver, the police official told Reuters. Social media posts showed rescue and medical workers at the scene in Prachinburi province, 155 km east of the capital Bangkok, helping victims near the bus with its undercarriage exposed. Thai Prime Minister Paetongtarn Shinawatra expressed her condolences to the victims' families and said an investigation was taking place. 'If it is found that there is a violation of the use of vehicles that do not meet the standards or are involved in reckless use of vehicles, legal action will be taken,' she said in a post on X. 'Inspection of vehicles must be safe and pass the specified standards before they are put into use to prevent accidents and reduce losses like this again,' she said. Road accidents and fatalities are common in Thailand due to weak enforcement of vehicle safety standards and poorly maintained roads. The Southeast Asian nation ranked ninth out of 175 World Health Organization member countries for road traffic deaths, according to its 2023 report. Last year, a school bus caught fire due to a gas cylinder leak, killing 23 people, including 16 students.	https://www.voanews.com/a/thailand-bus-overturns-in-ditch-killing-at-least-18-passengers/7988467.html	2025-02-25T23:07:52-08:00

Thousands freed from Myanmar scam centers face slow repatriation process	WASHINGTON — A sweeping crackdown led by authorities from Thailand, China and Myanmar has dismantled scam centers along the Thai-Myanmar border and freed thousands from nearly 30 countries, but helping them return home remains a big challenge, says the spokesperson for the Karen Border Guard Force, or BGF. Over a week ago, BGF, an ally of Myanmar's military junta, played a key role in evacuating more than 6,000 people from scam centers in Myanmar's Shwe Kokko fraud hub, near the border with Thailand. Although many have been freed, the spokesperson, Lieutenant Colonel Naing Maung Zaw, told VOA's Burmese Service the repatriation process is complex and will remain slow. 'Originally, we planned to send 1,000 people a day, but now we are only able to send a few hundred at a time,' he said in an interview Tuesday. 'So far, 673 people have been transferred to Thailand.' Getting those rescued from scam centers to where they can be processed is part of the challenge, he said. The BGF operates in a region where local militia groups control large swaths of territory. These groups have historically maintained uneasy alliances with the Myanmar military while engaging in illicit economic activities, including human trafficking and scam operations. According to the United Nations, criminal gangs have trafficked hundreds of thousands of people, forcing them to work in Southeast Asian scam centers such as the ones in Myanmar. Thousands of the recently freed remain in temporary shelters in Myanmar, awaiting processing by Myanmar's military authorities. 'We have evacuated more than 6,000 people, but overcrowding is an issue,' spokesperson Naing Maung Zaw said. 'About 500 people are crammed into warehouses, increasing risks of disease and escape attempts.' The repatriation process involves coordinating with multiple countries, as individuals from nearly 30 nations have been found in the scam centers. 'We are prioritizing the return of those who have been rescued,' he said. 'After China, the largest number of people are from Indonesia, followed by Vietnam, Malaysia, Taiwan, Pakistan, India, Uganda, Ethiopia, Nepal, Thailand, Rwanda, Kenya, Cambodia, and Ghana — making a total of 15 countries. According to our special forces on the ground, people from other countries are also among those affected, bringing the total to nearly 30 countries.' The Thai government said it is 'working closely with Myanmar and other countries to ensure the safe return of victims. Over 7,000 rescued individuals are currently in the process of being transferred.' Raids on scam centers continue, but operations will pause at the end of February, Naing Maung Zaw said. 'It's estimated that tens of thousands are still trapped in these scam centers. It will take months to repatriate everyone,' he said. The crackdown is a response to growing international pressure, particularly from China. On Thursday, China’s Ministry of Public Security announced the repatriation of 200 nationals rescued from Myanmar’s scam hubs, with more expected to follow. However, according to Xinhua, these individuals are being referred to as 'suspects in call center fraud,' suggesting that China views them as potential criminals rather than victims. The operation is being overseen by Liu Zhongyi, China's assistant minister of public security, who has been coordinating efforts with Thai and Myanmar officials to dismantle the criminal networks. Liu emphasized that shutting down these operations is critical not only for ensuring the safety of Chinese citizens but also for curbing organized crime across the region. China's role in cybercrime crackdown China has taken a leading role in dismantling cyber scam networks operating along the Thailand-Myanmar border, leveraging diplomatic pressure and regional cooperation with both countries. The crackdown intensified, with Thai authorities cutting gas and oil supplies to Myanmar earlier this month and deploying military units to weaken criminal syndicates. On Feb. 5, the Thai authorities cut electricity, fuel, and internet supplies to several Myanmar border towns known to host scam operations. This action aimed to disrupt the infrastructure supporting these illicit activities. Additionally, Thai military units were deployed to the border area to further weaken the criminal syndicates operating there. China’s Ministry of Public Security confirmed the repatriation of 200 Chinese nationals from Myanmar, labeling them as suspects in telecom fraud. The ministry stated that over 800 more would be repatriated soon as part of a joint effort with Myanmar and Thailand to combat transnational cybercrime. Jason Tower, the Myanmar country director for the U.S. Institute of Peace, has been monitoring transnational cybercrime for nearly a decade. He told VOA in an interview Monday that 'the campaign is the most aggressive crackdown seen along the Thailand–Myanmar border.' Previous short-term disruptions, such as power and internet cuts, that once lasted only a few weeks, have now been replaced with sustained pressure, he said. 'The Thai military's presence and comprehensive cuts on electricity, internet, gas and oil have created significant challenges for these criminal networks,' he said. China has played a crucial role in coordinating regional efforts, pushing for tougher actions against cybercrime syndicates. 'A surge in social media outcry over high-profile trafficking cases has given Beijing the political capital to demand cross-border cooperation,' Tower said. While repatriation efforts continue, Tower said, dismantling the infrastructure linked to organized crime is equally critical. 'Without sustained pressure and intelligence-sharing, these criminal networks will continue to adapt and thrive,' he warned. Meanwhile, China has taken legal action against key figures over their alleged involvement in transnational cybercrime. Influential in the Myanmar town of Kokang, the Ming family, accused of colluding with cross-border scammers, was publicly tried in Wenzhou, China, last week, according to AFP. Kokang is an area in northeastern Myanmar along the southern Chinese border that is home to a Mandarin-speaking ethnic group of Chinese under the same name. The 23 defendants face charges in Wenzhou, including murder, fraud, and extortion. According to the Chinese court, they are linked to 14 Chinese deaths and illicit financial gains, exceeding $1.4 billion since 2015. Among those tried was the former head of the Kokang Administration, who was arrested in Nay Pyi Taw and handed over to China by Myanmar's junta last year. The six-day trial concluded with a verdict pending, underscoring Beijing's commitment to holding suspected major players accountable. Challenges amid ongoing crackdown Despite aggressive measures, scam syndicates continue to operate, shifting their hubs across borders. Syndicates can easily relocate to Cambodia, Laos or Dubai, Tower said. Impunity also remains a major issue. While some key figures were brought to justice in 2023-2024, many kingpins still operate freely. Since 2016, scam networks have flourished with little oversight, particularly in Cambodia, where large-scale scam centers remain active. Another challenge is repatriating trafficking victims and recovering stolen funds. Thai authorities have identified victims quickly, but returning them across multiple countries is complex. 'Without coordinated intelligence sharing, these networks will keep adapting,' Tower cautioned.

UN chief rules out UN peacekeepers for Haiti	UNITED NATIONS — U.N. Secretary-General Antonio Guterres has ruled out transitioning the multinational security support mission (MSS) in Haiti into a U.N. peacekeeping force for now, and is instead recommending creating a U.N. support mission to back the MSS that will be funded through the U.N. peacekeeping budget. 'Such a transition could be considered, once significant progress has been made in substantially reducing gang territorial control,' Guterres said of U.N. peacekeepers, in a letter Tuesday to the U.N. Security Council and obtained by VOA. 'A realistic option is based on a dual-track strategy, with the United Nations assuming new roles to enable the MSS, the national police and Haitian authorities, to substantially reduce gang territorial control through peace enforcement,' the U.N. chief said. 'This would require a robust mandate for the use of force and the capacities to conduct targeted operations against gangs.' Guterres sent his recommendation to the Security Council on Tuesday following a request from its members to come up with a range of U.N. options. The MSS is not a U.N. mission, but it does have Security Council authorization and the U.N. oversees its financial trust fund. He suggests establishing a U.N. support office for the MSS to provide logistical and operational support. It would be paid for by the U.N. peacekeeping budget — giving it reliable funding. The secretary-general said the mission needs stronger intelligence capabilities and more equipment, and it should be reinforced with specialized police units to protect critical infrastructure, including seaports, airports, oil terminals and major roads. The island nation has been plagued by gang violence and instability since 2021, when President Jovenel Moise was assassinated. The national police are under-staffed and poorly equipped and have been unable to stop the gangs, which are terrorizing the population, especially in the capital, Port-au-Prince. A transitional government is now in place with the goal of organizing credible elections, but it has faced internal and external challenges. Late last year, the United States and then-council member Ecuador, which were co-leads on Haiti on the council, had called for the MSS to become a U.N. peacekeeping operation. But not all members agreed. China and Russia have expressed reservations about sending peacekeepers to Haiti when there is a lack of peace to keep. Haiti’s past experiences with U.N. peacekeeping missions have ended badly, and it was originally felt that a non-U.N. mission was a better idea. But a lack of funding, equipment and logistics has brought even Haiti’s struggling government around to the idea of a U.N. peacekeeping mission, which would benefit from sustainable funding and access to more resources. The MSS started deploying in June and is mandated through Oct. 2, 2025. Guterres said it recently reached the level of 1,000 personnel. They come from the Bahamas, Belize, El Salvador, Guatemala, Jamaica and Kenya, which is leading the mission. But 1,000 is less than half of the 2,500 personnel planned for the mission. Financing has been a problem from the start. Guterres said the mission’s trust fund has $110.8 million in voluntary contributions from Canada, France, Germany, Italy, South Korea, Singapore, Spain, Turkey and the United States, of which $48 million has not been allocated and much more is needed. 'The MSS is slowly assuming the shape of a real multinational effort to support Haiti,' Guterres wrote. 'We must all stand behind it as an immediate and credible effort to help the Haiti’s national police beat back armed gangs, prevent their territorial expansion and protect the people of Haiti.' He added that when the MSS is fully deployed and adequately resourced it, 'represents the most viable solution to meet the medium-term goal of reducing gang territorial control.'	https://www.voanews.com/a/un-chief-rules-out-un-peacekeepers-for-haiti/7988427.html	2025-02-25T19:47:56-08:00	
Pope signs decree for canonization of Venezuela's first saint	Dr. Jose Gregorio Hernandez — known as the 'doctor of the poor' — will soon become Venezuela's first saint. Pope Francis, the first South American pope, signed the decree for the canonization of Hernadez from a hospital in Rome on Tuesday. A date for his canonization has not been set. The South American country has long sought the canonization of Hernandez, who died in 1919. 'This historic event, long awaited by the Venezuelan people, is a recognition of the exemplary life and heroic virtues of a man who dedicated his existence to alleviating human suffering and transmitting a message of love and hope,' the Archdiocese of Caracas said in a statement. A petition signed by 5 million people calling for his canonization was given to Pope John Paul II when he visited Venezuela in 1996. Hernandez was born in 1864 in Isnotu, in western Venezuela. He studied in Europe and the U.S. He became known as the 'doctor of the poor' in Venezuela as he tended to patients during the Spanish flu global pandemic. In 1919, after getting medicine at a pharmacy for an impoverished woman, he was hit by a car and died, according to an Associated Press report. An estimated 20,000 people participated in his funeral procession. He was beatified, a preliminary step to sainthood, in 2021 after a miracle was attributed to him in the case of girl who had been shot in the head in 2017. Doctors had said the 10-year-old girl would suffer permanent brain damage, but the girl's mother prayed to Hernandez, and the child made a full recovery. Any miracles attributed to a potential saint must be validated by teams of doctors, theologians and cardinals. Pope Francis is reported to be in stable but critical condition. He has been hospitalized for more than a week with double pneumonia. The Vatican said that the pope received the Eucharist Tuesday morning and then 'resumed work activities.' Some information provided by The Associated Press and Agence France-Presse.	https://www.voanews.com/a/pope-signs-decree-for-canonization-of-venezuela-s-first-saint/7988421.html	2025-02-25T19:13:32-08:00	
Israel, Hamas agree on new exchange, leaving fragile ceasefire intact	JERUSALEM — Officials from Israel and Hamas, a U.S.-designated terrorist organization, said Tuesday they have reached an agreement to exchange the bodies of hostages for the release of hundreds of Palestinian prisoners, keeping their fragile ceasefire intact for at least a few more days. Israel has delayed the release of 600 Palestinian prisoners since Saturday to protest what it says is the cruel treatment of hostages during their release by Hamas. The terrorist organization has said the delay is a 'serious violation' of their ceasefire and that talks on a second phase are not possible until they are freed. The deadlock had threatened to collapse the ceasefire when the current six-week first phase of the deal expires this weekend. But late Tuesday, Hamas said an agreement had been reached to resolve the dispute during a visit to Cairo by a delegation headed by Khalil al-Hayya, a top political official in the group. The breakthrough appeared to clear the way for the return of the bodies of four more hostages and hundreds of additional prisoners scheduled to be released under the ceasefire. The prisoners previously slated for release 'will be released simultaneously with the bodies of the Israeli prisoners who were agreed to be handed over,' along with the release of a new set of Palestinian prisoners, the Hamas statement said. An Israeli official, speaking on condition of anonymity because he was not authorized to speak to the media, confirmed an agreement to bring home the bodies in the coming days. He gave no further details. But Israeli media reports said the exchange could take place as soon as Wednesday. The Ynet news site said the Israeli bodies would be handed over to Egyptian authorities without any public ceremony. The latest agreement would complete both sides' obligations of the first phase of the ceasefire — during which Hamas is returning 33 hostages — including eight bodies — in exchange for nearly 2,000 Palestinian prisoners. It also could clear the way for an expected visit by the White House's Mideast envoy, Steve Witkoff, to the region. Witkoff, who is expected in the region in the coming days, has said he wants the sides to move into negotiations on the second phase, during which all remaining hostages held by Hamas are to be released and an end to the war is to be negotiated. The Phase 2 talks were supposed to begin weeks ago but did not. The ceasefire, brokered by the United States, Egypt and Qatar, ended 15 months of heavy fighting that erupted after Hamas' Oct. 7, 2023, terror attack that killed about 1,200 people in Israel and took about 250 people hostage. Israel's military offensive has killed more than 48,000 Palestinians, according to Palestinian health officials, displaced an estimated 90% of Gaza's population and destroyed the territory's infrastructure and health system. The Hamas-run Health Ministry says over half of the dead have been women and children.	https://www.voanews.com/a/israel-hamas-agree-on-new-exchange-leaving-fragile-ceasefire-intact-/7988414.html	2025-02-25T18:58:36-08:00	
8 sentenced to death for murder of Tunisia opposition leader	TUNIS, TUNISIA — A Tunisian court sentenced eight defendants to death on Tuesday over the 2013 assassination of leftist opposition figure Mohamed Brahmi, according to local reports. Charges included 'attempting to change the state's nature' and 'inciting armed conflict,' local media reported. Three of the defendants also received additional death sentences for 'deliberate participation in premeditated murder,' according to the reports. A ninth, who is on the run, was sentenced to five years in prison for 'failing to report terrorist crimes to the authorities,' said the reports. Tunisia still hands down death sentences, particularly in 'terrorism' cases, even though a de facto moratorium in effect since 1991 means they are effectively commuted to life terms. The verdict marked the first set of rulings in the case of Brahmi's assassination, which took place outside his home on July 25, 2013, amid Tunisia's turbulent post-revolution political landscape. Demonstrators took to the streets across the country, as Brahmi's distinctive round face and thick mustache became symbols of protest against militant violence. Brahmi, a nationalist left-wing leader of the People's Movement and member of Tunisia's Constituent Assembly, was an outspoken critic of the Islamist-inspired government dominated by Ennahdha at the time. His assassination further shocked the nation as it came less than six months after the killing of another prominent leftist figure, Chokri Belaid, who was also gunned down outside his home. Brahmi had been elected in Sidi Bouzid, the birthplace of the 2011 revolution that toppled ex-president Zine El Abidine Ben Ali and later swept through the Arab world. He was shot 14 times by two assailants in front of his wife and children. His family had long accused Ennahdha of being behind the murder, but the then-ruling party denied the allegations. It had also pushed back against accusations of excessive leniency, blacklisting the formerly legal Salafist movement Ansar al-Charia as a terrorist organization. Fighters affiliated with the Islamic State claimed responsibility for both the Brahmi and Belaid assassinations. The aftermath of the 2011 revolution saw a surge in Islamist radicalism in Tunisia with thousands of volunteers leaving to fight in Syria, Iraq and neighboring Libya. Tunisia faced heightened security threats, with armed groups operating from the Chaambi Mountains near the Algerian border, primarily targeting security forces and the military. In 2015, attacks in Sousse and the capital Tunis killed dozens of tourists and police, although authorities say they have since made significant progress against the extremists. In recent years, Tunisian authorities claim significant progress in combating violence, but the country remains under a state of emergency. In 2022, President Kais Saied — who has framed the murders of Brahmi and Belaid as national issues and often called them 'martyrs' — dismissed dozens of judges after alleging they had obstructed investigations. The high-profile killings, and the mass protests they drew, ultimately forced Ennahdha to relinquish power to a technocratic government following the adoption of a new constitution. The crisis had nearly derailed Tunisia's fragile democratic transition. But political dialogue led by four civil society organizations, including the Tunisian General Labour Union, helped restore stability and earned the nation of 12 million the 2015 Nobel Peace Prize.	https://www.voanews.com/a/sentenced-to-death-for-murder-of-tunisia-opposition-leader-/7988404.html	2025-02-25T18:43:37-08:00	
Nominee for No. 2 spot at Pentagon warns China 'incredibly determined' to surpass US	PENTAGON — President Donald Trump's nominee for deputy secretary of defense is warning that China's military is resolute on surpassing the United States and is calling for a fix to 'significant' military shortages at a time when administration leaders are trying to make big budget cuts. 'China is incredibly determined, they feel a great sense of urgency, and they'll be fully dedicated to becoming the strongest nation in the world and having dominance over the United States,' Steve Feinberg told members of the Senate Armed Service Committee on Tuesday. Feinberg, a businessman and investor, said the U.S. military shortages include 'shipbuilding, nuclear modernization, aircraft development, cyber defense, hypersonics, counter space, defending our satellites [and] counter drones.' 'We really need to plug these shortages, focus on our priorities, get rid of legacy programs, be very disciplined, while at the same time focusing on the economics. If we do that, given America's great innovative capability, entrepreneurship, we will defeat China. If we don't, our very national security is at risk,' Feinberg said. The hearing comes as Secretary of Defense Pete Hegseth has called on the department to cut 8% — roughly $50 billion — to reinvest in priorities aligned with a 'more lethal fighting force.' Senator Jack Reed, the top Democrat on the Senate Armed Services Committee, on Tuesday pushed back against the move saying, 'Slashing the defense budget will not create efficiency in our military. It will cripple it.' The concern about cuts to the military has echoed on both sides of the aisle. Republican committee Chairman Roger Wicker told the Breaking Defense news organization last month that he hoped to increase defense spending by as much as $200 billion in coming years. And Republican Senator Dan Sullivan on Tuesday called for prioritizing solutions to shipbuilding to counter threats from China and others. 'We're in the worst crisis in shipbuilding in over 40 years. The Chinese are building a giant navy. It's already bigger than ours,' he said. China's military has about 370 warships, according to the Pentagon's latest China Military Power Report, while the U.S. military has about 300. Feinberg acknowledged that the shipbuilding shortage is 'a tough problem' for the military. 'Our supply chain is definitely weak. Our workforce needs to be improved. But a big piece of improving our supply chain is working more closely with our private sector. We have companies that can get at where our needs are, where our shortages are, and we need to work more closely with them. We need people inside of government that understand their issues,' Feinberg said. Several Democrats on the committee were critical of interference at the Pentagon by the Department of Government Efficiency, saying it could create a major vulnerability should its members not handle data more carefully. 'They [DOGE] just sent an unclassified email with CIA recent hire names in an unclassified space. As a former CIA officer, you just blew the cover of someone who was going to risk their life abroad to protect our country,' said Democratic Senator Elissa Slotkin. 'Do you know how appetizing it is for our adversaries to have this data? ... It is quite literally an issue of safety and security,' she added. Democrats also raised concern about plans to let go more than 5,000 Pentagon civilian employees this week, while Republican Senator Markwayne Mullin countered that cutting 5,000 jobs amounted to less than 0.5% of the workforce. 'Our national debt is now costing us more to just pay interest than we spend on our military. That's a huge national security risk,' he said. 'And so, at what point do we start making cuts?'	https://www.voanews.com/a/nominee-for-no-2-spot-at-pentagon-warns-china-incredibly-determined-to-surpass-us/7988386.html	2025-02-25T17:55:45-08:00	
Ukraine, US agree on a framework economic deal, Ukrainian officials say	KYIV, UKRAINE — Ukraine and the United States have reached an agreement on a framework for a broad economic deal that would include access to Ukraine's rare earth minerals, three senior Ukrainian officials said Tuesday. The officials, who were familiar with the matter, spoke on condition of anonymity because they were not authorized to speak publicly. One of them said Kyiv hopes that signing the agreement will ensure the continued flow of U.S. military support that Ukraine urgently needs. President Donald Trump, speaking to reporters in the Oval Office, said he'd heard that Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy was coming and added that 'it's OK with me, if he'd like to, and he would like to sign it together with me.' The agreement could be signed as early as Friday and plans are being drawn up for Zelenskyy to travel to Washington to meet Trump, according to one of the Ukrainian officials. Another official said the agreement would provide an opportunity for Zelenskyy and Trump to discuss continued military aid to Ukraine, which is why Kyiv is eager to finalize the deal. Trump called it 'a very big deal,' adding that it could be worth 1 trillion dollars. 'It could be whatever, but it's rare earths and other things.' According to one Ukrainian official, some technical details are still to be worked out. However, the draft does not include a contentious Trump administration proposal to give the U.S. $500 billion worth of profits from Ukraine's rare earth minerals as compensation for its wartime assistance to Kyiv. Instead, the U.S. and Ukraine would have joint ownership of a fund, and Ukraine would in the future contribute 50 percent of future proceeds from state-owned resources, including minerals, oil, and gas. One official said the deal had better terms of investments and another one said that Kyiv secured favorable amendments and viewed the outcome as 'positive.' The deal does not, however, include security guarantees. One official said that this would be something the two presidents would discuss when they meet. The progress in negotiating the deal comes after Trump and Zelenskyy traded sharp rhetoric last week about their differences over the matter. Zelenskyy said he balked at signing off on a deal that U.S. Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent pushed during a visit to Kyiv earlier this month, and the Ukrainian leader objected again days later during a meeting in Munich with Vice President JD Vance because the American proposal did not include security guarantees. Trump then called Volodymyr Zelenskyy 'a dictator without elections' and claimed his support among voters was near rock-bottom. But the two sides made significant progress during a three-day visit to Ukraine last week by retired Lieutenant General Keith Kellogg, Trump's special envoy to Ukraine and Russia. The idea was initially proposed last fall by Zelenskyy as part of his plan to strengthen Kyiv's hand in future negotiations with Moscow.	https://www.voanews.com/a/ukraine-us-agree-on-a-framework-economic-deal-ukrainian-officials-say-/7988354.html	2025-02-25T17:21:43-08:00	
South Korean president's impeachment trial ends with denial of wrongdoing	South Korea's Constitutional Court on Tuesday heard the last of the oral arguments in President Yoon Suk Yeol's impeachment trial. The court's decision on whether Yoon will be reinstated or removed from office is expected by mid-March. Yoon has denied that he did anything wrong when he declared martial law on Dec. 3. In his closing statement Tuesday, he defended the declaration, saying it was a 'proclamation that the nation was facing an existential crisis.' He told the court that 'external forces, including North Korea, along with anti-state elements within our society' were 'working together to seriously threaten our national security and sovereignty.' The liberal opposition-controlled National Assembly impeached Yoon, a conservative, after his short-lived Dec. 3 martial law decree. They accused Yoon of taking the extraordinary measure, which is reserved for national emergencies or times of war, without proper justification. In his statement, Yoon said he 'could no longer neglect a do-or-die crisis facing this country' and that he had 'tried to inform the people of these anti-state acts of wickedness by the mammoth opposition party and appealed to the people to stop it with their surveillance and criticism.' Yoon had said the opposition parties blocked a revision to an anti-espionage law, preventing the prosecution of foreign nationals spying on South Korea. 'This was never a decision made for my personal benefit,' he told the court Tuesday. The ruling People Power Party (PPP) pushed for an amendment to the law to broaden its scope from targeting 'enemy states' to include 'foreign countries,' citing threats posed by Chinese espionage. The opposition Democratic Party of Korea (DPK) blocked the revision for fear of potential misuse of the law. Yoon also was arrested last month and indicted on rebellion charges after his declaration. The charges carry possible penalties that include life imprisonment or a death sentence. After declaring martial law, Yoon ordered troops and police officers into the National Assembly where lawmakers were gathering to veto his decree. He said it was not his intention to prevent the lawmakers, who unanimously voted against the decree, from doing their work. He said he deployed the security forces to maintain law and order. However, some commanders of the forces sent to the assembly told investigators and assembly hearings that they were ordered to drag the lawmakers from the assembly. An opposition lawyer had an emotional reaction to that tactic at the impeachment trial, telling the court, 'As a citizen and a father, I feel a sense of rage and betrayal toward Yoon, who tried to turn my son into a martial law soldier.' If Yoon's impeachment is upheld by the court, a new election must be held within 60 days. VOA’s Christy Lee contributed to this article.

US expands visa restrictions on Cubans tied to labor export program	WASHINGTON/HAVANA — The United States has expanded a visa restriction policy to target Cuban officials believed to be tied to a labor program that sends Cuban workers overseas, particularly health care workers, U.S. Secretary of State Marco Rubio said on Tuesday. Cuba's health service generates major export earnings by sending doctors and health workers around the world. In a statement, Rubio said the expanded restrictions target individuals and immediate family members of individuals believed to be responsible for the program, which he described as 'forced labor.' The U.S. has already imposed restrictions on several people, including some Venezuelans, he added. Cuba's foreign minister, Bruno Rodriguez, lashed out at the restrictions, calling the measure part of Rubio's 'personal agenda' and unjustified. 'Suspension of visas associated with Cuba's international medical cooperation agreements represents the seventh measure of unjustified aggression against our population in a month,' Rodriguez said on X. The decision to restrict visas for those involved with Cuban medical missions is the latest significant escalation in U.S. policy toward Cuba since Trump took office on Jan. 20. Rubio has signaled a tough new stance on the communist-run island, reversing a last-minute effort by the Biden administration to loosen sanctions on long-time foe Cuba and complicating money transfers to the island. Rubio, a former U.S. senator and the son of immigrants who came to Florida from Cuba in the 1950s, has long opposed more normal relations with Havana, dating back to the administration of Democratic President Barack Obama. Rubio on Tuesday branded the labor programs as self-serving and abusive. 'Cuba's labor export programs, which include the medical missions, enrich the Cuban regime, and in the case of Cuba's overseas medical missions, deprive ordinary Cubans of the medical care they desperately need in their home country,' Rubio said. Cuba has for decades rejected such accusations. Since its 1959 leftist revolution, Cuba has dispatched an 'army of white coats' to disaster sites and disease outbreaks around the world in the name of solidarity. In the last decade, they have fought cholera in Haiti and Ebola in West Africa. But Cuba has also exported doctors on more routine missions in exchange for cash or goods in recent decades, an increasingly critical source of hard currency in a nation suffering a deep economic crisis. The United States and Cuba have had a strained relationship since Fidel Castro took over in the 1959 revolution, and a U.S. trade embargo has been in place for decades.	https://www.voanews.com/a/us-expands-visa-restrictions-on-cubans-tied-to-labor-export-program-/7988318.html	2025-02-25T16:50:57-08:00	
US Embassy tracks 3 Americans on death row in Democratic Republic of Congo	STATE DEPARTMENT — The United States says its embassy in the Democratic Republic of Congo continues to attend legal proceedings and closely follow developments in the case of three detained U.S. citizens who face the death penalty. The U.S. State Department declined to comment on whether negotiations are underway to secure their release. Over the weekend, U.S. President Donald Trump’s special envoy for hostages, Adam Boehler, noted in a social media post that the three Americans are still being held by the DRC government. In September 2024, a military court in the DRC sentenced 37 people to death, including three Americans — Tyler Thompson Jr., Marcel Malanga and Benjamin Reuben Zalman-Polun — for their role in a failed coup in the Central African nation in May 2024. A State Department spokesperson told VOA on Monday, 'The United States supports DRC authorities upholding a fair and transparent legal process,' adding that U.S. Ambassador to Congo Lucy Tamlyn and embassy staff in Kinshasa have been communicating with their counterparts at the highest levels of the DRC government throughout the process. The U.S. State Department has not declared the three Americans to be wrongfully detained. 'The Department continuously reviews the circumstances surrounding the detentions of U.S. nationals overseas, including those in the DRC, for indicators that they are wrongful,' the State Department spokesperson said. 'When making these assessments, the Department looks at the totality of the circumstances for each case individually,' the spokesperson added, noting that the Secretary of State has the ultimate authority to determine whether a case qualifies as a wrongful detention. Once the U.S. government designates an American detained abroad as wrongfully detained, the case must be transferred from the State Department’s Bureau of Consular Affairs to the Special Presidential Envoy for Hostage Affairs. The U.S. government is then required to actively seek the release of wrongfully detained Americans. The State Department refrained from commenting on whether discussions are in progress to repatriate the three American citizens. 'Due to privacy and other considerations, we have no further comment,' said the spokesperson. Minerals for peace? Meanwhile, DRC President Felix Tshisekedi has reportedly proposed granting the United States access to its vast mineral resources as an incentive for U.S. intervention to help end the conflict in eastern Congo, where Rwandan-backed M23 rebels have captured two provincial capitals — Goma and Bukavu — and other territory. Rwanda continues to deny backing the group in the face of evidence presented by United Nations experts and human rights groups. The United States has called on Rwanda’s leaders to end their support for M23 and to respect the DRC’s sovereignty. In a social media post on X on Sunday, Tshisekedi’s spokesperson, Tina Salama, shared a photo from a recent meeting between the Congolese President and Trump’s envoy for special missions, Richard Grenell. The post indicated that a proposal on DRC's rich mineral resources was 'revealed' during the meeting. She said Tshisekedi 'invites' the U.S. to buy minerals directly from Congo instead of sourcing looted resources through Rwanda. The State Department did not respond to questions from VOA about whether a mineral deal was in offered in the meeting.	https://www.voanews.com/a/us-embassy-tracks-3-americans-on-death-row-in-democratic-republic-of-congo/7988019.html	2025-02-25T16:48:59-08:00

Trump turns eye on China's copper production	WHITE HOUSE — China's growing copper reserves have caught the eye of President Donald Trump, who on Tuesday ordered an investigation into what administration officials say is Beijing's move to 'gain control of the world's copper markets.' Trump, in the Oval Office, asked his newly minted secretary of commerce, Howard Lutnick, to explain. Lutnick read from what he said was a social media post he planned to release, saying: 'Tariffs will help rebuild back our American copper industry and strengthen our national defense. American industries depend on copper, and they should be made in America. No exemptions, no exceptions. America first creates American jobs and protects our national security. It's time for copper to come home.' Earlier in the day, Trump's senior counselor for trade and manufacturing explained the administration's concerns. 'China has long used industrial overcapacity and dumping as an economic weapon to dominate global markets, systematically undercutting competitors and driving rival industries out of business by massively subsidizing key industries, flooding international markets with below-cost goods and then consolidating control once competitors collapse,' Peter Navarro said in a call with reporters ahead of the signing. 'China has successfully expanded its economic influence in sectors ranging from steel and aluminum to solar panels and electric vehicles.' Trump's order jumpstarts an investigation under the authority of the Trade Expansion Act, which focuses on whether importation of a certain item presents a threat to national security. The president can decide whether to follow the recommendations of the report, due in 270 days. China's government released a report earlier this month where they laid out a plan to increase copper ore reserves by 5% to 10% by 2027. Chinese government figures state that in 2024, China topped the world in the production of both refined copper and copper-processed materials. Navarro told reporters the U.S. hopes to do more with the nation's 'untapped' copper potential and cited plans to boost U.S. production by 70% and reduce external reliance on the material vital for electrical equipment.	https://www.voanews.com/a/trump-turns-eye-on-china-s-copper-production/7988338.html	2025-02-25T16:31:53-08:00

VOA Russian: Russia's economy growth is forecast to stall	Three years since the beginning of the Kremlin's full-scale invasion of Ukraine, Russia's economy has continued to grow because of its rampant defense spending. VOA Russian spoke with the experts who predict the defense-based growth is unsustainable and about to hit the ceiling as both industrial capacities and workforce are at near maximums. Thousands of Western sanctions imposed on Moscow also have hit certain sectors of the Russian economy, particularly damaging Gazprom, the car industry and aviation.

Blackout hits Chile, leaving millions without power	SANTIAGO, CHILE — A sweeping blackout hit Chile on Tuesday, stranding commuters, knocking out traffic lights, paralyzing countless businesses and leaving millions of people across the South American nation without power. The National Electrical Coordinator, Chile's grid operator, said a disruption had occurred in a high-voltage transmission line that carries power from the Atacama Desert of northern Chile to the capital of Santiago in the country's central valley. It did not say what actually caused the disruption that pushed much of the country's power grid into shutdown, from the northernmost Chilean port of Arica to the southern Los Lagos agricultural region. Chile's national disaster response service, Senapred, reported that a 'disruption in the supply of electricity' had provoked a 'massive power outage' across 14 of the country's 16 regions, including Santiago, a city of some 8.4 million people, where authorities said there would be no subway service until further notice. Interior Minister Carolina Toha said hospitals, prisons and government buildings were switching on backup generators to keep essential equipment operating. In a press conference, Toha urged the public to stay calm and said officials were racing to put the grid back in operation and restore electric service across the country of some 19 million people. 'It's affecting the entire electrical system of the country,' she said of the breakdown in the 500-kV backbone transmission line. Toha said if all areas didn't return to normal by sunset, the government would take emergency measures to avert a crisis. One of the country's main electricity distributors, Saesa, which serves more than 1 million people across Chile, confirmed that all of its customers had experienced the power failure. Officials said they were evacuating passengers from darkened tunnels and subway stations in Santiago and elsewhere in the country, including the coastal tourist hot spot of Valparaiso. Videos on social media from all over Chile, a long ribbon of a country stretching 4,300 kilometers (more than 2,600 miles) along the southern Pacific coast, showed chaos at intersections with no functioning traffic lights, people having to use their mobile phones as flashlights in the underground metro and police dispatched to help evacuate office buildings. Transport Minister Juan Carlos Munoz urged people to stay home, saying it's 'not a good time to go out since we have a transport system that is not operating normally.' At the very most, he said, just 27% of city traffic lights are working. Mobile phone services also blinkered offline in parts of the country. Authorities at Santiago International Airport said terminals had switched to emergency power to keep flights operating as usual.	https://www.voanews.com/a/blackout-hits-chile-leaving-millions-without-power-/7988065.html	2025-02-25T16:16:11-08:00	
Apple shareholders reject proposal to scrap company's diversity programs	Apple shareholders rebuffed an attempt to pressure the technology trendsetter into joining President Donald Trump's push to scrub corporate programs designed to diversify its workforce. The proposal drafted by the National Center for Public Policy Research — a self-described conservative think tank — urged Apple to follow a litany of high-profile companies that have retreated from diversity, equity and inclusion initiatives currently in the Trump administration's crosshairs. After a brief presentation about the anti-DEI proposal, Apple announced shareholders had rejected it. In a regulatory filing submitted Tuesday evening, Apple disclosed that 97% of the ballots cast were votes against the measure. The outcome vindicated Apple management's decision to stand behind its diversity commitment even though Trump asked the U.S. Department of Justice to look into whether these types of programs have discriminated against some employees whose race or gender aren't aligned with the initiative's goals. But Apple CEO Tim Cook has maintained a cordial relationship with Trump since his first term in office, an alliance that so far has helped the company skirt tariffs on its iPhones made in China. After Cook and Trump met last week, Apple on Monday announced it will invest $500 billion in the U.S. and create 20,000 more jobs during the next four years — a commitment applauded by the president. Tuesday's shareholder vote came a month after the same group presented a similar proposal during Costco's annual meeting, only to have it overwhelmingly rejected, too. That snub didn't discourage the National Center for Public Policy Research from confronting Apple about its DEI program in a pre-recorded presentation by Stefan Padfield, executive director of the think tank's Free Enterprise Project, who asserted 'forced diversity is bad for business.' In the presentation, Padfield attacked Apple's diversity commitments for being out of line with recent court rulings and said the programs expose the Cupertino, California, company to an onslaught of potential lawsuits for alleged discrimination. He cited the Trump administration as one of Apple's potential legal adversaries. 'The vibe shift is clear: DEI is out, and merit is in,' Padfield said in the presentation. The specter of potential legal trouble was magnified last week when Florida Attorney General James Uthmeier filed a federal lawsuit against Target alleging the retailer's recently scaled-back DEI program alienated many consumers and undercut sales to the detriment of shareholders. Just as Costco does, Apple contends that fostering a diverse workforce makes good business sense. But Cook conceded Apple may have to make some adjustments to its diversity program 'as the legal landscape changes' while still striving to maintain a culture that has helped elevate the company to its current market value of $3.7 trillion — greater than any other business in the world. 'We will continue to create a culture of belonging,' Cook told shareholders during the meeting. In its last diversity and inclusion report issued in 2022, Apple disclosed that nearly three-fourths of its global workforce consisted of white and Asian employees. Nearly two-thirds of its employees were men. Other major technology companies for years have reported employing mostly white and Asian men, especially in high-paid engineering jobs — a tendency that spurred the industry to pursue largely unsuccessful efforts to diversify.	https://www.voanews.com/a/apple-shareholders-reject-proposal-to-scrap-company-s-diversity-programs/7988035.html	2025-02-25T15:09:46-08:00	
Kremlin disinformation campaigns aim to discredit French military in Sahel, analysts say	On Feb. 20, Ivory Coast became the latest African nation to expel French troops, taking control of the last remaining French military base in the country. This followed the departure of French forces from Chad, which had hosted them for nearly 70 years. These moves marked the end of France's military presence in the Sahel region, after the expulsions from Mali, Burkina Faso and Niger, all ruled by military juntas. Chadian President Mahamat Idriss Deby called the French withdrawal a 'new dawn for a fully sovereign Chad.' Nigerian Senator Shehu Sani, with 3.3 million followers on X, claimed, 'The French forces are of no use,' contradicting the statistical data. Since France began withdrawing in 2022, conflict-related fatalities in the Sahel have risen by 65%, according to the Armed Conflict Location and Event Data Project (ACLED). Analysts point to Russian propaganda and disinformation campaigns as key drivers of the shift away from France in the Sahel. Bakary Sambe of the Timbuktu Institute told VOA that Russia has exploited anti-imperialist sentiment and historical colonial grievances to turn public opinion in Africa against France. The military leaders of Niger, Mali and Burkina Faso, after expelling French forces, have increasingly aligned with Russia, which has deployed Wagner mercenaries across the region. Human rights groups have accused Russian troops in Africa of committing abuses against civilians. As French forces departed Chad, identical pro-Russian messages circulated on social media, often from influencers known for pushing anti-Western narratives. X content creators including African Hub, Typical African and RT News India echoed the sentiment, framing the French withdrawal as the end of colonial exploitation, dating back to the French invasion in 1900. All three accounts posted a video of French troops' departure from Chad with identical wording that described it as France's 'final humiliation.' The Africa Center for Strategic Studies, affiliated with the U.S. Defense Department, notes that Russia is the primary source of disinformation in Africa, with over 80 documented campaigns targeting more than 20 countries. These campaigns leverage paid African influencers, digital avatars and manipulated media to fuel anti-Western sentiment. The ''Russian embassies appear to have helped set up a network of ostensibly African grassroots front organizations,'' the Africa Center said. These disinformation campaigns 'employ paid African influencers, digital avatars, and the circulation of fake and out-of-context videos and photographs. These messages copy-and-paste from and are amplified through multiple channels of Russian state-controlled media, radio, and official communications, creating the repetitive echo chambers in which disinformation narratives become rote,'' the Africa Center reported. The Africa Digital Democracy Observatory (ADDO) tracks how digital tools shape public opinion in Africa, noting the influence of prominent pan-Africanist figures such as Kemi Seba and Nathalie Yamb. The U.S. State Department said Seba was closely working with Russian political operatives linked to the now deceased oligarch and Wagner Group leader Yevgeny Prigozhin, seeking to influence elections in Madagascar. Yamb has been involved in Russian-backed activities, including attending the 2019 Russia-Africa summit. During the 2023 Niger coup, Russian content creators falsely claimed that ECOWAS (Economic Community of West African States) was planning an invasion of Niger, a narrative debunked by ECOWAS leaders. Russia has also expanded its cultural influence in the Sahel, establishing 'Russian Houses' across the region. In N'djamena, Chad's capital, VOA's Henry Wilkins visited one such 'Russian House' last month. Unlike Western cultural institutes, these Russian centers are involved in propaganda efforts, with some training journalists to spread anti-Western disinformation, Wilkins reported. The Russian Embassy in Chad and the Russian Ministry of Foreign Affairs did not respond to VOA requests for comment. Russia's goal, according to Constantin Gouvy of the Clingendael Institute, is to replace Western powers such as France as the primary partner for the Sahel states using disinformation to destabilize the region. Sambe of the Timbuktu Institute suggests that Russia's actions in Africa are a form of retaliation against NATO, particularly France, for its role in European geopolitics.	https://www.voanews.com/a/kremlin-disinformation-campaigns-aim-to-discredit-french-military-in-the-sahel-analysts-say-/7988010.html	2025-02-25T14:57:41-08:00	
Pentagon chief tours Guantanamo Bay as more detainees arrive	Washington — More migrants slated for deportation from the United States have arrived at the detention center at Guantanamo Bay, Cuba, just as U.S. Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth visited the naval base to get an update on mass deportation efforts. A U.S. cargo plane carrying nine migrants from Fort Bliss in Texas landed at Guantanamo Bay midday Tuesday, a U.S. defense official told VOA. A second official said all nine passengers are considered 'high threat illegal aliens,' and they were taken to the detention center there. A third official said that an additional flight carrying more migrants was tentatively scheduled for Wednesday. All of the officials spoke to VOA on the condition of anonymity since they were not authorized to discuss the deportation operations. The new detainees join another 17 detainees sent from Fort Bliss to Guantanamo Bay on Sunday. Neither the Department of Homeland Security (DHS), which is spearheading the U.S. deportation efforts, nor Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) has so far responded to questions about the identities of the detainees, their countries of origin or the crimes with which they are charged. Tuesday's flight carrying detainees from the U.S. mainland to the naval base in Cuba is the second since ICE last Thursday deported 177 detainees who had been brought to Guantanamo Bay earlier this month. Of the 177, officials had said that more than 120 were dangerous criminals, including members of Tren de Aragua, a Venezuelan street gang designated by the U.S. as a foreign terrorist organization. The other 50 or so individuals had been held at the base's migrant facility, designed to hold nonviolent individuals. Hegseth on Tuesday shared photos of his visit to the base on his X social media account, praising U.S. troops there for their support of U.S. deportation efforts. 'These warriors are directly supporting the apprehension and deportation of dangerous illegal aliens,' he wrote in one post. 'We cannot thank them or their families enough.' The commander of U.S. Southern Command, which oversees operations at the naval base at Guantanamo Bay, told lawmakers earlier this month that the base's migrant facility had the capacity to hold about 2,500 nonviolent detainees. Efforts were underway to allow it to house as many as 30,000 nonviolent migrants slated for deportation. U.S. deportation efforts have sparked criticism from immigration rights groups. Earlier this month, the American Civil Liberties Union and several other organizations filed a lawsuit against DHS, alleging the detainees held at the Guantanamo Bay prison facility before being deported Thursday had been improperly denied access to lawyers. DHS dismissed the lawsuit's allegations.	https://www.voanews.com/a/pentagon-chief-tours-guantanamo-bay-as-more-detainees-arrive/7987965.html	2025-02-25T14:14:59-08:00	
House leader works to secure enough votes to pass US budget	WASHINGTON — A partial U.S. government shutdown appeared increasingly likely Tuesday afternoon as U.S. Speaker of the House Mike Johnson worked to secure every single vote in the Republican conference to pass a spending bill. With the slimmest of majorities, Johnson cannot afford to lose a single vote. 'We promised to deliver President Trump's full agenda, not just a part of it. Not just a little bit of it now and return for the rest,' Johnson told reporters Tuesday. But several members of the House Republican conference are still concerned about the size of the spending measure, how and when to enact a proposed extension of the 2017 tax cuts, and how to pay down the U.S. deficit without cutting key safety net programs that help American voters. Senate leadership has proposed passing the tax cuts in a separate bill later this year. 'Not only are we working to find savings for the American taxpayer, a better, more efficient use of their dollar, which we are morally obligated to do, we also have a moral obligation to bend the curve on the debt,' Johnson said. President Donald Trump has called for lawmakers to pass 'one big, beautiful bill' that will be a key part of enacting his domestic policy agenda. Despite Trump expressing his preference for the House of Representatives version of the budget, the Senate passed a funding resolution Friday that provides $150 billion in military funding and $175 billion for border security. That measure also avoids the controversial Medicaid cuts of the House version. Republican Representative Tony Gonzales led a group of seven other House Republicans warning against potential cuts to health care program Medicaid, food assistance funding and other social safety net programs. 'Slashing Medicaid would have serious consequences, particularly in rural and predominantly Hispanic communities where hospitals and nursing homes are already struggling to keep their doors open,' the lawmakers said in a letter to Johnson last week. Republican Representative Thomas Massie, a member of the conservative Freedom Caucus, also said he would vote no on the version of the budget up for a vote. Several House Republicans have not yet announced their votes on the measure. Congressional Democrats also object to the Republican tax cut proposal, arguing it would harm lower-income and middle-class Americans who are already concerned about the cost of living and inflation. In a 'Dear Colleagues' letter sent Monday morning, Democratic Leader Hakeem Jeffries wrote, 'Far-right extremists are determined to push through $4.5 trillion of tax breaks for wealthy Republican donors and well-connected corporations, explode the debt and saddle everyday Americans with the bill by ending Medicaid as we know it. We must be at full strength to enhance our opportunity to stop the GOP Tax Scam in its tracks.' Trump posted on Truth Social last week that 'The House and Senate are doing a SPECTACULAR job of working together as one unified, and unbeatable, TEAM, however, unlike the Lindsey Graham version of the very important Legislation currently being discussed, the House Resolution implements my FULL America First Agenda, EVERYTHING, not just parts of it!' If lawmakers cannot reach a compromise by March 14, there will be a partial government shutdown, leaving millions of federal employees temporarily without pay and suspending some nonessential government services. Senate Majority Leader John Thune did not rule out the possibility of another short-term spending bill to give lawmakers more time to work. 'We're keeping all the options on the table, but we are running out of time,' Thune told reporters Tuesday. The Senate moved forward with a vote on its version of the budget due to uncertainty over the potential success of the vote on the House version. The two versions will have to be compromised to be signed into law. But Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer characterized the vote as a first step toward hurting voters. 'Make no mistake, it will rob seniors, kids and the disabled to pay for the rich to get richer. It's wrong. We're going to use every lever we have at our disposal to lift up the concerns that we are hearing from our constituents, band together and organize with them and fight to stop this tax break for billionaires,' Schumer told reporters Tuesday.	https://www.voanews.com/a/us-house-speaker-works-to-secure-enough-votes-to-pass-budget-avoid-partial-government-shutdown/7987938.html	2025-02-25T14:13:44-08:00	
UN warns two-state solution for Israelis, Palestinians ‘withering away’	UNITED NATIONS — The United Nations’ top official for the Middle East warned Tuesday that the window may be closing on the possibility of achieving a two-state solution for Israelis and Palestinians. 'The people of the region can emerge from this period with peace, security and dignity,' Sigrid Kaag, special coordinator for the Middle East peace process, told a meeting of the U.N. Security Council. 'However, this may be our last chance to achieve the two-state solution.' She later told reporters that the impacts of conflict, the situation in Gaza, the expansion of Israeli settlements and threats of annexation of the West Bank are pushing a two-state solution further away. 'So, it's also my intent to remind the council that statements are one thing, but we need action,' she said. 'And it's the two-state solution as a viable solution, geographically, is withering away before our very eyes. And words themselves won't solve it. It needs active political engagement and diplomacy.' In the council, Kaag expressed alarm about the expansion of Israeli military operations in the West Bank that began on Jan. 21, particularly in Jenin, Tubas and Tulkarm. 'Israeli forces have deployed airstrikes and other heavy weapons, while Palestinian militants have used improvised explosive devices and carried out shooting attacks,' she said. 'This takes place alongside continued violence and intimidation by Israeli settlers against Palestinians and attacks by Palestinians against Israelis. Gaza ceasefire On Gaza, Kaag said the three-phase ceasefire and hostage release deal must be implemented and the resumption of fighting avoided at all costs. 'I call on both sides to fully honor their commitments to the ceasefire deal and conclude negotiations for the second phase,' she said. 'I commend the mediators — Egypt, Qatar and the United States — for their steadfast work in securing the first phase and pursuing the second phase.' The acting U.S. ambassador said the Trump administration is continuing its work to ensure full implementation of the deal. 'Hamas still holds 63 hostages, including New Jersey native Idan Alexander and the remains of four Americans murdered by Hamas in Gaza,' Ambassador Dorothy Shea said of the U.S.-designated terror group. 'As long as Hamas stands as a force that can govern, or as a force that can administer, or as a force that can threaten by use of violence, peace becomes impossible,' she said. 'Hamas must be eliminated. It must be eradicated.' Israel’s ambassador agreed, saying Israel would continue to act. 'We will not be deterred. We will eliminate Hamas,' Danny Danon told council members. 'Believe me when I say it. We will bring our people home, and we will secure the safety and future of Israel.' Pressed further on whether that includes resuming the fighting, Danon told reporters that is one option, but other options are also being discussed. He referenced as an example a deal that saw Palestine Liberation Organization fighters leave Lebanon to Tunisia, following Israel’s 1982 invasion of Lebanon in pursuit of them. 'But the end game will be no Hamas in Gaza,' he said. Palestinian envoy Riyad Mansour expressed concern that the first phase of the ceasefire will expire in days with no firm agreement on the second phase. 'For the U.S., the conclusion of this agreement and its implementation is about the hostages. But for Israel, was it?' Mansour said to the council. 'The next few days yet again test its true priorities. Will they destroy the ceasefire and resume fighting? Or will they — will all of you, will all of us — make the ceasefire permanent to save lives?' Israeli hostage appeal Noa Argamani, a young Israeli woman kidnapped from the Nova music festival on Oct. 7, 2023, and held hostage for eight months by Hamas in Gaza before her rescue by the Israeli military, appealed for the parties to fully implement the three phases of the fragile ceasefire deal so all remaining hostages, living and dead, are released. She said her partner, Avinatan Or, who was also taken captive, is not eligible for release until the second phase of the deal. 'Work hard to get everyone home now,' Argamani told the Security Council, the first time a former Oct. 7 hostage has directly addressed the council. She said the remaining hostages 'are in hell' and 'deserve to come back home.' Under the terms of the deal agreed upon in mid-January, the first stage of 42 days will expire this Saturday. Local news reports say 30 Israeli and foreign hostages have been released, plus the remains of four slain captives, including two children. Hundreds of Palestinian prisoners have also been released. Israel’s military has pulled back to the edges of Gaza, and Palestinians have begun returning to their homes in the north of the Gaza Strip, which was previously off-limits. The second phase is expected to see the remaining male hostages freed, including soldiers, in exchange for more Palestinian prisoners. And in the third phase, the bodies of dead Israeli hostages are expected to be exchanged for dead Palestinian fighters. Argamani warned that 'every second in captivity is dangerous.' 'This is why it is absolutely critical that we end this terrible tragedy. Without immediate action, many more innocent people will be killed,' she said.	https://www.voanews.com/a/un-warns-two-state-solution-for-israelis-palestinians-withering-away/7987942.html	2025-02-25T14:12:45-08:00	
AU, Somalia agree on troop numbers for new mission	The federal government of Somalia and the African Union have agreed on the number of troop-contributing countries for a new AU mission following weeks of differences between Ethiopia and Somalia, and later on between Somalia and Burundi over the number of troops coming from each country. An AU official, who requested anonymity because he does not have authorization to speak with media, told VOA that Burundian forces who have been in Somalia since 2007 will be leaving the country after the two governments disagreed on the number of troops coming from Burundi. The African Union Support and Stabilization Mission in Somalia, or AUSSOM, is expected to have 11,900 personnel operating on the ground in Somalia, including soldiers, police and civilian support staff, according to Somali and AU officials. The new arrangement allocates 4,500 soldiers to Uganda, 2,500 to Ethiopia, 1,520 to Djibouti, 1,410 to Kenya and 1,091 to Egypt, according to the official. A second AU diplomat who requested anonymity for the same reasons told VOA that the negotiations about Burundian soldiers in Somalia are still ongoing. 'The departure of Burundi would have significant political and financial repercussions for the AU,' the second diplomat said. 'In addition, there is still a major issue of funding for AUSSOM that has not been resolved. Burundi sacrificed a lot, and they deserve to have their concerns addressed,' he added. There will also be several hundred police personnel from Nigeria, Sierra Leone, and Egypt, to be based in Mogadishu, Jowhar, and Baidoa. The completion of the troop-contributing countries was delayed by diplomatic tension between Somalia and landlocked Ethiopia over the latter’s controversial sea access deal with Somaliland on Jan. 1, 2024. Mogadishu protested the deal as a 'violation of its sovereignty and territorial integrity.' Somaliland is a breakaway region of Somalia. The tensions eased after the two sides reached a breakthrough agreement on Dec. 11 in Ankara with the mediation of Turkey, where they pledged to end their differences. This week, Somalia and Ethiopia signed an agreement that secured the participation of Ethiopian troops in the new African Union mission in Somalia. The agreement followed a visit to Mogadishu over the weekend by an Ethiopian delegation led by military chief Field Marshal Birhanu Jula, accompanied by Ethiopian intelligence chief Redwan Hussien, where they met with their Somali counterparts, General Odawa Yusuf Rage and Abdullahi Mohamed Ali Sanbalolshe. State media in Somalia and Ethiopia both confirmed the visit. Somalia’s National News Agency, or SONNA, said the talks focused on counterterrorism, regional stability and the role of Ethiopian forces in AUSSOM. 'The chiefs underscored the role of ENDF (Ethiopian National Defense Force) in African Union peace support operations and agreed on the Force disposition of ENDF in the African Union Support and Stabilization mission in Somalia (AUSSOM),' said a communique published by SONNA. Ethiopian troops will be deployed to the same Somali regions where they were stationed over the years — Gedo, Bay, Bakool and Hiran regions. The only new troops joining the mission will come from Egypt, which supported Somalia in Mogadishu's dispute with Ethiopia. Ethiopia also maintains troops outside the AU mission based on a bilateral agreement. This week’s deal between Ethiopian and Somali officials extends that arrangement. 'At bilateral level, the Chiefs agreed to develop a Status of Force Agreement a (SOFA) for all the bilateral forces that will operate in Somalia,' Sunday’s communique read. The first AU contingent from Uganda was deployed in Somalia in March 2007 at a time when al-Shabab was gaining a foothold in the country. The U.S.-designated terrorist group remains a threat to the international community-backed government. On Tuesday, al-Shabab launched multiple front attacks in central Somalia, entering small towns and villages before government forces repelled them. In the semi-autonomous region of Puntland, security forces are continuing their almost two months long offensive against Islamic State militants, taking one town after the other. Local security officials say they are confident of capturing the largest main base of the group within days.

German election winner: Europe must defend itself as US 'does not care'	London — Germany’s likely next chancellor has warned that the United States cares little about Europe’s fate and has called for the continent to urgently organize its own defense capabilities, marking a profound shift in approach from Europe’s biggest economy. 'I would never have thought that I would have to say something like this in a TV show. But after Donald Trump's remarks last week, it is clear that the Americans — or in any case, the Americans in this administration — do not care much about the fate of Europe,' Friedrich Merz said in a post-election televised debate after his Christian Democrats, or CDU Party, won 28.5% of the vote in Sunday’s election, 8% ahead of the second place Alternative for Germany Party, or AfD. 'My absolute priority will be to strengthen Europe as quickly as possible so that step by step, we can really achieve independence from the USA,' added Merz. He said the NATO summit in June could be a defining moment, adding that it’s unknown whether allies 'would still be talking about NATO in its current form or whether we will have to establish an independent European defense capability much more quickly.' Ukraine support Until now, Germany has been the second-biggest donor of military aid to Ukraine, after the United States. Merz may seek to boost that support, according to Liana Fix of the Washington-based Council on Foreign Relations. 'Friedrich Merz has spoken in favor of Ukraine's victory. In general, he has adopted a more hawkish position than [outgoing Chancellor] Olaf Scholz had. He advocated for German long-range missile deliveries to Ukraine, the Taurus. He made clear that support for Ukraine will have to continue, even if a ceasefire deal is reached,' Fix told VOA. Merz’s election victory came on the eve of the third anniversary of Russia’s full-scale invasion of Ukraine. The Brandenburg Gate, once the frontier between east and west Berlin during the Cold War, was lit up Monday in the Ukrainian national colors to mark the anniversary. The potential threat from Moscow loomed heavy over the German election. Berlin resident Juergen Harke, who was among those attending a pro-Ukrainian demonstration outside the Russian Embassy, said it was vital that Merz remains true to his word. 'I hope that the new government will continue to supply weapons to Ukraine, that it will work together with the European states to develop a major counterweight to Russia — and now also to Trump,' Harke told Reuters. Shifts in US policy Trump has engineered a dramatic change in U.S. policy toward Ukraine and its defense against the Russian invasion. Last week, he falsely blamed Kyiv for starting the war and labeled Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy a 'dictator.' On Monday, the U.S. joined Russia in voting against a European-backed resolution at the United Nations Security Council which blamed Moscow for the war and called for an immediate withdrawal of Russian troops from Ukraine. Monday on his social media platform Truth Social, Trump congratulated Merz on his victory. 'Looks like the conservative party in Germany has won the very big and highly anticipated election. Much like the USA, the people of Germany got tired of the no common sense agenda, especially on energy and immigration that has prevailed for so many years,' Trump wrote, using all capital letters. Russia, meanwhile, said it would wait to see how relations with the new German chancellor play out. 'Each time we want to hope for a more sober approach to reality, for a more sober approach to what could be issues of mutual interest [between Russia and Germany] and mutual benefits. But let's see how it will be in reality,' Kremlin spokesperson Dmitry Peskov told reporters on Monday. Europe defense The sudden reversal in U.S. foreign policy has shocked Europe, said analyst Mattia Nelles, founder of the German-Ukrainian Bureau, a policy consultancy based in Dusseldorf. 'We are, as Germany, shocked and utterly unprepared for the end of the Pax Americana, the end of America providing security for Europe. And we now find ourselves in a difficult position to organize the transition away from U.S. being the leading provider of security to a more European-driven approach — not just to Ukraine, but to organizing our own self-defense,' Nelles told VOA. 'And that’s a huge effort. It’s going to require a lot of political will,' he said. 'But Merz has said he's willing to lead on that, and let's see whether we are able to step up.' Can Europe afford to pay for its own defense? 'Merz can agree to joint debt on the European level, which the conservatives always hated,' Fix of the Council on Foreign Relations said. Europe is currently holding around $200 billion of Russian state assets, which were frozen following the invasion. Merz 'can agree to seizing Russian frozen assets, which has not been done so far but should be done soon before Hungary vetoes. He has talked about the U.K. and France having to extend the nuclear umbrella to Germany as a possible pathway,' Fix added. German debt In the election campaign, Merz supported maintaining Germany’s so-called 'debt brake,' which limits annual government borrowing to only 0.35% of the country’s gross domestic product. Germany’s budget deficit is among the lowest in the G7 group of nations, although critics say the policy blocks critical investment. Merz has hinted that the debt brake may be eased to boost defense spending. 'Given the challenges at hand, we're looking at the reform of the so-called debt brake, and that requires constitutional amendments, for which there is not a majority of the centrist parties in parliament,' Nelles noted. The Christian Democrats are well short of a majority, but Merz has ruled out forming a coalition with the far-right AfD. Far-right firewall The so-called 'firewall' around the AfD, whereby German centrist parties have refused to rely on parliamentary votes or to enter any coalition with the far right, has been strongly criticized by Washington. Alice Weidel, co-leader of the AfD, echoed those concerns. 'We consider this blockade to be undemocratic. You cannot exclude millions of voters per se,' she told supporters on Monday. Instead, Merz plans to begin coalition talks with the Social Democrats of outgoing Chancellor Olaf Scholz. 'The conservatives now have to negotiate and change the tone and find constructive agreement with the Social Democrats on the difficult issues ranging from migration to debt reform in Germany, public financing, rebooting the German economic model and of course, on Ukraine,' Nelles said. Merz said Monday that he hoped a coalition government would be formed by Easter at the latest. 'There's optimism that there is a reenergized focus now — with Germany soon having a functioning government again and a majority in parliament — reenergizing and joining this coalition of the willing, to rally more support for Ukraine and more support for European defense,' Nelles added.	https://www.voanews.com/a/german-election-winner-europe-must-defend-itself-as-us-does-not-care/7987844.html	2025-02-25T12:11:33-08:00	
What's behind Israeli, US silence on Lebanon blocking Iranian flights delivering cash to Hezbollah?	WASHINGTON — Israel and the United States have responded with silence to claims by Hezbollah that the two allies secretly threatened Lebanon this month into stopping the arrivals of Iranian commercial airliners delivering cash to the Lebanese terror group. The silence of the Israeli and U.S. governments on Hezbollah's allegations is typical of their low-key approaches to dealing with some regional security problems, according to U.S. and Israeli researchers who spoke to VOA in recent days. The researchers also say Lebanon's indefinite suspension of landing rights for Iranian airlines, in effect since Feb. 13, will make it harder but not impossible for Iran to airlift cash to Hezbollah, its main regional proxy force. Beirut began the suspension by calling it a 'security' measure and denying landing rights to a scheduled flight that day of Iran's Mahan Air, whose passengers were left stranded in Tehran. Lebanese authorities initially said the halt to commercial flights from Iran would last five days but then extended it with no declared end date. A day before the flight suspension began, the Israeli military posted a warning to the X social media platform, calling for a stop to Iran's elite military Quds Force using civilian planes to smuggle cash to Hezbollah via Beirut's airport. The warning said Israel 'will use all available means' to ensure its security, as Hezbollah tries to refinance and rebuild from major losses sustained in a months-long Israeli offensive that ended with a November ceasefire. Iran's U.N. mission in New York did not respond when asked by VOA to comment on the Israeli warning. In a recorded speech televised on February 16, Hezbollah chief Naim Qassem said the Lebanese government had received a warning that Israel would attack the Beirut airport runway if the Mahan Air jet had been granted permission to land there. On Feb. 19, Hezbollah TV network Al Manar published a commentary that also blamed the flight's cancelation on 'American bullying and threats,' which it said included 'U.S. financial and political sanctions' on Lebanon if the government did not agree to 'limit' Hezbollah's freedom of movement. In a conversation with reporters on February 18, Lebanese President Jospeh Aoun said his government's measures against Iranian airlines 'are linked to the sanctions imposed on them.' Several Iranian airlines, including Mahan Air and Iran Air, are under U.S. and EU sanctions that prohibit transactions with those companies. The Lebanese Embassy in Washington did not respond to a VOA request for comment on whether the government had received a warning that Israel would bomb Beirut's airport runway if the Mahan Air flight had landed there on Feb. 13. The Israeli military also has declined to comment to VOA on whether it made such a threat. The U.S. State Department did not respond to several VOA inquiries about whether it conveyed Israel's Feb. 12 warning to the Lebanese government through the U.S.-led ceasefire monitoring mechanism. Israeli Brigadier General (Retired) Assaf Orion, a defense researcher at the Washington Institute for Near East Policy, said Israel did not have to publicize a specific threat against Beirut's airport to get its point across to Lebanon. He cited multiple Israeli strikes on Syria's main civilian airports in Damascus and Aleppo in October and November 2023. The strikes, which left the Syrian airports temporarily inoperable, were part of a years-long Israeli military campaign to obstruct Iranian arms shipments to Hezbollah through Syria, then ruled by Iranian ally Bashar al-Assad. 'Look at Israel's track record at Damascus International Airport. Assad, before he fled Syria into exile in December, understood that if he wanted his airport to be operational, he needed to stop it from bringing in Iranian arms shipments,' Orion said. The U.S. also typically conveys warnings to Lebanon through a combination of private communications and public diplomacy rather than through issuing public threats, said former Israeli intelligence official Avi Melamed, who runs Inside the Middle East, a U.S. nonprofit research group. U.S. Deputy Special Envoy for the Middle East Morgan Ortagus, in a visit to Lebanon on Feb. 7, told reporters that Hezbollah must be prevented from using any role in the Lebanese government to terrorize the Lebanese people, calling that a 'red line' for Washington. She did not mention the possibility of any new sanctions on Lebanon. U.S. Major General Jasper Jeffers, who arrived in Lebanon in November to lead the ceasefire monitoring mechanism, has said little publicly about his work. In a January 15 comment, the latest of three Jeffers statements published by the U.S. Embassy in Beirut, he commended the Lebanese Armed Forces' efforts in 'providing for the security and stability of Lebanon.' The researchers said Iran's inability to fly its civilian planes to the Lebanese capital will complicate its longstanding efforts to deliver cash by air to Hezbollah. Eyal Zisser, a Middle East history professor at Tel Aviv University, said Iran has alternative options of transporting cash on Iraqi and Turkish airliners that fly to Beirut. 'But if you are moving millions of dollars through Iraqi and Turkish airports, you would need cooperation from authorities of those countries,' Zisser said. 'Transferring the money from an Iranian plane to a Turkish plane at a Turkish airport would be a complicated process.' Delivering smaller amounts of cash on Iraqi and Turkish flights to Beirut would be relatively easier for Iran and harder for authorities of other nations to prove as illicit activity, according to David Daoud of the Washington-based Foundation for Defense of Democracies. The Lebanese government began asserting more control over security at Beirut's airport last October, reducing the influence of Hezbollah as it was reeling from Israel's offensive. But Daoud said Lebanon's decision to suspend flights only from Iran, rather than from other nations, shows that its tightening of security has been inconsistent.	https://www.voanews.com/a/what-s-behind-israeli-us-silence-on-lebanon-blocking-iranian-flights-delivering-cash-to-hezbollah-/7987736.html	2025-02-25T12:06:26-08:00	
Canada’s immigration overhaul signals global shift in student migration	From Europe to North America, nations are tightening their immigration policies. Now Canada, long seen as one of the world's most welcoming nations, has introduced sweeping changes affecting international students.

US consumer confidence drops sharply, survey shows	U.S. consumer confidence plunged in February in its biggest monthly decline in more than four years, a business research group said Tuesday. The Conference Board said its consumer confidence index dropped from 105.3 in January to 98.3 this month, the largest month-to-month decline since August 2021. With U.S. consumer spending accounting for about 70% of the world’s largest economy, the three major stock indexes on Wall Street all fell on news of the report. The tech-heavy NASDAQ dropped by more than a percentage point. The Conference Board said in a statement, 'Views of current labor market conditions weakened. Consumers became pessimistic about future business conditions and less optimistic about future income. Pessimism about future employment prospects worsened and reached a 10-month high.' Separately, U.S. Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent contended Tuesday that the U.S. economy is more fragile under the surface than economic indicators suggest, and he vowed to 'reprivatize' growth by cutting government spending and regulation. In his first major economic policy address, Bessent told a group at the Australian Embassy in Washington that interest rate volatility, enduring inflation and reliance on the public sector for job growth have hobbled the American economy, despite general national economic growth and low unemployment. Bessent blamed 'prolific overspending' under former President Joe Biden and regulations that have hindered supply-side growth as the main drivers of 'sticky inflation.' 'The previous administration's over-reliance on excessive government spending and overbearing regulation left us with an economy that may have exhibited some reasonable metrics but ultimately was brittle underneath,' he said. Bessent said that 95% of all job growth in the past 12 months has been concentrated in public and government-adjacent sectors, such as health care and education, jobs offering slower wage growth and less productivity than private-sector jobs. Meanwhile, he said jobs in manufacturing, metals, mining and information technology all contracted or flatlined over the same period. 'The private sector has been in recession,' Bessent said. 'Our goal is to reprivatize the economy.' Consumers had appeared increasingly confident heading toward the end of 2024 and spent generously during the holiday season. But U.S. retail sales dropped sharply in January, with unusually cold weather throughout much of the U.S. taking some of the blame. Retail sales fell 0.9% last month from December, the Commerce Department reported last week. The decline, the biggest in a year, came after two months of robust gains. With inflation remaining a concern for consumers and uncertainty about President Donald Trump’s plan to impose new or stiffer tariffs on imports from other countries, policymakers at the country’s central bank, the Federal Reserve, have taken a cautious approach on whether to further cut its benchmark interest rate. The Fed left its key borrowing rate alone at its last meeting after cutting it at the previous three. 'Consumers' confidence has deteriorated sharply in the face of threats to impose large tariffs and to slash federal spending and employment,' Pantheon Macroeconomics chief Samuel Tombs wrote in a note to clients. Some information in this report came from The Associated Press, Reuters and Agence France-Presse.	https://www.voanews.com/a/us-consumer-confidence-drops-sharply-survey-shows/7987763.html	2025-02-25T11:39:38-08:00	
US expands visa restrictions on Cubans tied to labor export program	WASHINGTON — The United States has expanded an existing visa restriction policy to target Cuban officials believed to be tied to a labor program that sends Cuban workers overseas, particularly health care workers, U.S. Secretary of State Marco Rubio said on Tuesday. In a statement, Rubio said the expanded restrictions target individuals and immediate family members of individuals believed to be responsible for the program, which he described as 'forced labor.' The U.S. has already imposed restrictions on several people, including some Venezuelans, he added. The Caribbean island nation's health service generates major export earnings by sending health workers around the world. 'Cuba's labor export programs, which include the medical missions, enrich the Cuban regime, and in the case of Cuba's overseas medical missions, deprive ordinary Cubans of the medical care they desperately need in their home country,' Rubio said. The Cuban government did not immediately respond to a request for comment. The United States and Cuba have had a strained relationship since Fidel Castro took over in a 1959 revolution, and a U.S. trade embargo has been in place for decades.	https://www.voanews.com/a/us-expands-visa-restrictions-on-cubans-tied-to-labor-export-program/7987728.html	2025-02-25T11:23:53-08:00	
More Thai firms turning up on US sanctions list for trade with Russia	BANGKOK — Thailand is emerging as one of Russia’s main pipelines for machine and computer parts with the potential for military use, with a growing number of local companies accused of helping Moscow evade Western export controls meant to cripple its war on Ukraine. Since Russia’s full-scale invasion of Ukraine in February 2022, the United States has imposed sanctions on seven companies in Thailand for exporting these 'high priority items' to Russia, the last of them in December. Trade data published last year by S&P Global, a financial analytics and services firm based in New York, also show a huge spike in these exports out of Thailand since 2022. Thailand eluded mention when the U.S. Treasury and Commerce departments started warning in mid-2023 of third countries being used to funnel high-priority items to Russia as a way of skirting the West’s export controls. 'So, it was a surprise to see them … as a new country or a new location which had been involved in this type of goods transaction,' Byron McKinney, a sanctions risk and supply chain expert at S&P Global Market Intelligence, told VOA of his team’s research. Supply chains hit by sanctions, McKinney said, are 'a little like water in a stream — if you try damming in one place, it will try and move around. So, Thailand kind of appeared in this way, as a country which wasn’t there originally for the transshipment or transit of these goods but has appeared later on.' Within days of the 2022 invasion, the U.S. Commerce Department placed export controls on dozens of high-priority items it said Russia needed most 'to sustain its brutal attack on Ukraine,' from ball bearings to microchips. These are commonly known as dual-use goods for their potential to be put to both civilian and military use. A 2024 report by McKinney and his team shows China exporting or reexporting the vast majority of these goods to Russia since the invasion — over $6 billion worth in 2023 alone. It also shows countries funneling more such goods to Russia than Thailand. But of the 14 countries whose exports and reexports to Russia that the report breaks down, Thailand saw the sharpest spike of any, from $8.3 million in 2022 to $98.7 million in 2023, a jump of over 1,000%. Thailand’s 2023 shipments also included an especially large proportion of the most sensitive, high-priority goods such as microchips, designated by U.S. Customs as Tier 1. More recent data shared with VOA by S&P Global show Thailand’s exports and reexports of high-priority goods to Russia again topping $90 million in 2024. McKinney said the trade routes on which the goods are shipped are in constant flux. But for the time being, he added, 'Thailand just happens to be in an area where there’s the possibility to transit these goods easier or quicker because maybe the regulation is a bit more light touch, for example, than it would be in other locations. So, it kind of gets picked on from that particular perspective and … turns up as a particular transit or transshipment hub.' The U.S. has put sanctions on seven Thailand-registered companies in the past 13 months. The first was NAL Solutions in January 2024. In announcing the sanctions, the U.S. Treasury Department said NAL was part of a network of companies controlled by Russian national Nikolai Aleksandrovich Levin channeling electronics and other goods from the United States and other countries to Russia. Washington sanctioned another five firms in Thailand in October, including Intracorp, which Treasury accused of setting up other companies that send high-priority goods to Russia. Treasury also tied Thailand’s Siam Expert Trading — added to the sanctions list in December — to the TGR Group, which it described as 'a sprawling international network of businesses and employees that have facilitated significant sanctions circumvention on behalf of Russian elites.' Five of the seven firms did not reply to VOA’s repeated requests for comment about the sanctions. The other two could not be reached. Spokespersons for the Thai government and Ministry of Commerce, which oversees the country’s exports and company licensing, did not reply to VOA’s requests for comment either. Since the full-scale invasion of Ukraine, Thailand has been keen to keep up warm diplomatic and economic ties with Russia. At an international summit on China’s Belt and Road Initiative in Beijing two years ago, Thailand’s prime minister at the time, Srettha Thavisin, hailed his country’s 'close relations' with Russia, shook hands with Russian President Vladimir Putin and invited him to Thailand. 'When Srettha became prime minister in 2023, he was focused like a laser on economic growth and viewed Russia as a useful economic partner,' Ian Storey, a senior fellow at the ISEAS-Yusof Ishak Institute in Singapore, told VOA. 'Visa-free entry was extended for Russian tourists, and the authorities turned a blind eye to incidents of antisocial behavior and illegal activities.' He said Prime Minister Paetongtarn Shinawatra, who replaced Srettha last year, has carried on both his fixation on economic growth and neutral stance on the Russia-Ukraine war. Just last month at Putin’s invitation, Thailand joined BRICS, a group of developing countries with Brazil, Russia, India, China and South Africa at its core, focused on forging closer economic ties. And while bilateral trade between Russia and Thailand has been falling in recent years, Storey says Russians have become major players in Thailand’s property market. They have also helped boost Thailand’s tourism sector, a pillar of the economy. In an interview with Russia’s state-owned TASS news agency in 2023, Vitaly Kiselev, president of the Thai-Russian Chamber of Commerce, said Western sanctions on Moscow were also opening up more trade opportunities between Russia and Thailand. He said chamber membership was on the rise. Given Thailand’s priorities, and U.S. President Donald Trump’s approach to negotiating an end to the Russia-Ukraine war, Storey doubts that Thai authorities will step in to stop the country’s trade in dual-use goods. 'If Bangkok hasn't taken action to crack down on this trade three years after the war started, there's little chance that it will do so now, especially as the Trump administration is making nice with Russia,' he said. Across Asia, only Japan, Singapore, South Korea and Taiwan have imposed trade restrictions or other sanctions on Russia since the 2022 invasion.	https://www.voanews.com/a/more-thai-firms-turning-up-on-us-sanctions-list-for-trade-with-russia-/7987637.html	2025-02-25T10:24:18-08:00	
Dying to leave: Why Pakistanis are risking their lives to reach Europe	ISLAMABAD — When Amir Ali left the narrow alleys of his village in Pakistan’s Punjab province last summer for Spain, he thought his dream of a better life was finally coming true. The 21-year-old had failed seven times before to get a visa for countries in Europe and the Middle East. Six months later, in mid-January, Ali was one of 22 Pakistani men whom Moroccan authorities rescued from a stranded migrant boat in the Atlantic Ocean off the coast of West Africa. At least 43 Pakistanis were among 50 men who perished from hunger, dehydration and physical torture at the hands of human smugglers. Limping with an injured foot in his home in Gujranwala district, Ali said he felt lucky to be alive. 'It’s not as if we survived because of some food or water,' he said. 'Not at all. It’s just that God wanted to save us, so we survived.' Since December 2024, dozens of Pakistanis have died as boats carrying migrants to Europe have run into accidents. While Pakistan does not rank among the top 10 countries from which migrants attempting irregular entry into Europe come, thousands of its nationals risk their lives every year to reach the continent. Human smugglers are becoming savvy too, officials say, as kingpins move to evade an ongoing crackdown, and rely on digital currencies to transfer the proceeds of their crime. A harrowing journey Ali traveled 1,200 kilometers south of Gujranwala to Karachi, where he boarded a plane to Senegal on a visa that smugglers had arranged. 'I didn’t even know that a country with that name existed,' Ali told VOA. From Senegal he obtained a visa to enter Mauritania, where he stayed in a safe house with dozens of other migrants for almost five months. The dream journey was turning into a nightmare. 'There were so many boys in one room, there was no room to sit,' Ali said. 'It was mentally very tough.' In the wee hours of the morning on Jan. 2, he was stuffed with more than 80 others on a boat headed from Nouakchott, Mauritania, to Spain’s Canary Islands. After a day of travel, the boat ran out of fuel. To lighten the load, Ali said, the smugglers threw away the passengers’ belongings and took away their meager rations. 'On the fourth day on the boat, a man went crazy because of hunger. He jumped into the ocean. We all got very scared thinking about what was going to happen next,' Ali said. Smugglers, the survivor said, thrashed anyone who complained or didn’t comply. 'The smugglers told us to throw the dead bodies in the water,' said Ali. 'When we refused, thinking how could we throw our brothers, they beat us up a lot.' The ordeal ended almost two weeks later when Moroccan authorities rescued the survivors after a fishing boat spotted them. Ali’s family sold livestock and precious agricultural land and took loans to raise $10,000 to get their son to Spain. His mother is worried about the debt but delighted that her son is alive. Who is leaving and why Almost two hours away in Gujrat district of Punjab, Haji Shaukat Ali is devastated. His son Chaudhry Atif and nephew Chaudhry Sufyan did not survive. A roadside sign leading to their village commemorates the two as martyrs. 'We sent them because of our weakness,' said Ali, sitting among a group of mourners, some of whom had come from Europe. 'The weakness is money.' Studies conducted by Gallup Pakistan and the Pakistan Institute of Development Economics, or PIDE, in recent years show lack of jobs as the primary reason for wanting to leave a country where economic growth is barely keeping up with population growth. According to Pakistan’s Bureau of Emigration and Overseas Employment, more than 65,000 people left legally to work abroad just in January 2025. Between 2022 and 2024, an average of 800,000 nationals moved abroad for work annually. Most went to the Middle East but a few to Europe. Pakistanis also made nearly 5,000 attempts to enter Europe illegally in 2024, data from the EU’s border and coast guard agency Frontex indicates. Amir Ali’s home district of Gujranwala and Atif and Sufyan’s home district of Gujrat lead in migration trends, along with nearby Sialkot, Mandi Bahauddin and Faisalabad districts, despite being hubs of agriculture and industrial activity. 'They are not the poorest of the poor,' said demographer Durre Nayab, pointing to the ability of migrants from this region to pull together thousands of dollars to fund their journey. 'But it’s not just the financial aspect,' Nayab, who was involved in the PIDE study, told VOA. 'The two other aspects that came out were lifestyle, and somehow, they thought they would gain more respect out of [the] country.' Many Pakistanis wanting to leave felt poorly treated compared to their wealthier countrymen, Nayab explained. 'This difference made them disillusioned about the whole system,' the demographer said. The PIDE study showed 37% of Pakistanis would leave, if given a chance. Does life get better? Kashif Ali, a cousin of the deceased Atif, spent hundreds of dollars to arrange a sponsor for a work permit to Italy a decade ago. 'In Pakistan, a middle-class laborer earns around $3 a day. For that same work, they make $20 to $25 overseas,' said Ali, who works in boat making. His family in Pakistan now has a new home and a car. Such a turn of fortune is on display across small towns and villages in central Punjab. Experts say it inspires many others to risk their lives to reach Europe. It was a similar story of success that made Ishraq Nazir move from Mandi Bahauddin to Greece. He entered the European country after a brief stay in Turkey as a tourist in 2009. It took him a decade to get a Greek residency permit after his asylum request was rejected. For years he worked odd jobs like herding cows and painting trees to get by. Now he works in a packaging factory earning almost $60 a day and said he finally feels settled. 'I had to face a lot of difficulties, but the fact is that if I had stayed in Pakistan, I would have not gotten anything given the type of jobs they have,' Nazir told VOA on the phone while packing disposable plates. 'My friends are still where they started.' Umar Shaid from district Sialkot arrived illegally in Greece by boat from Libya in October. 'I am struggling. It’s very hard to find work. There are very few opportunities. I don’t have any friends or relatives to seek help from,' Shaid said by phone over the sound of the Athens metro. Shaid said he has spent around $15,000 to pay smugglers and take care of his day-to-day expenses. 'Honestly, I believed the stories people told me and took this silly decision,' said Shaid. Still, he said he was not planning to go back to Pakistan. Crackdown on smugglers Pakistan began cracking down on human smuggling after hundreds of its nationals died off the coast of Pylos, Greece, in June 2023 in one of the worst migrant boat disasters. A report by Pakistan’s National Commission for Human Rights says after that disaster, authorities arrested 854 suspected human smugglers. Frustrated by recent incidents, Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif formed a high-level task force in January, with himself as the head, to combat human smuggling. The Federal Investigation Agency, or FIA, has ramped up efforts, arresting dozens of alleged human smugglers and confiscating the assets of others to force them out of hiding. 'For the first time we have seen that they [smugglers] are using Bitcoin and digital currency. They have shifted away from traditional ways of money laundering.' Bilal Tanvir, FIA deputy director for the Gujrat region, told VOA. However, he said a lack of resources and low rate of conviction of alleged criminals posed a challenge in curbing the crime. The FIA is also facing increased scrutiny. Sharif’s government removed the agency head three weeks ago. More than 100 officials have been fired, suspended or blacklisted for alleged involvement in and insufficient action against human smuggling. Survivor Ali told VOA his group of migrant men faced no hurdle boarding the flight for Senegal at the Karachi airport. 'Someone connected with the agents came, held our hand and told us to come after him. Wherever we went, we followed him,' Ali said. 'Nobody stopped us.' Tanvir defended his agency, saying officers focus on those entering the country more than those on their way out. The impact of tragedies Surrounded by friends and neighbors, Ali looked disappointed. He told VOA he would not recommend attempting to reach Europe by boat. Others in the room felt differently. 'Why should I lie?' said Tariq Bajwa, who supports his young sons’ plan to head to Europe illegally in a few years. 'Looking at others, we are willing to try as well.' Several young men in the room agreed. Why Europe? 'Just because,' said Hamza Qayyum, the son of a farmer. 'There’s farming in Europe. I don’t feel like it doing it here,' the 20-year-old with a sixth-grade education explained. Asked if they would risk drowning in the sea, Muhammad Zohaib, whose brothers work in the Middle East asked, 'Why not?' 'Planes crash too, so what’s the big deal if a boat sinks?' the 20-something said. 'One can run into an accident right outside the house.'	https://www.voanews.com/a/dying-to-leave-why-pakistanis-are-risking-their-lives-to-reach-europe/7987593.html	2025-02-25T10:21:02-08:00	
German election winner: Europe must defend itself as US ‘does not care’	Friedrich Merz, who will likely be the next chancellor of Germany after gaining the largest vote share in elections Sunday, has warned that the United States 'does not care much' about the fate of Europe — and called for the continent to urgently organize its own defense capability.

Starmer to boost UK defense spending against Russian threat	British Prime Minister Keir Starmer said Tuesday that the U.K. would increase its defense spending by 2027 to bolster its security against the threat of Russian aggression exhibited by Moscow’s three-year war against Ukraine. Starmer told Parliament that defense spending would increase by $17 billion annually, boosting outlays from 2.3% of the United Kingdom’s economic production to 2.5%, with corresponding cuts in overseas development assistance. Starmer told lawmakers the increased defense spending was a 'generational response' and the 'biggest sustained increase in defense spending since the end of the Cold War.' He said it was necessary because 'tyrants like [Russian President Vladimir] Putin only respond to strength.' 'We must stand by Ukraine, because if we do not achieve a lasting peace, then the economic instability and threats to our security, they will only grow,' said Starmer, who is set to meet with U.S. President Donald Trump in Washington on Thursday. 'And so, as the nature of that conflict changes as it has in recent weeks, it brings our response into sharper focus, a new era that we must meet as we have so often in the past, together, and with strength,' Starmer told the House of Commons. Britain previously said it would increase its defense spending to 2.5% of its national economic production but did not pinpoint a date. It already is one of 23 of the 32 countries in NATO that meets the goal of the West’s main military alliance for each country to spend at least 2% of its gross domestic product on defense. Starmer’s push to increase defense spending comes as European countries have expressed new concerns about ongoing military support from the United States as Trump advances his 'America First' foreign policy agenda and pushes to settle the Ukraine war in discussions with Putin. Starmer has offered to send British troops to Ukraine as part of a force to safeguard any ceasefire that might be agreed to but says an American 'backstop' will be needed to ensure a lasting peace. Trump has not committed to providing security guarantees for Ukraine, saying Monday after meeting with French President Emmanuel Macron at the White House that 'Europe is going to make sure nothing happens.' Trump last week called Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy a 'dictator' but has declined to characterize Putin the same way.

US Supreme Court throws out Oklahoma man's murder conviction, death sentence	Washington — The U.S. Supreme Court on Tuesday threw out the murder conviction and death penalty for Richard Glossip, an Oklahoma man who has steadfastly maintained his innocence and averted multiple attempts by the state to execute him. The justices found that Glossip's trial violated his constitutional rights. The justices heard arguments in October in a case that produced a rare alliance in which lawyers for Glossip and the state argued that the high court should overturn Glossip's conviction and death sentence because he did not get a fair trial. The victim's relatives had told the high court that they want to see Glossip executed. Oklahoma's top criminal appeals court had repeatedly upheld the conviction and sentence, even after the state sided with Glossip. Glossip was convicted and sentenced to death in the 1997 killing in Oklahoma City of his former boss, motel owner Barry Van Treese, in what prosecutors have alleged was a murder-for-hire scheme. Glossip has always maintained his innocence. Another man, Justin Sneed, admitted robbing Van Treese and beating him to death with a baseball bat but testified he only did so after Glossip promised to pay him $10,000. Sneed received a life sentence in exchange for his testimony and was the key witness against Glossip.	https://www.voanews.com/a/us-supreme-court-throws-out-oklahoma-man-s-murder-conviction-death-sentence/7987443.html	2025-02-25T08:06:43-08:00	
Guantanamo Bay: A new front in US immigration policy?	U.S. President Donald Trump plans to send 30,000 undocumented migrants to Guantanamo Bay, the U.S. naval base in Cuba. While it is most well known for housing terror suspects after 9/11 — and for drawing condemnation from human rights groups — Guantanamo has been occasionally used as a processing center for immigrants trying to reach the U.S., mostly from Haiti and Cuba. Although Guantanamo's Migrant Operations Center is separate from the high-security jail, that doesn’t mean it has escaped scrutiny.	https://www.voanews.com/a/guantanamo-bay-a-new-front-in-us-immigration-policy-/7987381.html	2025-02-25T07:51:22-08:00	
Hong Kong Democratic Party’s plan to disband marks ‘end of an era’	TAIPEI, TAIWAN — Hong Kong’s largest and oldest opposition party, the Democratic Party, has announced that it will start the process of disbanding, a move that analysts say will mark 'the end of an era' for the city’s pro-democracy forces. During a press conference last Thursday, Democratic Party chairperson Lo Kin-hei told journalists that the party, founded in 1994, would set up a three-person task force to 'study' the procedures needed for the party to shut down. 'We considered the overall political environment in Hong Kong and all those future plans that we can foresee, and that is the decision that we make,' he said, adding that party members’ votes will determine the final decision for disbandment. Lo did not specify when the vote might take place. Hong Kong’s government has yet to comment on the news of the party’s possible disbandment and authorities did not respond to inquiries from VOA. In an editorial published Monday, the Chinese Communist Party-controlled media outlet Wen Wei Po said the Democratic Party’s planned disbandment was the result of the party’s connections to detained media tycoon Jimmy Lai, who is facing several national security charges, and its support of 'violent protesters' during the 2019 pro-democracy protests. The Democratic Party, founded a few years before the end of British colonial rule, played a pivotal role in Hong Kong’s transition to Chinese governance, with some of its early leaders, including prominent figures such as Martin Lee and Albert Ho, helping to shape the 'One Country, Two Systems' model, a constitutional arrangement set up to give Hong Kong a high degree of autonomy under Chinese rule. Following Hong Kong’s handover to China in 1997, the Democratic Party became the most influential opposition force in the port city’s legislative council, leading street protests and advocating for the fulfillment of universal suffrage and direct elections that were embedded in the Basic Law, the city’s mini-constitution. But following months-long anti-government protests that sent shockwaves across the city in 2019, Beijing initiated a series of moves to tighten control over Hong Kong, including the imposition of the controversial National Security Law, or NSL, in July 2020 and the overhaul of the city’s electoral system that essentially blocks pro-democracy candidates from running in elections. ‘Chilling effect’ felt in Hong Kong Analysts say the Democratic Party’s decision to begin disbandment reflects Hong Kong authorities’ intensifying crackdown on pro-democracy organizations, with several opposition political parties, such as the Civic Party, deciding to shut down due to increasing political pressure and restrictions on operating. 'Democratic Party’s decision to start preparing for disbandment marks the end of the good old times when there were functioning opposition parties that could maintain a presence in the legislative council, serve constituents, and consult the government on policies,' said Maggie Shum, a political scientist at Penn State University in the U.S. Additionally, she said, the crackdown has affected independent bookstores, independent media, and independent institutions. 'It’s like the Hong Kong government is going down a long list of democratic institutions and taking every one of them off the list,' Shum told VOA by phone, adding that the trend has created a 'society-wide chilling effect' in Hong Kong. The Hong Kong Journalist Association, or HKJA, the main journalism group in the city, was forced to scrap its annual fundraising dinner this month after two hotels cancelled bookings. The head of HKJA, Selina Cheng, has said the cancellations were likely the result of 'political pressure' the hotels had faced. Local authorities have said nothing about the issue. Additionally, the Hong Kong Public Opinion Research Institute, which tracks public attitudes on a wide range of issues in the city, announced it would suspend all self-funded research and might even 'close down' after its CEO Robert Chung was summoned by national security police for investigations. Some pro-democracy activists in Hong Kong say authorities have shifted the focus of their crackdowns to groups dedicated to issues such as labor rights in recent months. 'The Hong Kong government has proposed legislative amendments that will ban individuals convicted of national security offenses from being part of labor unions while imposing stricter vetting mechanisms on foreign funding,' said Debby Chan, a former pro-democracy district councilor in Hong Kong. Emily Lau, the former chairperson of the Democratic Party, said these trends show Hong Kong’s political system is pivoting away from democracy. 'More than a dozen groups have dissolved over the last two to three years and in the current environment, it will be hard for pro-democracy figures or organizations to have the space to operate,' she told VOA by phone, adding that Hong Kong authorities’ goal is to 'annihilate' pro-democracy figures’ attempts to 'organize.' Beijing: ‘National security safeguarded’ in Hong Kong In response to inquiries from VOA, the Chinese Embassy in Washington, D.C., said Beijing 'firmly supports' Hong Kong authorities’ efforts to 'safeguard national security' and urged 'critics' to 'stop smearing the Chinese central government’s policy governing Hong Kong.' 'Hong Kong’s economy is booming, and the constitutional order is in stable operation, national security is safeguarded and the ‘patriots ruling Hong Kong’ is implemented,' Liu Pengyu, the Chinese Embassy spokesperson, told VOA in an email. Shum at Penn State said Hong Kong people may 'get disoriented or forced to withdraw from caring about politics' because authorities are rapidly tightening control over civil society and 'taking away their power to take collective actions.' 'Hong Kong is implementing the Chinese model of governance and using an authoritarian way to control every aspect of life,' she told VOA. Shum said Hong Kong’s people could still find symbolic ways to express support for democracy. 'The online censorship in Hong Kong is not as dire as compared to China and there are a lot of exiled media outlets reporting on the situation in Hong Kong, which serve as channels for Hong Kong people to connect with the outside world,' she said, adding that that 'could potentially serve as anchors for people who care about democratic values.'	https://www.voanews.com/a/hong-kong-democratic-party-s-plan-to-disband-marks-end-of-an-era-/7987402.html	2025-02-25T07:49:02-08:00	
Trial begins in Germany for 4 alleged Hamas members	BERLIN — A trial began Tuesday in Germany for four alleged members of U.S.-designated terror group Hamas who are suspected of organizing weapons caches across Europe. The country's top prosecutor accuses the men of membership in a foreign terrorist organization. It's a pilot case for prosecutors, German news agency dpa reported. 'For the first time in Germany, people are facing charges of participating as members of the foreign terrorist organization Hamas,' prosecutor Jochen Weingarten said, according to dpa. The men are accused of seeking out some weapons depots set up years ago, as well as setting up new ones, for Hamas across Europe so it could later use the firearms and ammunition for attacks against Israeli and Jewish targets on the continent, prosecutors said when filing charges last year. The weapons were allegedly moved around Europe in preparation for Hamas' terror attack against Israel on Oct. 7, 2023, prosecutors said. Around 1,200 people, mostly civilians, were killed in that attack, and about 250 taken hostage. The attack triggered Israel's air and ground offensive in Gaza, which has killed more than 48,200 Palestinians, according to Gaza's Health Ministry, which doesn't distinguish between combatants and civilians. The ministry says more than half the dead have been women and children. Hamas also considered targeting the Israeli Embassy in Berlin, the area around Tempelhof Airport in the capital and the U.S. Ramstein Air Base in Germany, authorities said. Abdelhamid Al A., Mohamed B., Nazih R. and Ibrahim El-R. were arrested in December 2023. Prosecutors identified them only by their first name and last initial in line with German privacy laws. All four had important positions within Hamas, prosecutors asserted. The men allegedly set up a weapons cache in Bulgaria in 2019 and in Denmark later that year. They sought to find a spot in Poland but were unsuccessful, prosecutors said.	https://www.voanews.com/a/trial-begins-in-germany-for-4-alleged-hamas-members/7987308.html	2025-02-25T06:54:05-08:00

Church of England eyes disciplining clergy over child abuse scandal	The Church of England will seek to bring disciplinary proceedings against 10 clerics including former Archbishop of Canterbury George Carey, it said on Tuesday, implementing recommendations from an abuse report last year. The CoE, central to 85 million Anglicans worldwide, has been in crisis over safeguarding the vulnerable since the November report, which said ex-leader Justin Welby had taken insufficient action to stop one of the church's most prolific serial abusers. Welby eventually stepped down over the findings. Eight priests and a former bishop were also listed among those potentially facing disciplinary action in the CoE statement as the CoE concluded its own independent review into all clergy criticized in last year's report. That report found that the late John Smyth, a British lawyer who volunteered at Christian summer camps, subjected more than 100 boys and young men to 'brutal and horrific' physical and sexual abuse over a 40-year period. The potential outcomes of the CoE's disciplinary process, which is at its first stage, could result in various penalties ranging from a permanent ban from ministry to resignation by consent. 'We must not forget that at the heart of this case are the survivors and victims who have endured the lifelong effects of the appalling abuse by John Smyth. We are truly sorry,' Alexander Kubeyinje, the CoE's National Director of Safeguarding, said in the statement. 'The Church is committed to taking very seriously its response to the findings of the review as well as responding to its recommendations.'	https://www.voanews.com/a/church-of-england-eyes-disciplining-clergy-over-child-abuse-scandal-/7987210.html	2025-02-25T05:26:43-08:00	
Unknown illness kills over 50 in part of Congo with hours between symptoms and death	KINSHASA, DR Congo — An unknown illness has killed over 50 people in northwestern Congo, according to doctors on the ground and the World Health Organization on Monday. The interval between the onset of symptoms and death has been 48 hours in the majority of cases, and 'that’s what’s really worrying,' Serge Ngalebato, medical director of Bikoro Hospital, a regional monitoring center, told The Associated Press. The latest disease outbreak in the Democratic Republic of Congo began on Jan. 21, and 419 cases have been recorded including 53 deaths. According to the WHO’s Africa office, the first outbreak in the town of Boloko began after three children ate a bat and died within 48 hours following hemorrhagic fever symptoms. There have long been concerns about diseases jumping from animals to humans in places where wild animals are popularly eaten. The number of such outbreaks in Africa has surged by more than 60% in the last decade, the WHO said in 2022. After the second outbreak of the current mystery disease began in the town of Bomate on Feb. 9, samples from 13 cases have been sent to the National Institute for Biomedical Research in Congo’s capital, Kinshasa, for testing, the WHO said. All samples have been negative for Ebola or other common hemorrhagic fever diseases like Marburg. Some tested positive for malaria.	https://www.voanews.com/a/unknown-illness-kills-over-50-in-part-of-congo-with-hours-between-symptoms-and-death-/7987202.html	2025-02-25T05:13:32-08:00	
Taiwan investigating Chinese-crewed ship believed to have severed an undersea cable	TAIPEI, Taiwan — Taiwanese authorities are investigating a Chinese-crewed ship suspected of severing an undersea communications cable in the latest such incident adding to tensions between Taipei and Beijing. Taiwan's coast guard intercepted the Togolese-flagged cargo ship Hongtai in waters between its main island's west coast and the outlying Penghu Islands early Tuesday, according to a statement by the coast guard. The coast guard had earlier been notified by telecommunications provider Chunghwa Telecom that one of its undersea cables had been severed 6 nautical miles (11 kilometers) northwest of Jiangjun Fishing Harbor. The Hongtai had been anchored in that same area since Saturday evening, the coast guard said. From Saturday until early Tuesday, authorities in the nearby Anping Port in Tainan had sent signals to the vessel seven times but had received no response. After the Chunghwa Telecom cable damage report, the coast guard approached the ship, which had begun to sail northwestward, and escorted it to Anping Port. Taiwanese authorities said the ship's entire eight-person crew were Chinese nationals and the case was being handled 'in accordance with national security-level principles.' 'The cause of the underwater cable break, whether it was due to intentional sabotage or simply an accident, is still pending further investigation for clarification,' the coast guard said. 'The possibility of this being part of a gray-zone incursion by China cannot be ruled out,' it added. Communications on the Penghu Islands were not disrupted because Chunghwa Telecom had successfully activated a backup cable, the coast guard said. This is the latest in a series of incidents in recent years in which undersea Taiwanese cables have been damaged — with Taipei in some instances blaming China. Earlier this year, a Chinese cargo ship was suspected of severing a link northeast of the island. In February 2023, two undersea cables serving Taiwan's Matsu Islands were severed, disrupting communications for weeks. Taipei fears China might damage its underwater communications cables as part of attempts to blockade or seize the island, which Beijing claims as its own. A Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesperson said during a regular press briefing on Tuesday that he was not aware of the issue and it did not pertain to diplomacy.	https://www.voanews.com/a/taiwan-investigating-chinese-crewed-ship-believed-to-have-severed-an-undersea-cable-/7987166.html	2025-02-25T04:29:49-08:00	
ICC prosecutor arrives in DR Congo amid conflict in east	Kinshasa, DR Congo — The prosecutor for the International Criminal Court (ICC) Karim Khan has arrived in the DR Congo, his office said Tuesday, as the country grapples with an upsurge in fighting in the east. The Rwanda-backed M23 has in recent weeks seized two major cities in eastern Democratic Republic of Congo, giving the armed group a major foothold in the region since taking up arms again in late 2021. 'We are extremely worried about recent developments in Congo, we know the situation particularly in the east is acute,' Khan told reporters on his arrival in the capital Kinshasa. 'The message has to be conveyed very clearly: any armed group, any armed forces, any allies to armed groups or armed forces don't have a blank cheque,' he said. 'They must comply to international humanitarian law,' Khan added. According to UN experts, the M23 is supported by around 4,000 Rwandan soldiers. Since its resurgence, the fighting between the group and Congolese armed forces has provoked a humanitarian crisis in a region plagued by conflict for three decades. 'This is a moment where we will see if international humanitarian law can withstand the demands that the people of the Democratic Republic of Congo insist upon, which is the equal application of the law,' Khan said. 'The people of the DRC are as precious as... the people of Ukraine, the people of Israel or Palestine, girls or women of Afghanistan,' he added. Khan is set to meet DRC President Felix Tshisekedi, government ministers, the U.N. Secretary General's country representative Bintou Keita, as well as victims of the conflict and civil society members. The first investigation that the ICC opened after it began its work in 2002 concerned the DRC. Since then, the court has convicted three people for crimes committed in the country. The ICC prosecutor's office also opened an investigation in 2023 into allegations of crimes committed since January 2022 in North Kivu province in the east of the vast nation. Khan's office, which visited the country in May 2023, indicated early this month that the current situation in eastern DRC 'is part of the ongoing investigation.'	https://www.voanews.com/a/icc-prosecutor-arrives-in-dr-congo-amid-conflict-in-east-/7987151.html	2025-02-25T04:08:10-08:00	
US again sends ‘high threat’ migrants to Guantanamo Bay	Washington — The United States has started sending more migrants deemed by officials to be 'high threat' criminal aliens to the U.S. naval base at Guantanamo Bay, Cuba, just days after emptying out the base’s migrant facilities. A U.S. defense official confirmed to VOA that a C-130 military cargo plane carrying migrants left Fort Bliss in Texas and arrived at Guantanamo Bay on Sunday. A second defense official said all 17 migrants were assessed to be 'high threat' and are being held at the base’s detention facility. Both officials spoke to VOA on the condition of anonymity to discuss the deportation operations. The Department of Homeland Security (DHS), which is spearheading the U.S. deportation efforts, along with Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE), has not yet responded to questions about the identities of the latest round of detainees sent to Guantanamo Bay, their countries of origin, or the crimes with which they are charged. The latest flight carrying migrants to Guantanamo Bay comes as U.S. Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth is set to visit the base Tuesday to review the military’s efforts to support the mass deportations ordered by U.S. President Donald Trump. Hegseth, according to a Pentagon statement, 'will receive briefings on all mission operations at the base, including at the Migrant Operations Center and the Guantanamo Bay Detention Facility.' 'The Secretary's trip underscores the Department's commitment to ensuring the security and operational effectiveness of Guantanamo Bay Naval Station,' the statement added. ICE announced last Thursday that it had transported 177 migrants being held at Guantanamo Bay to Honduras, where they were to be picked up by the Venezuelan government. U.S. officials had previously said that more than 120 of those detainees were dangerous criminals, including members of Tren de Aragua, a Venezuelan street gang designated by the U.S. as a foreign terrorist organization. The approximately 50 other individuals who were deported Thursday had been held at the base's migrant facility, designed to hold nonviolent individuals. Earlier this month, the commander of U.S. Southern Command, which oversees operations at the naval base at Guantanamo Bay, told lawmakers that the base's migrant facility had the capacity to hold about 2,500 nonviolent detainees. Efforts are under way to allow it to house as many as 30,000 nonviolent migrants slated for deportation. The American Civil Liberties Union, along with several immigration rights groups, earlier this month filed a lawsuit against DHS, alleging the detainees held at the Guantanamo Bay prison facility before being deported had been improperly denied access to lawyers. DHS dismissed the lawsuit's allegations.	https://www.voanews.com/a/us-again-sends-high-threat-migrants-to-guantanamo-bay-/7987133.html	2025-02-25T03:46:07-08:00	
Exploration firm restarts search for MH370 11 years on	Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia — A fresh search for Malaysia Airlines flight MH370 has been launched more than a decade after the plane went missing in one of aviation's greatest enduring mysteries. Maritime exploration firm Ocean Infinity has resumed the hunt for the missing plane, Malaysian transport minister Anthony Loke said Tuesday. Loke told reporters contract details between Malaysia and the firm were still being finalized but welcomed the 'the proactiveness of Ocean Infinity to deploy their ships' to begin the search for the plane which went missing in March 2014. Loke added that details on how long the search would last had not been negotiated yet. He also did not provide details on when exactly the British firm kicked off its hunt. The Malaysian government in December had said it had agreed to launch a new search for MH370, which disappeared more than a decade ago. The Boeing 777 carrying 239 people disappeared from radar screens on March 8, 2014 while en route from Kuala Lumpur to Beijing. Despite the largest search in aviation history, the plane has never been found. 'They (Ocean Infinity) have convinced us that they are ready,' said Loke. 'That's why the Malaysian government is proceeding with this,' he added. In December, Loke had said the new search would be on the same 'no find, no fee' principle as Ocean Infinity's previous search, with the government only paying out if it finds the aircraft. The contract was for 18 months and Malaysia would pay $70 million to the company if the plane was found, Loke previously had said. Ocean Infinity, based in Britain and the United States, carried out an unsuccessful hunt in 2018. The company's first efforts followed a massive Australia-led search for the aircraft that lasted three years before it was suspended in January 2017. The Australia-led search covered 120,000 square kilometers in the Indian Ocean but found hardly any trace of the plane, with only some pieces of debris picked up. The plane's disappearance has long been the subject of theories -- ranging from the credible to outlandish -- including that veteran pilot Zaharie Ahmad Shah had gone rogue. A final report into the tragedy released in 2018 pointed to failings by air traffic control and said the course of the plane was changed manually.	https://www.voanews.com/a/exploration-firm-restarts-search-for-mh370-11-years-on/7987100.html	2025-02-25T02:41:51-08:00	
National dialog a 'historic opportunity' for Syria, interim president says	DAMASCUS, SYRIA — Syria's interim president said on Tuesday his country had a 'historic opportunity' to rebuild, addressing a national dialog summit billed by Syria's Islamist rulers as a key milestone after decades of Assad family rule. Hundreds of Syrians gathered at the presidential palace in Damascus for the one-day event, arriving on a red carpet previously reserved for the few foreign dignitaries visiting former president Bashar al-Assad, until he was toppled last year by a rebel offensive spearheaded by Hayat Tahrir al-Sham (HTS). The group's head, Ahmed al-Sharaa, was named by military rebel commanders as the country's interim president last month and he swiftly pledged to hold a national dialog to discuss the country's future. 'Syria liberated itself on its own, and it suits it, to build itself on its own,' he said in his opening address on Tuesday. 'What we are living today is an exceptional, historic and rare opportunity. We must take advantage of every moment of it to serve the interests of our people and our country,' he said. Sharaa stressed that Syria must unify the various armed groups under a single military command, saying the country's 'strength lies in its unity.' Participants divided into six working groups to discuss a transitional justice system; the constitution; building state institutions; personal freedoms; Syria's future economic model and the role civil society would have in the country. The discussions were confidential, with a moderator allocating two minutes to participants to speak and restrictions on removing any documents from the summit hall. Organizers say the recommendations set to be agreed by the end of the day will help shape a constitutional declaration intended to lay out the basic principles for Syria's new governing order. They will be considered by a new transitional government that is set to take power on March 1. Proponents say the process is a notable shift from decades of autocratic rule by the Assad family, when political dissent was often met with detention in a labyrinthine prison system. But critics have questioned the rushed preparation for the summit, the lack of minority representation and the weight it will ultimately hold in a political process steered heavily so far by HTS. The summit will be closely watched by Arab and Western capitals alike, which have conditioned full ties with Syria's new leaders - including the possible lifting of sanctions - on whether the political process is inclusive of Syria's ethnically and religiously diverse population, three diplomats said. Syria-based diplomats were not invited to the conference, three foreign envoys in the country said. Its organizers did not take up offers by the United Nations to help with the summit. The U.N., the United States and other countries have imposed sanctions on HTS as a group. The U.S. and the European Union also have widespread sanctions in place on Syria, but have issued temporary lifts on some sectors in recent weeks. Speaking after Sharaa, Syria's Foreign Minister Asaad al-Shibani criticized international sanctions still in place, saying they were being used 'as a means of pressure on the will of the Syrian people.' Following his comments, a woman in attendance stood up and shouted, 'Thank God, the People's Palace has returned to the people!' To put together the event, a seven-member preparatory committee hosted listening sessions organized by province, sometimes holding several two-hour sessions a day to fit in all of Syria's 14 regions over the course of a week. Five of the committee members are either in HTS, or close to the group, and there are no Druze or Alawite members, both of which are significant minorities in Syria. No members of the Kurdish-led autonomous administration in northeast Syria or the U.S.-backed Syrian Democratic Forces were invited, officials from both groups told Reuters.	https://www.voanews.com/a/national-dialog-a-historic-opportunity-for-syria-interim-president-says/7987094.html	2025-02-25T02:31:13-08:00	
Singaporeans lose record $822 million to scams in 2024, police say	SINGAPORE — Singaporeans lost a record $822 million to scams last year, with cryptocurrency schemes accounting for almost a quarter of the losses, the city-state's police force said on Tuesday. The amount lost to scams increased by 70.6% from $486 million in 2023, while the number of cases rose by about 11% to 51,501, the Singapore Police Force (SPF) said in a report. Cryptocurrency scams accounted for 24.3% of total money lost, while the e-commerce scams were the most numerous, with $13 million lost in 11,665 cases. 'The majority of the cases, more than 70%, saw less than $3,700 in losses. The increase in total amount lost was driven by a small number of cases with very high losses,' the SPF said, with four cases accounting for $178 million of the losses. The police said that while people aged 65 and above only made up 8.4% of scam victims, the average amount lost per victim was the highest among the various age groups. Of the total amount lost, Singapore's Anti-Scam Command recovered more than $136 million, the police said. In January, Singapore passed a new law allowing police to freeze bank accounts of potential scam victims to prevent further losses.	https://www.voanews.com/a/singaporeans-lose-record-822-million-to-scams-in-2024-police-say/7987089.html	2025-02-25T02:23:43-08:00

Trump administration proposes steep fees on Chinese cargo ships	The Trump administration has proposed punitive new fees on international shipping that would target vessels owned by Chinese companies or manufactured in Chinese shipyards, promising to dramatically alter the economics of global trade. The new policy would charge Chinese-owned cargo ships, as well as third-country flagged vessels built in China, $1 million or more per port-of-call in the U.S. Large container ships often make multiple stops when delivering goods to the U.S., and would face new fees at each port. The Office of the U.S. Trade Representative (USTR) published the proposal Friday, tying it to an investigation into allegations by several U.S. labor unions that China has unfairly distorted the international shipbuilding industry. The investigation, conducted under Section 301 of the Trade Act of 1974, determined that the Chinese government has pursued a policy of subsidizing its domestic shipbuilding industry with the aim of 'targeting for dominance' the global market. Growing market share The investigation pointed out that over the past 25 years, China’s share of the global shipbuilding industry has exploded. China accounted for about 5% of the total tonnage of ships manufactured in 1999. By 2023, the Chinese share of the market surpassed 50%. The USTR found that Chinese policy 'burdens or restricts U.S. commerce by undercutting business opportunities for and investments in the U.S. maritime, logistics, and shipbuilding sectors; restricting competition and choice; creating economic security risks from dependence and vulnerabilities in sectors critical to the functioning of the U.S. economy; and undermining supply chain resilience.' The results of the investigation, which began during President Joe Biden’s administration, were announced last month. The proposal is open for public comment until March 24, at which point the administration will determine whether or not to implement it. Chinese reaction On Monday, Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesperson Lin Jian sharply criticized the U.S. move. '[T]o serve its political agenda at home, the U.S. has abused Section 301 investigation[s], which seriously violated WTO [World Trade Organization] rules and further undermined the multilateral trading system,' he said. 'We call on the U.S. side to respect facts and multilateral rules and immediately stop its wrongdoings.' The China Association of the National Shipbuilding Industry (CANSI) and China Shipowner Association had previously blasted the USTR investigation as being 'conclusions full of lies and distortion of facts.' In a statement issued when the results of the investigation were released, CANSI said, 'Development of China’s shipbuilding industry strictly follows the international trading rules and is the result of collaboration with global partners, as well as the tech innovation, and the hard-wording and excellent performances of Chinese industry players.' Complex new rules The USTR proposal contains a number of complicated elements that made it unclear precisely how any new regime of port fees would be administered. Each ship owned by a Chinese entity would be charged a $1 million fee on entering a U.S. port, though the proposal also appears to consider a different fee calculation of $1,000 per ton of capacity, which could add up to considerably more for large ships that carry thousands of tons of cargo. Chinese-built ships operated by non-Chinese shipowners would be subject to a $1.5 million fee, which could be adjusted, depending on the percentage of Chinese-built ships in that shipowner’s fleet. This would apply even if the ship’s cargo was not manufactured in China. Ships owned by companies that have existing orders for new ships pending with Chinese shipbuilders could be hit with an additional $1 million fee per entry at U.S. ports. The rule also provides for 'refunds' of a similar amount each time a shipping company sends a U.S.-built cargo ship into a U.S. port. Economic justifications hazy Mary Lovely, a senior fellow with the Peterson Institute for International Economics, said it was difficult to find an economic justification for the proposal. 'The thing that's really disturbing is that it's not linked to any particular policy that would benefit American businesses or consumers,' she said. International trade will continue to flow to the United States, but through more convoluted routes that add time and expense. For example, Lovely predicted that many shipping firms would explore the possibility of diverting their ships to ports in Mexico and Canada, and trucking the cargo into the U.S. 'It seems to me that this is just a tremendous way to reduce volume and employment at U.S. ports and basically force trade to take transportation routes and transportation modes that are clearly going to raise prices for U.S. businesses and consumers,' Lovely said. 'There's no way around it.' In an email exchange with VOA, Joe Kramek, World Shipping Council president and CEO, echoed those concerns. 'USTR's proposed draconian $1 million-plus per U.S. port visit fees on ships that carry the large majority of the U.S. trade, if they are Chinese-built or –operated – or on any ship operator from any country that has even a single Chinese ship in its fleet or on order – if carried forward, would cause broad economic harm across all sectors of the U.S. supply chain,' wrote Kramek, whose organization represents shipping companies. 'The fees would result in fewer U.S. port calls, higher prices for U.S. consumers, and severe impacts for exporters, particularly American farmers,' he wrote. Unlikely to benefit US shipbuilders Though ostensibly aimed at helping U.S. shipbuilders, the law is unlikely to have a significant impact on that industry, said Marc Levinson, a Washington-based economist and historian who has written two books about container shipping. 'This is not likely to do much for U.S. shipbuilding,' Levinson told VOA. 'U.S. commercial shipbuilders are very far away from global scale. They don't produce anything that is competitive on the international market for commercial oceangoing vessels.' 'The winners of this policy would be Japan, Korea, the Philippines, other countries where commercial shipbuilding is on a larger scale today than the United States,' Levinson said. The losers, he added, will include U.S. consumers, as the port fees are passed on in the form of higher prices for imported goods. In an email exchange with VOA, the National Retail Federation registered its opposition to the policy, writing, 'NRF strongly opposes a port fee remedy, which will do nothing to force China to change its behavior and practices. It will only increase shipping costs for retailers and further disrupt the maritime market.'	https://www.voanews.com/a/trump-administration-proposes-steep-fees-on-chinese-cargo-ships/7987079.html	2025-02-25T02:05:06-08:00	
Pope Francis rested well all night, Vatican says	VATICAN CITY — Pope Francis, who is in critical condition in a hospital battling double pneumonia, rested well throughout the night, the Vatican said on Tuesday. The 88-year-old pope was admitted to Rome's Gemelli hospital on Feb. 14. 'The pope rested well all night,' the Vatican said in a one-sentence statement. On Monday, the Vatican said the pontiff's condition remained critical but had shown a 'slight improvement,' adding that the 'mild kidney insufficiency,' first reported at the weekend, was not a cause for concern. Double pneumonia is a serious infection that can inflame and scar both lungs, making it difficult to breathe. The Vatican has described the pope's infection as 'complex,' and said it was caused by two or more microorganisms. Francis, who has been pope since 2013, has suffered bouts of ill health over the past two years. He is particularly prone to lung infections because he developed pleurisy as a young adult and had part of one lung removed. Thousands of people gathered in St. Peter's Square on Monday evening to pray for the pope's recovery. His friend, the Honduran cardinal Oscar Rodriguez Maradiaga, told La Repubblica newspaper: 'I think...it's not time for him to go to heaven yet.' The pope signaled in early February that he had a bad cold, which meant he could not read out his speeches. Despite this, he continued to work, with multiple daily meetings and even taking part in open-air Masses, despite the chill. Some well-wishers have said he should have taken better care of himself, but Maradiaga defended his work ethic. 'He is aware that he has a mission he must carry out, and nothing stops him. The pope explained that he did not accept his election (as pontiff) in order to rest,' he said. In Monday's statement, the Vatican said Francis had resumed working in his self-contained apartment within the Gemelli hospital, and had called the Catholic parish in Gaza, which the pope has done frequently during the Israel-Hamas war.	https://www.voanews.com/a/pope-francis-rested-well-all-night-vatican-says/7987084.html	2025-02-25T02:03:34-08:00	
At least four dead in South Korea highway construction project collapse	ANSEONG, South Korea — At least four people died and six were injured on Tuesday after a collapse at a highway construction site in an area south of the South Korean capital, Seoul, fire authorities said. The accident took place at 9:49 a.m. local time, in Anseong, about 70 km from Seoul, when five 50-meter concrete structures supporting the highway bridge collapsed, one after another, after being hoisted into place by a crane, the Yonhap News Agency reported. Ko Kyung-man, an Anseong fire official, said that four people had died, including two Chinese nationals, and six were injured, including five who were in a critical condition. The five also included one Chinese citizen. 'They were working to install a deck on the bridge,' Ko told a televised briefing. 'All of the 10 were up on the deck ... and fell from both sides when it collapsed.' Broadcaster YTN aired dramatic footage showing a deck of a towering bridge collapsing at the site. Rescue workers at the site were seen examining twisted metal struts and fractured concrete slabs below the columns of the highway bridge. Acting President Choi Sang-mok called to mobilize all available personnel and resources to rescue any missing people and to ensure safety measures to prevent further damage, his office said. The National Fire Agency said that it has mobilized three helicopters and nearly 150 officials for the search and rescue operation, and the Transport Ministry said it has dispatched a team of officials to the scene. Deadly accidents continue to regularly occur at industrial sites in South Korea, which introduced a law in 2022 to address safety lapses and punish company management if a worker is killed on the job. Earlier in February, six people died in a fire in a hotel construction site in the port city of Busan, with around 100 people evacuated including 14 workers plucked to safety by a helicopter after they had taken refuge on a rooftop. In June last year, a fire at a lithium battery factory that authorities blamed on quality control failures and inadequate safety training killed 23 workers. Data released in March by South Korea's labor ministry showed that 598 industrial workers died in 2023, with the construction sector accounting for nearly half, or 303, though the total death toll was down from 644 in 2022.	https://www.voanews.com/a/at-least-four-dead-in-south-korea-highway-construction-project-collapse/7987066.html	2025-02-25T00:59:31-08:00	
Talks to protect Earth's biodiversity resume with money topping the agenda	BOGOTA, Colombia — An annual United Nations conference on biodiversity that ran out of time last year will resume its work Tuesday in Rome with money at the top of the agenda. That is, how to spend what's been pledged so far — and how to raise a lot more to help preserve plant and animal life on Earth. The talks in Colombia, known as COP16, yielded some significant outcomes before they broke up in November, including an agreement that requires companies that benefit from genetic resources in nature — say, by developing medicines from rainforest plants — to share the benefits. And steps were taken to give Indigenous peoples and local communities a stronger voice in conservation matters. But two weeks turned out to be not enough time to get everything done. The Cali talks followed the historic 2022 COP15 accord in Montreal, which included 23 measures aimed at protecting biodiversity. Those included putting 30% of the planet and 30% of degraded ecosystems under protection by 2030, known as the Global Biodiversity Framework. 'Montreal was about the ‘what’ — what are we all working towards together?' said Georgina Chandler, head of policy and campaigns for the Zoological Society London. 'Cali was supposed to focus on the ‘how’ — putting the plans and the financing in place to ensure we can actually implement this framework.' 'They eventually lost a quorum because people simply went home,' said Linda Krueger of The Nature Conservancy, who is in Rome for the two days of talks 'And so now we’re having to finish these last critical decisions, which are some of the nitty gritty decisions on financing, on resource mobilization and on the planning and monitoring and reporting requirements under the Global Biodiversity Framework.' The overall financial aim was to achieve $20 billion a year in the fund by 2025, and then $30 billion by 2030. So far, only $383 million had been pledged as of November, from 12 nations or sub-nations: Austria, Canada, Denmark, France, Germany, Japan, Luxembourg, New Zealand, Norway, Province of Québec, Spain, and the United Kingdom. Participants will discuss establishing a 'global financing instrument for biodiversity' intended to effectively distribute the money raised. And a big part of the talks will be about raising more money. ‘Completely off track’ on larger financial goal Chandler and Kruger both said the finance points at Colombia's talks were particularly contentious. 'It’s really about how do we collect the money and how do we get it distributed fairly. Get it to the ground where it’s needed most, so that that’s really the core issue,' said Kruger. Oscar Soria, chief executive of The Common Initiative, a think tank specializing in global economic and environmental policy, was pessimistic about raising a great deal more money. 'We are completely off track in terms of achieving that money,' Soria said. Key sources of biodiversity finance are shrinking or disappearing, he said. 'What was supposed to be a good Colombian telenovela in which people will actually bring the right resources, and the happy ending of bringing their money, could actually end up being a tragic Italian opera, where no one actually agrees to anything and everyone loses,' Soria said. Susana Muhamad, Colombia's former environment minister and the COP16 president, said she's hopeful of 'a good message from Rome.' 'That message is that still, even with a very fragmented geopolitical landscape, with a world increasingly in conflict, we can still get an agreement on some fundamental issues,' Muhamad said in a statement. 'And one of the most important is the need to protect life in this crisis of climate change and biodiversity.' Global wildlife populations have plunged on average by 73% in 50 years, according to an October report from the World Wildlife Fund and the Zoological Society of London. 'Biodiversity is basically essential to our livelihoods and well-being,' Chandler said. 'It’s essential to the the air we breathe, the water we drink, rainfall that food systems rely on, protecting us from increasing temperatures and increasing storm occurrences as well.' Chandler said deforestation in the Amazon has far-reaching impacts across South America, just as it does in the Congo Basin and other major biodiverse regions worldwide. 'We know that has an impact on rainfall, on food systems, on soil integrity in other countries. So it’s not just something that’s kind of small and isolated. It's a widespread problem,' she said.	https://www.voanews.com/a/talks-to-protect-earth-s-biodiversity-resume-with-money-topping-the-agenda-/7987061.html	2025-02-25T00:50:14-08:00	
China adviser pushes to lower legal marriage age to 18 to boost birthrate	HONG KONG — A Chinese national political adviser has recommended lowering the legal age for marriage to 18 to boost fertility chances in the face of a declining population and 'unleash reproductive potential,' a state-backed newspaper said on Tuesday. Chen Songxi, a member of the National Committee of the Chinese People’s Political Consultative Conference (CPPCC), told the Global Times that he plans to submit a proposal on completely relaxing restrictions on childbirth in China and establish an 'incentive system' for marriage and childbirth. Chen's comments come ahead of China’s annual parliamentary meeting next week where officials are expected to announce measures to offset the country's declining population. The legal age for marriage in China is 22 for men and 20 for women, amongst the highest in the world, compared with most developed countries where the legal marriage age is 18. Chen said China's legal marriage age should be lowered to 18 'to increase the fertility population base and unleash reproductive potential.' It is to be consistent with international norms, Chen said. China's population fell for a third consecutive year in 2024, as marriages plummeted by a fifth, the biggest drop on record, despite efforts by authorities to encourage young couples to wed and have children. Much of China's demographic downturn is the result of its one-child policy imposed between 1980 and 2015. Couples have been allowed to have up to three children since 2021. Chen said China should remove restrictions on the number of children a family can have to meet the 'urgent needs of population development in the new era.' However, a rising number of people are opting to not have children, put off by the high cost of childcare or an unwillingness to marry or put their careers on hold. Authorities have tried to roll out incentives and measures to boost baby making including expanding maternity leave, financial and tax benefits for having children, as well as housing subsidies. But China is one of the world's most expensive places to bring up a child, relative to its GDP per capita, a prominent Chinese think tank said last year, detailing the time and opportunity cost for women who give birth. CPPCC, a largely ceremonial advisory body, meets in parallel with parliament. It is made up of business magnates, artists, monks, non-communists and other representatives of broader society, but has no legislative power.	https://www.voanews.com/a/china-adviser-pushes-to-lower-legal-marriage-age-to-18-to-boost-birthrate/7987015.html	2025-02-24T23:28:57-08:00	
Vietnam's US exports account for 30% of GDP, making it highly vulnerable to tariffs	HANOI, VIETNAM — Vietnam's goods exports to the United States accounted for 30% of its gross domestic product last year, the highest share among U.S. top trade partners, a Reuters review of public data shows, making the country highly vulnerable to reciprocal tariffs. The Southeast Asian nation experienced a surge in foreign investment after the first Trump administration started a trade war with Beijing in 2018, as foreign multinationals moved factories from China to its southern neighbor to avoid U.S. tariffs. It hosts major operations of South Korea's Samsung Electronics and Taiwan's contract manufacturer Foxconn. Apple, chipmaker Intel and footwear and apparel giant Nike are among U.S. corporations which in recent years bet on Vietnam as a production hub for goods often exported to the United States. The massive inflow of manufacturing investment has turned the Communist-run nation into a major node in global supply chains and significantly boosted its economic ties with the United States. Vietnam now directs 29% of its exports to its former foe, according to Vietnamese customs data. Last year, with goods exports worth $142.4 billion, Vietnam became the sixth largest exporter to the United States, after Mexico, China, Canada, Germany and Japan, United Nations commodity trade statistics show. Shipments to the U.S. last year represented about 30% of Vietnam's GDP of $468 billion, based on IMF's estimates, the largest share for all U.S. trading partners. Only Mexico, which is facing explicit threats from Trump of 25% tariffs, has a comparable exposure. It ships more than three times more goods than Vietnam to the U.S., with the total value of its exports accounting for 27.6% of its larger GDP. By comparison, China's exports to the U.S. are worth 2.5% of its GDP, and Japan's 3.7%. Vietnam's vulnerability is compounded by large trade imbalances that could make it stand out as U.S. officials study global reciprocal tariffs, which U.S. President Donald Trump has mandated to prepare by April. Vietnam's booming exports, combined with limited imports from the U.S., made it last year the U.S. partner with the fourth-largest trade surplus, lower only than China, the 27-country EU and Mexico, according to U.S. trade data. The country also 'satisfies (other) criteria for tariff applications set by the White House,' said Sayaka Shiba, a senior analyst at research firm BMI, noting that compared to the U.S., it has higher tariff rates, levies VAT, has non-trade barriers and is on the U.S. watchlist for possible currency manipulation.	https://www.voanews.com/a/vietnam-s-us-exports-account-for-30-of-gdp-making-it-highly-vulnerable-to-tariffs/7987014.html	2025-02-24T23:28:09-08:00	
Russian aerial attacks hit Kyiv, Sumy	Multiple regions of Ukraine came under aerial attack from Russian forces overnight, with officials in Kyiv and Sumy saying Tuesday there were injuries and damage to buildings. Mykola Kalashnyk, governor of the Kyiv region, said a 44-year-old woman was hospitalized as a result of the attacks, which also damaged several houses. Officials in Sumy said Ukrainian air defenses shot down seven drones, but that the attacks injured two people and damaged two apartment buildings. Cherkasy Governor Ihor Taburets said Tuesday on Telegram that the military destroyed 20 drones over his region. Taburets said there were no reports of injuries or damage. In the Dnipropetrovsk region, Governor Serhiy Lysak said air defenses destroyed three Russian drones, while Mykolaiv Governor Vitaliy Kim said the military shot down seven drones in his region. Russia’s Defense Ministry said Tuesday it shot down 20 Ukrainian drones overnight, mostly over the Bryansk region that is located along the Russia-Ukraine border. Bryansk Governor Alexander Bogomaz said on Telegram there were no injuries from the Ukrainian attack. Other intercepts took place over the Kursk and Kaluga regions, the Defense Ministry said.

Trump says Canada, Mexico tariffs on schedule despite border, fentanyl efforts	WASHINGTON — President Donald Trump said on Monday that tariffs on Canadian and Mexican imports are 'on time and on schedule' despite efforts by the countries to beef up border security and halt the flow of fentanyl into the U.S. ahead of a March 4 deadline. 'The tariffs are going forward on time, on schedule,' Trump told a joint news conference with French President Emmanuel Macron. He had been asked whether Canada and Mexico had done enough to avoid the punishing 25% U.S. duties. Many had hoped the top two U.S. trading partners could persuade Trump's administration to further delay tariffs that would apply to over $918 billion worth of U.S. imports from the two countries, from autos to energy. This could wreak havoc on the integrated North American economy, with the automotive sector hit particularly hard. Trump did not specifically mention the March 4 deadline. He later referred to his desire for 'reciprocal' tariffs to match the duty rates and offset the trade barriers of all countries, including France. Trump and Macron did not publicly discuss another sticking point -- digital services taxes imposed by France, Canada and other countries aimed at dominant U.S. tech giants including Google, Facebook and Amazon. On Friday, Trump ordered his administration to revive tariff investigations into countries that levy digital service taxes on U.S. firms. Border hopes dimmed Canada and Mexico have taken steps to beef up border security, which bought them about a month's reprieve from Trump's earlier Feb. 1 deadline to impose the tariffs, based on a national emergency declaration. Any further delay negotiated ahead of the deadline will keep the tariff threat in place at least until clear evidence emerges that Canadian and Mexican measures are working, said Dan Ujczo, a lawyer specializing in U.S.-Canada trade matters. 'There's progress being made on the security front,' said Ujczo, senior counsel with Thompson Hine in Columbus, Ohio. 'But it's overly optimistic to think that those tariffs would be fully rescinded.' The White House, U.S. Trade Representative's office and Commerce Department did not respond to requests for comment on negotiations expected this week ahead of the March 4 deadline. More tariff threats Since Trump's initial 25% tariff threat and imposition of a 10% duty on all Chinese imports, he has heaped on more tariff actions that could muddy the waters on border negotiations. These include substantially raising tariffs on steel and aluminum to a flat 25%, rescinding longstanding exemptions for Canada and Mexico, the largest sources of U.S. imports of the metals. These steep increases, which also extend to hundreds of downstream steel products, are due to take effect a week after the border tariffs, on March 12. Trump has also said he wants to impose 25% tariffs on imports of autos, pharmaceuticals and semiconductors, and to match duty rates and trade barriers of other countries. The threatened tariffs could kick off an early launch of a renegotiation of the U.S.-Mexico-Canada agreement on trade that is due by 2026, Ujczo added. Trump signed the USMCA into law in 2020 after renegotiating the 1994 North American Free Trade Agreement but has increasingly expressed dissatisfaction with imports of autos from Mexico and Canada. Progress cited On Thursday, Mexican Economy Minister Marcelo Ebrard said on Thursday he had a 'constructive dialog' during a meeting with Trump's top trade officials. Ebrard said in a post on X that the 'joint work' on U.S. trade matters starts on Monday. Mexico has begun deploying as many as 10,000 national guard troops to its northern border, as part of the agreement that Mexican President Claudia Sheinbaum said also called on the U.S. to work to stop the flow of firearms into Mexico. Canada this month created a new fentanyl czar to coordinate the fight against smuggling of the deadly opioid, appointing senior intelligence official Kevin Brosseau to the post. Ottawa also has reclassified drug cartels as terrorist entities and has deployed drones, helicopters and other surveillance technologies on the vast northern U.S. border. Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau has kept in close contact with Trump on the border issues in recent days, including in a Saturday call that included discussions of joint efforts to curb fentanyl trade. He has threatened retaliatory tariffs on $107 billion of U.S. imports, including American beer, wine and bourbon and Florida orange juice, but said last week that Canada is 'going to do the work' to ensure that tariffs are not imposed.	https://www.voanews.com/a/trump-says-canada-mexico-tariffs-on-schedule-despite-border-fentanyl-efforts/7986957.html	2025-02-24T18:34:57-08:00	
Musicians release silent album to protest UK's AI copyright changes	LONDON — More than 1,000 musicians including Kate Bush and Cat Stevens on Tuesday released a silent album to protest proposed changes to Britain's copyright laws which could allow tech firms to train artificial intelligence models using their work. Creative industries globally are grappling with the legal and ethical implications of AI models that can produce their own output after being trained on popular works without necessarily paying the creators of the original content. Britain, which Prime Minister Keir Starmer wants to become an AI superpower, has proposed relaxing laws that currently give creators of literary, dramatic, musical and artistic works the right to control the ways their material may be used. The proposed changes would allow AI developers to train their models on any material to which they have lawful access, and would require creators to proactively opt out to stop their work being used. The changes have been heavily criticized by many artists, who say it would reverse the principle of copyright law, which grants exclusive control to creators for their work. 'In the music of the future, will our voices go unheard?' said Bush, whose 1985 hit 'Running Up That Hill' enjoyed a resurgence in 2022 thanks to Netflix show 'Stranger Things.' The co-written album titled 'Is This What We Want?' features recordings of empty studios and performance spaces to represent what organizers say is the potential impact on artists' livelihoods should the changes go ahead. A public consultation on the legal changes closes later on Tuesday. Responding to the album, a government spokesperson said the current copyright and AI regime was holding back the creative industries, media and AI sector from 'realizing their full potential.' 'We have engaged extensively with these sectors throughout and will continue to do so. No decisions have been taken,' the spokesperson said, adding that the government's proposals will be set out in due course. Annie Lennox, Billy Ocean, Hans Zimmer, Tori Amos and The Clash are among the musicians urging the government to review its plans. 'The government's proposal would hand the life's work of the country's musicians to AI companies, for free, letting those companies exploit musicians’ work to outcompete them,' said organizer Ed Newton-Rex, the founder of Fairly Trained, a non-profit that certifies generative AI companies for fairer training data practices. 'The UK can be leaders in AI without throwing our world-leading creative industries under the bus.'	https://www.voanews.com/a/musicians-release-silent-album-to-protest-uk-s-ai-copyright-changes/7986931.html	2025-02-24T17:35:23-08:00	
Trump hosts French leader to discuss Ukraine endgame	President Donald Trump said Monday he’s nearing a deal with Ukraine and with Russia to end the war in Ukraine after a packed day of meetings at the White House with French President Emmanuel Macron. Trump urged Europe to take a bigger role in funding, and Paris pushed for more assurances from Moscow. The U.S. president pushed his desire for a deal to end the war, which struck its grim third anniversary Monday. He has said this will include an agreement with Ukraine for its critical minerals — a deal he hinted could be signed as soon as next week by Ukraine’s president. 'There's tremendous distrust on both sides,' Trump said. 'That's why it's good that I'm coming in now. But I think it's to the very much benefit of Russia to make a deal and to go on with leading Russia in a very positive way. That's what you have to do. But I really believe that he wants to make a deal. I may be wrong, but I believe he wants to make a deal.' Macron was more circumspect, correcting Trump in the Oval Office when Trump said Europe supported Ukraine with a loan. Macron then warned against trusting Moscow. 'Let’s try to get something first which ... can be assessed, checked and verified,' he said in English. 'And let's be sure that we build sufficient guarantees in the short run. And this is where we are ready to be engaged. As for France, a lot of my European colleagues are ready to be engaged. But we do need this American backup, because this is part of the credibility of the security guarantees. And this is our collective deterrence capacity. And I have the feeling that the president has this capacity.' Analysts spoke of what the two leaders accomplished in their meetings. 'It looks like they agreed to have European peacekeepers enforce the peace between Russia and Ukraine,' said William Pomeranz, a senior scholar at the Wilson Center Kennan Institute. 'There are a lot of other side issues that I haven't really been able to get a hold of, but yes, there are attempts to have a peace agreement and a use of peacekeepers to enforce the agreement between Russia and Ukraine.' Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy expressed hope and emphasized the importance of Washington’s role. 'Our teams are already working productively with the U.S. on an economic agreement, which we hope to sign in Washington,' he said in English. 'And President Trump, we would really like to hear from you, because all our people, all our families, are very worried: ‘Will there be support from America? Will America be the leader of the free world?’ And I want to be very honest, very honest with you: For our people, for life in general, it is so important that American support, American assistance remains.' But other world leaders expressed concerns that Ukraine was kept out of high-level discussions in Saudi Arabia between Washington and Moscow. Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan, who recently met with Zelenskyy in Ankara, also said Russia hasn’t always been part of the process. 'Apart from the Istanbul process, Russia has been excluded from the tables established so far, and therefore the desired result has not been achieved,' Erdogan said. 'If results are to be obtained from the new process, Ukraine must definitely be included in the process, and this war must be ended through mutual negotiations.' Russian President Vladimir Putin said that so far, talks have not been specific. 'During the phone conversation and at the meeting in Riyadh, we certainly touched on issues related to the Ukrainian crisis,' he said. 'However, it was not discussed in essence. We only agreed that we would approach it. That being said, of course, we are not rejecting the participation of European countries.' Some analysts warn that Trump’s idea of a deal is not advantageous to Ukraine. 'We have to see this as a move by Donald Trump to undermine the legitimacy of Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy — and in the worst case, as Trump advocating for Russia's position, which has been in the past that elections have to be part of a negotiation process in Ukraine, although it's an entirely Ukrainian domestic issue,' said Liana Fix, a fellow for Europe at the Council on Foreign Relations. 'So, it's not only a back and forth between Trump and Zelenskyy. We do see a broader realignment here of U.S. policy towards a normalization of relations with Russia, where Ukraine is perceived as a problem to this normalization,' she said. Meanwhile in Europe, as Ukraine somberly marked Monday as the third anniversary of the war, Paris’ most famous icon, the Eiffel Tower, burned brightly in the yellow and blue colors of the Ukrainian flag.	https://www.voanews.com/a/trump-hosts-french-leader-to-discuss-ukraine-endgame/7986909.html	2025-02-24T16:40:42-08:00	
Top US general in Asia begins 2-day visit to Cambodia	The top U.S. Army officer for the Asia-Pacific region began a two-day visit to Cambodia Monday in a trip designed to expand and improve frayed ties between the two nations. General Ronald P. Clark, the commanding general of the United States Army Pacific met with Cambodian Prime Minister Hun Manet and senior Cambodian military officials in Phnom Penh. Ties between the U.S. and Cambodia have been strained with Washington’s criticism of Cambodia’s political repression and human rights violations. However, the U.S. and other countries are also greatly concerned with Cambodia’s close ties with China. Of special interest is China’s access to the Ream Naval Base near the disputed South China Sea, a waterway China claims almost in full. In 2016, an international tribunal in The Hague rejected China’s sweeping claims. The naval base is strategically located in the Gulf of Thailand, which borders the western section of the South China Sea. The base’s renovation was funded by China. China has contributed massive amounts of money to Cambodia’s updating of its infrastructure with the help beginning when the prime minister’s father, Hun Sen, was leading the country. That funding continues and later Monday, Manet met with Yin LI, a member of the Politburo of the Chinese Communist Party, according to a post on the prime minister’s Telegram account. The post said the Li praised the progress on 'all cooperation in all fields' between Cambodia and China. During the meeting, Clark also expressed his admiration for Cambodia for sending U.N. peacekeepers to several international locations, according to the prime minister’s office. The prime minister also thanked the U.S. for its assistance in helping to clear explosives from Cambodia after years of war that left Cambodia in the late 1990s with 4 million to 6 million land mines and other unexploded ordnance, including unexploded U.S. bombs. Clark also met Monday with General Mao Sophan, Cambodia’s military chef. The two military generals had 'constructive discussions,' the army said in a statement. Topics of their talks included defense, trade, tourism, counterterrorism, peacekeeping and demining, the Cambodian army said. Their discussion also included the possible revival of the Angkor Sentinel exercise, the joint military exercises previously held by the U.S. and Cambodia that were abandoned nearly 10 years ago, the army said.

Deadly floods in Botswana kill 9; nearly 2,000 people evacuated	GABORONE, BOTSWANA — Botswana authorities say at least nine people were confirmed dead Monday, as rare flooding hit the semi-arid country. More than 5,000 people have been affected by the floods as record rainfall fell over the last week. Addressing Parliament on Monday, Moeti Mohwasa, the minister for state president, said the nine people who died had all drowned. Of the deceased, six were minors. 'While the risk level has generally reduced ... I regret to inform this house that we have lost one more person yesterday evening, bringing to nine the total number of fatalities to date. … So far, the number of people evacuated has increased to 1,806 from 1,749 reported yesterday,' Mohwasa said. The United Nations Children Fund (UNICEF) said at least 600,000 schoolchildren were experiencing disruptions due to the floods. Schools have been closed since last week, but Mohwasa said most are expected to reopen Tuesday. 'After a thorough assessment of the situation, I am happy to announce that schools will reopen tomorrow, February 25, 2025,' he said. 'Another positive note is that our critical infrastructure remain[s] stable, with both electricity and water supply fully restored. Our 24-hour clinics, primary hospitals, and referral hospitals are operational and accessible to all, although there may be occasional interruptions in service provision.' While the situation is improving with rain subsiding, more than 600 people remained at evacuation centers Monday. Calvin Moalosi, a Gaborone resident who was at one of the centers, said he lost his belongings due to the floods. 'I have never seen so much water in my life. The house became a pool of water, and it is really sad that some people were swept away in the floods,' Moalosi said. 'The government has done its best to evacuate people and take them to safe areas.' Most parts of the country recorded heavy rains from 150 mm (6 inches) to 200 mm (8 inches) in a 24-hour period several times last week. Kutlwano Mukokomani, chief executive at the local Red Cross Society, said the organization is continuing to provide relief at evacuation centers across the country. 'The Botswana Red Cross Society provided relief items to evacuation centers. We continue to provide these relief items to ensure that our communities are kept safe. We provided food items, blankets, mattresses and also hygiene packs. We are also doing assessments so that they can further guide our response,' Mukokomani said. Botswana, like most southern African countries, has been recovering from the devastating El Nino-induced drought.	https://www.voanews.com/a/deadly-floods-in-botswana-kill-9-nearly-2-000-people-evacuated/7986895.html	2025-02-24T16:23:33-08:00	
US lawmakers rush to avoid March 14 government shutdown	U.S. lawmakers are one step closer to funding the government past a March 14 deadline, but Congress still has serious issues to resolve as they come back to work in the nation’s capital this week. At question is how and when to enact a proposed extension of the 2017 tax cuts and how to pay down the U.S. deficit without cutting key safety net programs that help American voters. President Donald Trump has called for lawmakers to pass 'one big, beautiful bill' that will be a key part of enacting his domestic policy agenda. Despite Trump expressing his preference for the House of Representatives version of the budget, the Senate passed a funding resolution Friday that provides $150 billion in military funding and $175 billion for border security. That measure also avoids the controversial Medicaid cuts in the House version. Senate leadership has proposed passing the tax cuts in a separate bill later this year. 'Republicans are moving forward on legislation to fund continued efforts to deport criminal aliens, as well as provide other necessary resources to secure our border, discourage illegal immigration and restore respect for the rule of law,' Senate Majority Leader John Thune said Monday on the Senate floor. But Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer characterized the vote as a first step toward extending the tax cuts. 'What are Republicans doing? They're spending precious time trying to cater to the wishes of the absolutely richest people in America, instead of working to avoid a disastrous halt of services that help tens of millions of middle-class American families,' Schumer said Monday. The Senate moved forward with a vote on its version of the budget due to uncertainty over the potential success of the vote on the House version. The two versions will have to be compromised to be signed into law. The House is set to hold a procedural vote on Tuesday, but Speaker of the House Mike Johnson holds a slim Republican majority and cannot afford to lose any members of his own to pass his version of the budget. Republican Representative Tony Gonzales led a group of seven other House Republicans warning against potential cuts to health care program Medicaid, food assistance funding and other social safety net programs. 'Slashing Medicaid would have serious consequences, particularly in rural and predominantly Hispanic communities where hospitals and nursing homes are already struggling to keep their doors open,' the lawmakers said in a letter to Johnson sent last week. Republican Representative Thomas Massie, a member of the conservative Freedom Caucus, also expressed concern about the version of the budget up for a vote, along with several other undecided House Republicans who have not yet announced their votes on the measure. Congressional Democrats also object to the Republican tax cut proposal, arguing it will harm lower-income and middle-class Americans who are already concerned about the cost of living and inflation. In a 'Dear Colleagues' letter sent Monday morning, Democratic Leader Hakeem Jeffries wrote, 'Far-right extremists are determined to push through $4.5 trillion of tax breaks for wealthy Republican donors and well-connected corporations, explode the debt and saddle everyday Americans with the bill by ending Medicaid as we know it. We must be at full strength to enhance our opportunity to stop the GOP Tax Scam in its tracks.' Trump posted on Truth Social last week that 'The House and Senate are doing a SPECTACULAR job of working together as one unified, and unbeatable, TEAM, however, unlike the Lindsey Graham version of the very important Legislation currently being discussed, the House Resolution implements my FULL America First Agenda, EVERYTHING, not just parts of it!' If lawmakers cannot reach a compromise by March 14, there will be a partial government shutdown, leaving millions of federal employees temporarily without pay and suspending some non-essential government services.	https://www.voanews.com/a/us-lawmakers-rush-to-avoid-march-14-government-shutdown-/7986622.html	2025-02-24T15:35:25-08:00	
China eyes Trump's Ukraine strategy, strengthens ties with Russia	STATE DEPARTMENT — Three years into Russia’s aggression in Ukraine, China is closely monitoring U.S. President Donald Trump’s strategy to end the war, as Beijing calculates its moves to position itself as a strategic partner for Ukraine while maintaining a no‐limits partnership with Russia, according to experts and former officials. This week, British Prime Minister Keir Starmer and French President Emmanuel Macron are set to hold in-person meetings in Washington, following the Feb. 18 direct talks between senior U.S. and Russian officials in Riyadh, the Saudi capital. Macron met with Trump Monday morning at the White House for a meeting that lasted nearly two hours. Both leaders participated in a videoconference with other G7 leaders about Ukraine. Earlier on Monday, Chinese President Xi Jinping spoke with Russian President Vladimir Putin, who updated Xi on the Riyadh talks and reaffirmed the 'comprehensive strategic partnership' between Russia and China. A Chinese readout said, 'China welcomes the positive efforts made by Russia and relevant parties to resolve the crisis.' 'Crisis’ but not war For three years, Chinese officials have said Beijing will 'play a constructive role' in the 'political settlement of the crisis,' refraining from using the term 'Ukraine war' to describe Russia's aggression since Feb. 24, 2022. Beijing also commended the recent U.S.-Russia talks, during which Ukraine was not present. China and Ukraine 'established a strategic partnership in 2011. ... In recent years, China has been Ukraine's largest trading partner,' Chinese Foreign Minister Wang Yi told Ukrainian Foreign Minister Andrii Sybiha on Feb. 15 on the margins of the Munich Security Conference. 'Regarding the Ukrainian crisis ... China has always worked for peace and promoted talks,' Wang said. Notably, the Chinese readout of the meeting made no mention of Ukraine’s sovereignty or territorial integrity. On Feb. 20, two days after the U.S.-Russia talks, Wang held in-person discussions with Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov at the G20 ministerial meeting in Johannesburg, South Africa, where Lavrov briefed him on the Riyadh talks. Wang reaffirmed China’s 'comprehensive strategic partnership' with Russia. Wang said China 'supports' all efforts dedicated to peace, including 'the recent consensus reached between the United States and Russia' in Riyadh. Talks, not negotiations U.S. Secretary of State Marco Rubio said the Riyadh talks — the first between Washington and Moscow in years — were not negotiations aimed at striking any deal on Ukraine, despite concerns from Ukraine and European countries that they were being sidelined. He said the talks were intended to determine whether the Russians were serious about ending the war. In a measured tone, Rubio characterized the talks — which lasted for more than four hours — as steps toward establishing 'lines of communication' on bilateral issues between the United States and Russia. Among these efforts is the goal of achieving 'some normalcy in our missions and their ability to function.' Some analysts said Beijing is nervous over a reset of U.S.-Russia ties. 'While a complete rapprochement might not be in the cards, they’re nervous because if Trump lifts sanctions on Russia, then Moscow’s dependency on China decreases,' Dennis Wilder, who was a top White House China adviser to former U.S. President George W. Bush, told RFE/RL. But others warned that the U.S. risked bolstering China's global information campaign, which portrays Washington as an unreliable ally. Retired Rear Admiral Mark Montgomery, a defense analyst at the Washington-based Foundation for Defense of Democracies (FDD), said, 'We immediately gave away what leverage we had' and 'misattributed who the aggressor was' while rushing into talks with the Russians. China, 'stumbling into this good news,' certainly gets the benefit, Montgomery said in a recent webinar hosted by FDD. 'I have no doubt that diplomats from China are whispering in ears around the world about the unreliability of Americans, and unfortunately, this administration is giving them some talking points,' Bradley Bowman, senior director of the Center on Military and Political Power at the FDD, said during the webinar. Experts skeptical A Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesperson declined to comment on whether China would consider sending peacekeeping forces to Ukraine after the conflict ends. Xi and Putin are scheduled to exchange visits to Moscow and Beijing later this year. The two held a virtual meeting on Jan. 21. Additionally, Xi took a phone call from Putin on the afternoon of Feb. 24. Some former U.S. officials are skeptical about the extent to which the Chinese government is genuinely willing to act to stop Russia’s war on Ukraine. They believe China may use the issue as leverage in its dealings with Trump. 'I think the Chinese will look at the Ukraine issue, and they will offer some help to Trump. They probably won't do very much, and then they will claim success,' Evan Medeiros, director of Georgetown University’s Asian Studies program, said during a recent podcast with the German Marshall Fund’s Indo-Pacific program. Medeiros served on the White House National Security Council from 2009 to 2015. 'Anything that is in their direct material interests, like helping to rebuild Ukraine, they will embrace. But of course, that doesn't have to do with encouraging Russia to reach a peace deal. That's about ensuring that Chinese infrastructure companies get lots of big fat contracts,' Medeiros added.	https://www.voanews.com/a/china-eyes-trump-s-ukraine-strategy-strengthens-ties-with-russia/7986607.html	2025-02-24T15:11:31-08:00

US Supreme Court rebuffs free speech challenge to abortion clinic buffer zones	WASHINGTON — The U.S. Supreme Court declined Monday to hear a challenge to the legality of buffer zones used to protect access to abortion clinics and limit harassment of patients in a challenge brought by anti-abortion activists who have argued that their free speech rights were being violated. The justices turned away appeals by self-described 'sidewalk counselors' in New Jersey and Illinois of lower court decisions to throw out their lawsuits that had claimed that the buffer zones violate free speech protections under the U.S. Constitution's First Amendment. The activists had been asking the Supreme Court to overturn its 2000 ruling allowing a Colorado buffer zone law. Conservative Justices Clarence Thomas and Samuel Alito said they would have taken up the appeals. The legality of so-called buffer zones that create a perimeter around abortion facilities, or 'floating' zones that put distance between demonstrators and a clinic's patients or staff, has been legally contested for decades. The issue pits free speech rights against concerns over harassment and violence by anti-abortion protesters. The Supreme Court has a 6-3 conservative majority. In 2022, the court overturned the 1973 Roe v. Wade ruling that had legalized abortion nationwide, ending its recognition of a woman's constitutional right to terminate her pregnancy. Since that ruling, the issue of buffer zones has regained prominence. While numerous Republican-led states have banned or severely restricted abortion, some municipalities in states where it remains legal have adopted buffer zone ordinances to limit intimidation and harassment, drawing legal challenges. In Carbondale, Illinois, a group called Coalition Life that organizes sidewalk counselors sued after the local city council passed such an ordinance in 2023. The measure established a floating 8-foot (2.4 meters) buffer that prevents people from approaching people without their permission in the vicinity of health care facilities, in response to increased threats and disorderly acts at abortion clinics. The ordinance has since been repealed. It had been modeled after a nearly identical Colorado law that the Supreme Court upheld in 2000 in a case called Hill v. Colorado. The Chicago-based 7th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals dismissed the coalition's case in March 2024, noting that the challengers cannot prevail so long as the Hill ruling remains in place. Thomas, in his dissent on Monday, criticized the court's Hill decision and expressed regret that the justices had declined 'an invitation to set the record straight on Hill's defunct status.' 'I would have taken this opportunity to explicitly overrule Hill,' Thomas added. The coalition's lawyers had asked the Supreme Court to overrule the Hill ruling because in places where 'anti-abortion views are disfavored,' buffer zones are a 'ready tool to try to silence those who advance them — and to do so precisely when and where their speech may matter most.' In New Jersey, a sidewalk counselor named Jeryl Turco sued the city of Englewood for adopting a 2014 ordinance that created an 8-foot buffer zone protecting the entrances and driveways of healthcare facilities. The buffer was set after reports of people associated with an evangelical Christian ministry engaging in aggressive and hostile protests outside Metropolitan Medical Associates, a local abortion clinic. Turco was not associated with the ministry, and said she delivered only peaceful counseling. The Philadelphia-based 3rd U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals threw out Turco's complaint in January 2024, saying a buffer zone can help protect an individual's health, safety and access to pregnancy-related services, and 'does not place a substantial burden on Turco's speech.' The 3rd Circuit said its ruling was in line with the Hill precedent. Alexis McGill Johnson, president and CEO of Planned Parenthood Federation of America, said after the Supreme Court acted on Monday that buffer zones 'help to create a safer environment for patients, providers and staff.' 'No patient should have to encounter threats, intimidation and attacks while seeking health care — and no medical provider or health center staff should be threatened because of their work to deliver abortion care to patients in need,' Johnson said.	https://www.voanews.com/a/us-supreme-court-rebuffs-free-speech-challenge-to-abortion-clinic-buffer-zones-/7986592.html	2025-02-24T14:47:54-08:00	
Oscar performers include Cynthia Erivo, Ariana Grande and Doja Cat	After devastating wildfires tore through Los Angeles, the 97th Academy Awards are going forward. Like the Grammys and other awards shows this year, the ceremony will be transformed by the fires and the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences has pledged to help its members and the broader film community recover. Here’s everything you need to know about this year’s show: When are the Oscars? The Academy Awards will be held March 2, at the Dolby Theater in Los Angeles. The show, to be broadcast live by ABC, is scheduled to begin at 7 p.m. Eastern/4 p.m. Pacific. Who's hosting the Oscars? Conan O’Brien is hosting the Academy Awards for the first time. O’Brien, the late-night host turned podcaster and occasional movie star, said upon the announcement: 'America demanded it and now it’s happening: Taco Bell’s new Cheesy Chalupa Supreme. In other news, I’m hosting the Oscars.' How have the wildfires altered the show? The wildfires that consumed large parts of Los Angeles in early January led some to call for the cancellation of the Academy Awards. The academy twice postponed the announcement of nominations but never pushed the March 2 date of the ceremony. Academy leaders have argued the show must go ahead, for its economic impact on Los Angeles and as a symbol of resilience. Organizers have vowed this year’s awards will 'celebrate the work that unites us as a global film community and acknowledge those who fought so bravely against the wildfires.' Still, the fires have curtailed much of the usual frothiness of Hollywood's awards season. The film academy canceled its annual nominees’ luncheon. For many involved in the Oscars, the fires have been felt acutely. O'Brien's Pacific Palisades home survived but his family has been unable to go back to it. O'Brien's assistant and podcast co-host Sona Movsesian lost her home. 'I know so many people who lost their homes and I’m just, was ridiculously lucky,' O’Brien told The Associated Press. 'So, we want to make sure that that show reflects what’s happening and that we put a light on the right people in the right way.' Who's presenting at the Oscars? More stars were added to the presenter lineup last week, including Selena Gomez, Oprah Winfrey, Joe Alwyn, Goldie Hawn, Ben Stiller, Ana de Armas, Sterling K. Brown, Willem Dafoe, Lily-Rose Depp and Connie Nielsen. They'll join the likes of Halle Berry, Penelope Cruz, Elle Fanning, Whoopi Goldberg, Scarlett Johansson, John Lithgow, Amy Poehler, June Squibb and Bowen Yang, as well as last year's acting winners — Emma Stone, Robert Downey Jr., Cillian Murphy, Da’Vine Joy Randolph — on the Oscar stage. Though the academy initially said it would bring back the 'fab five' style of presenting the acting awards, with five previous winners per category, organizers have reportedly abandoned those plans for this year’s ceremony. Nick Offerman will also be participating as the Oscars announcer. Will there be any performances? The academy has announced that, unlike previous years, the original song nominees will not be performed this time. That doesn't mean there won't be music, though. Doja Cat, LISA of Blackpink, Queen Latifah and RAYE will be part of 'showstopping performances celebrating the filmmaking community and some of its legends,' producers announced Monday, as will Wicked's Cynthia Erivo and Ariana Grande. (The songs from Wicked weren't eligible for best song since, hailing from the Broadway musical, they aren't original to the movie.) The Los Angeles Master Chorale will also appear. What's nominated for best picture? The 10 nominees for best picture are: Anora, The Brutalist, A Complete Unknown, Conclave, Dune: Part 2, Emilia Perez, I’m Still Here, Nickel Boys, The Substance, and Wicked. How to watch Oscar-nominated films? Some of the nominees are still in theaters, but many of this year’s Oscar nominees are streaming on various platforms. Who are the favorites? More than most years, that’s a tricky question, but a front-runner had emerged after Anora took the top awards at the Producers Guild, Directors Guild and Independent Spirit Awards. The best picture race had been seen as unusually wide open, with Anora, Conclave, The Brutalist, A Complete Unknown and Emilia Perez all having legitimate hopes of winning — the hopes of Conclave further boosted by its Screen Actors Guild ensemble win. In the acting categories, Demi Moore (The Substance) is favored for best actress, although Mikey Madison's BAFTA and Independent Spirit wins for Anora makes it more of a race. Adrien Brody (The Brutalist) is most likely in best actor — though SAG winner Timothee Chalamet could threaten — while Zoe Saldana (Emilia Perez) is the supporting actress front-runner and Kieran Culkin (A Real Pain) is the favorite for best supporting actor. None of those awards, however, is considered a definite lock. What's the deal with ‘Emilia Perez’? Jacques Audiard’s Emilia Perez, a narco-musical about a Mexican drug lord who undergoes gender-affirming surgery, comes in with a leading 13 nominations. The film, at one point, seemed like Netflix’s best chance yet to land the streamer its first best picture win. Its star, Karla Sofia Gascon, made history by becoming the first openly trans actor nominated for an Oscar. But no nominee has had a rockier post-nominations Oscar campaign. After old offensive tweets by Gascon were uncovered, the actress issued an apology. The fallout, though, has badly damaged a movie that was already a divisive contender, and led Netflix to radically refocus its flagging campaign.	https://www.voanews.com/a/oscar-performers-include-cynthia-erivo-ariana-grande-and-doja-cat/7986581.html	2025-02-24T14:24:48-08:00	
Doctors Without Borders halts activities at Sudan's Zamzam camp due to heavy fighting	Doctors Without Borders on Monday halted its operations in Sudan's famine-stricken Zamzam camp due to an escalation of attacks and fighting in the vicinity. The international medical aid group, also known by its French name Medecins Sans Frontieres and acronym MSF, said fighting between the Sudanese military and its rival paramilitary the Rapid Support Forces intensified in the camp, located in North Darfur. The escalation made it 'impossible' for the group to provide life-saving humanitarian needs to thousands of displaced people in the area, it said in a statement, adding it had suspended all activities in Zamzam, including at its field hospital. 'Halting our project in the midst of a worsening disaster in Zamzam is a heart-breaking decision,' said Yahya Kalilah, the group's head of mission in Sudan. Kalilah said that being close to violence, experiencing great difficulty in sending supplies, dealing with the 'impossibility' of sending experienced staff, and the uncertainty around routes out of the camp, left MSF with 'little choice.' Sudan plunged into war when fighting began in April 2023 between the military and the RSF after simmering tensions. As a result of fighting in the capital, Khartoum, and spread to the other parts of the country. The conflict that killed more than 24,000 people, forced over 14 million people out of their homes, and created famine across various parts of the country. The fighting in Zamzam ramped up Feb. 11-12, according to MSF. The field hospital received 130 wounded patients, most suffering from gunshot and shrapnel wounds. The MSF facility in Zamzam can't provide trauma surgery for those in critical conditions as it was originally established to address the significant malnutrition crisis unfolding in the camp. Kalilah said that 11 patients died in the hospital, including five children, because staff couldn't treat them properly or refer them to the local hospital in El Fasher, the regional capital. Access to water and food in the area has been more compromised because of the fighting, according to the MSF. The central market has been looted and burned. Zamzam camp hosts around 500,000 people and has seen displaced families newly arriving from the areas of Abu Zerega, Shagra, and Saluma, who told MSF teams of abuses in villages and roads in the El Fasher locality that include killings, sexual violence, lootings and beatings. 'In January and December, two of our ambulances carrying patients from the camp to El Fasher were shot at,' Kalilah said. 'Now, it's even more dangerous and as a result, many people, including patients requiring trauma surgery or emergency caesarean sections, are trapped in Zamzam.'	https://www.voanews.com/a/doctors-without-borders-halts-activities-at-sudan-s-zamzam-camp-due-to-heavy-fighting-/7986565.html	2025-02-24T14:23:29-08:00	
US judge allows Trump's AP Oval Office ban to stand over use of 'Gulf of Mexico' name	WASHINGTON — A federal judge on Monday denied a request by the Associated Press to restore full access for the news agency's journalists after President Donald Trump's administration barred them for continuing to refer to the Gulf of Mexico in coverage. U.S. District Judge Trevor McFadden, a Trump appointee, declined to immediately grant the AP's request for a temporary injunction restoring its access to the Oval Office and Air Force One during a hearing in Washington federal court. The AP sued three senior Trump aides on Friday, arguing that the decision to block its reporters from those locations violates the U.S. Constitution's First Amendment protections against government abridgment of speech by trying to dictate the language they use in reporting the news. Lawyers for the Trump administration argued in a court filing before the hearing that the AP does not have a constitutional right to what it called 'special media access to the president.' White House Communications Director Steven Cheung in an earlier statement had called the AP lawsuit a 'blatant PR stunt.' During an appearance last week at the Conservative Political Action Conference, White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt also said, 'We feel we are in the right in this position.' Leavitt is one of the three White House officials named as defendants in the lawsuit. The other two, Chief of Staff Susan Wiles and Deputy Chief of Staff Taylor Budowich, have not responded to requests for comment. Trump signed an executive order last month directing the U.S. Interior Department to change the name of the Gulf of Mexico to the Gulf of America. The AP said in January it would continue to use the gulf's long-established name in stories while also acknowledging Trump's efforts to change it. The White House banned AP reporters in response. The ban prevents the AP's journalists from seeing and hearing Trump and other top White House officials as they take newsworthy actions or respond in real time to news events. The White House Correspondents' Association said in a legal brief backing the AP in the case that the ban 'will chill and distort news coverage of the president to the public's detriment.' Reuters released a statement in support of the AP.	https://www.voanews.com/a/us-judge-allows-trump-s-ap-oval-office-ban-to-stand-over-use-of-gulf-of-mexico-name-/7986557.html	2025-02-24T14:05:10-08:00	
Clint Hill, agent who leaped onto JFK's car after president was shot, dies at 93	BELVEDERE, CALIFORNIA — Clint Hill, the Secret Service agent who leaped onto the back of President John F. Kennedy's limousine after the president was shot, then was forced to retire early because he remained haunted by memories of the assassination, has died. He was 93. Hill died Friday at his home in Belvedere, California, according to his publisher, Gallery Books, an imprint of Simon & Schuster. A cause of death was not given. Although few may recognize his name, the footage of Hill, captured on Abraham Zapruder's chilling home movie of the assassination, provided some of the most indelible images of Kennedy's assassination in Dallas on Nov. 22, 1963. Hill received Secret Service awards and was promoted for his actions that day, but for decades blamed himself for Kennedy's death, saying he didn't react quickly enough and would gladly have given his life to save the president. 'If I had reacted just a little bit quicker. And I could have, I guess,' a weeping Hill told Mike Wallace on CBS' 60 Minutes in 1975, shortly after he retired at age 43 at the urging of his doctors. 'And I'll live with that to my grave.' It was only in recent years that Hill said he was able to finally start putting the assassination behind him and accept what happened. On the day of the assassination, Hill was assigned to protect first lady Jacqueline Kennedy and was riding on the left running board of the follow-up car directly behind the presidential limousine as it made its way through Dealey Plaza. Hill told the Warren Commission that he reacted after hearing a shot and seeing the president slump in his seat. The president was struck by a fatal headshot before Hill was able to make it to the limousine. Zapruder's film captured Hill as he leaped from the Secret Service car, grabbed a handle on the limousine's trunk and pulled himself onto it as the driver accelerated. He forced Mrs. Kennedy, who had crawled onto the trunk, back into her seat as the limousine sped off. Hill later became the agent in charge of the White House protective detail and eventually an assistant director of the Secret Service, retiring because of what he characterized as deep depression and recurring memories of the assassination. The 1993 Clint Eastwood thriller In the Line of Fire, about a former Secret Service agent scarred by the JFK assassination, was inspired in part by Hill. Hill was born in 1932 and grew up in Washburn, North Dakota. He attended Concordia College in Moorhead, Minnesota, served in the Army and worked as a railroad agent before joining the Secret Service in 1958. He worked in the agency's Denver office for about a year, before joining the elite group of agents assigned to protect the president and first family. Since his retirement, Hill has spoken publicly about the assassination only a handful of times, but the most poignant was his 1975 interview with Wallace, during which Hill broke down several times. 'If I had reacted about five-tenths of a second faster, maybe a second faster, I wouldn't be here today,' Hill said. 'You mean you would have gotten there, and you would have taken the shot?' Wallace asked. 'The third shot, yes, sir,' Hill said. 'And that would have been all right with you?' 'That would have been fine with me,' Hill responded. In his 2005 memoir, Between You and Me, Wallace recalled his interview with Hill as one of the most moving of his career. In 2006, Wallace and Hill reunited on CNN's Larry King Live, where Hill credited that first 60 Minutes interview with helping him finally start the healing process. 'I have to thank Mike for asking me to do that interview and then thank him more because he's what caused me to finally come to terms with things and bring the emotions out where they surfaced,' he said. 'It was because of his questions and the things he asked that I started to recover.' Decades after the assassination, Hill co-authored several books — including Mrs. Kennedy and Me and Five Presidents — about his Secret Service years with Lisa McCubbin Hill, whom he married in 2021. 'We had that once-in-a-lifetime love that everyone hopes for,' McCubbin Hill said in a statement. 'We were soulmates.' Clint Hill also became a speaker and gave interviews about his experience in Dallas. In 2018, he was given the state of North Dakota's highest civilian honor, the Theodore Roosevelt Rough Rider Award. A portrait of Hill adorns the Capitol gallery of fellow honorees. A private funeral service will be held in Washington, D.C., on a future date.	https://www.voanews.com/a/clint-hill-agent-who-leaped-onto-jfk-s-car-after-president-was-shot-dies-at-93/7986546.html	2025-02-24T14:01:35-08:00	
VOA Russian: Chechen leader Kadyrov wants to rule for life	Chechen leader Ramzan Kadyrov, who has ruled the republic since 2007, said he wants to remain in power for life.

VOA Russian: Analyst notes Russia's military equipment losses in war with Ukraine	VOA Russian spoke to independent analyst Jakub Janovsky who documents Russian military equipment losses in the war with Ukraine. He noted that Russia has lost 136 military planes and 151 helicopters in three years of the war, reducing its aviation fleet so Moscow now relies more on long-range missiles and drones. Janovsky also said Russia has noticeably reduced the use of the heavy military equipment, such as tanks and armored fighting vehicles, on the frontline in Ukraine in the past several months, though the reasons for that are unknown.

At UN, competing resolutions on ending Russia’s war in Ukraine approved	The U.N. General Assembly marked the third anniversary of Russia’s full-scale invasion of Ukraine by narrowly approving competing resolutions on ending the war, one drafted by Kyiv with the European Union, and a second from the United States. 'Russia believed Ukraine would surrender. Russia believed we would fall in three days. Russia believed our government would flee. However, Russia miscalculated gravely,' Mariana Betsa, Ukraine’s deputy foreign minister, told the gathering, saying Ukrainians continue to stand firm and resist. In the weeks leading up to the meeting, there was only the Ukrainian draft resolution, which reflected previous ones adopted by the 193-member body. That resolution included a reference to Russia’s 'full-scale invasion of Ukraine' and called for a 'comprehensive, just and lasting peace' in line with the United Nations Charter and 'within its internationally recognized borders.' Then late Friday afternoon, the United States put forward its own brief text, titled: 'The Path to Peace,' which called for 'a swift end to the conflict and further urges a lasting peace between Ukraine and the Russian Federation.' It did not mention Russia’s full-scale invasion of Ukraine. Russia’s U.N. ambassador called the U.S. draft 'a good move.' 'This is our opportunity to build real momentum toward peace,' U.S. Secretary of State Marco Rubio said in a statement Friday. European diplomats met through the weekend to find a way to prevent the U.S. draft from undermining international support for Ukraine at a critical moment in the war. On Monday, they proposed three amendments to the U.S. text, all of which were adopted by the General Assembly. They added language to the U.S. text that included replacing the wording 'the Russia-Ukraine conflict' with 'the full-scale invasion of Ukraine by the Russian Federation.' A paragraph was inserted that said: 'Reaffirming its commitment to the sovereignty, independence, unity and territorial integrity of Ukraine within its internationally recognized borders, extending to its territorial waters.' The paragraph also included language on supporting the U.N. Charter and the principles of sovereignty and territorial integrity of states. When the amended U.S. text was put to a vote, Washington abstained on its own resolution. It was adopted with 93 states in favor, 8 against and 73 abstentions. 'These amendments pursue a war of words rather than an end to the war,' U.S. envoy Dorothy Shea said. 'The attempt to add this language detracts from what we are trying to achieve with this forward-looking resolution: A firm consensus from the members of this body to unite behind a resolution calling for the end to this conflict.' Russia also voted against the U.S. draft, because their attempt to amend it with language to address what it says are the root causes of the conflict was rejected by the Assembly. 'The essence of it has become completely distorted,' Russian ambassador Vassily Nebenzia said, but he welcomed the U.S. move and said he hoped it would be followed by other new initiatives. 'I think that today, our American colleagues have seen for themselves that the road to peace in Ukraine will not be an easy one, and there will be many who will try to make sure the peace does not come for as long as possible,' Nebenzia said. The Ukrainian resolution was approved to loud applause with 93 states in favor, 18 against and 65 abstentions. It was the weakest support Ukraine has had over the course of the last three years in the Assembly. The United States voted against the Ukrainian text as did Russia, its allies Belarus and North Korea, several African states, European Union outlier Hungary, and Israel. General Assembly resolutions are not legally binding, but they do carry the moral weight of the international community. The United States is expected to still bring its original draft resolution to the U.N. Security Council later Monday for a vote. It would need the support of at least nine of the 15 members and no veto from any permanent member — Britain, China, France, Russia or the United States. The Europeans have said they will bring their three amendments to the council for a vote as well. A senior State Department official said Monday that Washington would veto any amendments — European or Russian — to its original text. U.N. Secretary-General Antonio Guterres was in Geneva on Monday, where he said countries 'must spare no effort to bring an end to this conflict and achieve a just and lasting peace in line with the U.N. Charter, international law and General Assembly resolutions.' Macron in Washington The diplomatic drama at the United Nations was taking place as French President Emmanuel Macron was at the White House for a meeting and lunch with President Donald Trump that included discussions about the war in Ukraine. Macron said last week that he planned to tell Trump the U.S. leader 'cannot be weak' in the face of Russian President Vladimir Putin. British Prime Minister Keir Starmer is due to visit Washington later this week for similar talks, and like Macron has emphasized the need for Ukraine’s sovereignty to be at the center of any peace effort. A group of leaders including European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen, European Council President Antonio Costa, Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau, Denmark's Prime Minister Mette Frederiksen and Spain's Prime Minister Pedro Sanchez visited Kyiv on Monday in a show of support for Ukraine. 'We are in Kyiv today, because Ukraine is Europe,' von der Leyen said on X. 'In this fight for survival, it is not only the destiny of Ukraine that is at stake. It’s Europe’s destiny.' New EU sanctions on Moscow European Union foreign ministers on Monday approved a new round of sanctions against Russia, which EU foreign policy chief Kaja Kallas said include measures against ships that work to evade restrictions on transporting certain goods, banks that circumvent sanctions and equipment used to pilot drones. Kremlin spokesperson Dmitry Peskov called the new sanctions 'entirely predictable,' and said the European nations seemed to want the war to continue. Fighting continued Monday with Russia saying it shot down 23 Ukrainian drones overnight, including 16 over the Oryol region. Some information for this story was provided by The Associated Press, Agence France-Presse and Reuters.	https://www.voanews.com/a/at-un-competing-resolutions-on-ending-russia-s-war-in-ukraine-approved/7986387.html	2025-02-24T12:06:00-08:00	
Russia's 3-year-war on Ukraine still unresolved	Russia’s war on Ukraine hit the three-year mark Monday and the conflict is no more settled than it was when Moscow’s troops first stormed across the border of its neighbor. In the earliest days of fighting, Russian President Vladimir Putin had hoped to quickly overwhelm Kyiv’s forces and capture the one-time Soviet satellite state. But Ukrainian forces, supplied with tens of billions of dollars’ worth of U.S. and European munitions, fought back over three years and now the war is at something of a deadly stalemate with any settlement of it, and on what terms, in a state of uncertainty. By numerous accounts, hundreds of thousands of Russian and Ukrainian soldiers have been killed or wounded, along with tens of thousands of Ukrainian civilians who have been killed and injured in the Russian ground and aerial attacks. Russia controls about a fifth of Ukraine’s internationally recognized territory, including the Crimean Peninsula it unilaterally seized in 2014, and lands captured by pro-Russian separatists in eastern Ukraine in the ensuing years and territory taken over by Moscow’s forces since the war started on Feb. 24, 2022. As the war rages, Russian troops are gaining even more territory. But the political overseers who could control Ukraine’s fate have changed. Former U.S. President Joe Biden, who led the Western coalition of nations funding Ukraine’s war effort, vowed continued support for Kyiv against Russia for 'as long as it takes.' Now, the new U.S. leader is President Donald Trump, who declined last year during a political debate to say he wanted Ukraine to win the war. Last week he called Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy a 'dictator.' Trump claimed that Zelenskyy, not Putin, started the war, and laid the groundwork for a settlement of the war with Putin. Last week, the U.S. and Russia excluded Ukraine and European countries from the initial discussions, with Trump saying Zelenskyy could have negotiated with Russia three years ago to talk Putin out of invading. On Monday, more than a dozen Western leaders attended events in Ukraine to mark the third anniversary of the war. Trump has said he wants the carnage to end, but Ukrainian and European officials are worried that he envisions a settlement that would be more favorable to Moscow than Kyiv. He has demanded that Ukraine turn over a large portion of its rare earth minerals to the U.S. to pay for its military support over the last three years. The Kremlin says it has no intention of yielding any of the territory it now holds while the U.S. says that Ukraine’s goal of joining NATO, the West’s key military alliance, as part of a negotiated end to the war is unrealistic. U.S. officials say both Russia and Ukraine will have to make concessions to reach a peace deal, but the terms of any settlement are far from a conclusion. European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen warned at a conference in Kyiv that world security is at stake depending on how the Russia-Ukraine war might end. 'The autocrats around the world are watching very carefully whether there's any impunity if you violate international borders or invade your neighbor, or if there is true deterrence,' she said. Some of Ukraine's most important backers, including European leaders and Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau, were among the stream of dignitaries arriving by train in Kyiv. Others spoke at a conference via video link. The officials echoed similar messages that Ukraine and its European partners must be consulted in any peace negotiations, Putin's ambitions must be thwarted, and Europe must take on more of the burden for its own defense. The shift in Washington's policy toward Ukraine under Trump has touched off deep concerns in Europe, where governments fear being sidelined by the U.S. in efforts to secure a peace deal and are weighing how they might pick up the slack of any cut in U.S. aid for Ukraine. European Council President Antonio Costa announced Sunday that he would convene an emergency summit of the 27 European Union leaders in Brussels on March 6, with Ukraine at the top of the agenda. 'We are living a defining moment for Ukraine and European security,' he said in a post on social media. British Prime Minister Keir Starmer and French President Emmanuel Macron are both heading to Washington this week to meet with Trump. Starmer said Ukrainians' voices 'must be at the heart of the drive for peace,' while Trump's intervention had 'changed the global conversation' and 'created an opportunity.' 'Russia does not hold all the cards in this war,' Starmer said. EU foreign ministers Monday approved a new array of sanctions against Russia that target Moscow’s so-called 'shadow fleet' of ships that it uses to skirt restrictions on transporting oil and gas, or to carry stolen Ukrainian grain. The EU said 74 vessels were added to its shadow fleet list. Asset freezes and travel bans were imposed on 83 officials and 'entities,' typically government agencies, banks or companies. Spanish Prime Minister Pedro Sánchez said his country would provide a more than $1 billion military systems package to Ukraine this year. Coming off his victory in Sunday's German elections, conservative leader Friedrich Merz — also a staunch backer of Ukraine — posted on X Monday: 'More than ever, we must put Ukraine in a position of strength.' 'For a fair peace, the country that is under attack must be part of peace negotiations,' he wrote. The EU's top diplomat, Kaja Kallas, insisted that the U.S. cannot seal any peace deal to end the war without Ukraine or Europe being involved. She highlighted what she said were pro-Russian positions being taken by the Trump administration. 'You can discuss whatever you want with Putin. But if it comes to Europe or Ukraine, then Ukraine and Europe also have to agree to this deal,' Kallas told reporters in Brussels.

Taliban continues corporal punishment, flogging 20 Afghans over alleged adultery	ISLAMABAD — Afghanistan’s hard-line Taliban authorities publicly flogged 20 men and women Monday on charges of adultery, rape, and engaging in 'illegitimate relations.' The Taliban's Supreme Court reported that all defendants received sentences of 39 lashes each and prison terms ranging from one to seven years. The punishments were carried out in the eastern Khost and central Parwan provinces, with residents, judicial, and government officials among the spectators. Since regaining control of Afghanistan in 2021, the Taliban have publicly flogged hundreds of men and women. Most were charged with offenses such as adultery, sodomy, eloping, having illegitimate relations and robbery. The number of Afghans subjected to flogging this month alone has reached 86, with 17 women among the victims, according to data from the top court. The United Nations has condemned corporal punishment being conducted by the Taliban as a violation of international law and human dignity, calling for the practice to be halted immediately. The Taliban government, which is not recognized by any country, defends its criminal justice system and overall governance by stating that they are aligned with Islamic law or Sharia and dismissing foreign criticism as misguided. The de facto Afghan leaders have placed sweeping restrictions on women’s access to education and employment, effectively erasing most of them from public life in Afghanistan and drawing persistent calls from the U.N. to reverse what it condemns as 'gender-apartheid.'	https://www.voanews.com/a/taliban-continues-corporal-punishment-flogging-20-afghans-over-alleged-adultery-/7986154.html	2025-02-24T10:16:29-08:00	
Roberta Flack, Grammy-winning singer with an intimate style, dies at 88	NEW YORK — Roberta Flack, the Grammy-winning singer and pianist whose intimate vocal and musical style on Killing Me Softly with His Song, The First Time Ever I Saw Your Face and other hits made her one of the top recording artists of the 1970s and an influential performer long after, died Monday. She was 88. She died at home surrounded by her family, publicist Elaine Schock said in a statement. Flack announced in 2022 she had ALS, commonly known as Lou Gehrig's disease, and could no longer sing, Little known before her early 30s, Flack became an overnight star after Clint Eastwood used The First Time I Ever Saw Your Face as the soundtrack for one of cinema's more memorable and explicit love scenes, between the actor and Donna Mills in his 1971 film Play Misty for Me. The hushed, hymn-like ballad, with Flack's graceful soprano afloat on a bed of soft strings and piano, topped the Billboard pop chart in 1972 and received a Grammy for record of the year. In 1973, she matched both achievements with Killing Me Softly, becoming the first artist to win consecutive Grammys for best record. She was a classically trained pianist discovered in the late 1960s by jazz musician Les McCann, who later wrote that 'her voice touched, tapped, trapped, and kicked every emotion I've ever known.' Versatile enough to summon the up-tempo gospel passion of Aretha Franklin, Flack often favored a more reflective and measured approach. For Flack's many admirers, she was a sophisticated and bold new presence in the music world and in the social movements of the time, her friends including the Rev. Jesse Jackson and Angela Davis, whom Flack visited in prison while Davis faced charges — for which she was acquitted — for murder and kidnapping. Flack sang at the funeral of Jackie Robinson, major league baseball's first Black player, and was among the many guest performers on the feminist children's entertainment project created by Marlo Thomas, Free to Be ... You and Me.	https://www.voanews.com/a/roberta-flack-grammy-winning-singer-with-an-intimate-style-dies-at-88/7986124.html	2025-02-24T08:50:54-08:00	
Apple to build 23,200-square meter facility in Texas	U.S. tech giant Apple has announced plans to create some 20,000 jobs and invest $500 billion over the next four years in the United States. Apple says it will expand teams and facilities in nine states across the country and that it aims to open a 23,200-square-meter server manufacturing facility in Texas in 2026. The announcement comes just days after Apple CEO Tim Cook met with U.S. President Donald Trump. 'We are bullish on the future of American innovation, and we’re proud to build on our long-standing U.S. investments with this $500 billion commitment to our country’s future,' Cook said on the investment. 'From doubling our Advanced Manufacturing Fund, to building advanced technology in Texas, we’re thrilled to expand our support for American manufacturing. And we’ll keep working with people and companies across this country to help write an extraordinary new chapter in the history of American innovation,' he added in a company statement. Trump thanked Cook and Apple for the investment on Monday morning on the social media platform Truth Social. 'Apple has just announced a record $500 billion investment in the United States of America. The reason, faith in what we are doing, without which, they wouldn’t be investing 10 cents,' Trump said. Most of Apple’s consumer goods are currently assembled and produced overseas. Many of them, assembled in China, are liable to 10% tariffs imposed by Trump earlier in February. To reduce its reliance on international supply chains, Apple announced in January that it had begun mass producing its own chips at an Arizona factory owned by TSMC, Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company. The TSMC Arizona factory, along with legislation aimed at increasing U.S. semiconductor production, were two of Trump’s largest industrial policy moves during his first term. In a release on its website, Apple said the $500 billion commitment includes the company’s work with thousands of suppliers across all 50 states, direct employment, Apple Intelligence infrastructure and data centers, corporate facilities, and Apple TV+ production in 20 states. Apple said it is also set to open a manufacturing academy in Michigan, offering training led by engineers and local university staff to support mid-sized manufacturing firms in areas like project management and manufacturing processes.	https://www.voanews.com/a/apple-to-build-23-200-square-meter-facility-in-texas/7986112.html	2025-02-24T08:33:59-08:00	
US imposes new sanctions on Iran's 'shadow fleet'	Washington — The United States imposed sanctions on more than 30 people and vessels for their role in selling and transporting Iranian petroleum-related products as part of Tehran's 'shadow fleet,' the Treasury Department said. The sanctions target oil brokers in the United Arab Emirates (UAE) and Hong Kong, tanker operators and mangers in India and China, the head of Iran's National Iranian Oil Company, and the Iranian Oil Terminals Company, Treasury said. It said the vessels sanctioned ship tens of millions of barrels of crude oil valued in the hundreds of millions of dollars, the department said in a statement. 'Iran continues to rely on a shadowy network of vessels, shippers, and brokers to facilitate its oil sales and fund its destabilizing activities,' said Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent. The sanctions build on those imposed by the Biden administration. Such sanctions target key sectors of Iran's economy with the aim of denying the government funds for its nuclear and missile programs. The move generally prohibits any U.S. individuals or entities from doing any business with the targets and freezes any U.S.-held assets.	https://www.voanews.com/a/us-imposes-new-sanctions-on-iran-shadow-fleet/7986107.html	2025-02-24T08:28:45-08:00

Pakistan, Azerbaijan sign agreements, MOUs on trade and energy	Islamabad — Pakistan and Azerbaijan have signed agreements and memorandums of understanding (MOUs), chiefly about trade and energy, during a visit to Azerbaijan by Pakistani Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif. Sharif arrived Sunday in the Azerbaijani capital, Baku, for a two-day visit to hold talks with President Ilham Aliyev and other top officials. In a post on social media, the Pakistani leader said he had an 'excellent meeting' with Aliyev, saying the two worked on finalizing a portfolio of investments Azerbaijan plans to make in Pakistan. Aliyev promised a $2 billion investment during a visit to Pakistan last July. 'This will be the first quantum jump in our trade and investment relations and will be a huge reflection of our fraternal ties,' a statement from the Pakistani prime minister’s office quoted Sharif as saying. This is Sharif’s second visit to the Central Asian country since taking office in February of last year. Aliyev is expected to sign final agreements for investment during a visit to Pakistan in April. 'We received concrete projects from Pakistan, and Azerbaijani representatives are evaluating them. Today we put ambitious and realistic targets to finalize all the discussions within one month and by the beginning of April, the documents will be prepared for signing,' the Pakistani statement quoted Aliyev as saying. Agreements on pipeline, LNG delivery During Sharif’s visit, Azerbaijan’s state-owned oil company, SOCAR, exchanged several MOUs with Pakistan’s oil trading and refining companies, including one to complete a pipeline in the South Asian country, Pakistan's state-run news agency reported. The Machike-Thallian-Tarujabba White Oil Pipeline Project is designed to transport oil within Pakistan. Both sides also signed updated agreements and MOUs on the delivery of liquified natural gas, or LNG, from Azerbaijan to Pakistan. Prior to the trip, Pakistan’s Economic Cooperation Committee approved a three-year extension of the LNG Framework Agreement between SOCAR and Pakistan LNG Limited Thursday. Signed in 2023, the agreement allows Pakistan to procure one shipload of LNG per month when required, without any financial commitments, according to the statement from Pakistan’s Ministry of Finance. Such an agreement allows Pakistan to purchase energy products as needed rather than using precious foreign exchange reserves to pay for unused cargo. According to Sharif’s office, Aliyev also discussed joint defense production with Pakistan. 'Azerbaijan has already acquired defense equipment from Pakistan and we are satisfied with the quality of this equipment and we will continue to do it,' the Azerbaijani leader was quoted as saying. Last September, the Pakistani military signed a deal to sell JF-17 Thunder block III fighter jets to the Central Asian country. The jets are jointly produced by Pakistan and China. The visit, aimed at bringing more foreign investment to Pakistan, comes as the country prepares for a review of a three-year bailout program with the International Monetary Fund when the lender’s team visits in March. Pakistan reached a $7 billion loan agreement with the Washington-based lender last September to avoid a balance-of-payment crisis. In a push to further deepen ties with Central Asian countries, Sharif heads to Uzbekistan Tuesday.	https://www.voanews.com/a/pakistan-azerbaijan-sign-agreements-mous-on-trade-and-energy/7986025.html	2025-02-24T07:22:22-08:00	
Russian court upholds French researcher's jail sentence	Moscow — A Russian court on Monday upheld a three-year prison sentence for French researcher Laurent Vinatier, one of several Westerners jailed by Russia during the Ukraine offensive. France condemned the sentence as 'arbitrary' and demanded Vinatier's 'immediate release,' after accusing Russia of taking Westerners hostage. Vinatier, who works for a Swiss conflict mediation NGO, was arrested last summer as tensions with France and other Western countries soared over Ukraine. In October, Russia found Vinatier guilty of gathering information on the Russian military and of violating its 'foreign agent' law — which has usually been reserved for Russian nationals. 'The sentence... against Laurent Vinatier is left unchanged,' judge Tatyana Sokolova said at an appeal hearing, an AFP reporter in court heard. After the sentence was upheld, tears welled in Vinatier's eyes. Speaking in Russian in a video link from prison, Vinatier had earlier told the court: 'I fully admit my guilt. I repent.' The researcher has said he was not aware that he should have registered as a 'foreign agent.' The label, which has Stalin-era connotations, has mainly been used against domestic Kremlin critics. Vinatier worked as an adviser with the Geneva-based Centre for Humanitarian Dialogue and is a veteran researcher on Russia and other post-Soviet countries. Vinatier has said in court that in his work he always tried to 'present Russia's interests in international relations.' 'Everything I did in Russia together with its representatives was only for the sake of peace,' Vinatier said. His lawyer Oleg Besonov said the sentence was 'too severe' and told the court that Vinatier had two dependent minor children, one of whom is disabled. The French foreign ministry in a statement repeated a demand for Russia to release Vinatier and repeal its 'foreign agents' law, which it said goes against Russia's human rights commitments. French President Emmanuel Macron has repeatedly called on Russia to free Vinatier, saying that he is unfairly detained and that the 'propaganda' against him 'does not match reality.' Paris is one of Ukraine's strongest supporters and Russia has singled out France as a particularly hostile state during the conflict. Russia has arrested several Westerners since its offensive in Ukraine and held several prisoner exchanges with the United States, including the biggest East-West swap since the Cold War in August 2024. Tensions between Europe and Moscow remain high, while US President Donald Trump meanwhile has warmed U.S. ties with the Kremlin in a dramatic policy shift. This month, Russia freed a U.S. citizen, Kalob Byers, just a few days after detaining him at a Moscow airport for possession of cannabis-laced gummies in his luggage, a sign of a major turnaround between Moscow and Washington.

Syria's national dialogue conference set to kick off Monday	Damascus — A long-awaited national dialogue conference intended to help chart Syria’s political future after the fall of former President Bashar Assad is set to begin Monday. The main session will be held on Tuesday, with participants holding workshops to discuss transitional justice, the structure of a new constitution, reforming and building institutions, personal freedoms, the role of civil society and the country’s economy. The outcome of the national dialogue will be nonbinding recommendations to the country’s new leaders. Plans for the conference — which had been promised by the country’s new authorities in the immediate aftermath of Assad’s fall in a lightning rebel offensive in December — had been in flux up until the last minute. The date of the conference was announced on Sunday, one day before it was to start. Two days before that announcement, Hassan al-Daghim, spokesperson for the committee organizing the national dialogue, had said the date of the conference had not been set and the timing was 'up for discussion by the citizens.' He also said the number of participants had not been determined yet and might range from 400 to 1,000. It was not clear Monday what the final number would be or how the invited participants had been selected. The committee said Sunday that it had held more than 30 meetings across Syria’s provinces in which some 4,000 people participated in the runup to the conference 'to ensure the representation of various components of Syrian society,' state-run news agency SANA reported. It said participants had repeatedly called for a temporary constitutional declaration, an economic plan, the restructuring of government sectors, involving citizens in the management of institutions, and enhancing security and stability. After Assad was toppled, Hayat Tahrir al-Sham, or HTS, the main former rebel group now in control of Syria, set up an interim administration comprising mainly members of its 'salvation government' that had ruled in northwestern Syria. They said at the time that a new government would be formed through an inclusive process by March. In January, former HTS leader Ahmad al-Sharaa was named Syria’s interim president after a meeting of most of the country’s former rebel factions. The groups agreed to dissolve the country’s constitution, the former national army, security service and official political parties. The armed groups present at the meetings also agreed to dissolve themselves and for their members to be absorbed into the new national army and security forces. Notably absent was the Kurdish-led Syrian Democratic Forces, which holds sway in northeastern Syria and which has not been invited to participate in the national dialogue.	https://www.voanews.com/a/syria-s-national-dialogue-conference-set-to-kick-off-monday-/7985773.html	2025-02-24T03:55:31-08:00	
Xi affirms 'no limits' partnership with Putin in call on Ukraine war anniversary	BEIJING — China's President Xi Jinping reaffirmed his 'no limits' partnership in a phone call with Russian President Vladimir Putin on Monday, China's state media reported, on the third anniversary of Russia's full-scale invasion of Ukraine. The leaders held the talks as U.S. President Donald Trump has pushed for a quick deal to end the Ukraine war, raising the prospect that Washington could draw a wedge between Xi and Putin and focus on competing with the world's second largest economy. The call appeared aimed at dispelling any such prospects — the two leaders underscored the durability and the 'long-term' nature of their alliance, with its own 'internal dynamics' that would not be impacted by any 'third party.' 'China-Russia relations have strong internal driving force and unique strategic value, and are not aimed at, nor are they influenced by, any third party,' said Xi, according to the official readout published by state media. 'The development strategies and foreign policies of China and Russia are long-term,' said Xi Trump has alarmed Washington's European allies by leaving them and Ukraine out of talks with Russia last week and blaming Ukraine for Russia's 2022 invasion. This was the second call both leaders have held this year, after they discussed in January how to build ties with Trump. China and Russia declared a 'no limits' strategic partnership, days before Putin sent tens of thousands of troops into Ukraine in February 2022. Xi has met Putin over 40 times in the past decade and Putin in recent months described China as an 'ally.' Beijing has refused to condemn Moscow for its role in the war, straining its ties with Europe and the U.S. as a result.	https://www.voanews.com/a/xi-affirms-no-limits-partnership-with-putin-in-call-on-ukraine-war-anniversary-/7985763.html	2025-02-24T03:41:13-08:00	
Projectiles thrown at Russian consulate in France, one explodes, says security source	MARSEILLE, France — Two projectiles were thrown at the perimeter wall of Russia's consulate in the southern French port city of Marseille on Monday, one of which exploded, a French security source said. It was not immediately clear if the projectiles cleared the wall. BFM TV said the projectiles were Molotov cocktails and that they landed in the consulate's garden. Russia demanded a full French investigation and said the incident looked like an act of terrorism, state news agency TASS reported. No one was injured, the security source said. Consulate staff were kept indoors and police set up a security perimeter around the consulate. The incident in the southern French city took place on the third anniversary of the Russia-Ukraine war. 'The explosions on the territory of the Russian Consulate General in Marseille have all the hallmarks of a terrorist attack,' TASS quoted Russia's Foreign Ministry spokeswoman Maria Zakharova as saying.	https://www.voanews.com/a/projectiles-thrown-at-russian-consulate-in-france-one-explodes-says-security-source/7985736.html	2025-02-24T02:51:08-08:00	
China says rising food demand requires production boost	Beijing — China's rising demand for food calls for increased efforts to boost grain production even after record-high output in recent years, China's Central Rural Work Leading Group said on Monday. 'More than 1.4 billion of us want to eat, and we want to eat better and better,' Han Wenxiu, a director from China's Central Rural Work Leading Group told a news conference. More people eat meat, eggs and milk in greater volumes, which requires a large-scale increase in grain for feed, Han said. China is the world's largest agriculture producer and importer, bringing in more than 157 million metric tons of grain and soybeans last year, when it also reported record grain production of 706.5 million tons. In its annual rural work policy blueprint released on Sunday, known as the No. 1 document, the State Council sharpened China's focus on self-sufficiency and supply stability to counter potential disruptions to agricultural trade with the United States, the European Union and Canada. Last year's bumper harvest helped to stabilize prices and relieved consumers' concerns, Han said. But he cited 'the current complex and severe domestic and international environment,' and said the need to buffer shocks from extreme weather conditions called for increased output. 'The central government's policy is clear: grain production can only be strengthened, not relaxed. We must not say that grains have passed the test just because of a momentary downturn in prices,' he said. China has further potential to develop and integrate biotechnology, strengthen equipment support and build a diversified food supply system to ensure food security, he said. The agriculture ministry aims to increase grain production by 50 million tons by 2030, which would be a 7% increase over 2024's grain harvest.	https://www.voanews.com/a/china-says-rising-food-demand-requires-production-boost/7985727.html	2025-02-24T02:37:04-08:00	
Thousands in limbo on Thai-Myanmar border after scam center crackdown	BANGKOK — Thousands of foreigners freed from online scam-operating centers in Myanmar are stuck in limbo on the border with Thailand after a multinational crackdown on the compounds run by criminal gangs, three sources told Reuters on Monday. In recent weeks, authorities from China, Thailand and Myanmar have attempted to dismantle scam centers and illegal online operations on the border, part of a network of illegal compounds across Southeast Asia where hundreds of thousands have been trafficked by gangs, according to the United Nations. Thai and Cambodian police raided a building in a border town and freed 215 foreigners, a senior Thai official said on Sunday. Two Myanmar armed groups - the Karen National Army (KNA) and the Democratic Karen Buddhist Army (DKBA)- are currently holding around 7,000 former scam center workers but are unable to send them to Thailand, a Thai security official and two aid workers said. 'Many are stuck in limbo and Thailand's lack of response is causing great harm,' said one of aid workers, currently on the Thai side of the border. 'It is like these victims are being revictimized again.' Thailand's foreign ministry said that agencies are currently planning for future handovers of those freed, which would 'proceed based on the readiness of the embassies or the countries of origin.' KNA and DKBA officials did not respond to calls from Reuters. The majority of these workers are Chinese, with about 1,000 from other foreign countries, according to the aid workers. Many of the former scam center workers are being held in dire conditions and local authorities are concerned about the lack of sanitation and health facilities, they said. Thai Deputy Prime Minister Phumtham Wechayachai said last Thursday that Thailand doesn't have the capacity to accept more people unless foreign embassies repatriate those crossing over. Thailand this month accepted 260 scam center workers, more than half of whom were from Ethiopia, which has no embassy in the country. Thai authorities also allowed China to repatriate 621 of its nationals via a series of flights from a border town last week. Scam centers have been operating in the region for years, but face renewed scrutiny after the rescue of Chinese actor, Wang Xing, who was lured to Thailand with the promise of a job, and then abducted and taken to one such center in Myanmar. Southeast Asian countries have since stepped up efforts to tackle scam centers, including Thailand cutting power, fuel and internet supply to areas linked with scam centers.	https://www.voanews.com/a/thousands-in-limbo-on-thai-myanmar-border-after-scam-center-crackdown/7985721.html	2025-02-24T02:27:57-08:00	
Pope resting on 10th day of hospitalization	ROME — Pope Francis was resting Monday morning after a quiet night, on the 10th day of his hospitalization for a complex lung infection that has provoked the early stages of kidney failure, the Vatican said. The one-line statement didn’t say if Francis, 88, had woken up. 'The night passed well, the pope slept and is resting,' it said. Late Sunday, doctors reported that blood tests showed early kidney failure that was nevertheless under control. They said Francis remained in critical condition but that he hadn't experienced any further respiratory crises since Saturday. He was receiving high flows of supplemental oxygen and, on Sunday, was alert, responsive and attended Mass. They said his prognosis was guarded. Doctors have said Francis’ condition is touch-and-go, given his age, fragility and pre-existing lung disease. They have warned that the main threat facing Francis is sepsis, a serious infection of the blood that can occur as a complication of pneumonia. To date there has been no reference to any onset of sepsis in the medical updates provided by the Vatican, including on Sunday. Monday marks Francis’ 10th day in the hospital, making this equal to the longest hospitalization of his papacy. He spent 10 days at Rome’s Gemelli hospital in 2021 after he had 33 centimeters of his colon removed. In New York on Sunday, Cardinal Timothy Dolan acknowledged what church leaders in Rome weren’t saying publicly: that the Catholic faithful were united 'at the bedside of a dying father.' 'As our Holy Father Pope Francis is in very, very fragile health, and probably close to death,' Dolan said in his homily from the pulpit of St. Patrick’s Cathedral, though he later told reporters he hoped and prayed that Francis would 'bounce back.' Doctors have said Francis’ condition is touch-and-go, given his age, fragility and pre-existing lung disease. His condition has revived speculation about what might happen if he becomes unconscious or otherwise incapacitated, and whether he might resign.	https://www.voanews.com/a/pope-resting-on-10th-day-of-hospitalization/7985700.html	2025-02-24T00:54:13-08:00	
Germany's Merz faces tricky talks with potential coalition ally	BERLIN — Germany's likely next chancellor Friedrich Merz will start trying to form a coalition government on Monday after his conservative bloc won a national election that saw far-right and far-left parties hoover up support from disaffected voters. Merz, who has no previous experience in office, is set to take charge with Europe's largest economy ailing, its society split over migration and its security caught between a confrontational U.S. and an assertive Russia and China. The 69-year-old faces lengthy coalition negotiations after the far-right Alternative for Germany (AfD) surged to a historic second place in a fractured vote, following the collapse of Chancellor Olaf Scholz's unloved three-way alliance. In an early indication of his policy intentions, Merz also took aim at the U.S. after his win, criticizing the 'ultimately outrageous' comments flowing from Washington during the campaign, comparing them to hostile interventions from Russia. 'For me, the absolute priority will be to strengthen Europe as quickly as possible so that we can achieve real independence from the USA, step by step,' Merz said on Sunday. His conservative CDU/CSU bloc came in first place on 28.6%, ahead of the far-right Alternative for Germany on 20.8%, its best-ever result, according to provisional results. Mainstream parties, however, rule out working with the AfD, a party which is monitored by German security services on suspicion of extremism but has been endorsed by U.S. figures including billionaire Elon Musk. That means Merz will have to negotiate with Scholz's center-left Social Democrats (SPD) to form a coalition in talks that are likely to take months following a bruising campaign that highlighted policy differences. Merz will, however, not have to rely on support from the Greens for an outright parliamentary majority, after the new BSW party founded by Sahra Wagenknecht, a former leader of the Left party, just missed the 5% threshold required to enter the lower house.	https://www.voanews.com/a/germany-s-merz-faces-tricky-talks-with-potential-coalition-ally/7985692.html	2025-02-24T00:23:53-08:00	
UN to vote on Russia-Ukraine war resolutions	A resolution drafted by the United States and another drafted by Ukraine and backed by the European Union calling for an end to the war in Ukraine are set for votes Monday at the United Nations. The U.N. General Assembly is expected to vote on the Ukrainian resolution, followed by the U.S. resolution. The U.N. Security Council is expected to hold its own vote on the U.S. resolution later in the day. The U.S. calls for 'a swift end to the conflict and further urges a lasting peace between Ukraine and the Russian Federation.' The U.S.-drafted measure does not mention Russia’s full-scale invasion of Ukraine, which began three years ago Monday. U.S. Secretary of State Marco Rubio said Friday that the resolution would 'affirm that this conflict is awful, that the U.N. can help end it, and that peace is possible.' 'This is our opportunity to build real momentum toward peace,' Rubio said in a statement. The more extensive Ukrainian resolution says the Russian invasion 'has persisted for three years and continues to have devastating and long-lasting consequences not only for Ukraine, but also for other regions and global stability.' It calls for 'a de-escalation, an early cessation of hostilities and a peaceful resolution of the war against Ukraine' and highlights the need for the war to end this year. The Ukrainian draft says earlier resolutions adopted by the General Assembly need to be fully implemented, including those calling for Russia to fully withdraw from Ukraine’s internationally recognized borders. General Assembly resolutions are not legally binding, but they do carry the moral weight of the international community. At the Security Council, a resolution needs the support of at least nine of the 15 members, with none of the permanent members—Britain, China, France, Russia, or United States—using their veto power. The U.S. measure is expected to have enough support Monday. The votes come as French President Emmanuel Macron visits the United States for talks with President Donald Trump that are expected to include the war in Ukraine. Macron said last week that he planned to tell Trump the U.S. leader 'cannot be weak' in the face of Russian President Vladimir Putin. British Prime Minister Keir Starmer is due to visit Washington later this week for similar talks, and like Macron has emphasized the need for Ukraine’s sovereignty to be at the center of any peace effort. European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen and European Council President Antonio Costa visited Kyiv on Monday in a show of support for Ukraine. 'We are in Kyiv today, because Ukraine is Europe,' von der Leyen said on X. 'In this fight for survival, it is not only the destiny of Ukraine that is at stake. It’s Europe’s destiny.' Some information for this story was provided by The Associated Press, Agence France-Presse and Reuters.	https://www.voanews.com/a/un-to-vote-on-russia-ukraine-war-resolutions/7985679.html	2025-02-23T23:41:17-08:00	
Kenyan police officer killed in Haiti in confrontation with gang members	PORT-AU-PRINCE, Haiti — A Kenyan police officer was killed on Sunday in Haiti, north of the capital, Port-au-Prince, the first casualty since the Kenyan-led security mission arrived in the Caribbean country in June 2024, the mission's authorities said. The Multinational Security Support Mission to Haiti said in a statement on Sunday that the Kenyan officer was injured during an operation in the Artibonite department and then airlifted to a hospital, where he died. Jack Ombaka, the mission's spokesperson, told Reuters that Sunday's casualty was the first the mission has suffered since the U.N.-backed anti-gang force arrived in the country, where rampant gang violence has displaced more than a million people. The officer was killed during a confrontation with gang members, Ombaka wrote in a statement. 'We salute our fallen hero,' the statement read. 'We will pursue these gangs to the last man standing. We will not let you down.' The death on Sunday came amid a surge in gang-related violence in the metropolitan area of Port-au-Prince over the last week.	https://www.voanews.com/a/kenyan-police-officer-killed-in-haiti-in-confrontation-with-gang-members/7985667.html	2025-02-23T22:55:05-08:00	
Philippine, Japan ministers agree to further enhance defense partnership	Manila, Philippines — Japan and the Philippines agreed on Monday to further deepen defense ties in the face of an 'increasingly severe' security environment in the Indo-Pacific region, Japanese defense minister Gen Nakatani said on Monday. Nakatani met his Philippine counterpart Gilberto Teodoro in Manila for a meeting in which the two ministers tackled regional security issues, including the maritime situation in the East and South China Seas. 'The security environment surrounding us is becoming increasingly severe and that it is necessary for the two countries as strategic partners to further enhance defense cooperation and collaboration to maintain peace and stability in Indo-Pacific,' Nakatani said through a translator. Nakatani said the Philippines and Japan have agreed to deepen cooperation on military exchanges, establish a high-level strategic dialogue among its military and deepen information sharing. Security ties between the two U.S. allies have strengthened over the past two years as Japan and the Philippines share common concerns over China's increasingly assertive actions in the region. Last year, Manila and Tokyo signed a landmark military pact allowing the deployment of their forces on each other's soil. Japan and China have repeatedly faced off around uninhabited Japanese-administered islands that Tokyo calls the Senkaku and Beijing calls the Diaoyu. The Philippines and China have also clashed frequently in the South China Sea around disputed shoals and atolls that fall inside Manila's exclusive economic zone. Nakatani visited military bases in the northern Philippines on Sunday, including a naval station that houses a coastal radar that Japan donated as part of its $4 million security assistance in 2023. Manila was one of the first recipients of Tokyo's official security assistance, a program aimed at helping boost deterrence capabilities of partner countries. In December, the two countries signed a second security deal in which Japan agreed to provide the Philippine navy rigid-hull inflatable boats (RHIB) and additional coastal radar systems.	https://www.voanews.com/a/philippine-japan-ministers-agree-to-further-enhance-defense-partnership/7985663.html	2025-02-23T22:34:10-08:00	
Chinese aerospace executive expelled from Communist Party for graft	BEIJING — A former Chinese aerospace defense executive has been expelled from the ruling Communist Party for corruption, China's anti-graft watchdog said on Monday, part of a sweeping anti-corruption purge across China's military-industrial complex. The former chairman of Aviation Industry Corporation of China, Tan Ruisong, 'lived off the military sector' and took a huge amount in bribes, according to a statement from the Central Commission for Discipline Inspection. The move comes after 14 military delegates were expelled from China's national legislative body in the past two years, as part of a purge of the world's largest military unprecedented in size and scale. These include four generals, eight lieutenant generals and two major generals. At least three more aerospace defense executives have been expelled from China's top political advisory body. Tan 'had lost his ideals and beliefs, betrayed his original aspirations,' 'accepted banquets' in violation of Party regulations, 'engaged in power-for-sex transactions' and used his position to 'seek profits for others in enterprise restructuring and ... contracting engineering projects,' the unusually detailed statement said. His case has been transferred to prosecutors, the statement added. Reuters could not reach Tan for comment. State-owned Aviation Industry Corporation of China did not immediately respond to a request for comment. Tan's case comes three months after a senior Chinese military official, Miao Hua, was put under investigation for 'serious violations of discipline.' Miao had been the People's Liberation Army's leading political officer and sat on the six-person Central Military Commission, the army's top command body headed by President Xi Jinping. China's two previous defense ministers, Li Shangfu and Wei Fenghe, were also expelled from the Communist Party in June for corruption. Li's case in particular was connected to corrupt procurement of military equipment, Reuters reported. Many of those ousted earlier were connected to the PLA Rocket Force - an elite arm of the PLA that oversees its most advanced conventional and nuclear missiles. Analysts say that exposing deep-set graft could take time and potentially slow Xi's long-running military modernization plans.	https://www.voanews.com/a/chinese-aerospace-executive-expelled-from-communist-party-for-graft/7985659.html	2025-02-23T22:10:42-08:00	
No passengers, no planes, no local benefits. Pakistan's newest airport is a bit of a mystery	GWADAR, Pakistan — With no passengers and no planes, Pakistan’s newest and most expensive airport is a bit of a mystery. Entirely financed by China to the tune of $240 million, it's anyone's guess when New Gwadar International Airport will open for business. Located in the coastal city of Gwadar and completed in October 2024, the airport is a stark contrast to the impoverished, restive southwestern Balochistan province around it. For the past decade, China has poured money into Balochistan and Gwadar as part of a multibillion dollar project that connects its western Xinjiang province with the Arabian Sea, called the China-Pakistan Economic Corridor or CPEC. Authorities have hailed it as transformational but there’s scant evidence of change in Gwadar. The city isn’t connected to the national grid — electricity comes from neighboring Iran or solar panels — and there isn't enough clean water. An airport with a 400,000-passenger capacity isn't a priority for the city's 90,000 people. 'This airport is not for Pakistan or Gwadar,' said Azeem Khalid, an international relations expert who specializes in Pakistan-China ties. 'It is for China, so they can have secure access for their citizens to Gwadar and Balochistan.' Caught between insurgency and the military CPEC has catalyzed a decadeslong insurgency in resource-rich and strategically located Balochistan. Separatists, aggrieved by what they say is state exploitation at the expense of locals, are fighting for independence — targeting both Pakistani troops and Chinese workers in the province and elsewhere. Members of Pakistan’s ethnic Baloch minority say they face discrimination by the government and are denied opportunities available elsewhere in the country, charges the government denies. Pakistan, keen to protect China's investments, has stepped up its military footprint in Gwadar to combat dissent. The city is a jumble of checkpoints, barbed wire, troops, barricades, and watchtowers. Roads close at any given time, several days a week, to permit the safe passage of Chinese workers and Pakistani VIPs. Intelligence officers monitor journalists visiting Gwadar. The city's fish market is deemed too sensitive for coverage. Many local residents are frazzled. 'Nobody used to ask where we are going, what we are doing, and what is your name,' said 76-year-old Gwadar native Khuda Bakhsh Hashim. 'We used to enjoy all-night picnics in the mountains or rural areas.' 'We are asked to prove our identity, who we are, where we have come from,' he added. 'We are residents. Those who ask should identify themselves as to who they are.' Hashim recalled memories, warm like the winter sunshine, of when Gwadar was part of Oman, not Pakistan, and was a stop for passenger ships heading to Mumbai. People didn’t go to bed hungry and men found work easily, he said. There was always something to eat and no shortage of drinking water. But Gwadar's water has dried up because of drought and unchecked exploitation. So has the work. The government says CPEC has created some 2,000 local jobs but it’s not clear whom they mean by 'local' — Baloch residents or Pakistanis from elsewhere in the country. Authorities did not elaborate. People in Gwadar see few benefits from China's presence Gwadar is humble but charming, the food excellent and the locals chatty and welcoming with strangers. It gets busy during public holidays, especially the beaches. Still, there is a perception that it's dangerous or difficult to visit — only one commercial route operates out of Gwadar's domestic airport, three times a week to Karachi, Pakistan's largest city, located at the other end of Pakistan's Arabian Sea coastline. There are no direct flights to Balochistan's provincial capital of Quetta, hundreds of miles inland, or the national capital of Islamabad, even further north. A scenic coastal highway has few facilities. Since the Baloch insurgency first erupted five decades ago, thousands have gone missing in the province — anyone who speaks up against exploitation or oppression can be detained, suspected of connections with armed groups, the locals say. People are on edge; activists claim there are forced disappearances and torture, which the government denies. Hashim wants CPEC to succeed so that locals, especially young people, find jobs, hope and purpose. But that hasn't happened. 'When someone has something to eat, then why would he choose to go on the wrong path,' he said. 'It is not a good thing to upset people.' Militant violence declined in Balochistan after a 2014 government counterinsurgency and plateaued toward the end of that decade, according to Pakistan Institute for Conflict and Security Studies. Attacks picked up after 2021 and have climbed steadily since. Militant groups, especially the outlawed Baloch Liberation Army, were emboldened by the Pakistani Taliban ending a ceasefire with the government in November 2022. An inauguration delayed Security concerns delayed the inauguration of the international airport. There were fears the area’s mountains — and their proximity to the airport — could be the ideal launchpad for an attack. Instead, Pakistani Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif and his Chinese counterpart Li Qiang hosted a virtual ceremony. The inaugural flight was off limits to the media and public. Abdul Ghafoor Hoth, district president of the Balochistan Awami Party, said not a single resident of Gwadar was hired to work at the airport, 'not even as a watchman.' 'Forget the other jobs. How many Baloch people are at this port that was built for CPEC,' he asked. In December, Hoth organized daily protests over living conditions in Gwadar. The protests stopped 47 days later, once authorities pledged to meet the locals’ demands, including better access to electricity and water. No progress has been made on implementing those demands since then. Without local labor, goods or services, there can be no trickle-down benefit from CPEC, said international relations expert Khalid. As Chinese money came to Gwadar, so did a heavy-handed security apparatus that created barriers and deepened mistrust. 'The Pakistani government is not willing to give anything to the Baloch people, and the Baloch are not willing to take anything from the government,' said Khalid.	https://www.voanews.com/a/no-passengers-no-planes-no-local-benefits-pakistan-s-newest-airport-is-a-bit-of-a-mystery/7985656.html	2025-02-23T21:17:59-08:00	
Ahead of UN action on Ukraine, US urges countries to vote no on rival European resolution	UNITED NATIONS — The United States is urging the United Nations General Assembly to back its resolution to mark the third anniversary of Russia's invasion of Ukraine on Monday, oppose any amendments and vote no on a rival text drafted by Ukraine and European allies. In a diplomatic note sent on Sunday and reviewed by Reuters, the United States described its brief resolution as 'a forward-looking resolution focused on one simple idea: ending the war.' 'Through this resolution, Member States can build real momentum towards international peace and security, the maintenance of which is the principal purpose of the United Nations,' it said, asking countries to 'vote no on any other resolution or amendments presented' during Monday's meeting. The U.S. draft resolution, put forward on Friday, pits it against Ukraine and the European Union, which have for the past month been negotiating with U.N. member states on their own resolution on the war in Ukraine, which repeats the U.N. demand that Russia withdraw its troops and halt hostilities. The 193-member U.N. General Assembly has overwhelmingly repeatedly backed Ukraine's sovereignty and territorial integrity within its internationally recognized borders since the war began. The U.S. draft makes no reference to that. The U.S. text mourns the loss of life during the 'Russia-Ukraine conflict,' reiterates that the U.N.'s main purpose is to maintain international peace and security and peacefully settle disputes. It 'implores a swift end to the conflict and further urges a lasting peace between Ukraine and Russia.' Proposed amendments The 15-member Security Council is also set to vote on the same U.S. text later on Monday, diplomats said. A council resolution needs at least nine votes in favor and no vetoes by the U.S., Russia, China, Britain or France to be adopted. The U.S. push for U.N. action comes after President Donald Trump launched a bid to broker an end to the war, sparking a rift with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy and raising concerns among European allies that they could be cut out of peace talks. U.S. and Russian officials met on Tuesday. The General Assembly is set to vote on several proposed amendments to the U.S. draft resolution. Russia has proposed amending the U.S. draft to reference addressing the 'root causes' of the war. Russia called its 2022 invasion a 'special military operation' designed to 'denazify' Ukraine and halt an expansion of NATO. Britain and 24 European Union states have also proposed amendments to the U.S. draft in the General Assembly. They want to describe the conflict as 'the full-scale invasion of Ukraine by the Russian Federation,' back Ukraine's sovereignty and territorial integrity and implore 'just, lasting and comprehensive peace' in line with the U.N. Charter and principles of sovereign equality and territorial integrity. General Assembly resolutions are not binding but carry political weight, reflecting a global view on the war. No country holds a veto in the assembly.	https://www.voanews.com/a/ahead-of-un-action-on-ukraine-us-urges-countries-to-vote-no-on-rival-european-resolution/7985650.html	2025-02-23T20:29:16-08:00	
Trump says Dan Bongino to be FBI deputy director	WASHINGTON — President Donald Trump said in a post on social media Sunday that Dan Bongino, a conservative talk show host, will be deputy director of the FBI. Bongino will join Kash Patel, who was recently confirmed by the Senate as director of the FBI. Trump said Bongino was named to the role by Patel. The position does not require Senate confirmation. 'Great news for Law Enforcement and American Justice!' Trump posted on his social media network, Truth Social, calling Bongino 'a man of incredible love and passion for our Country.' Bongino was previously a New York City police officer, and a member of the U.S. Secret Service. He most recently had been known as a conservative radio host and podcaster. Trump said in his post that Bongino is 'prepared to give up' his program as he steps into the new role. 'The Dan Bongino Show' was most recently the 56th-ranked podcast in the United States, according to Spotify.	https://www.voanews.com/a/trump-says-dan-bongino-to-be-fbi-deputy-director/7985643.html	2025-02-23T19:56:59-08:00	
What happens to the leadership of the Catholic Church when a pope becomes sick or incapacitated?	VATICAN CITY — While the Vatican has detailed laws and rituals to ensure the transfer of power when a pope dies or resigns, they do not apply if he is sick or even unconscious. And there are no specific norms outlining what happens to the leadership of the Catholic Church if a pope becomes totally incapacitated. As a result, even though Pope Francis remains hospitalized in critical condition with a complex lung infection, he is still pope and very much in charge. Still, Francis' hospital stay is raising obvious questions about what happens if he loses consciousness for a prolonged period, or whether he might follow in Pope Benedict XVI's footsteps and resign if he becomes unable to lead. On Monday, Francis' hospital stay will hit the 10-day mark, equaling the length of his 2021 hospital stay for surgery to remove 33 centimeters (13 inches) of his colon. His age and prolonged illness have revived interest about how papal power is exercised in the Holy See, how it is transferred and under what circumstances. And it points to the legislative loophole that currently exists in what to do if a pope gets so sick that he can't govern. The Vatican Curia Francis may be in charge, but he already delegates the day-to-day running of the Vatican and church to a team of officials who operate whether he is in the Apostolic Palace or not, and whether he is conscious or not. Chief among them is the secretary of state, Cardinal Pietro Parolin. Other Vatican functions are proceeding normally, including the Vatican's 2025 Holy Year celebrations. What happens when a pope gets sick? Canon law does have provisions for when a bishop gets sick and can't run his diocese, but none for a pope. Canon 412 says a diocese can be declared 'impeded' if its bishop — due to 'captivity, banishment, exile, or incapacity' — cannot fulfil his pastoral functions. In such cases, the day-to-day running of the diocese shifts to an auxiliary bishop, a vicar general or someone else. Even though Francis is the bishop of Rome, no explicit provision exists for the pope if he similarly becomes 'impeded.' Canon 335 declares simply that when the Holy See is 'vacant or entirely impeded,' nothing can be altered in the governance of the church. But it doesn't say what it means for the Holy See to be 'entirely impeded' or what provisions might come into play if it ever were. In 2021, a team of canon lawyers set out to propose norms to fill that legislative gap. They created a canonical crowd-sourcing initiative to craft a new church law regulating the office of a retired pope as well as norms to apply when a pope is unable to govern, either temporarily or permanently. The proposed norms explain that, with medical advancements, it's entirely likely that at some point a pope will be alive but unable to govern. It argues that the church must provide for the declaration of a 'totally impeded see' and the transfer of power for the sake of its own unity. Under the proposed norms, the governance of the universal church would pass to the College of Cardinals. In the case of a temporary impediment, they would name a commission to govern, with periodical medical checks every six months to determine the status of the pope. 'At first, the promoting group was accused of imprudently choosing topics that were too sensitive and controversial,' said one of the coordinators, canon lawyer Geraldina Boni. But then, 'a widespread consensus formed,' she told The Associated Press. Even Francis' own canon lawyer, Cardinal Gianfranco Ghirlanda, acknowledged some sort of norms were necessary if the pope 'incurably, then irreversibly, lost consciousness or otherwise the ability to perform human acts.' 'The problem is, who declares that the pope is in a situation where he cannot govern?' he told Italian daily Il Giornale in 2022. Ghirlanda largely backed the crowd-sourcing initiative's idea, proposing a committee of medical experts to determine if the pope's condition is irreversible. If they confirm it is, the Rome-based cardinals would be summoned to declare the pope cannot govern, triggering a conclave. What about the letters? Francis confirmed in 2022 that shortly after he was elected pope, he wrote a letter of resignation, to be invoked if he became medically incapacitated. He said he gave it to the then-secretary of state, Cardinal Tarcisio Bertone, and said he assumed Bertone had delivered it to Parolin's office when he retired. The text is not public, and the conditions Francis contemplated for a resignation are unknown. It is also not known if such a letter would be canonically valid. Canon law requires a papal resignation to be 'freely and properly manifested' — as was the case when Benedict announced his resignation in 2013. In 1965, Pope Paul VI wrote letters to the dean of the College of Cardinals hypothesizing that if he were to become seriously ill, the dean and other cardinals should accept his resignation. The letter was never invoked, since Paul lived another 13 years and died on the job. What happens when a pope dies or resigns? The only time papal power changes hands is when a pope dies or resigns. At that time, a whole series of rites and rituals comes into play governing the 'interregnum' — the period between the end of one pontificate and the election of a new pope. During that period, known as the 'sede vacante,' or 'empty See,' the camerlengo, or chamberlain, runs the administration and finances of the Holy See. He certifies the pope's death, seals the papal apartments and prepares for the pope's burial before a conclave to elect a new pope. The position is currently held by Cardinal Kevin Farrell, the head of the Vatican's laity office. The camerlengo has no role or duties if the pope is merely sick or otherwise incapacitated. Likewise, the dean of the College of Cardinals, who would preside at a papal funeral and organize the conclave, has no additional role if the pope is merely sick. That position is currently held by Italian Cardinal Giovanni Battista Re, 91. Earlier this month, Francis decided to keep Re on the job even after his five-year term expired, rather than make way for someone new. He also extended the term of the vice-dean, Argentine Cardinal Leonardo Sandri, 81.	https://www.voanews.com/a/what-happens-to-the-leadership-of-the-catholic-church-when-a-pope-becomes-sick-or-incapacitated-/7985642.html	2025-02-23T19:41:26-08:00	
The 31st SAG Awards get underway with a win for Kieran Culkin	The 31st Screen Actors Guild Awards kicked off Sunday night with host Kristen Bell paying tribute to Los Angeles firefighters and another supporting actor win for 'A Real Pain' co-star Kieran Culkin. Bell introduced the ceremony, streaming live on Netflix from the Shrine Auditorium in Los Angeles, as an ode to both the aspirational spirit of actors who come to Los Angeles to make it, and to the city, itself. The SAG Awards unfolded against the backdrop of the devastating wildfires that began in early January. Those fires forced the guild to cancel its in-person nominations announcement and launched a disaster relief fund for SAG-AFTRA members affected. Before singing 'Do You Want to Be an Actor?' to tune of 'Do You Want to Build a Snowman?' from 'Frozen,' Bell introduced attending firefighters as 'the most attractive tables' among a sea of stars. 'First it was COVID then it was the strikes then it was the devastating wildfires,' actor Courtney B. Vance, president of the SAG-AFTRA charitable foundation told attendees ahead of the show. 'Thousands have lost their homes including our own members and their families.' The night's first televised award went to Culkin, who has won just about every award in the category. Gripping the SAG trophy, he could quickly tell the difference. 'It is funny that the heaviest of all awards is given by actors,' said Culkin, who characteristically riffed his way through a rambling acceptance speech before swearing sincerity: 'Believe it or not, this actually means a lot to me.' The SAG Awards should offer the final clue in an unusually unpredictable Oscar race. The other major awards — including the BAFTAs, the Producers Guild Awards, the Directors Guild Awards and the Golden Globes — have all had their say. But actors make up the largest piece of the film academy pie, so their picks often correspond strongly with Academy Award winners. After wins from the PGA and the DGA — and last night, the Independent Spirit Awards — Sean Baker's 'Anora' is seen as the favorite to win best picture in a week's time at the Oscars. But Edward Berger's 'Conclave' won last weekend at the BAFTAs, the latest wrench in an award season full of them. That's included the unlikely rise and precipitous fall of another top contender, 'Emilia Pérez.' The awards are being streamed lived by Netflix, which distributed 'Emilia Pérez,' for the second time. 'Wicked' comes in the leading film nominee, with five nods, while 'Shōgun' heads the TV categories. It took early awards for Hiroyuki Sanada, Anna Sawai and for best stunt ensemble. The corresponding award for film went to the stunt performer ode 'The Fall Guy.' The best actor and best actress categories should be nail biters. While Brody ('The Brutalist') has won a string of awards, Chalamet ('A Complete Unknown') and Ralph Fiennes ('Conclave') could easily pull off the upset. Best actress could go to either Moore ('The Substance') or Madison ('Anora'). In addition to the competitive categories, Jane Fonda will be given the SAG Life Achievement Award.	https://www.voanews.com/a/the-31st-sag-awards-get-underway-with-a-win-for-kieran-culkin/7985630.html	2025-02-23T19:12:14-08:00	
Report: In record year of internet shutdowns, Myanmar leads	Bangkok — In a record year for internet shutdowns, countries in the Asia-Pacific region imposed the most restrictions, according to a new report. Myanmar is the worst-affected country worldwide, with 85 shutdowns last year, research by the digital rights group Access Now found. Its report, released Monday, Feb. 24, shows authorities worldwide imposed at least 296 shutdowns in 54 countries. Conflict — followed by protests, school or university exams and elections — was the biggest trigger, Access Now found. For the Asia-Pacific region, the report finds 202 shutdowns in 11 countries or territories. It is the highest number ever recorded by Access Now in a single year for the region. The three countries with the worst record are all in Asia: 190 cases in Myanmar, India and Pakistan accounted for around 64% of all recorded shutdowns in 2024. India, often referred to as the biggest democracy in the world, had 84 recorded cases. VOA contacted Myanmar’s military administration, and the Washington embassies for India and Pakistan for comment. As of publication, VOA had not received a reply. Raman Jit Singh Chima, the Asia Pacific policy director at Access Now, warned of a rise of digital authoritarianism in Asia. 'Shutdowns destabilize societies, undermine digital progress, put entire communities at risk, and provide a cloak of impunity for human rights abuses,' he said in a statement. 'Authorities from Myanmar to Pakistan are isolating people from the rest of the world with impunity, reflecting the rising digital authoritarianism in Asia.' Access Now collects data on shutdowns, which include cables being cut, equipment confiscated, platforms being blocked, and orders to telecommunication companies. 'Rebirth' of radio Since seizing power in a coup in February 2021, the junta in Myanmar has regularly blocked access to the internet. The junta says the blocks are to maintain 'stability' and prevent what it calls the spread of disinformation and fake news. At the same time, the junta has jailed dozens of journalists and revoked media licenses. Out of the 85 shutdowns imposed in Myanmar last year, 31 coincided with documented human rights abuses and at least 17 correlated with airstrikes on civilians, the Access Now report found. The record puts the country among the worst for digital rights for the fourth consecutive year, the report found. Toe Zaw Latt, a veteran journalist from Myanmar, told VOA it was 'no surprise' that the country tops the list. 'Myanmar has one of the worst censorship [records] on digital platforms,' he said. '[The military does this] so most of the people can’t access independent information or internet mainly, especially young people. They just want one version of truth, the army’s version of truth.' Zaw Latt said the junta is trying to prevent 'independent access of information on the internet.' A journalist for decades, Zaw Latt is also secretary of the Independent Press Council Myanmar. He said the internet blocks have seen a 'rebirth' in radio. 'Globally, radio is dying but it’s having a rebirth in Burma because it’s cheap and accessible,' he said, using the country’s former name. 'Even some people go back, very primitive, back to print because of these internet shutdowns.' Still, Zaw Latt said, it is not possible to completely cut off the internet, 'because people will find a way.' Alongside shutdowns the junta has passed laws to further control the information narrative. On Jan. 1, a cybersecurity law was enacted in Myanmar, banning the use of Virtual Private Networks, or VPNs, that people use to access blocked or censored content. The law penalizes those who share information from banned websites. Experts say it’s another attempt from the junta to suppress public information. Two other Asian countries — Malaysia and Thailand — also made the list for the Southeast Asia region for the first time. Thailand was included after it shut electricity and internet connections on its border with Myanmar following an attempt to crack down on scam centers that have lured thousands into forced labor and scammed billions from internet users worldwide. Overall, press freedom in East Asia continues to see a decline, according to Reporters without Borders. The global watchdog reports that 26 out of 31 countries in the Asia-Pacific region have seen a decline in press freedoms between 2023 and 2024.	https://www.voanews.com/a/report-in-record-year-of-internet-shutdowns-myanmar-leads/7985585.html	2025-02-23T18:02:32-08:00	
Spain smashes sex trafficking gang that exploited more than 1,000 women	MADRID — Spanish police have smashed a human trafficking ring that lured more than 1,000 women to the country over the past year with false job offers before forcing them into sex work, police said Sunday. The women, who were mainly from Venezuela and Colombia, were told they would be working in the beauty or cleaning sectors, Spain's National Police said in a statement. 'On arrival in Spain they were transferred to clubs where they were sexually exploited and forced to work all hours,' police said. The women were only allowed out for two hours per day and were kept under video surveillance. Three alleged ring leaders — two Colombian women and a Spaniard — were among 48 suspects arrested in raids in Alicante and Murcia, in southeastern Spain, and three strip clubs were closed as part of the operation. Police also seized more than $157,000 in cash, blocked bank accounts containing $980,960 and seized 17 properties. Six of the suspects were held in pre-trial detention, police said. The others were released on bail to face trial at a later date.	https://www.voanews.com/a/spain-smashes-sex-trafficking-gang-that-exploited-more-than-1-000-women/7985605.html	2025-02-23T17:30:25-08:00	
Kamala Harris receives prestigious Chairman's prize at NAACP Image Awards	Los Angeles — Former Vice President Kamala Harris stepped on the NAACP Image Awards stage Saturday night with a sobering message, calling the civil rights organization a pillar of the Black community and urging people to stay resilient and hold onto their faith during the tenure of President Donald Trump. 'While we have no illusions about what we are up against in this chapter in our American story, this chapter will be written not simply by whoever occupies the oval office nor by the wealthiest among us,' Harris said after receiving the NAACP's Chairman's Award. 'The American story will be written by you. Written by us. By we the people.' The 56th annual Image Awards was held at the Pasadena Civic Auditorium in the Los Angeles area. Harris, defeated by Trump in last year's presidential election, was the first woman and the first person of color to serve as vice president. She had previously been a U.S. senator from California and the state's attorney general. In her first major public appearance since leaving office, Harris did not reference her election loss or Trump's actions since entering the Oval Office, although Trump mocked her earlier in the day at the Conservative Political Action Conference. Harris spoke about eternal vigilance, the price of liberty, staying alert, seeking the truth and America's future. 'Some see the flames on our horizons, the rising waters in our cities, the shadows gathering over our democracy and ask 'What do we do now?'' Harris said. 'But we know exactly what to do, because we have done it before. And we will do it again. We use our power. We organize, mobilize. We educate. We advocate. Our power has never come from having an easy path.' Other winners of the Chairman's prize have included former President Barack Obama, the late Rep. John Lewis and the late actor Ruby Dee. NAACP Hall of Fame Harris was honored during the ceremony along with the Wayans family. The family was inducted into the NAACP Image Awards Hall of Fame in recognition of pioneering contributions to film, TV, sketch and stand-up comedy that have shaped Hollywood for decades. Keenen Ivory Wayans, Damon Wayans Sr., Marlon Wayans, Shawn Wayans, Kim Wayans and Damon Wayans Jr. each were recognized. Marlon Wayans, whose guest appearance on Peacock's 'Bel-Air' was up for an NAACP award, shared how Keenen Ivory Wayans sparked the family's rise. 'He raised us all like Jedis,' he said. 'We wouldn't be here if it wasn't for our big brother.' Marlon Wayans joked that when his brother told their mom he was leaving college for comedy, she said, 'Boy, I've known you your whole life, and you ain't never said nothing funny. That's the funniest thing you've said.' The crowd erupted in laughter, a fitting tribute to a family that has kept audiences laughing for more than three decades. The family has a long list of credits. Keenen Ivory Wayans created the sketch comedy series 'In Living Color' in 1990 and directed the 2000 slasher spoof 'Scary Movie,' which was written by Marlon Wayans and Shawn Wayans, who also wrote and starred in 'White Chicks' in 2004. Damon Wayan's had a starring role in the 1995 comedy 'Major Payne,' and currently co-stars with son Damon Wayans Jr. in the CBS sitcom 'Poppa's House,' which was nominated for an NAACP Award. The pair also were nominated for their acting on the show. Damon Wayans Jr. has acted in two of the most critically acclaimed comedies in recent years: 'Happy Endings' and 'New Girl.' Kim Wayans, a comedian, actor and director, also received praise for her work in the 2011 drama 'Pariah.' Entertainer of the year Keke Palmer expressed her surprise after her name was called as winner of the coveted entertainment of the year. 'Oh my gosh. Guys, I didn't think I was going to win,' said Palmer, who paid homage to fellow nominee Cynthia Erivo's Oscar-nominated performance in 'Wicked.' Palmer starred in the buddy comedy 'One of Them Days,' which debuted No. 1 at the box office last month. She also won an Emmy for her hosting efforts on NBC's 'Password.' 'It's such an amazing category to be in with all these people,' Palmer said. 'It's a beautiful night. It's Black History Month, y'all. It's so important we all come here together and celebrate one another with one another.' Other nominees included Kendrick Lamar, Kevin Hart and Shannon Sharpe. Awards recognize LA residents impacted by wildfires Image Awards host Deon Cole honored residents of the nearby Altadena neighborhood who were affected by January's devastating Los Angeles-area wildfires. A video of the fire devastation played before actor Morris Chestnut took the stage. 'Homes were lost, stores destroyed, countless lives shattered and over two dozen souls gone forever,' said Chestnut, a Los Angeles native who referenced impacted areas such as Altadena, the Pacific Palisades and Malibu. 'But what was not lost is the spirit of our community,' said Chestnut, who noted 22 Altadena residents attended the show on Saturday. Many in the audience stood and applauded. Cole shifted tone and brightened the mood with a comedic prayer for Kanye West's wife to find more clothes after her barely-there Grammys look and for Shannon Sharpe to finally size up his T-shirts. The opening act was a lead-up to the evening's first award: Queen Latifah as best actress in a drama series for her role in 'The Equalizer.' Chappelle honored Dave Chappelle was honored with the President's Award for his 'thought-provoking humor.' Accepting the award, Chappelle talked about the NAACP's push against negative portrayals of Black people in media and the importance of representation. 'Every opportunity we get, we just keep chipping away at this monster of a machine,' he said. Past recipients of the President's Award include Jay-Z, Lauryn Hill, Usher, Rihanna and John Legend.	https://www.voanews.com/a/kamala-harris-receives-prestigious-chairman-s-prize-at-naacp-image-awards/7985604.html	2025-02-23T17:04:18-08:00	
California governor asks Congress for nearly $40 billion for Los Angeles wildfire relief	Sacramento, California — California Gov. Gavin Newsom has asked Congress to approve nearly $40 billion in aid to help the Los Angeles area recover from January's devastating wildfires, which he said could become the costliest natural disaster in U.S. history. Newsom sent a letter Friday asking for support from lawmakers including House Speaker Mike Johnson and Rep. Tom Cole, the House Appropriations Committee chair. 'Los Angeles is one of the most economically productive places on the globe, but it can only rebound and flourish with support from the federal government as it recovers from this unprecedented disaster,' Newsom wrote. The total economic losses from the firestorm have been estimated to surpass $250 billion — with real estate losses from the Palisades and Eaton fires predicted to potentially top $30 billion, according to a Los Angeles Times analysis. More than 16,200 structures were destroyed as flames ripped through Pacific Palisades, Malibu, Pasadena and Altadena. Newsom vowed that the funding would be used to rebuild homes, infrastructure, businesses, schools, churches and health care facilities, while supporting the needs of people affected by the devastation. 'Make no mistake, Los Angeles will use this money wisely,' Newsom wrote. His largest request is for an additional $16.8 billion from the Federal Emergency Management Agency, mostly intended for the rebuilding of property and infrastructure, with $5 billion earmarked for debris cleanup. Newsom also asked for $9.9 billion from the Department of Housing and Urban Development for grants to fire victims, homeowners, businesses and renters, as well as $5.29 billion from the Small Business Administration for homeowner and business loans. Newsom thanked President Donald Trump for support for fast-tracking debris removal. The letter did not mention recent threats by the Trump administration that federal aid could come with strings attached. 'We are eternally grateful,' Newsom said. Trump has been a frequent critic of Newsom and California's water policies. Ric Grenell, a Trump ally serving as his envoy for special missions, said Friday that 'there will be conditions' to any federal aid for the state. He said one of the possible conditions being discussed was defunding the California Coastal Commission, which regulates coastal development and protects public beach access. Trump has criticized the agency as overly restrictive, bureaucratic and a hindrance to timely rebuilding efforts.	https://www.voanews.com/a/california-governor-asks-congress-for-nearly-40-billion-for-los-angeles-wildfire-relief/7985599.html	2025-02-23T16:51:00-08:00	
Australia fines Telegram for delay in answering child abuse, terror questions	Sydney — Australia's online safety regulator fined messaging platform Telegram about $640,000 on Monday for its delay in answering questions about measures the app took to prevent the spread of child abuse and violent extremist material. The eSafety Commission in March 2024 sought responses from social media platforms YouTube, X and Facebook to Telegram and Reddit, and blamed them for not doing enough to stop extremists from using live-streaming features, algorithms and recommendation systems to recruit users. Telegram and Reddit were asked about the steps they were taking to combat child sexual abuse material on their services. They had to respond by May, but Telegram submitted its response in October. 'Timely transparency is not a voluntary requirement in Australia and this action reinforces the importance of all companies complying with Australian law,' eSafety Commissioner Julie Inman Grant said in a statement. Telegram's delay in providing information obstructed eSafety from implementing its online safety measures, Grant said. Telegram said it had fully responded to all eSafety's questions last year, with no outstanding issues. 'The unfair and disproportionate penalty concerns only the response time frame, and we intend to appeal,' the company said in an email. Australia's spy agency in December said one in five priority counterterrorism cases investigated involved youths. The messaging platform has been under growing scrutiny around the world since its founder Pavel Durov was placed under formal investigation in France in August in connection with alleged use of the app for illegal activities. Durov, who is out on bail, has denied the allegations. Grant said Big Tech must be transparent and put in place measures to prevent their services from being misused as the threat posed by online extremist materials poses a growing risk. 'If we want accountability from the tech industry we need much greater transparency. These powers give us a look under the hood at just how these platforms are dealing, or not dealing, with a range of serious and egregious online harms which affect Australians,' Grant said. If Telegram chooses to ignore the penalty notice, eSafety would seek a civil penalty in court, Grant said.	https://www.voanews.com/a/australia-fines-telegram-for-delay-in-answering-child-abuse-terror-questions/7985591.html	2025-02-23T16:38:08-08:00	
Sudan's military touts field advances, breaks RSF siege of crucial city	Cairo — Sudan’s military on Sunday broke a more than year-long siege on the crucial city of Obeid, restoring access to a strategic area in the south-central region and strengthening crucial supply routes in its nearly two years of war against a notorious paramilitary group, officials said. The military also kicked the Rapid Support Forces from its last stronghold in the White Nile province in another setback to the notorious group, military spokesperson Brig. Gen. Nabil Abdullah said in a statement. Sudan was plunged into chaos in April last year when simmering tensions between the military and the RSF exploded into open warfare across the country. The fighting, which wrecked the capital, Khartoum, and other urban areas has been marked by atrocities including mass rape and ethnically motivated killings that amount to war crimes and crimes against humanity, especially in the western region of Darfur, according to the United Nations and international rights groups. Abdullah, the spokesperson, said military troops in the al-Sayyad axis managed to reopen the road to the city of Obeid and break the RSF siege on the city which serves as the provincial capital of North Kordofan province. The city hosts a sprawling airbase and the military’s 5th Infantry Division known as Haganah. A commercial and transportation hub, Obeid is located on a railway linking Khartoum to Nyala, the provincial capital of South Darfur province. It was besieged by the RSF since the onset of the ongoing conflict in April 2023. Finance Minister Jibril Ibrahim hailed the military’s advances in Obeid as a 'massive step' to lift the RSF siege on Al-Fasher, the capital of North Darfur province, as well as delivering humanitarian aid to the Kordofan area. Sunday’s RSF defeats were the latest in a series of setbacks for the notorious group that started in September when the military launched an offensive aimed at recapturing the Great Khartoum area — Khartoum and its two sister cities of Omdurman and Khartoum North, or Bahri. The military has since captured strategic areas including its own main headquarters and is now close to recapturing the Republican Palace which RSF fighters stormed in the first hours of the war trying to kill military chief Gen. Abdel-Fattah Burhan. The RSF has also suffered multiple battlefield setbacks elsewhere in the country. It lost control of the city of Wad Medani, the capital of Gezira province, and other areas in the province. The military also regained control of the country’s largest oil refinery. The developments on the ground have given the military the upper hand in the war, which is approaching its 2-year mark with no peaceful settlement on the horizon. International mediation attempts and pressure tactics, including a U.S. assessment that the RSF and its proxies are committing genocide, have not halted the conflict. The RSF and its allies meanwhile signed a charter that paved the way for the establishment of a parallel government to challenge the military-backed administration. The move has raised concerns about a potential split of the country. Cholera spreading to another city Cholera has spread to Rabak, the provincial capital of White Nile province, according to health authorities in the province. The disease first hit Kosti, another White Nile city, before reaching Rabak, the health ministry said. A total of 68 people died from cholera in the two cities between Thursday and Sunday, according to the health ministry. More than 1,860 others were diagnosed with the disease, it said. An anti-cholera vaccination campaign in Kosti and Rabak reached 67% of its targeted people in the last two days, according to the ministry. The outbreak was blamed mainly on contaminated drinking water after Kosti’s water supply facility was knocked out during an attack by the RSF, the health ministry said. The facility was later fixed as part of the government's efforts to fight the disease. Cholera is a highly contagious disease that causes diarrhea leading to severe dehydration and can be fatal if not immediately treated, according to the World Health Organization. It’s transmitted through the ingestion of contaminated food or water. Cholera outbreaks are not uncommon in Sudan. The disease killed more than 600 and sickened over 21,000 others in Sudan between July and October last year, mostly in the country’s eastern areas where millions of people displaced by the conflict were located.	https://www.voanews.com/a/sudan-military-touts-field-advances-breaks-rsf-siege-of-crucial-city/7985349.html	2025-02-23T15:48:46-08:00	
Trump administration fires 2,000 USAID workers, puts thousands of others on leave	Washington — The Trump administration said Sunday that it was placing all but a fraction of staffers at the U.S. Agency for International Development on leave worldwide and eliminating 2,000 U.S.-based staff positions. The move was the latest and one of the biggest steps yet toward what President Donald Trump and cost-cutting ally Elon Musk say is their goal of gutting the six-decade-old aid and development agency in a broader campaign to slash the size of the federal government. The move comes after a federal judge on Friday allowed the administration to move forward with its plan to pull thousands of USAID staffers off the job in the United States and around the world. U.S. District Judge Carl Nichols rejected pleas in a lawsuit from employees to keep temporarily blocking the government's plan. 'As of 11:59 p.m. EST on Sunday, February 23, 2025, all USAID direct hire personnel, with the exception of designated personnel responsible for mission-critical functions, core leadership and/or specially designated programs, will be placed on administrative leave globally,' according to the notices sent to USAID workers that were viewed by The Associated Press. At the same time, the agency said it was beginning a reduction in force that would eliminate 2,000 U.S.-based staffers. That means many of the Washington-based staffers who are being placed on leave would soon have their positions eliminated. The Trump appointee running USAID, deputy administrator Pete Marocco, has indicated he plans to keep about 600 mostly U.S.-based staffers on the job in the meantime, in part to arrange travel for USAID staffers and families abroad. USAID and the State Department did not immediately respond to messages seeking comment. The move escalates a monthlong push to dismantle the agency, which has included closing its headquarters in Washington and shutting down thousands of aid and development programs worldwide following an effort to freeze all foreign assistance. Trump and Musk contend that USAID's work is wasteful and furthers a liberal agenda. Lawsuits by government workers' unions, USAID contractors and others say the administration lacks the constitutional authority to eliminate an independent agency or congressionally funded programs without lawmakers' approval. The Trump administration efforts upend decades of U.S. policy that aid and development work overseas serves national security by stabilizing regions and economies and building alliances, a critical tool of U.S. 'soft power' for winning influence abroad. The notices of firings and leaves come on top of hundreds of USAID contractors receiving no-name form letters of termination in the past week, according to copies that AP viewed. The blanket nature of the notification letters to USAID contractors, excluding the names or positions of those receiving them, could make it difficult for the dismissed workers to get unemployment benefits, workers noted. A different judge in a second lawsuit tied to USAID has temporarily blocked the foreign funding freeze and said this past week that the administration had kept withholding the aid despite his court order and must at least temporarily restore the funding to programs worldwide.	https://www.voanews.com/a/trump-administration-firing-2-000-usaid-workers-putting-thousands-of-others-on-leave/7985347.html	2025-02-23T15:37:57-08:00	
Some US agencies tell workers not to reply to Musk's 'accomplishments email'	Washington — Multiple U.S. federal agencies told employees not to respond immediately to a demand by President Donald Trump's adviser Elon Musk to list their accomplishments in the last week or be fired, as a chaotic campaign to cull the bureaucracy pushes forward. Trump administration-appointed officials at the FBI and State Department sent their staff emails telling them not to respond outside their chains of command, in a possible sign of tension between members of the Republican administration and the world's richest person in his campaign to cut down the government's 2.3 million-member civilian workforce. 'The FBI, through the office of the director, is in charge of all our review processes,' said FBI Director Kash Patel, a Trump appointee, in an email to staff seen by Reuters. Musk leads the so-called Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE), which in the first weeks of Trump's administration has laid off more than 20,000 workers and offered buyouts to another 75,000, across wide swaths of the government from the Defense Department — long a top Republican priority — to the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, where all staff have been ordered to halt work. The frantic pace has led the federal government in some cases to rush to rehire workers who perform critical functions like securing the nation's nuclear arsenal and trying to fight the worsening bird flu outbreak, which has caused egg prices to spike higher. While there is bipartisan agreement that the U.S. government, which carries $36 trillion in debt, would benefit from reform, Musk's tumultuous approach has drawn widespread criticism, including from voters in some Republican areas. Federal workers Saturday evening received an email instructing them to detail the work they did during the previous week by 11:59 p.m. ET on Monday (0459 GMT Tuesday), shortly after Musk posted on his X social media site that failing to respond would be taken as a resignation. The subject of the email read, 'What did you do last week?' and came from a human resources address in the Office of Personnel Management, but did not include Musk's threat of termination. Workers at the departments of Defense, Homeland Security, Education and Commerce, as well as at the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation, the National Institutes of Health and the Internal Revenue Service also were told not to respond, pending further guidance, according to sources and emails reviewed by Reuters. 'To be clear — this is irregular, unexpected, and warrants further validation,' a senior executive at the National Centers for Environmental Information, an agency that manages environmental data and is part of the Commerce Department, wrote. Some officials welcomed the move. Ed Martin, Trump's nominee for U.S. Attorney in Washington, D.C., who is serving in an interim capacity, praised Musk and DOGE in an email response. But other offices within the Justice Department, including the executive office that supports all U.S. attorneys and the department's civil division, told employees not to reply, pending additional information. Employees at the Drug Enforcement Administration, part of the Justice Department, were told to respond, according to an email seen by Reuters. Union questions Musk's authority The largest federal workers' union, the American Federation of Government Employees, wrote on X on Sunday that it did not believe Musk had the authority to fire employees who did not respond and would formally request that OPM rescind the message. Meanwhile, the union advised members to ask their supervisors directly whether to reply and to follow their guidance. The email left some employees even more frustrated and worried after weeks of uncertainty about their futures. 'I really wonder when someone is going to say enough,' one IRS employee told Reuters. Media offices at the Commerce, Justice, Education and Treasury departments, as well as at the FDIC and NIH, did not immediately respond to requests for comment. An FBI spokesperson declined to comment, and a State Department spokesperson referred questions to the White House. Musk on X on Sunday called the email 'a very basic pulse check.' Senator John Curtis, a Republican from Utah, said he supports the Trump administration's efforts to reduce government spending, but that Musk should take a more humane approach. 'If I could say one thing to Elon Musk, it's please put a dose of compassion in this,' Curtis said on CBS News' 'Face the Nation.' 'These are real people. These are real lives. These are mortgages. It's a false narrative to say we have to cut, and you have to be cruel to do it as well.' Some federal judiciary employees, including judges, also received the Saturday email from OPM, even though the court system is not part of the executive branch, the Administrative Office of the U.S. Courts confirmed. The judiciary advised employees that no action should be taken in response to the message, according to an email reviewed by Reuters. In some cases, employees were left unsure how to respond even if they chose to do so. Some lawyers, for instance, expressed concern that their work is confidential. Workers at the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau also received the email, according to people with knowledge of the matter, even though they were all ordered to cease working since early this month, leaving them with little to do.	https://www.voanews.com/a/some-us-agencies-tell-workers-not-to-reply-to-musk-s-accomplishments-email-/7985346.html	2025-02-23T15:24:28-08:00	
Syria's new president invited to emergency Arab League summit in Egypt	Cairo — Syria's new President Ahmed al-Sharaa has received an invitation from Egyptian counterpart Abdel Fattah el-Sissi to attend an emergency Arab League summit in Cairo on March 4, the Syrian presidency said Sunday in a statement, marking a major step in rebuilding ties with the Arab world after the downfall of Bashar al-Assad. Sharaa, whose Hayat Tahrir al-Sham (HTS) group spearheaded the offensive that toppled autocratic leader Assad in December, was declared president for a transitional phase last month. Since assuming power, Sharaa has sought to strengthen ties with Arab nations, pledging a political transition that includes the formation of an inclusive government and eventual elections, which he has said could take up to four years to organize. Egypt, which views Islamists as an existential threat, has treaded with caution after Sharaa took office, with officials saying Syria's new administration needed to adopt an inclusive political transition free from 'external interventions.' While Sissi congratulated Sharaa upon his appointment, their first face-to-face meeting is expected to take place during the Arab League summit. The upcoming Cairo summit is set to focus primarily on Arab efforts to counter U.S. President Donald Trump's plan to redevelop war-torn Gaza into an international beach resort and his calls for Egypt and Jordan to resettle displaced Palestinians from Gaza.	https://www.voanews.com/a/syria-new-president-invited-to-emergency-arab-league-summit-in-egypt/7985325.html	2025-02-23T13:53:03-08:00

Hegseth defends Trump's firings of Pentagon leaders, says more may be to come	Washington — Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth insists President Donald Trump 's abrupt firing of the nation's senior military officer amid a wave of dismissals at the Pentagon wasn't unusual and he suggested more firings could come. 'Nothing about this is unprecedented,' Hegseth told 'Fox News Sunday' about Air Force Gen. CQ Brown Jr. being removed Friday night as chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff. 'The president deserves to pick his key national security advisory team.' Hegseth said 'there are lots of presidents who made changes' citing former commanders in chief, including Franklin D. Roosevelt, George H.W. Bush and Barack Obama. Obama, Hegseth said, 'fired or dismissed hundreds' of military officials. Months into his first term, Obama removed Army Gen. David McKiernan from being commander of the U.S. forces in Afghanistan. However, Trump, while running for his second term, vowed to eradicate 'woke' ideologies from the military and to swiftly dismiss many top leaders. Hegseth and Trump have made no secret about focusing on pushing aside military officers who have supported diversity, equity and inclusion in the ranks. The administration says the move will better fortify a lethal fighting force. Brown was just the second Black general to serve as chairman. His 16 months in the post were consumed with the war in Ukraine and the expanded conflict in the Middle East. Trump in 2020 nominated Brown as Air Force's chief of staff. Trump wants to replace Brown with Air Force Lt. Gen. Dan 'Razin' Caine, who retired in December. It is unclear what recalling Caine to active-duty service will require. The position requires Caine to be confirmed by the Senate. Hegseth said Friday's dismissals affected six three- and four-star generals and were 'a reflection of the president wanting the right people around him to execute the national security approach we want to take.' He called Brown 'honorable' but said he is 'not the right man for the moment,' without citing specific deficiencies. After the 2020 murder of George Floyd, Brown in a video spoke of his experience as a Black pilot, apparently making him fodder for the Trump administration's wars against inclusion initiatives in the military. Of Caine, Hegseth said that Trump 'respects leaders who untie the hands of war fighters in a very dangerous world.' Retired Gen. George Casey called the firings 'extremely destabilizing.' Casey, who was Republican President George W. Bush's commander of the U.S. and multinational forces in Iraq from 2004 to 2007, also noted that the Trump administration can change Pentagon policy without changing personnel, but added, that what happened is 'within the president's prerogative.' 'That's his prerogative,' Casey told ABC's 'This Week.' 'He is the commander in chief of the armed forces.' Still, Sen. Jack Reed of Rhode Island, the ranking Democrat on the Senate Armed Services Committee told ABC that the firings were 'completely unjustified' and that 'apparently, what Trump and Hegseth are trying to do is to politicize the Department of Defense.' Hegseth was also asked on Fox News about officials potentially compiling lists of more defense officials they plan to fire. He said there was no list but suggested that more dismissals could indeed be coming. 'We have a very keen eye towards military leadership and their willingness to follow lawful order,' Hegseth said. 'Joe Biden gave lawful orders. A lot of them are really bad,' he said, adding that things like COVID vaccine mandates 'eroded' the military ideologically 'President Trump has given another set of lawful orders and they will be followed,' Hegseth said. 'If they're not followed then those officers will find the door.'	https://www.voanews.com/a/hegseth-defends-trump-s-firings-of-pentagon-leaders-says-more-may-be-to-come-/7985292.html	2025-02-23T12:05:38-08:00	
Estonia pushing for EU to seize Russian assets for Ukraine	Brussels — Estonia has launched a new push to get fellow EU members to agree to seize frozen Russian assets and use them to help Ukraine, dismissing a Russian idea on how the money could be used as part of a peace deal. The Baltic country has sent a discussion paper on the issue to European Union partners and will raise it at a meeting of EU foreign ministers in Brussels on Monday, officials said. Some 210 billion euros ($219.62 billion) in Russian assets are immobilized in the EU by sanctions as part of an international crackdown on Moscow for its 2022 invasion of Ukraine. Last year, the G7 group of nations – including the EU – agreed to use profits from frozen Russian assets to fund a $50 billion loan for Ukraine. But the assets themselves remain untouched. 'The decision to use the windfall profits was a step in the right direction. I see that the time is ripe now to take the next step,' Estonian Foreign Minister Margus Tsahkna told Reuters. On Friday, Reuters reported that Moscow could agree to allow Russian assets frozen in Europe to be used for reconstruction in Ukraine but would insist part of the money is spent on the part of the country controlled by its forces. Tsahkna dismissed that idea. 'Giving Russia some of the assets to use in the occupied areas means accepting Russia’s occupation of some parts of Ukraine,' he said. The EU has insisted Ukraine’s territorial integrity must be respected in any peace deal. Several EU countries, including Baltic states and Poland, have said they are ready to consider seizing the assets. But Germany, France, Belgium and the European Central Bank have been wary, warning of legal challenges and undermining the euro as a reserve currency. Belgium-based clearing house Euroclear holds most of the Russian assets frozen in Europe. But the issue has resurfaced on the political agenda, particularly as the Trump administration has said it expects Europe to take on a larger share of support for Ukraine. The Estonian paper, seen by Reuters, tries to address its partners' concerns. It says asset seizure can be justified under international law, as a countermeasure to Moscow's war and because 'Russia refuses to engage in reparations.' It also says joint action by the EU and international partners could mitigate any risk to the euro as a reserve currency.	https://www.voanews.com/a/estonia-pushing-for-eu-to-seize-russian-assets-for-ukraine/7985281.html	2025-02-23T11:43:25-08:00	
American Airlines flight from New York to Delhi lands safely in Rome after security concern	Rome, Italy — An American Airlines flight from New York to New Delhi, India, landed safely in Rome on Sunday afternoon after it was diverted due to a security concern , which later proved to be 'non-credible,' the airline said. American Airlines said Flight 292 'was inspected by law enforcement' after landing at Leonardo da Vinci International Airport and 'cleared to re-depart.' It didn't clarify the cause of the security concern, but added an inspection was required by protocol before the flight could land in New Delhi. 'The flight will stay in Rome overnight to allow for required crew rest before continuing to Delhi as soon as possible tomorrow,' the airline said. An Associated Press reporter filmed two fighter jets flying over the airport shortly before the unscheduled landing. Fire trucks were visible on the landing strip on one side of the plane after it landed. The airport continued to operate normally, a spokesman with Rome's airport said.	https://www.voanews.com/a/american-airlines-flight-from-new-york-to-delhi-lands-safely-in-rome-after-security-concern/7985282.html	2025-02-23T11:41:07-08:00	
EU leaders will hold emergency summit on Ukraine and European security	Brussels — The leaders of the 27 European Union countries will have an emergency summit on March 6 about next steps for Ukraine and Europe's security. European Council President Antonio Costa announced Sunday that he is convening the summit in Brussels. 'We are living a defining moment for Ukraine and European security,' Costa said in a post on social media. Since the EU leaders last met Feb. 3, the Trump administration has upended years of U.S. support for Ukraine and decades of commitment to defending European allies. The leader of the European Commission, Ursula von der Leyen, and other members of the EU's executive branch, will visit Kyiv on Monday to show support for Ukraine on the third anniversary of Russia's invasion.	https://www.voanews.com/a/eu-leaders-will-hold-emergency-summit-on-ukraine-and-european-security-/7985274.html	2025-02-23T11:20:51-08:00

Captain America' dives in 2nd weekend, 'The Monkey' boosts Neon's successes	New York — 'Captain America: Brave New World' soared on opening weekend but crashed down in its second go-around with audiences. 'Brave New World,' the latest sign that the Marvel machine isn’t quite what it used to be, remained No. 1 at the box office in its second frame with $28.2 million in ticket sales, according to studio estimates Sunday. But after a debut of $100 million over four days and $88 million over three days, that meant a steep drop of 68%. While blockbusters often see significant slides in their second weekends, only two previous MCU titles have fallen off so fast: 2023’s 'The Marvels,' which fell 78%, and 2023’s 'Ant-Man and the Wasp: Quantumania,' which dropped 70%. The Anthony Mackie-led 'Captain America' installment has been slammed by critics, and audiences also have graded it poorly, with a 'B-' CinemaScore. 'Brave New World,' which fans had hoped would right the Marvel ship, has been largely met as another example of a once impenetrable brand struggling to recapture its pre- 'Avengers: Endgame' aura of invincibility. Still, 'Brave New World' has quickly grossed $289.4 million worldwide, with international sales nearly reaching $150 million. And with few big-budget offerings arriving in theaters in the coming weeks, it will have scant competition through much of March. The biggest new release of the weekend was Oz Perkins’ 'The Monkey,' the director’s follow-up to his 2024 horror hit, 'Longlegs.' Adapted from a Stephen King short story, 'The Monkey' opened with $14.2 million for Neon, the second-best debut for the indie distributor. The best? 'Longlegs,' which launched with $22.4 million. Neon had much to celebrate over the weekend. Its top awards contender, 'Anora,' by Sean Baker, continues to gather momentum into next Sunday's Academy Awards. The best-picture favorite added wins at the Independent Spirit Awards on Saturday. Perkins, Neon and Blumhouse, which partnered in the release of 'The Monkey,' have found a productive low-budget collaboration, with more on the way. Even if 'The Monkey' doesn’t reach the heights of 'Longlegs' ($126.9 million globally), Perkins and Neon return with 'Keeper' this October. 'The Monkey,' starring Tatiana Maslany and Theo James, revolves around an old monkey toy found in an attic. Reviews have been good (77% fresh on Rotten Tomatoes), though audiences were less impressed, giving it a C+ CinemaScore. Horror films, though, typically grade low. As it did with 'Longlegs,' Neon leaned into cryptic promotion for 'The Monkey,' along with some macabre marketing. A funeral premiere was held at Los Angeles’ Immanuel Presbyterian Church, and fan screenings took place at the Hollywood Cemetery. The film, produced by James Wan, cost $10 million to make. Lionsgate’s 'The Unbreakable Boy' opened with a paltry $2.5 million in 1,687 theaters. The Christian-themed Jon Gunn-directed film starring Zachary Levi and Meghann Fahy, is about parents who learn their son is autistic and has brittle bone disease. 'Paddington in Peru,' the third installment of the marmalade-mad bear, fell to third place in its second weekend. It grossed $6.5 million in 3,890 locations, bringing its two-week total to $25.2 million. 'Paddington in Peru' has been most popular overseas, where its collected $150 million thus far. 'Ne Zha 2,' the animated Chinese juggernaut, took in $3.1 million from 800 theaters in its second weekend. In China, the sequel has grossed $1.7 billion this month, setting numerous box-office records. Those totals put 'Ne Zha 2' past 'Inside Out 2' ($1.66 billion) as the highest grossing animated film ever. Top 10 movies by domestic box office With final domestic figures releasing Monday, this list factors in the estimated ticket sales for Friday through Sunday at U.S. and Canadian theaters, according to Comscore. 1. 'Captain America: Brave New World,' $28.2 million. 2. 'The Monkey,' $14.2 million. 3. 'Paddington in Peru,' $6.5 million. 4. 'Dog Man,' $5.9 million. 5. 'Ne Zha 2,' $3.1 million. 6. 'Heart Eyes,' $2.9 million. 7. 'Mufasa: The Lion King,' $2.5 million. 8. 'The Unbreakable Boy,' $2.5 million. 9. 'Chhaava,' $1.5 million. 10.

Netanyahu says Israel won't allow Syrian forces 'south of Damascus'	Jerusalem — Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu says Israel will not allow Syria's new army or the insurgent group that led the ouster of former President Bashar Assad to 'enter the area south of Damascus' as his government made clear Israeli forces would stay in parts of southern Syria for an indefinite period. Netanyahu's comments Sunday at a military graduation led to new concerns over the Israeli presence, and sway, in a swath of southern Syria as Damascus' new leaders attempt to consolidate control after years of civil war. 'Take note: We will not allow HTS forces or the new Syrian army to enter the area south of Damascus,' Netanyahu said, referring to Syria's new authorities as well as Hayat Tahrir al-Sham, the main former rebel group. 'We demand the complete demilitarization of southern Syria in the provinces of Quneitra, Daraa and Suwayda from the forces of the new regime. Likewise, we will not tolerate any threat to the Druze community in southern Syria.' There was no immediate response from Syrian authorities. Defense Minister Israel Katz added that Israeli forces will remain on the peak of Mt. Hermon in southern Syria and in a buffer zone 'for an indefinite period of time to protect our communities and thwart any threat.' He said Israeli forces have built two posts on the mountain and another seven in the buffer zone 'to ensure defense and offense against any challenge.' After the fall of Assad in December, Israel seized the U.N.-patrolled buffer zone on Syrian territory. The zone was set up under a 1974 ceasefire agreement. Syria's new authorities and U.N. officials have called for Israel to withdraw. Meanwhile, Netanyahu's government has been under pressure to protect Israelis living near border areas in the north. Katz said Israel will 'strengthen ties with friendly populations in the region,' notably the Druze, a religious minority who live in both southern Syria and in Israel's Golan Heights, where Druze navigate their historically Syrian identity while living under Israeli rule. 'We will not tolerate any threat to the Druze community in southern Syria,' Netanyahu said. More broadly, Israeli forces 'will not allow hostile forces to establish themselves and be present in the security zone in southern Syria from here to Damascus. And we will act against any threat,' Katz said.	https://www.voanews.com/a/netanyahu-says-israel-won-t-allow-syrian-forces-south-of-damascus-/7985248.html	2025-02-23T10:32:44-08:00	
Washington, Kyiv near deal for Ukrainian ‘critical minerals’ rights	The United States and Ukraine said Sunday they are nearing an agreement for Kyiv to give Washington a large share of its rare earth mineral rights as compensation for the billions of dollars in munitions the U.S. sent to Ukraine to defend itself from Russia’s full-scale war. Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy told a news conference in Kyiv that Ukraine and the U.S. are 'making progress' in reaching a deal. He said a draft of the pact calls for Ukraine to pay the U.S. $2 for each dollar in aid the U.S. has sent to Kyiv to fight Russia’s invasion, although details of the would-be agreement have not been disclosed. The war hits the three-year mark on Monday. The U.S. has been Ukraine’s biggest benefactor, sending $128 billion in military and humanitarian assistance to Ukraine, according to Germany’s Kiel Institute for the World Economy. The U.S. share is just ahead of the combined $124 billion figure for the 27-nation European Union. U.S. special envoy Steve Witkoff told CNN’s 'State of the Union' that he expects Zelenskyy will sign the minerals deal this week. Zelenskyy at first rejected the U.S. demand for half of Ukraine’s rare earth mineral supplies, which are used in the production of technology products. Witkoff signaled in the CNN interview that the deal will now be completed although he did not spell out details of the agreement. Witkoff said that European countries made their contributions to Ukraine’s war efforts after reaching agreement with Kyiv to eventually be paid back, but the U.S. had no such understanding. Witkoff said such U.S. support for Ukraine with no repayment terms made 'no sense' to President Donald Trump, a long-time New York real estate deal maker before entering politics in 2015. Zelenskyy said, 'I had an agreement with [former U.S. President Joe] Biden and American Congress, I am grateful to the Congress, to the both parties. And it was support by providing grants. Grant is not a loan. And we don't have to return the loan here. Maybe someone does not like it and thinks that it's unjust. Maybe. I don't know. But here is what this deal was about. It was grant. Therefore, it's not about the figure. We simply don't see it as a loan.' Trump, who last week called Zelenskyy a 'dictator' and accused him of starting the war even though Russia invaded Ukraine, has demanded the repayments and blamed his predecessor, Biden, for not securing some form of compensation guarantee. Zelenskyy said Sunday he wants Trump to 'understand' his position and come through with concrete security guarantees to help Kyiv defend itself against the Russian invasion. 'I want very much from Trump understanding of each other,' Zelensky said at his news conference, adding: 'Security guarantees from Trump are much needed.' Zelenskyy said he was willing to give up his presidency if it meant peace in Ukraine, quipping that he could exchange his departure for Ukraine's entry into NATO, which Russia is adamantly opposed to. 'If [it means] peace for Ukraine, if you really need me to leave my post, I am ready,' Zelenskyy said. 'I can exchange this for NATO [membership], if that condition is there, immediately.' The top U.S. and Russian diplomats, U.S. Secretary of State Marco Rubio and Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov, met in Saudi Arabia without either Ukrainian or European officials last week to lay the groundwork for peace talks to end the war. Zelenskyy complained about Ukraine being excluded from the talks, but Trump said he could have negotiated with Russia beforehand to talk Moscow out of invading. 'I’ve had very good talks with Putin, and I’ve had not such good talks with Ukraine,' Trump told U.S. state governors at the White House. 'They don’t have any cards, but they play it tough,' Trump said of Ukraine. Russian state television said in recent days that Trump’s view of the Russia-Ukraine conflict is 'in total alignment with the way we see things.' Witkoff said the war 'wouldn’t have had to happen' if Ukraine hadn’t been pushing at the time for membership in NATO. Kyiv is still pressing to join the 32-nation pact, but Washington says it is unrealistic for that to happen as part of a negotiated peace settlement to end the war. Witkoff said that eventually 'you’ll see concessions signed by both sides' in a peace deal. Russia now controls about one-fifth of the internationally recognized Ukrainian territory, with Kremlin spokesperson Dmitry Peskov saying Sunday Moscow has no intention of yielding any of the land back to the Kyiv government. 'The people decided to join Russia a long time ago,' he said, referring to Moscow-staged votes in eastern Ukraine held amid the three-year offensive that were assailed as bogus by Kyiv, the West and international monitors. 'No one will ever sell off these territories,' Peskov said. 'That's the most important thing.' A Trump call with Putin two weeks ago set the stage for the Rubio-Lavrov talks in Saudi Arabia. 'This is a dialogue between two extraordinary presidents,' Peskov told state TV. Russia on Sunday marked Defender of the Fatherland Day — a holiday hailing soldiers and veterans. In a video released by the Kremlin, Putin said God and fate had entrusted him and his army with 'the mission' to defend Russia. Meanwhile, Zelenskyy said Russia launched 267 overnight drone attacks on Ukraine, which he condemned as 'aerial terror.' Ukrainian officials reported damage in five regions of the country. Zelenskyy said that in the past week, Russia has targeted Ukraine with nearly 1,150 attack drones, more than 1,400 guided aerial bombs and 35 missiles of various types.

France arrests 10 linked to escape of gang leader with Romania set to extradite him	Paris — Police have arrested 10 suspected accomplices of a suspected gangland killer described as France's 'public enemy number one,' the Paris chief prosecutor said Sunday, as Romania prepares to hand him over following his arrest in Bucharest. Prosecutor Laure Beccuau said the 10 are alleged to have helped in the escape of Mohamed Amra in an ambush nine months ago in which two prison officers were shot dead and three wounded. Amra, who is accused of gangland murders and drug trafficking, was arrested near a shopping center in Bucharest on Saturday. Romania will hand him over to France within 30 days, his lawyer said after a court hearing in Bucharest. He had vanished after the attack with military-style assault weapons on a prison van carrying him in northern France last May. The brutality of the ambush, which was caught on CCTV, shocked France and Amra instantly became the country's most wanted man. The authorities tasked more than 300 investigators with finding Amra, who is known as 'La Mouche' (The Fly), and has a long history of convictions for violent crimes that started when he was in his early teens. According to a 2024 judiciary report, he started out with aggravated robberies and progressively 'slid towards violence,' eventually entering the world of organized crime. The report found that authorities underestimated for some time just how dangerous he had become. Amra is suspected of pursuing his drug-related activities from his prison cell, and even of ordering hits from detention. Facial recognition, fingerprints Justice Minister Gerald Darmanin on Sunday published an open letter to prison officers, promising them better working conditions. He also vowed the creation of 'prison police' units and a 'high security prison,' in response to concerns that it has become too easy for convicted criminals to continue their business despite being locked up, thanks notably to access to mobile phones. Such a supermax prison, to be completed within months, would keep France's '100 biggest drug traffickers' in complete isolation -- using Italian anti-mafia laws as a model — so that 'a case like Amra's can never happen again,' Darmanin said. At the time of his escape, Amra was facing one charge for attempted murder and another for participation in a gangland killing in the southern city of Marseille, a hub for drug trafficking and gang violence. The Paris prosecutor said in a statement that his 10 suspected accomplices had been detained on Saturday and early Sunday. A police source told AFP that they were arrested for the most part in Rouen and Evreux in northwestern France, and that police seized weapons during raids. 'They are suspected of having helped in the preparation and execution of the escape, and having helped the fugitive to hide,' the prosecutor said. Romanian police said Amra was arrested near a Bucharest shopping center and would be brought before a magistrate who will decide on his extradition to France. After being alerted by their French colleagues, it took Romanian police just 48 hours to locate, identify and capture Amra, the government in Bucharest said. Amra, who rejects the charges against him, had agreed to be returned to France, lawyer Maria Marcu said. 'He respects the decision of the French authorities who want to put him on trial,' she said. Beccuau said Amra, who had changed his appearance and dyed his hair, had been identified through facial recognition tools and his fingerprints. The lawyers for the families of the two agents killed in Amra's escape said they were 'relieved' that he had finally been apprehended.	https://www.voanews.com/a/france-arrests-10-linked-to-escape-of-gang-leader-with-romania-set-to-extradite-him-/7985164.html	2025-02-23T08:40:01-08:00	
Rich in cash, Japan automaker Toyota builds city to test futuristic mobility	SUSONO — Woven City near Mount Fuji is where Japanese automaker Toyota plans to test everyday living with robotics, artificial intelligence and autonomous zero-emissions transportation. Daisuke Toyoda, an executive in charge of the project from the automaker's founding family, stressed it's not 'a smart city.' 'We're making a test course for mobility so that's a little bit different. We're not a real estate developer,' he said Saturday during a tour of the facility, where the first phase of construction was completed. The Associated Press was the first foreign media to get a preview of the $10 billion Woven City. The first phase spans 47,000 square meters (506,000 square feet), roughly the size of about five baseball fields. When completed, it will be 294,000 square meters (3.1 million square feet). Built on the grounds of a shuttered Toyota Motor Corp. auto plant, it's meant to be a place where researchers and startups come together to share ideas, according to Toyoda. Ambitious plans for futuristic cities have sputtered or are unfinished, including one proposed by Google's parent company Alphabet in Toronto; 'Neom' in Saudi Arabia; a project near San Francisco, spearheaded by a former Goldman Sachs trader, and Masdar City next to Abu Dhabi's airport. Woven City's construction began in 2021. All the buildings are connected by underground passageways, where autonomous vehicles will scuttle around collecting garbage and making deliveries. No one is living there yet. The first residents will total just 100 people. Called 'weavers,' they're workers at Toyota and partner companies, including instant noodle maker Nissin and Daikin, which manufactures air-conditioners. Coffee maker UCC was serving hot drinks from an autonomous-drive bus, parked in a square surrounded by still-empty apartment complexes. The city's name honors Toyota's beginnings as a maker of automatic textile looms. Sakichi Toyoda, Daisuke Toyoda's great-great-grandfather, just wanted to make life easier for his mother, who toiled on a manual loom. There was little talk of using electric vehicles, an area where Toyota has lagged. While Tesla and Byd emerged as big EV players, Toyota has been pushing hydrogen, the energy of choice in Woven City. Toyota officials acknowledged it doesn't expect to make money from Woven City, at least not for years. Keisuke Konishi, auto analyst at Quick Corporate Valuation Research Center, believes Toyota wants to work on robotic rides to rival Google's Waymo — even if it means building an entire complex. 'Toyota has the money to do all that,' he said.	https://www.voanews.com/a/rich-in-cash-japan-automaker-toyota-builds-city-to-test-futuristic-mobility/7985149.html	2025-02-23T08:15:08-08:00	
French authorities detained 4 people after stabbing linked to Islamic extremism	Paris — Four people were in custody Sunday after a deadly stabbing in eastern France that authorities linked to Islamic extremism, according to the national anti-terrorism prosecutor’s office. A Portuguese man was killed in the Saturday attack in the city of Mulhouse, near the border with Germany. Seven police officers were wounded, including a parking control agent hospitalized with grave injuries, the prosecutor’s office said. Those detained include the suspected assailant, a 37-year-old Algerian man identified by prosecutors as Brahim A. The interior minister described him as an Islamic extremist with a schizophrenic profile. Two of the suspect's family members and a person who lodged him were also detained, the prosecutor's office said. French President Emmanuel Macron said the government has 'complete determination' to respond to the attack, which he blamed on 'Islamist terrorism.' France has been on high alert for extremist threats. The suspect repeatedly said, 'Allahu Akbar' — 'God is great' in Arabic — during the attack, the prosecutor said. He was armed with a knife and a screwdriver. The suspect arrived in France without papers in 2014 and was arrested and convicted of glorifying terrorism in the wake of the Oct. 7, 2023, Hamas terrorist attack on Israel, Interior Minister Bruno Retailleau told reporters Saturday night. Police experts had ″detected a schizophrenic profile″ in the suspect, he added. After several months in prison for that conviction, the suspect was confined to house arrest as authorities sought to expel him to Algeria. Retailleau criticized Algeria for resisting the return of criminals France is seeking to deport. The French government will convene a special meeting Wednesday about immigration in the wake of the attack, Foreign Minister Jean-Noel Barrot said Sunday. They will notably study 19 countries 'where we have the most difficulty in returning people without papers,' Barrot said on Europe-1 radio.	https://www.voanews.com/a/french-authorities-detained-4-people-after-stabbing-linked-to-islamic-extremism-/7985132.html	2025-02-23T08:06:38-08:00	
Hundreds of thousands attend the funeral of Hezbollah leader Nasrallah 5 months after his killing	BEIRUT — Hundreds of thousands of people packed into a stadium in Beirut and the streets outside Sunday for the funeral of Hezbollah's former leader, Hassan Nasrallah, nearly five months after he was killed in an Israeli airstrike. Nasrallah died after Israel's air force dropped more than 80 bombs on the militant group's main operations room in a southern suburb of the Lebanese capital. His death was a major blow for the Iran-backed militant group and political party that he had transformed into a potent force in the Middle East. Hezbollah is a U.S. designated terrorist group. Nasrallah was one of the group's founders and led it for more than 30 years, enjoying wide influence among Iran-backed groups in the region. He was widely respected in the so-called Iran-led axis of resistance that included Iraqi, Yemeni and Palestinian factions. Nasrallah also became an iconic figure in other parts of the Arab world after Hezbollah fought Israel to a draw in a brutal monthlong war in 2006, but the group's image in much of the region suffered after it intervened on the side of former President Bashar Assad in Syria's civil war. Hezbollah had called on its supporters to attend the funeral in large numbers in what appears to be a move to show that the group remains powerful after suffering major blows during a 14-month war with Israel that left many of its senior political and military officials dead. A Lebanese official who spoke on condition of anonymity because he was not authorized to comment estimated the crowd size at 450,000. 'This massive crowd confirms that Hezbollah is still the most popular party at the Lebanese level, and as a result, all the talk that Hezbollah is weak or degraded is out of place,' said Ali Fayyad, a lawmaker with the group's political wing, who attended the funeral. Sahar al-Attar, a mourner who traveled from Lebanon's Bekaa Valley for the funeral said,'We would have come even under bullets' to attend Nasrallah's burial. Nasrallah shared the funeral with his cousin and successor, Hashem Safieddine, who was killed in an Israeli airstrike on a Beirut suburb a few days later. Nasrallah will be laid to rest later Sunday in Beirut while Safieddine will be buried in his hometown in southern Lebanon. Both had temporarily been buried in secret locations. As the coffins were paraded before the huge crowd, men riding on the platforms with them tossed flowers, while some in the crowd tossed clothing articles in the hope they would come in contact with the coffins, believing it would bless them. Outside of the stadium, giant screens were placed along the road leading to the airport, titling the funeral: 'We are committed to the covenant.' Senior Hezbollah official Ali Daamoush told reporters Saturday that about 800 prominent figures from 65 countries would attend the funeral in addition to thousands of individuals and activists from around the world. Iranian parliament Speaker Mohammad Bagher Qalibaf and Foreign Minister Abbas Araghchi were among the officials who arrived at the Lebanese capital's main sports stadium. Lebanon's parliament speaker and representatives of the president and prime minister were also in attendance. The funeral also drew non-official participants from outside of Lebanon, including some from Western countries. Irish activist Tara O'Grady waved the flag of her country and said that she came to Beirut 'to stand with the people of Lebanon and their resistance against the Zionist regime who are brutally continuing to bomb the south of Lebanon.' She likened Nasrallah to Irish early-20th century revolutionary Michael Collins. As O'Grady spoke with The Associated Press, four Israeli warplanes flew at low altitude over Beirut while Nasrallah's coffin was paraded into the stadium. The crowd chanted: 'Death to Israel' and 'at your service, Nasrallah.' Israeli Defense Minister Israel Katz said in a statement that the fighter jets flying over the funeral 'send a clear message: Whoever threatens to annihilate Israel and strike Israel — that will be his end.' Hours before and during the funeral, the Israeli military also launched a series of strikes in southern and eastern Lebanon. As part of the U.S.-brokered ceasefire deal that ended the war with Israel on Nov. 27, Hezbollah is not supposed to have an armed presence along the border with Israel. The group was dealt another blow with the fall of the Assad family's five-decade rule in Syria in early December, which blocked a main route for the flow of weapons and money from Iran. Its rivals have been calling on it to lay down its weapons all over Lebanon and become a political faction. Nasrallah's successor, Hezbollah's current Secretary-General Naim Kassem, said in a televised speech played at the funeral that 'the resistance is still present and strong in numbers and weapons, and the inevitable victory is coming.' He was not at the stadium. Kassem added that 'Israel must withdraw from the areas it still occupies' in southern Lebanon, referring to five strategic border points where Israeli forces remain. 'We won't allow America to control our country,' he said. 'Israel will not take with politics what they did not take in the war.'	https://www.voanews.com/a/hundreds-of-thousands-attend-the-funeral-of-hezbollah-leader-nasrallah-5-months-after-his-killing-/7985124.html	2025-02-23T07:53:26-08:00	
Congo's president says he'll create ‘unity government’ as violence spreads	KINSHASA — Congo's president says he is going to launch a unity government, as violence spreads across the country's east and pressure mounts over his handling of the crisis. On Saturday, in some of his first statements since M23 rebels captured major cities in eastern Congo, President Felix Tshisekedi, told a meeting of the Sacred Union of the Nation ruling coalition not to be distracted by internal quarrels. 'I lost the battle and not the war. I must reach out to everyone including the opposition. There will be a government of national unity,' said Tshisekedi. He didn’t give more details on what that would entail or when it would happen. M23 rebels — the most prominent of more than 100 armed groups vying for control and influence in eastern Congo — have swept through the region seizing key cities, killing some 3,000 people. In a lightning three-week offensive, the M23 took control of eastern Congo’s main city Goma and seized the second largest city, Bukavu. The rebels are supported by about 4,000 troops from neighboring Rwanda, according to U.N. experts, and at times have vowed to march as far as Congo’s capital, Kinshasa, over 1,000 miles away. Rwanda has accused Congo of enlisting ethnic Hutu fighters responsible for the 1994 genocide in Rwanda of minority Tutsis and moderate Hutus. M23 says it’s fighting to protect Tutsis and Congolese of Rwandan origin from discrimination and wants to transform Congo from a failed state to a modern one. Analysts have called those pretexts for Rwanda’s involvement. On Saturday, Tshisekedi paid tribute to soldiers who were killed and vowed to prop up the army. The DRC government has officially designated the M23 rebel group as a terrorist organization, while the United Nations and the United States classify it as an armed rebel group. The DRC government has repeatedly accused Rwanda of supporting the M23 rebel group, a claim that Rwanda denies.	https://www.voanews.com/a/congo-s-president-says-he-ll-create-unity-government-as-violence-spreads/7985125.html	2025-02-23T07:44:17-08:00	
Kremlin hails Putin-Trump dialogue as promising	Moscow — The Kremlin on Sunday hailed dialogue between U.S. President Donald Trump and Russian President Vladimir Putin — two 'extraordinary' presidents — as 'promising,' and vowed it would 'never' give up territory seized in eastern Ukraine. Trump broke with Western policy earlier this month by phoning Putin to discuss how to end the Ukraine conflict — a call hailed by Moscow as ending three years of isolation for the Kremlin leader since he launched his full-scale offensive in February 2022. Top Russian and U.S. officials then met in Saudi Arabia last week to discuss a 'restoration' of ties and start a discussion on a possible Ukraine ceasefire — all without the involvement of Kyiv or Europe. 'This is a dialogue between two extraordinary presidents,' Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov told state TV on Sunday. 'That's promising,' he added. 'It is important that nothing prevents us from realizing the political will of the two heads of state.' Trump's overtures to Moscow have triggered alarm in Kyiv and across Europe. But it is unclear whether his moves will be able to bring Moscow and Kyiv closer to a truce. Peskov on Sunday ruled out any territorial concessions as part of a settlement. 'The people decided to join Russia a long time ago,' he said, referring to Moscow-staged votes in eastern Ukraine held amid the offensive that were slammed as bogus by Kyiv, the West and international monitors. 'No one will ever sell off these territories. That's the most important thing.' 'God willed it' Putin said God and fate had entrusted him and his army with 'the mission' to defend Russia. 'Fate willed it so, God willed it so, if I may say so. A mission as difficult as it is honorable — defending Russia — has been placed on our and your shoulders together,' he told servicemen who have fought in Ukraine. Russia was on Sunday marking Defender of the Fatherland Day — a holiday hailing soldiers and veterans — a day before the three-year anniversary of the start of its full-scale offensive. 'Today, at the risk of their lives and with courage, they are resolutely defending their homeland, national interests and Russia's future,' Putin said in a video released by the Kremlin. Moscow's army had overnight launched a record 267 attack drones at Ukraine, Kyiv's air force said. Among them, 138 were intercepted by air defense and 119 were 'lost.' Ukraine did not say what happened to the remaining 10 but a separate armed forces statement on Telegram said several regions, Kyiv included, had been 'hit.' AFP journalists in the Ukrainian capital heard air defense systems in operation throughout the night. 'Inappropriate remarks' Amid his outreach to Moscow, Trump has also verbally attacked Ukraine's leader, Volodymyr Zelenskyy falsely claiming Kyiv started the war and that Zelensky was hugely unpopular at home. The bitter war of words has threatened to undermine Western support for Kyiv at a critical juncture in the conflict. Zelenskyy on Sunday called for the Western coalition that has been helping Kyiv fend off the Russian offensive for the last three years to hold strong. 'We must do our best to achieve a lasting and just peace for Ukraine. This is possible with the unity of all partners: we need the strength of the whole of Europe, the strength of America, the strength of all those who want lasting peace,' Zelenskyy said on Telegram. Moscow has reveled in the spat between Trump and Zelensky. 'Zelenskyy makes inappropriate remarks addressed to the head of state. He does it repeatedly,' Peskov said Sunday. 'No president would tolerate that kind of treatment. So his [Trump's] reaction is completely quite understandable.' Scrambling to respond to Trump's dramatic policy reversal, French President Emmanuel Macron and British Prime Minister Keir Starmer will travel to Washington next week to make the case for supporting Ukraine.	https://www.voanews.com/a/kremlin-hails-putin-trump-dialogue-as-promising-/7985003.html	2025-02-23T04:58:01-08:00	
Russia signs memorandum to build port, oil refinery in Myanmar	Moscow — Myanmar and its close ally Russia signed a memorandum on investment cooperation in a special economic zone in Dawei, including construction of a port and an oil refinery, Russia's Ministry of Economic Development said on Sunday. The document was signed by the head of the Russian ministry, Maxim Reshetnikov, and Myanmar's minister for investment and foreign economic relations, Kan Zaw, during a visit of a Russian delegation to the Southeast Asian country. 'The text of the memorandum contains the basic parameters of several large infrastructure and energy projects that are being implemented jointly with Russian companies in Myanmar,' the Russian ministry cited Reshetnikov as saying in a statement. 'We are talking about projects to build a port, a coal-fired thermal power plant and an oil refinery.' He added that 'oil refining is still the most complex element,' and there was no final decision on construction of a refinery. 'As for the refinery — there is a desire of the Myanmar side to have a refinery. Our companies are still studying the economics of such a project, it is very complicated from the point of view of economic feasibility,' Interfax news agency cited Reshetnikov. According to the Russian ministry, the Dawei special economic zone is a 196 square-kilometer project in the Andaman Sea which is planned to house high-tech industrial zones and transport hubs, information technology zones and export processing zones. Russia has become Myanmar's closest ally since the military coup that overthrew Aung San Suu Kyi's elected civilian government in February 2021. Moscow and Naypyidaw have been discussing a deeper energy cooperation, including Russia's participation in the construction of a gas pipeline to the Myanmar's main city Yangon. Russia has also had plans for a nuclear research reactor in the country.	https://www.voanews.com/a/russia-signs-memorandum-to-build-port-oil-refinery-in-myanmar-/7984996.html	2025-02-23T04:06:19-08:00	
Israel delays release of Palestinian prisoners, citing 'humiliating' handovers of hostages	TEL AVIV, Israel — Israel says the release of hundreds of Palestinian prisoners is delayed 'until the release of the next hostages has been assured, and without the humiliating ceremonies' at handovers of Israeli captives in Gaza. The statement by Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's office early Sunday came as vehicles apparently carrying prisoners left the open gates of Ofer prison, only to turn around and go back in. The release of 620 Palestinian prisoners had been delayed for several hours and was meant to occur just after six Israeli hostages were released Saturday. It was meant to be the largest one-day prisoner release in the Gaza ceasefire's first phase. Israel's announcement abruptly put the future of the truce into further doubt. The Palestinian Authority's commission for prisoners' affairs confirmed the delay 'until further notice.' The Associated Press video, recorded in the West Bank, showed prisoners' families, waiting outdoors in near-freezing weather, apparently dispersing. One woman was shown walking away in tears. The six were the last living hostages expected to be freed under the ceasefire's first phase, with a week remaining in the initial stage. Talks on the ceasefire's second phase are yet to start. The six included three Israeli men seized from the Nova music festival and another taken while visiting family in southern Israel during the October 7, 2023, attack led by Hamas, a U.S.-designated terrorist organization, that triggered the 16-month war in Gaza. The two others were held for a decade after entering Gaza on their own. Omer Wenkert, Omer Shem Tov and Eliya Cohen were released together. Cohen's family and friends in Israel chanted 'Eliya! Eliya! Eliya!' and cheered. 'You're heroes,' Shem Tov told his parents as they later embraced, laughing and crying. 'You have no idea how much I dreamt of you.' His father, Malki Shem Tov, told public broadcaster Kan his son was held alone after the first 50 days and lost 17 kilograms (37 pounds). Earlier Saturday, Tal Shoham, 40, and Avera Mengistu, 38, were freed. Mengistu, an Ethiopian-Israeli, entered Gaza in 2014. His family told Israeli media he has struggled with mental health issues. The Israeli-Austrian Shoham was taken from Kibbutz Be'eri. His wife and two children were freed in a 2023 exchange. Later, Israel's military said Hisham Al-Sayed, 36, was released. The Bedouin-Israeli entered Gaza in 2015. His family had told Israeli media he was previously diagnosed with schizophrenia. Israel's government didn't respond to questions about the delay in releasing prisoners. Hamas accused Israel of violating the ceasefire deal, with spokesperson Abdel Latif Al-Qanou accusing Netanyahu of 'deliberately stalling.' The hostage release followed a heartrending dispute when Hamas on Thursday handed over the wrong body for Shiri Bibas, an Israeli mother abducted with her two young boys. The remains were determined to be those of an unnamed Palestinian woman. Netanyahu vowed revenge for 'a cruel and malicious violation.' Hamas suggested it was a mistake. Israeli forensic authorities confirmed a body handed over Friday was Bibas. Dr. Chen Kugel, head of the National Institute of Forensic Medicine, said they found no evidence Bibas and her children were killed in an Israeli airstrike, as Hamas has claimed. Kugel did not give a cause. Difficult talks likely over the ceasefire's next phase The ceasefire deal has paused the deadliest and most devastating fighting ever between Israel and Hamas, but there are fears the war will resume. Negotiations on the ceasefire's second phase are likely to be more difficult. Hamas had said it will release four bodies next week, completing the truce's first phase. After that, Hamas will hold over 60 hostages — about half believed to be alive. Hamas has said it won't release the remaining captives without a lasting ceasefire and full Israeli withdrawal from Gaza. Netanyahu, with the backing of U.S. President Donald Trump's administration, says he's committed to destroying Hamas' military and governing capacities and returning all hostages, goals widely seen as mutually exclusive. Israel's military offensive has killed more than 48,000 Palestinians, mostly women and children, according to Gaza's Hamas-run Health Ministry, which doesn't distinguish between civilians and combatants. Israel says it has killed more than 17,000 Hamas terrorists, without providing evidence. The offensive destroyed vast areas of Gaza, reducing entire neighborhoods to rubble. At its height, the war displaced 90% of Gaza's 2.3 million population. The October 7, 2023, terrorist attack killed about 1,200 people, mostly civilians. Hundreds of Israeli soldiers have died in the war.	https://www.voanews.com/a/israel-delays-release-of-palestinian-prisoners-citing-humiliating-handovers-of-hostages-/7984992.html	2025-02-23T03:37:53-08:00	
Vatican: Ailing Pope Francis 'rested during a peaceful night'	ROME — Pope Francis, in critical condition with a complicated lung infection, rested well during a peaceful night following a respiratory crisis and blood transfusions, the Vatican said Sunday. Vatican spokesperson Matteo Bruni's one-line statement didn't mention if Francis was up or eating breakfast. 'The night passed quietly, the pope rested.' The brief update came after doctors said the 88-year-old pope, who had part of one lung removed as a young man, was in critical condition. On Saturday morning, he suffered a prolonged asthmatic respiratory crisis while being treated for pneumonia and a complex lung infection. The pope received 'high flows' of oxygen to help him breathe. He also received blood transfusions after tests showed low counts of platelets, which are needed for clotting, the Vatican said in a late update. The Saturday statement also said that the pontiff 'continues to be alert and spent the day in an armchair although in more pain than yesterday.' Doctors said the prognosis was 'reserved.' Doctors have said Francis’ condition is touch-and-go, given his age, fragility and pre-existing lung disease. Main threat facing pope is sepsis They have warned that the main threat facing Francis would be the onset of sepsis, a serious infection of the blood that can occur as a complication of pneumonia. As of Friday, there was no evidence of any sepsis, and Francis was responding to the various drugs he is taking, the pope’s medical team said in their first in-depth update on the pope’s condition. Saturday’s blood tests showed that he had developed a low platelet count, a condition called platelopenia or thrombocytopenia. Platelets are cell-like fragments that circulate in the blood that help form blood clots to stop bleeding or help wounds heal. Low platelet counts can be caused by a number of things, including side effects from medicines or infections, according to the U.S. National Institutes of Health. Francis, who has chronic lung disease and is prone to bronchitis in winter, was admitted to Gemelli hospital on Feb. 14 after a weeklong bout of bronchitis worsened. Doctors first diagnosed the complex viral, bacterial and fungal respiratory tract infection and then the onset of pneumonia in both lungs. They prescribed 'absolute rest' and a combination of cortisone and antibiotics, along with supplemental oxygen when he needs it. Speculation that Francis might resign Meanwhile, the Vatican hierarchy went on the defensive to tamp down rumors and speculation that Francis might decide to resign. There is no provision in canon law for what to do if a pope becomes incapacitated. Francis has said that he has written a letter of resignation that would be invoked if he were medically incapable of making such a decision. The pope remains fully conscious, alert, eating and working. The Vatican secretary of state, Cardinal Pietro Parolin, gave a rare interview to Corriere della Sera to respond to speculation and rumors about a possible resignation. It came after the Vatican issued an unusual and official denial of an Italian media report that said Parolin and the pope’s chief canonist had visited Francis in the hospital in secret. Given the canonical requirements to make a resignation legitimate, the implications of such a meeting were significant, but the Vatican flat-out denied that any such meeting occurred. Parolin said such speculation seemed 'useless' when what really mattered was the health of Francis, his recovery and return to the Vatican. 'On the other hand, I think it is quite normal that in these situations uncontrolled rumors can spread or some misplaced comment is uttered. It is certainly not the first time it has happened,' Parolin was quoted as saying. 'However, I don’t think there is any particular movement, and so far I haven’t heard anything like that.' Holy Year celebrations continue Deacons, meanwhile, were gathering at the Vatican for their special Holy Year weekend. Francis got sick at the start of the Vatican’s Holy Year, the once-every-quarter-century celebration of Catholicism. This weekend, Francis was supposed to have celebrated deacons, a ministry in the church that precedes ordination to the priesthood. In his place, the Holy Year organizer was to celebrate Sunday’s Mass, the Vatican said. And for the second consecutive weekend, Francis is skipping his traditional Sunday noon blessing, which he could have delivered from Gemelli if he were up to it. 'Look, even though he’s not [physically] here, we know he’s here,' said Luis Arnaldo Lopez Quirindongo, a deacon from Ponce, Puerto Rico, who was at the Vatican on Saturday for the Jubilee celebration. 'He’s recovering, but he’s in our hearts and is accompanying us, because our prayers and his go together.'	https://www.voanews.com/a/vatican-ailing-pope-francis-rested-during-a-peaceful-night-/7984949.html	2025-02-23T00:58:10-08:00	
Encroaching desert threatens to swallow Mauritania's homes, history	CHINGUETTI, MAURITANIA — For centuries, poets, scholars and theologians have flocked to Chinguetti, a trans-Saharan trading post home to more than a dozen libraries containing thousands of manuscripts. But it now stands on the brink of oblivion. Shifting sands have long covered the ancient city's 8th-century core and are encroaching on neighborhoods at its current edge. Residents say the desert is their destiny. As the world's climate gets hotter and drier, sandstorms are more frequently depositing centimeters of dunes onto Chinguetti's streets and in people's homes, submerging some entirely. Tree-planting projects are trying to keep the invading sands at bay, but so far, they haven't eased the deep-rooted worries about the future. Chinguetti is one of four UNESCO World Heritage sites in Mauritania, a West African nation where only 0.5% of land is considered farmable. In Africa — the continent that contributes the least to fossil fuel emissions — only Somalia and Eswatini have experienced more climate change impacts, according to World Bank data. Mauritanians believe Chinguetti is among Islam's holiest cities. Its dry stone and mud mortar homes, mosques and libraries store some of West Africa's oldest quranic texts and manuscripts, covering topics ranging from law to mathematics. Community leader Melainine Med El Wely feels agonized over the stakes for residents and the history contained within Chinguetti's walls. It's like watching a natural disaster in slow motion, he said. 'It's a city surrounded by an ocean of sand that's advancing every minute,' El Wely, the president of the local Association for Participatory Oasis Management, said. 'There are places that I walk now that I remember being the roofs of houses when I was a kid.' He remembers that once when enough sand blew into his neighborhood to cover the palms used to make roofs, an unknowing camel walking through the neighborhood plunged into what was once someone's living room. Research suggests sand migration plays a significant role in desertification. Deserts, including the Sahara, are expanding at unprecedented rates and 'sand seas' are being reactivated, with blowing dunes transforming landscapes where vegetation once stood. 'What we used to think of as the worst case scenario five to 10 years ago is now actually looking like a more likely scenario than we had in mind,' said Andreas Baas, an earth scientist from King's College London who researches how winds and the way they blow sand are changing. More than three-quarters of the earth's land has become drier in recent decades, according to a 2024 United Nations report on desertification. The aridity has imperiled ability of plants, humans and animals to survive. It robs lands of the moisture needed to sustain life, kills crops and can cause sandstorms and wildfires. 'Human-caused climate change is the culprit; known for making the planet warmer, it is also making more and more land drier,' the U.N. report said. 'Aridity-related water scarcity is causing illness and death and spurring large-scale forced migration around the world.' Scientists and policymakers are mostly concerned about soils degrading in once-fertile regions that are gradually becoming wastelands, rather than areas deep in the Sahara Desert. Still, in Chinguetti, a changing climate is ushering in many of the consequences that officials have warned about. Trees are withering, wells are running dry and livelihoods are vanishing. Date farmers like 50-year-old Salima Ould Salem have found it increasingly difficult to nourish their palm trees, and now have to pipe in water from tanks and prune more thoroughly to make sure it's used efficiently. Salem's neighborhood used to be full of families, but they've gradually moved away. Sand now blocks the doorway to his home. It's buried those where some of his neighbors once lived. And a nearby guesthouse built by a Belgian investor decades ago is now half-submerged in a rippling copper-hued dune. Though many have departed, Salem remains, aware that each time a member of the community leaves, their home can no long serve as a bulwark and the rest of the community therefore becomes more likely to be swallowed by the desert. 'We prefer to stay here. If I leave, my place will disappear,' Salem said. Acacia, gum and palm trees once shielded the neighborhood from encroaching dunes, but they've gradually disappeared. The trees have either died of thirst or have been cut down by residents needing firewood or foliage for their herds to feed on. Sandstorms are not new but have become increasingly intrusive, each leaving inches or feet in the neighborhoods on the edge of the city, retired teacher Mohamed Lemine Bahane said. Residents use mules and carts to remove the sand because the old city's streets are too narrow to accommodate cars or bulldozers. When sand piles high enough, some build new walls atop existing structures. 'When you remove the vegetation, it gives the dunes a chance to become more active, because it's ultimately the vegetation that can hold down the sand so it doesn't blow too much,' Bahane said. Bahane has for years taken measurements of the sand deposits and rains and says that Chinguetti has received an annual average of 2.5 centimeters of rainfall over the past decade. As rainfall plummets, trees die, and more sand migrates into town. And with shorter acacia trees submerged in sand, some herders resort to cutting down date palm trees to feed their flocks, further disrupting the ecosystem and date farming economy. The sands also raise public health concerns for the community breathing in the dust, Bahane said. The solution, he believes, has to be planting more trees both in neighborhoods and along the perimeter of town. Such 'green belts' have been proposed on a continent-wide scale as Africa's 'Great Green Wall' as well as locally, in towns like Chinguetti. Mauritania's Ministry of Environment and Ministry of Agriculture as well as European-funded NGOs have floated projects to plant trees to insulate the city's libraries and manuscripts from the incoming desert. Though some have been replanted, there's little sign that it has contributed to stopping the desert in its tracks. It can take years for taproots to grow deep enough into the earth to access groundwater. 'We're convinced that desertification is our destiny. But thankfully, there are still people convinced that it can be resisted,' El Wely, the community leader, said.	https://www.voanews.com/a/hold-for-wknd---mauritania-residents-say-the-desert-is-their-destiny-/7984232.html	2025-02-22T23:44:17-08:00	
Philippine village battles dengue by offering bounties for mosquitos — dead or alive	MANILA, PHILIPPINES — A village in the densely populated Philippine capital region launched a battle against dengue Wednesday by offering a token bounty to residents for captured mosquitos — dead or alive. The unusual strategy adopted by the Addition Hills village in Mandaluyong City reflects growing concern after the nearby city of Quezon declared an outbreak of the mosquito-borne illness over the weekend. Eight more areas reported an upsurge in cases of the potentially deadly viral infection. At least 28,234 dengue cases have been recorded in the Philippines this year up to Feb. 1, a 40% increase compared to the same period last year, according to health department statistics. Quezon City declared a dengue outbreak Saturday after deaths this year reached 10 people, mostly children, out of 1,769 residents infected. A urban village of more than 100,000 residents living in crowded neighborhoods and residential condominium towers, Addition Hills has done clean-ups, canal declogging and a hygiene campaign to combat dengue. But when cases spiked to 42 this year and two young students died, village leader Carlito Cernal decided to intensify the battle. 'There was an alarm,' Cernal told The Associated Press. 'I found a way.' Residents will get a reward of one Philippines peso (just over 1 cent) for every five mosquitos or mosquito larva they turn in, Cernal said. Critics warned the strategy could backfire if desperate people start breeding mosquitoes for the reward. Cernal said that was unlikely because the campaign would be terminated as soon as the uptick in cases eases. As the campaign began, about a dozen mosquito hunters showed up at the village office. Miguel Labag, a 64-year-old scavenger, handed a jug with 45 dark mosquito larvas squirming in some water and received a reward of nine pesos (15 cents). 'This is a big help,' Labag said, smiling. 'I can buy coffee.' Dengue is a mosquito-borne viral infection found in tropical countries worldwide. It can cause joint pain, nausea, vomiting and rashes, and in severe cases can cause breathing problems, hemorrhaging and organ failure. While there is no specific treatment for the illness, medical care to maintain a person's fluid levels is seen as critical. Officials in another village in Quezon City were considering releasing swarms of frogs to eat mosquitoes. Health Secretary Teodoro Herbosa said it's crucial to clean up mosquito breeding sites, and for anyone who might be infected to seek immediate medical attention. Despite an increase in dengue infections, the Philippines has managed to maintain low mortality rates, he said. Dengue cases surged unexpectedly ahead of the rainy season, which starts in June, likely because of intermittent downpours that have left stagnant pools of water where dengue-causing mosquitos can breed, Health Undersecretary Alberto Domingo said, adding that climate change was likely contributing to off-season downpours.	https://www.voanews.com/a/philippine-village-battles-dengue-by-offering-bounties-for-mosquitos-dead-or-alive/7984215.html	2025-02-22T23:43:32-08:00	
Beauty market targets young at heart in aging Japan	TOKYO — Yoshiko Abe is about to turn 89, but that hasn't stopped her from going to the gym every day and trying the free-of-charge makeup course at her housing complex. 'It was really helpful,' she said, all smiles and glowing after putting on foundation and pink lipstick, something she hadn't done in years. Japan has the largest percentage of older citizens than any other country in the world. More than a quarter of Japan's population is 65 and older, at 36 million people. In about a decade, the ratio will be one in three. No wonder the young-at-heart, like Abe, is a growing target for Japan Inc. The market for older people is estimated to grow to more than 100 trillion yen ($650 billion) in size this year, according to a study by Mizuho Bank. And that business isn't just about remedies for sicknesses and old folks' homes but taps into solid consumerism. The growth of artificial intelligence and robotics also offers promise for such services and gadgetry. Akira Shimizu, professor of business at Keio University, calls them 'cool grandpas and cute grannies' who remain sensitive to trends, including the latest luxury and health products. 'They think about the clothing and makeup that express their style,' he said. From luxury cruises and 'oldies' rock concerts, companies are leveraging the fact that older people these days remain active, go out with friends and on dates, so they want to dress up and look good, said Shimizu. Maintaining one's looks is good physical exercise because it takes hand agility to open cosmetics tubes and draw eyebrows nicely, and massaging the face gets one's saliva glands going, according to Miwa Hiraku, the makeover class instructor from the Japanese cosmetics company Shiseido. Shiseido Co., which started out as a pharmacy in 1872, said that makeup is not just good for your physical well-being but also your soul. The company has been holding free makeup courses for older people across the country. 'Putting on makeup works as a switch to turn on your energy at the start of your day,' said Hiraku, who vows to wear makeup even at 100. 'It's not just about looking beautiful. It's about living a long healthy life.' Yoshihiko Hotta, 85, the only man in the class of about 30 people, didn't try the rouge but happily put on the hand cream and went along with all the exercise routines. While acknowledging he felt some effects of aging like sore legs, he declared with conviction: 'I don't think age is relevant.'	https://www.voanews.com/a/beauty-market-targets-young-at-heart-in-aging-japan/7982895.html	2025-02-22T23:42:51-08:00	
Mystical beliefs fuel Senegal's illegal big cat trade	NIOKOLO-KOBA NATIONAL PARK, SENEGAL — The morning sun slants through the canopy of Senegal's Niokolo-Koba National Park as Sgt. Abdou Diouf and his brigade of rangers march in single file, guns at the ready. They scan the brush for signs of poachers, but today, it seems, the only hunters are the lions themselves, their fresh tracks pressed into the sand. As the sun climbs, a guttural call reverberates across the forest. The rangers pause. 'Lions,' Diouf says. Spanning more than 9,000 square kilometers – double the size of Rhode Island – Niokolo-Koba is the last sanctuary in Senegal for lions, which are critically endangered in West Africa. But even here, they find little respite. Driven by deeply rooted beliefs in the mystical powers of animal skin talismans known as 'gris-gris,' the illegal trade of lion and leopard parts is growing, according to a new report by wild cat conservation group Panthera. Panthera's investigation found lion and leopard parts sold in 80% of markets surveyed, with 63% of artisans reporting increased sales in recent years. For Niokolo-Koba's lions, the impact has been devastating. Despite enhanced protections that doubled the population to around 35 since 2017, helping delist the park as a UNESCO World Heritage Site in danger, an unsustainable average of two cats are still lost to poachers each year. The only other place lions are found in West Africa is in the W-Arly-Pendjari Complex, a border region of Benin, Burkina Faso and Niger, and Panthera estimates there are fewer than 250 adults left in the region. The allure of the gris-gris The gris-gris, prescribed by influential religious leaders called marabouts, are crafted from bits of skin with written prayers or Quranic verses sewn inside. They are widely used across Senegal; police don them for protection, wrestlers for strength, politicians for clout. Average citizens wear them to ward off curses that other people may have put on them for a variety of reasons — matters of romance, perhaps, or jealousy at economic success. Gris-gris are rooted in traditional African faiths that believe vital powers in animals and nature may be unlocked — to harm, to heal, or to protect, said Dr. Cheikh Babou, a history professor and expert in West African Islam at the University of Pennsylvania. With Islam's arrival in West Africa in the eighth century, gris-gris became hybrid objects, melding Quranic verses with the perceived powers of animal parts. 'People started to drink the Quran, to wear the Quran – in the same way that they did with animals,' Babou said. Reverence for the lion makes it a special gris-gris At a market stall in Tambacounda, Ibrahim, a customer who asked that his last name be withheld because the trade of lion parts is illegal, wears several amulets around his waist. Made from hyena, honey badger, goat, fox, jackal, monkey, and lion, each serves a specific purpose. He began wearing them years ago after falling ill; someone had cast a spell on him, he said, so he went to a marabout who prescribed the gris-gris. 'Here in Africa people are very mean,' he said. 'If they see you succeed a little, they will go to the marabout. They don't want to see you in good health.' Traditional African societies are very egalitarian, Babou said – those with wealth are expected to share it. 'Those who don't share break the ethic of communalism. And when you do that, you become a witch.' A gris-gris can offer protection from those looking to retaliate. Among these protective talismans, lion parts hold particular allure. As the national emblem, the image of the lion adorns everything from the country's coat of arms to billboard advertisements, and it serves as namesake for the beloved national soccer team, the Lions of Teranga. 'You cannot prevent a Senegalese person from believing that a lion skin has some kind of power,' said Daouda Ngom, Senegal's minister of Environment and Ecological Transition. Smuggling networks are tough to dislodge This demand has given rise to a complex smuggling network that spans the continent. Likely sourced from East and Southern Africa, the skins travel by public bus and truck along clandestine routes through the Sahel region, evading checkpoints and border security on their journey into Senegal, according to Panthera's report. 'These are well-established networks,' said Paul Diedhiou, the director of Niokolo-Koba National Park. 'Dismantling them requires time, strategy and a lot of professionalism.' Between 2019 and 2024, authorities in Senegal confiscated some 40 lion and leopard skins, according to the Eco Activists for Governance and Law Enforcement (EAGLE) Network, a wildlife law enforcement organization operating across Africa. During that same period, 40 people were arrested for trafficking skins and other parts such as teeth, claws, and skulls. 'These seizures represent only a fraction of the actual trade,' said Cécile Bloch, coordinator of EAGLE Senegal. 'Today, traffickers cut lion skins into thousands of pieces to cross borders more easily and avoid detection in local markets.' Since partnering with Niokolo-Koba in 2016, Panthera has helped strengthen security measures. The conservation group tripled the park's anti-poaching force from 20 to 60 agents, equipping them with vehicles and gear, while investing more than $7 million in infrastructure – including a ranger base with an airstrip, hundreds of camera traps, and new roads and bridges. Lions' fate may depend on convincing marabouts to change Yet the crisis' roots run deeper than poaching. At its heart are the marabouts whose gris-gris prescriptions drive the trade. Those involved often see no contradiction between their prescription or purchase of lion parts and their desire to protect the species, the Panthera report found. As one marabout, Cheikh Camara, put it in an interview with The Associated Press: 'I prescribe the gris-gris to help people get better. It's the poaching that's making the lions go extinct.' At the park's headquarters, the scale of the challenge is clear. A storeroom overflows with confiscated skins — leopards, lions, antelopes, even a crocodile. A rusting phalanx of seized firearms hangs on the wall. 'Sometimes the poachers fire at you,' said Diouf, the sergeant. 'It's very risky.' Such dangers are compounded by Senegal's toothless hunting and wildlife laws, which date to 1986. Recent arrests include a Burkinabe man found with leopard and lion parts who was sentenced to just one month in prison, while a Malian trafficker received the same penalty for smuggling leopard skins. One vendor told AP he can get a little over $3 for a small bit of lion skin that makes a single gris-gris. A belt can go for the equivalent of nearly $80, he said. The Panthera report said an entire lion skin can fetch the equivalent of $1,900 or more. 'The sentences are too short,' said Ndeye Seck, the head of litigation and armament for the parks department. 'We would like to see the hunting and protection of wildlife codes updated.' Ngom, the environment minister who assumed his role early last year, said pushing through tougher laws will be a priority for his team. But the battle to protect Senegal's lions is as much about culture as enforcement, and lasting change will require rethinking the role of gris-gris in modern Senegalese society, Babou said. 'Culture is very powerful,' he said. 'Until you can convince people that there are more effective tools to achieve your goals, then they will continue to believe in it.'	https://www.voanews.com/a/mystical-beliefs-fuel-senegal-s-illegal-big-cat-trade/7982878.html	2025-02-22T23:42:13-08:00	
Afghan women's radio station to resume broadcasts after Taliban say they're lifting suspension	An Afghan women's radio station will resume broadcasts after the Taliban suspended its operations, citing 'unauthorized provision' of content to an overseas TV channel and improperly using its license. Radio Begum launched on International Women's Day in March 2021, five months before the Taliban seized power amid the chaotic withdrawal of U.S. and NATO troops. The station's content is produced entirely by Afghan women. Its sister satellite channel, Begum TV, operates from France and broadcasts programs that cover the Afghan school curriculum from seventh to 12th grade. The Taliban have banned education for women and girls in the country beyond grade six. In a statement issued Saturday night, the Taliban's Information and Culture Ministry said Radio Begum had 'repeatedly requested' to restart operations and that the suspension was lifted after the station made commitments to authorities. The station pledged to conduct broadcasts 'in accordance with the principles of journalism and the regulations of the Islamic Emirate of Afghanistan, and to avoid any violations in the future,' it added. The ministry did not elaborate what those principles and regulations were. Radio Begum was not immediately available for comment. Since their takeover, the Taliban have excluded women from education, many kinds of work, and public spaces. Journalists, especially women, have lost their jobs as the Taliban tighten their grip on the media. In the 2024 press freedom index from Reporters without Borders, Afghanistan ranks 178 out of 180 countries. The year before that it ranked 152. The Information Ministry did not initially identify the TV channel it alleged Radio Begum had been working with. But the Saturday statement mentioned collaboration with 'foreign sanctioned media outlets.'	https://www.voanews.com/a/afghan-women-s-radio-station-to-resume-broadcasts-after-taliban-say-they-re-lifting-suspension/7984936.html	2025-02-22T23:39:46-08:00	
Well-off Hong Kong daunted by record deficits	HONG KONG — Hong Kong is facing its toughest fiscal test in three decades following a painful run of mammoth deficits, with experts urging the government to make careful cuts as the economy wobbles. The Chinese finance hub last saw a string of deficits after the Asian financial crisis in the late 1990s -- but their scale was a fraction of the $32.4 billion shortfall in the 2020-21 fiscal year. Hong Kong has recorded annual deficits exceeding $20 billion in three of the past four years, according to official figures. The city's finance chief, Paul Chan, said Sunday that the deficits were caused by 'multiple internal and external challenges' and that a new budget unveiled on Wednesday will tightly control public spending. While Chan earlier predicted a return to surplus in 'three or so years,' a former government minister told AFP that the situation is 'not just due to economic cycles' spurred by the coronavirus pandemic. 'If you look at Hong Kong versus other economies in the region, for example Singapore, those other economies have done much better,' said Anthony Cheung, who oversaw transport and housing policies. Adding to the headache is the exodus of companies and high-paid workers as the city's international reputation took a hit after Beijing quelled pro-democracy protests and imposed a sweeping national security law in 2020. Singapore and Hong Kong suffered towering deficits in 2020 because of the pandemic, but the former has been able to keep spending relative to income in check as firms shift there from the Chinese city, helping it outperform its fiscal targets. The challenge for Hong Kong is not just to balance its books, but to find fiscal sustainability amid U.S.-China tensions and a slowdown in the world's second-largest economy, Cheung said. 'In the past, we assumed that Hong Kong was geopolitically well-positioned. ... Now we have to be more careful about such presumptions.' Plunging land sales Hong Kong is required by its mini-constitution to 'strive to achieve a fiscal balance' -- a holdover from British colonial rule that kept the market mostly free from government intervention. After returning to China in 1997, it kept taxes low and refilled its coffers with the help of land-related revenue, selling land to developers with deep pockets. But last year Hong Kong collected just $2.5 billion that way, from a peak of $21.2 billion in 2018. '[Land-related revenue] by itself has contributed to the majority of the income decline,' said Yang Liu, a financial economist at the University of Hong Kong. 'We have a very inactive land market and declining housing prices. That's one reason that people [don't] trade, so there's no tax [income],' Liu told AFP. Hong Kong still has healthy cash reserves and low government debt compared with most economies around the world. But the prospect of three straight years in the red has fueled public debate on how to spend less. 'All the new initiatives will be under much stronger scrutiny, so [the government} will be a lot more disciplined, a lot more careful,' Liu said. In his upcoming budget speech, the finance chief is set to put the latest deficit at 'under HK$100 billion,' or $13 billion, adjusting for money raised from bond sales. There are calls to roll back a transport subsidy for those aged 60 to 64, which can grow into a major burden on the government as Hong Kong's population ages. Lawmaker Edmund Wong cautioned against pay cuts for civil servants, which he said may cause private-sector employers to follow suit, but urged the government to slim down. 'In the long term, we can greatly reduce the manpower which the government is employing now,' he told AFP. 'Welcoming' image The deficits could prompt Hong Kong to rethink how it makes money, though past discussions on expanding the tax base -- such as a goods and services tax -- went nowhere. The city's low ratio of debt to gross domestic product -- which the government last year put at no more than 13% -- means it can afford to issue bonds to fund huge undertakings, experts say. Officials have signaled they will push ahead with a massive infrastructure project in northern Hong Kong, while backing away from a separate plan to create artificial islands. As tensions flare between the United States and China, Hong Kong is seeking untapped growth potential in the Middle East and Southeast Asia that can translate to government revenue down the line. The city's economic fortunes are ultimately tied to how investors view the city as a regional and global hub, said Cheung, the former minister. 'We have to continue to showcase Hong Kong as a city that welcomes all kinds of views, all kinds of people, so long as they stay within the parameters of the national security legislation,' Cheung said.	https://www.voanews.com/a/well-off-hong-kong-daunted-by-record-deficits/7984933.html	2025-02-22T22:56:59-08:00	
Discontented Germany votes in an election with economy, migration and far-right strength in focus	BERLIN — German voters are choosing a new government in an election Sunday dominated by worries about the yearslong stagnation of Europe's biggest economy, pressure to curb migration and growing uncertainty over the future of Ukraine and Europe's alliance with the United States. The center-right opposition is favored to win, while polls point to the strongest result for a far-right party since World War II. Germany is the most populous country in the 27-nation European Union and a leading member of NATO. It has been Ukraine's second-biggest weapons supplier, after the U.S. It will be central to shaping the continent's response to the challenges of the coming years, including the Trump administration's confrontational foreign and trade policy. What are Germans voting for? More than 59 million people in the nation of 84 million are eligible to elect the 630 members of the lower house of parliament, the Bundestag, who will take their seats under the glass dome of Berlin's landmark Reichstag building. Germany's electoral system rarely produces absolute majorities, and no party looks anywhere near one this time. It's expected that two or more parties will form a coalition, following potentially difficult negotiations that will take weeks or even months before the Bundestag elects the next chancellor. This election is taking place seven months before it was originally planned after center-left Chancellor Olaf Scholz's coalition collapsed in November, three years into a term that was increasingly marred by infighting. There's widespread discontent and not much enthusiasm for any of the candidates. Who could take charge? Center-right opposition leader Friedrich Merz's Union bloc has consistently led polls, with 28-32% support in the most recent surveys, and Merz is favored to replace Scholz. Scholz's Social Democrats have been polling between 14% and 16%, which would be their worst postwar result in a national parliamentary election. The far-right, anti-immigration Alternative for Germany, or AfD, has been running in second place with around 20% of the vote — well above its previous best of 12.6% in a national election, from 2017 — and has fielded its first candidate for chancellor in Alice Weidel. But other parties say they won't work with it, a stance often known as the 'firewall.' The environmentalist Greens also are running for the top job, with outgoing Vice Chancellor Robert Habeck, but have been polling a little behind Scholz's party. Merz has pledged 'stability instead of chaos' after Scholz's three-party coalition collapsed following long-running internal arguments, including over how to revitalize the economy. But it's unclear whether the conservative leader, if he wins, will be able to put together a stable government that does much better. Merz hopes for a two-party coalition but may end up needing a third partner to form a government. The realistic candidates to join a Merz government are Scholz's Social Democrats, the Greens and the pro-business Free Democrats — who were the smallest partner in Scholz's collapsed government and may not manage to stay in parliament. The Free Democrats and another small party are hovering are hovering at around 5% of the vote, the threshold to qualify for seats in parliament. If they do, there may be no majority for a two-party coalition. What are the main issues? The contenders have made contrasting proposals to turn around the German economy, which has shrunk for the past two years and hasn't managed real growth in much longer. That's going to be a central job for the new government. Migration moved to the forefront of the campaign in the past month following deadly attacks committed by immigrants. Merz vowed to bar people from entering the country without proper papers and to step up deportations if he is elected chancellor. He then brought a nonbinding motion calling for many more migrants to be turned back at Germany's borders. Parliament approved it by a narrow majority thanks to AfD votes — a first in postwar Germany. Rivals made Merz's attitude toward AfD, which generated protests, an issue. Scholz accused Merz of 'irresponsible gambling' and breaking a taboo. Merz has rejected those accusations, saying that he didn't and won't work with AfD. He has repeatedly and categorically said since that his party will 'never' do so. Mainstream parties have vowed to keep up support for Ukraine in its war against Russia. And after the Scholz government reached a NATO target of spending 2% of gross domestic product on defense, the next administration will have to find a way to keep that going — and likely expand it, in the face of U.S. demands — once a special 100 billion-euro ($105 billion) fund to modernize the military is used up in 2027.	https://www.voanews.com/a/discontented-germany-votes-in-an-election-with-economy-migration-and-far-right-strength-in-focus/7984932.html	2025-02-22T22:39:55-08:00	
New FBI Director Patel will also be named acting head of firearms agency, official says	WASHINGTON — New FBI Director Kash Patel is expected to be named the acting head of the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives, a Justice Department official said Saturday. Patel could be sworn in next week, the official said, putting Patel in charge of two of the Justice Department's largest agencies in an unusual arrangement that raises questions about the future of the bureau that has long drawn the ire of conservatives. The Justice Department official spoke on the condition of anonymity to discuss the move before it's announced publicly. White House officials didn't immediately respond to a request for comment Saturday evening. Patel was sworn in Friday as FBI director after winning Senate approval despite Democrats' concerns about the steadfast Trump ally's plans to radically overhaul the FBI. ATF is a separate agency with about 5,500 employees and is responsible for enforcing the nation's laws around firearms, explosives and arson. Among other things, it's in charge of licensing federal firearms dealers, tracing guns used in crimes and analyzing intelligence in shooting investigations. The move was first reported Saturday by ABC News. The news comes days after Attorney General Pam Bondi fired the ATF's top lawyer. Bondi said in a Fox News interview Friday that she fired chief counsel Pamela Hicks because the agency was 'targeting gun owners.' Hicks, who spent more than 20 years as a Justice Department lawyer, said in a social media post that being ATF chief counsel was the 'highest honor' of her career. Conservatives have long railed against ATF over its role in regulating firearms and have suggested shuttering the agency. Under the Biden administration, the ATF advanced new regulations aimed at cracking down on ghost guns and requiring thousands more firearms dealers to run background checks on buyers at gun shows or other places outside brick-and-mortar stores. In an executive order earlier this month, President Donald Trump directed the attorney general to review all actions taken by the Biden administration around firearms 'to assess any ongoing infringements of the Second Amendment rights of our citizens.' Gun safety groups have raised alarm about putting Patel in charge of the FBI, with gun control group Brady calling him a 'known gun rights extremist.' Gun Owners of America, a gun rights group, called his confirmation as FBI director 'a major victory for gun owners and constitutional rights advocates nationwide.' The last confirmed ATF director was Steve Dettelbach, a former federal prosecutor, who led the agency from July 2022 until last month. He was the first confirmed director since 2015 as both Republican and Democratic administrations failed to get nominees through the politically fraught process.	https://www.voanews.com/a/new-fbi-director-patel-will-also-be-named-acting-head-of-firearms-agency-official-says/7984917.html	2025-02-22T20:01:31-08:00	
Israel delays release of Palestinian prisoners, citing 'humiliating' handovers of hostages	TEL AVIV, ISRAEL — Israel says the release of hundreds of Palestinian prisoners is delayed 'until the release of the next hostages has been assured, and without the humiliating ceremonies' at handovers of Israeli captives in Gaza. The statement by Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's office early Sunday came as vehicles apparently carrying prisoners left the open gates of Ofer prison, only to turn around and go back in. The release of 620 Palestinian prisoners had been delayed for several hours and was meant to occur just after six Israeli hostages were released Saturday. It was meant to be the largest one-day prisoner release in the Gaza ceasefire's first phase. Israel's announcement abruptly put the future of the truce into further doubt. The Palestinian Authority's commission for prisoners' affairs confirmed the delay 'until further notice.' The Associated Press video, recorded in the West Bank, showed prisoners' families, waiting outdoors in near-freezing weather, apparently dispersing. One woman was shown walking away in tears. The six were the last living hostages expected to be freed under the ceasefire's first phase, with a week remaining in the initial stage. Talks on the ceasefire's second phase are yet to start. The six included three Israeli men seized from the Nova music festival and another taken while visiting family in southern Israel during the October 7, 2023, attack led by Hamas, a U.S.-designated terrorist organization, that triggered the 16-month war in Gaza. The two others were held for a decade after entering Gaza on their own. Omer Wenkert, Omer Shem Tov and Eliya Cohen were released together. Cohen's family and friends in Israel chanted 'Eliya! Eliya! Eliya!' and cheered. 'You're heroes,' Shem Tov told his parents as they later embraced, laughing and crying. 'You have no idea how much I dreamt of you.' His father, Malki Shem Tov, told public broadcaster Kan his son was held alone after the first 50 days and lost 17 kilograms (37 pounds). Earlier Saturday, Tal Shoham, 40, and Avera Mengistu, 38, were freed. Mengistu, an Ethiopian-Israeli, entered Gaza in 2014. His family told Israeli media he has struggled with mental health issues. The Israeli-Austrian Shoham was taken from Kibbutz Be'eri. His wife and two children were freed in a 2023 exchange. Later, Israel's military said Hisham Al-Sayed, 36, was released. The Bedouin-Israeli entered Gaza in 2015. His family had told Israeli media he was previously diagnosed with schizophrenia. Accusations of 'stalling' Israel's government didn't respond to questions about the delay in releasing prisoners. Hamas accused Israel of violating the ceasefire deal, with spokesperson Abdel Latif Al-Qanou accusing Netanyahu of 'deliberately stalling.' The hostage release followed a heartrending dispute when Hamas on Thursday handed over the wrong body for Shiri Bibas, an Israeli mother abducted with her two young boys. The remains were determined to be those of an unnamed Palestinian woman. Netanyahu vowed revenge for 'a cruel and malicious violation.' Hamas suggested it was a mistake. Israeli forensic authorities confirmed a body handed over Friday was Bibas. Dr. Chen Kugel, head of the National Institute of Forensic Medicine, said they found no evidence Bibas and her children were killed in an Israeli airstrike, as Hamas has claimed. Kugel did not give a cause. Difficult talks likely The ceasefire deal has paused the deadliest and most devastating fighting ever between Israel and Hamas, but there are fears the war will resume. Negotiations on the ceasefire's second phase are likely to be more difficult. Hamas had said it will release four bodies next week, completing the truce's first phase. After that, Hamas will hold over 60 hostages — about half believed to be alive. Hamas has said it won't release the remaining captives without a lasting ceasefire and full Israeli withdrawal from Gaza. Netanyahu, with the backing of U.S. President Donald Trump's administration, says he's committed to destroying Hamas' military and governing capacities and returning all hostages, goals widely seen as mutually exclusive. Israel's military offensive has killed more than 48,000 Palestinians, mostly women and children, according to Gaza's Hamas-run Health Ministry, which doesn't distinguish between civilians and combatants. Israel says it has killed more than 17,000 Hamas terrorists, without providing evidence. The offensive destroyed vast areas of Gaza, reducing entire neighborhoods to rubble. At its height, the war displaced 90% of Gaza's 2.3 million population. The October 7, 2023, terrorist attack killed about 1,200 people, mostly civilians. Hundreds of Israeli soldiers have died in the war.	https://www.voanews.com/a/israel-delays-release-of-palestinian-prisoners-citing-humiliating-handovers-of-hostages-/7984903.html	2025-02-22T18:28:53-08:00	
Pakistan threatens to deport Afghans if US relocation timeline isn’t met	ISLAMABAD — Pakistan has warned that thousands of Afghan nationals awaiting relocation and resettlement in the United States will be deported to Afghanistan if their cases are rejected or not processed on time. Foreign Minister Ishaq Dar issued the warning during a television interview aired Saturday, noting that the U.S. has promised to relocate the Afghan community in question from Pakistan 'tentatively around September this year.' His office in Islamabad released the interview excerpts. 'If any refugee who was undertaken to be taken by another country after due process —no matter the timeline — if it doesn’t happen and the country refuses, then for us, that will be an illegal immigrant in Pakistan, and we might be forced to send such refugee back to [their] original country, which is Afghanistan,' Dar told Turkey’s TRT national broadcaster. However, the chief Pakistani diplomat expressed Islamabad’s willingness to resolve the issue with Washington, stating that his government is 'examining the situation and will negotiate [accordingly].' Last month, U.S. President Donald Trump halted refugee applications and travel plans until further notice to ensure that refugee entry into the United States aligns with its national interests. The decision has stranded around 45,000 Afghans prepared to fly out of Afghanistan and at least 15,000 qualified refugees currently in Pakistan, according to #AfghanEvac, a coalition that assists Afghans with their relocation and resettlement in the U.S. These individuals were part of Afghan families who fled their country following the Taliban insurgents’ retaking of power in 2021, primarily seeking refuge from potential retribution because of their affiliations with the U.S. and NATO forces during their nearly two-decade-long presence in Afghanistan. While about 80,000 of these Afghans have since been relocated from Pakistan, officials in Islamabad assert that around 40,000 remain in a state of limbo including around 15,000 in Pakistan destined for the United States. Since launching a crackdown on undocumented foreign migrants in September 2023, Pakistan has forcibly repatriated more than 825,000 undocumented Afghan refugees to their home country, according to the United Nations. The government has recently intensified its crackdown, targeting both documented and undocumented Afghan refugees. Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif ordered authorities last month to remove all Afghans from Islamabad and the adjoining city of Rawalpindi by Feb. 28 before arranging for deporting them to Afghanistan along with others subsequently. The targeted population encompasses over 2.5 million Afghans nationwide, comprising lawful refugees, documented economic migrants, and those without legal authorization to remain in Pakistan. Sharif’s directive stipulates March 31 as the deadline for the United States and other countries to process the cases of Afghans awaiting resettlements, thereby preventing their deportation.	https://www.voanews.com/a/pakistan-threatens-to-deport-afghans-if-us-relocation-timeline-isn-t-met/7984905.html	2025-02-22T18:20:28-08:00	
Macron, Starmer to meet Trump, offer ideas for Ukraine security guarantees	LONDON/PARIS — French President Emmanuel Macron and British Prime Minister Keir Starmer will travel to Washington next week amid alarm in Europe over U.S. President Donald Trump's hardening stance toward Ukraine and overtures to Moscow on the three-year conflict. The leaders of Europe's two nuclear powers, who will be traveling separately, are expected to try to persuade Trump not to rush into a ceasefire deal with Vladimir Putin at any cost, keep Europe involved and discuss military guarantees to Ukraine. Macron, who is trying to capitalize on a relationship with Trump built during their first presidential terms, has said agreeing to a bad deal that would amount to a capitulation of Ukraine would signal weakness to the United States' foes, including China and Iran. 'I will tell him: deep down you cannot be weak in the face of President (Putin). It's not you, it's not what you're made of and it's not in your interests,' he said in an hourlong question and answer session on social media ahead of Monday's visit to the White House. The visits come amid a rift between Trump and Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy, whom Trump described as a 'dictator.' That has alarmed Kyiv's European allies, already reeling from a more aggressive U.S. posture on trade, diplomacy and even domestic European politics. Philip Golub, a professor in international relations at the American University in Paris, said Trump's rapid-fire moves in his first weeks in office, as well as the rhetoric from other U.S. officials, had been a major shock for the Europeans. 'They could not have expected that somehow within the United States would emerge this ultra-nationalist coalition of forces that would actually challenge Europe's voice in world affairs in such a stark and strong way,' he told Reuters. He said Macron believed he had a 'historic role to play' in going to Washington to ensure Europe can weigh in on the ultimate negotiations on Ukraine. 'Whether he can actually achieve something, however, in this visit is an entirely different matter,' he added. Starmer, who has also warned the end of the war cannot be a 'temporary pause before Putin attacks again,' will be in Washington on Thursday. Speaking on a Fox News podcast on Friday, Trump said Macron and Starmer had not 'done anything' to end the war. 'No meetings with Russia!' he said, although he described Macron as 'a friend of mine' and Starmer as 'a very nice guy.' However, the two countries are keen to show Trump they are ready to take on a bigger burden for European security. Britain and France are firming up ideas with allies for military guarantees for Ukraine and their two leaders will seek to persuade Trump to provide U.S. assurances in any post ceasefire deal, Western officials said. Their respective militaries began initial planning last summer for the post-war scenario, but the discussions accelerated in November after Trump secured the U.S. presidency, a French military official and two diplomats said. They have also been supported in putting together an array of options by countries like Denmark and the Baltic states as Europeans discuss what they would be ready to do should there be an accord and peacekeepers required, officials said. While both Britain and France have ruled out sending troops to Ukraine immediately, the plans, still in concept stage, center around providing air, maritime, land and cyber support that would aim to deter Russia from launching any future attacks, Western officials said. Air and sea assets could be based in Poland or Romania, restoring safe international air space and ensuring the Black Sea remained safe for international shipping, the official said. Part of the British and French talks center around the possibility of sending European peacekeepers. While U.S. boots on the ground may not be necessary, deterrence in the form of U.S. medium-range missiles and ultimately nuclear weapons will remain crucial. The options being discussed would center not on providing troops for the frontline or the 2,000-kilometer border which would remain secured by Ukrainian forces, but further to the West, three European diplomats and the military official said. Those troops could be tasked with protecting key Ukrainian infrastructure such as ports or nuclear facilities to reassure the Ukrainian population. However, Russia has made it clear it would oppose a European presence in Ukraine. A French military official said there was little sense in talking numbers at this stage because it would depend on what was finally agreed, what international mandate was given and whether non-European troops would also be involved. 'It's not about the numbers of troops in Ukraine. It's the ability to mobilize and the ability to arrange everything into a package of interoperability units,' the French official said. A Western official said that even 30,000 troops could be on the 'high side.'	https://www.voanews.com/a/macron-starmer-to-meet-trump-offer-ideas-for-ukraine-security-guarantees/7984899.html	2025-02-22T17:57:16-08:00	
Poland pays for Ukraine's Starlink subscription, says its deputy PM	WARSAW, POLAND — Poland said Saturday it has been paying for Ukraine's Starlink subscription and will continue to do so despite sources saying the United States could consider cutting Ukraine's access to the satellite internet system. U.S. negotiators pressing Kyiv for access to Ukraine's critical minerals have raised the possibility of cutting the country's access to Elon Musk's vital Starlink satellite internet system, sources familiar with the matter told Reuters. Starlink provides crucial internet connectivity to the war-torn country and its military. 'We pay and will continue to pay a subscription fee for satellite internet for Ukraine,' Poland's Deputy Prime Minister Krzysztof Gawkowski said in a post on Musk-owned social media platform X. 'I cannot imagine that someone could decide to terminate a business contract for a commercial service to which Poland is a party,' added Gawkowski, who is also Poland's digital affairs minister. SpaceX, which operates Starlink, did not immediately respond to an email seeking comment. Ukrainian military officials did not immediately reply to a request for comment. Poland has delivered 20,000 Starlink units to Ukraine since Russia's invasion in February 2022, and has been funding their maintenance to support internet connectivity, according to information on the Polish presidency's website. President Andrzej Duda will meet Donald Trump later Saturday during a visit to the United States, amid a widening rift between Trump and President Volodymyr Zelenskyy that has alarmed Kyiv's European allies.	https://www.voanews.com/a/poland-pays-for-ukraine-s-starlink-subscription-says-its-deputy-pm/7984648.html	2025-02-22T17:43:12-08:00	
Musk orders US federal workers to describe what they did at work last week or get fired	WASHINGTON — Elon Musk, the billionaire head of the Trump administration's Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE), threatened Saturday to fire any federal worker who fails to explain what work they have accomplished during the previous week. The threat, issued in a post on the social media site X, was made just hours after President Donald Trump posted on his own social media network Truth Social that DOGE should get more aggressive in its attempts to downsize and reshape the federal workforce. 'All federal employees will shortly receive an email requesting to understand what they got done last week,' Musk posted on X. 'Failure to respond will be taken as a resignation.' As of Saturday evening, emails were sent to employees at federal agencies including the Securities and Exchange Commission, National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and others with the subject line, 'What did you do last week?' The email, seen by Reuters, asks employees to reply to the email they have received with five bullet points summarizing 'what you accomplished at work last week' and copy their managers. The email sent from a human resources address gives employees until 11:59 p.m. Eastern Standard Time on Monday to respond. It is unclear what legal basis Musk has to terminate federal workers if they fail to respond to his request. Workers at the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau also received the email Saturday, according to people with knowledge of the matter. However, most agency staff had been ordered not to perform any tasks since early this month, creating a conundrum. The agency is also under a temporary court order not to resume mass firings pending the outcome of legal proceedings. A spokesperson for DOGE did not immediately respond to a request for comment. The AFGE, the union representing federal employees, said in a statement it will challenge any 'unlawful terminations.' 'Once again, Elon Musk and the Trump administration have shown their utter disdain for federal employees and the critical services they provide to the American people,' said AFGE National President Everett Kelley. The Trump administration's fast-paced and controversial process to reduce government spending by shrinking the federal workforce led by Musk and his young aides at the cost-cutting DOGE has led to haphazard firings that resulted in numerous mistakes and forced several agencies to quickly rehire vital employees, such as those working on nuclear safety, defense and power generation. The first wave of job cuts has targeted workers who are easier to fire, such as employees on the job for less than two years or those who have started new roles within an agency. The indiscriminate firings have led to DOGE terminating people whose jobs are not funded by taxpayers and have begun to anger people across the country who are concerned about a loss of services as well as the impact of federal job losses on local economies. Trump has repeatedly talked about Musk as the functional leader of DOGE, which is not a Cabinet-level department, but the White House said in a court filing earlier this month that Musk had no authority over DOGE and was not an employee of the program.	https://www.voanews.com/a/musk-orders-us-federal-workers-to-describe-what-they-did-at-work-last-week-or-get-fired-/7984891.html	2025-02-22T17:21:48-08:00	
Officer killed after gunman takes hostages at Pennsylvania hospital	YORK, PENNSYLVANIA — A man armed with a pistol and carrying zip ties entered a Pennsylvania hospital's intensive care unit Saturday and took staff members hostage before he was killed by police in a shootout that also left an officer dead, authorities said. Three workers at UPMC Memorial Hospital, including a doctor, a nurse and a custodian, and two other officers were shot and wounded in the attack, York County District Attorney Tim Barker said. A fourth staffer was injured in a fall. Gunfire erupted after officers went to engage the shooter, whom Barker identified as Diogenes Archangel-Ortiz, 49. He said Archangel-Ortiz was holding at gunpoint a female staff member who had her hands bound with zip ties when police opened fire. 'This is a huge loss to our community,' Barker said at a news conference following the shooting. 'It is absolutely clear, and beyond any and all doubt, that the officers were justified in taking their action using deadly force.' Barker added that while the investigation is in its early stages, it appears Archangel-Ortiz had previous contact with the hospital's ICU earlier in the week for 'a medical purpose involving another individual' and he intentionally targeted the workers there. No one answered the door Saturday at an address in York believed to be that of Archangel-Ortiz. The officer who died was identified as Andrew Duarte of the West York Borough Police Department. 'We all have broken hearts and are grieving at his loss,' West York Borough Manager Shawn Mauck told The Associated Press. Duarte was a law enforcement veteran who joined the department in 2022 after five years with the Denver Police Department, according to his LinkedIn profile. He described receiving a 'hero award' in 2021 from Mothers Against Drunk Driving for his work in impaired driving enforcement for the state of Colorado. 'I have a type A personality and like to succeed in all that I do,' his LinkedIn profile said. Duarte also worked as a patrol officer in Denver, was highly regarded for his work and was close friends with other officers, the department there said in a statement. At a makeshift memorial on the front steps of the West York Borough Police Department, Linda Shields dropped off roses Saturday and dabbed tears as she thought of her son, a police officer in Maryland. 'He was so young,' Shields said of Duarte. 'It makes no sense at all.' Pennsylvania Gov. Josh Shapiro called the attack on police and health care workers 'the act of a coward.' 'Let it not be lost on anyone the act of extraordinary bravery and courage by the health care workers here, by the law enforcement professionals … who ran toward danger to keep people safe,' Shapiro said. UPMC Memorial is a five-story, 104-bed hospital that opened in 2019 in York, a city of about 40,000 people known for its creation of York Peppermint Patties in 1940. The shooting is part of a wave of gun violence in recent years that has swept through U.S. hospitals and medical centers, which have struggled to adapt to the growing threats. Such attacks have helped make health care one of the nation's most violent fields, with workers suffering more nonfatal injuries from workplace violence than workers in any other profession, according to the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. In 2023, a shooter killed a security guard in the lobby of New Hampshire’s state psychiatric hospital before being fatally shot by a state trooper. In 2022, a man killed two workers at a Dallas hospital while there to watch his child’s birth. In May of that year, a man opened fire in a medical center waiting room in Atlanta, killing one woman and wounding four. And just one month later, a gunman killed his surgeon and three other people at a Tulsa, Oklahoma, medical office because he blamed the doctor for his continuing pain after an operation.	https://www.voanews.com/a/officer-killed-after-gunman-takes-hostages-at-pennsylvania-hospital/7984890.html	2025-02-22T17:06:18-08:00	
Trump revels in mass federal firings, jeers at Biden before CPAC crowd	OXON HILL, MARYLAND — President Donald Trump said Saturday that 'nobody has ever seen anything' like his administration's sweeping effort to fire thousands of federal employees and shrink the size of government. Addressing an adoring crowd at the Conservative Political Action Conference in suburban Washington, Trump said, 'We're going to forge a new and lasting political majority that will drive American politics for generations to come.' The president has spent the opening weeks of his administration arguing that voters in November gave him a mandate to overhaul government while cracking down on the U.S.-Mexico border and to extend tax cuts that were the signature policy of his first administration. In a speech that lasted more than an hour, Trump predicted that the Republican Party would defy history, which has shown that a president's party typically struggles during midterm congressional elections. Of Republicans, he said, 'I don't think we've been at this level, maybe ever.' 'Nobody's ever seen anything like this, and nobody's ever seen four weeks like we had,' Trump said, likening his new administration's opening month to being on a roll through the first four holes of a round of golf, which he said gave him confidence for the fifth. Trump has empowered billionaire Elon Musk to help carry out the firings; Musk vowed Saturday that more might be coming. 'Consistent with President @realDonaldTrump's instructions, all federal employees will shortly receive an email requesting to understand what they got done last week,' Musk posted on X, which he owns. 'Failure to respond will be taken as a resignation.' Trump also repeatedly said Saturday that he'd carry out harder-line immigration policies. But those efforts have largely been overshadowed by his administration's mass federal firings. He announced that one agency that had been significantly reduced, the U.S. Agency for International Development, would have its Washington office taken over by Customs and Border Protection officials. 'The agency's name has been removed from its former building,' he said. The president also repeated his previous promises that his administration will scrutinize the country's gold depository at Fort Knox. 'Would anybody like to join us?' he said to cheers from the crowd. 'We want to see if the gold is still there.' 'Donald, don't get angry' But Trump also devoted large parts of his address to last year's presidential race, jeering at former President Joe Biden and mispronouncing the first name of former Vice President Kamala Harris — his Election Day opponent. He also mentioned Senator Elizabeth Warren, a Democrat who ran for president in 2020. The president said immigration and border policy under Biden made him angry. 'I couldn't stand it,' Trump said, before cautioning himself, 'Donald, don't get angry.' He went on to use an expletive to describe what he thinks of Biden's handling of border security, despite noting that evangelical conservatives have urged him not to use foul language. Trump had kinder words for Chinese President Xi Jinping, saying 'I happen to like' him, while adding, 'we've been treated very unfairly by China and many other countries.' President meets with world leaders On the sidelines of the conference, Trump met with conservative Polish President Andrzej Duda amid rising tensions in Europe over Russia's war in Ukraine. After he took the stage, Trump saluted Duda and Argentine President Javier Milei, who separately addressed the conference. Trump called Duda 'a fantastic man and a great friend of mine.' He noted that Milei was 'a MAGA guy, too, Make Argentina Great Again.' Duda is a populist who has enjoyed a close relationship with Trump in years past. Poland is a longtime ally of Ukraine. Trump upended recent U.S. policy by dispatching top foreign policy advisers to Saudi Arabia for direct talks with Russian officials that were aimed at ending fighting in Ukraine. Those meetings did not include Ukrainian or European officials, which has alarmed U.S. allies. After his face-to-face with Duda, Trump is meeting Monday at the White House with French President Emmanuel Macron and Thursday with British Prime Minister Keir Starmer. Trump also has begun a public back and forth with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy, whom the U.S. president called a 'dictator' while falsely suggesting that Ukraine started the war — though on Friday he acknowledged that Russia attacked its neighbor. Trump said during his speech, 'I'm dealing with President Zelenskyy. I'm dealing with President Putin' and added of fighting in Ukraine, 'It affects Europe. It doesn't really affect us.' About ending the war in Ukraine, Trump said Saturday, 'I think we're pretty close to a deal, and we better be close to a deal.' Later, the president and first lady Melania Trump were hosting an evening reception and dinner at the White House for the National Governors Association, which was holding their own weekend meetings in Washington.	https://www.voanews.com/a/trump-revels-in-mass-federal-firings-jeers-at-biden-before-cpac-crowd-/7984872.html	2025-02-22T16:37:50-08:00	
6 dead, 78 injured after roof of Peru shopping mall collapses	LIMA, PERU — The collapse of a food court roof at a shopping mall in northwestern Peru killed six people and left at least 78 others injured, the defense minister said Saturday. The heavy iron roof at the Real Plaza Trujillo shopping mall, a city in the La Libertad region, fell Friday night on dozens of people who were at the site. Defense Minister Walter Astudillo said at a news conference that according to the information provided by local firefighters in La Libertad, five people died on site and a sixth at a hospital after the collapse. Astudillo also said that 30 injured people have already been discharged and 48 remain hospitalized. Three remained in critical condition. The minister expressed his condolences to the victims' families. Luis Roncal, head of the local fire department, confirmed that they 'did not find any signs of life' as they monitored with rescue dogs, but said that the search for survivors would continue with more than 100 firefighters and police officers searching through the debris. Dozens of families were in the food court of the shopping mall when the roof collapsed, according to local media reports. The Real Plaza shopping complex in Trujillo, the country's third-largest city, is located about 500 kilometers (310 miles) north of the capital Lima. 'There is a child trapped' under the roof's metal structures, said local government health official Anibal Morillo to broadcaster Panamericana. Interior Minister Juan Jose Santivanez estimated the collapsed roof area was 700 to 800 square meters. 'We need hydraulic cranes to lift part of the roof that has not yet been removed because it is so heavy and to continue rescue operations for those who may be trapped,' the minister told Canal N television channel. According to the Regional Emergency Operations Center, the collapse occurred at 8:41 p.m. local time but was reported about half an hour later. Some information in this report is from The Associated Press.	https://www.voanews.com/a/dead-78-injured-after-roof-of-peru-shopping-mall-collapses/7984708.html	2025-02-22T16:11:18-08:00	
US, Uzbekistan reaffirm commitment to Central Asia security	WASHINGTON — As the Trump administration begins to engage with Central Asia, Uzbekistan has expressed eagerness to expand its strategic partnership, highlighting what it calls its 'enhanced' political dialogue on bilateral and regional issues and security cooperation, including its 'solid connection' with the Mississippi National Guard. The U.S. recently got back its seven Black Hawk helicopters from Uzbekistan that Afghan military pilots had flown there in 2021 while fleeing the Taliban. This transfer and other bilateral exchanges within the last month have underscored Tashkent's role as Washington's key partner in Central Asia, according to U.S. officials. However, analysts see the military relationship as largely transactional and shaped by geopolitical complexities and regional tensions. Talk between diplomats In a phone conversation on February 21 with Uzbek Foreign Minister Bakhtiyor Saidov, U.S. Secretary of State Marco Rubio reiterated U.S. support for the country's independence, sovereignty, and territorial integrity, according to State Department's spokesperson Tammy Bruce. They discussed a joint effort through the C5+1 diplomatic platform, launched nearly a decade ago between Washington and five Central Asian republics. The Trump administration is interested in using this platform to support 'a more peaceful and prosperous Central Asia.' Saidov described his talk with Rubio as 'candid and productive,' aiming to expand the 'strategic partnership between our nations in all spheres without an exception. Building strong bridges between business communities, increasing trade volume in both directions, ensuring prosperous development in Central Asia.' Cooperation with Pentagon, ties with Mississippi Uzbek Ambassador Furqat Sidikov says his country's forces 'have stood shoulder-to-shoulder with the Mississippi National Guard in the best ways,' citing joint exercises and Pentagon-sponsored professional exchanges. 'We are a reliable partner of the United States in the region,' Sidikov said at a January 31 embassy reception, pointing to defense reforms and improvements in the Uzbek military's equipment. Mississippi National Guard Adjutant General Major General Bobby Ginn emphasized at the event that since 2012, the partnership has facilitated more than 170 engagements between U.S. and Uzbek soldiers, strengthening disaster response and readiness. 'Uzbekistan's commitment to regional stability and contributions to counterterrorism efforts and border security' demonstrate the power of its armed forced, Ginn said. Davis Florick, the Pentagon's acting principal director for Eurasia, also attending the reception, thanked Tashkent for 'storing' U.S. aircraft and diligently working with the U.S. toward the mutually beneficial solution. He confirmed that the seven Black Hawks were part of a fleet from Afghanistan that, according to multiple sources, included 24 helicopters, among them Mi-17s and UH-60s, and 22 fixed-wing aircraft, most of which were transferred to Uzbekistan last year. Another high-level Pentagon official, Rear Admiral Erin Osborne, speaking at the same gathering, praised Uzbekistan as a 'critical ally' that offered its airspace and an air base during the initial years of the U.S. military campaign in Afghanistan. The republic was also part of Pentagon's Northern Distribution Network, delivering nonmilitary goods to the international coalition fighting in the neighboring country. Osborne said that mutual trust and understanding were reflected in 'capacity-building initiatives and the sharing of intelligence to counter common threats.' The U.S., she added, is committed to working with Uzbekistan 'to ensure its stability and sovereignty, as well as the stability and sovereignty of the entire Central Asian region.' The Taliban and the Afghanistan factor Even though the transfer of the Black Hawks back to the U.S. was disclosed at the embassy event, Uzbek officials have been tight-lipped about this collaboration to avoid any tension with the Taliban, which has condemned the handovers as an infringement on Afghanistan's sovereignty. The Taliban's Defense Ministry issued a statement denouncing the transfer as 'unacceptable' and demanding the return of the aircraft. Eighteen U.S. aircraft also ended up in Tajikistan in 2021, but Washington and Dushanbe have yet to settle the matter. During a visit to the region in June 2022, U.S. Central Command commander General Michael Kurilla said the aircraft would not be returned to Afghanistan 'because they do not belong to the Taliban … Our hope is to be able to hand over some or all of the aircraft to the Tajik government.' Washington analysts view Uzbekistan as the most active U.S. military partner in the region, comparing it with the activities other republics in Central Asia have with their state partners, specifically Kazakhstan with Arizona, Tajikistan with Virginia, and Kyrgyzstan and Turkmenistan with Montana. Still, they characterize Tashkent-Washington security relationship as more transactional than strategic. 'The Uzbeks want training and equipment. What do we want from them? A reliable partner in the region,' a former U.S. official with deep experience in Central Asia told VOA. The official spoke on the condition of anonymity for professional reasons. The U.S. has trained Uzbek pilots to operate and maintain the transferred aircraft, but continued congressional funding — amounting to several million dollars — is crucial for sustained cooperation. 'There will be questions from Congress, of course,' the former official said. 'The primary justification so far has been that these assets would help counter extremists from Afghanistan.' Meanwhile, experts in Tashkent support Uzbekistan's cautious approach to the Taliban. As officials have said, Uzbekistan will engage with whoever governs Afghanistan. While it does not officially recognize the Taliban, the administration of President Shavkat Mirziyoyev has forged stable diplomatic relations with Kabul, holds significant investment and business agreements with the country, and provides humanitarian aid to the Afghan people. Last summer, Uzbekistan opened a free economic zone in the city of Termez on the border with Afghanistan, inviting neighbors to foster entrepreneurial cooperation. U.S. interests and Central Asian security The U.S. maintains military cooperation agreements with each Central Asian republic, with plans reviewed annually and subject to funding approval. Despite intelligence-sharing efforts, there is no U.S.-Uzbekistan overflight agreement. Tashkent does not allow its territory to be used for strikes on neighboring soil, even against terrorist targets. 'The Trump administration may question this,' said the former U.S. official. 'It complicates the case for cooperation with Uzbekistan because they're centrally located, yet we must fly around them. It's hard to justify what we're getting in return.' For years, the U.S. has also supported regional border security initiatives. 'That's the big program,' the former U.S. official said, but added: 'How many terrorists have we stopped? How many have been disrupted, killed, or captured? Do we have those hard numbers? We are still in the nascent stages of setting up the program.'	https://www.voanews.com/a/us-uzbekistan-reaffirm-commitment-to-central-asia-security/7984698.html	2025-02-22T15:38:35-08:00	
Hundreds of Congolese police join rebels in occupied city	Crowds of Congolese police officers who switched to the M23 rebel group sang and clapped in occupied Bukavu city on Saturday, preparing for retraining under the authority of the rebels who are intent on showing they plan to stick around and govern. The M23 rebels advanced a week ago into eastern Democratic Republic of Congo's second-largest city, which was rocked by looting and unrest as Congolese forces withdrew without a fight. The M23's capture of swaths of eastern Congo and valuable mineral deposits has fanned fears of a wider war and led the United Nations Security Council to demand unanimously Friday that it cease hostilities and withdraw. In Bukavu, there was no sign this call would be heeded. The assembled police, wearing brand new uniforms and black berets, were told they would leave for a few days of training and come back to support the M23 rebels. 'May you come back to us in good shape so that together we can continue to liberate our country,' said Police Commander Jackson Kamba. Around 1,800 police officers have surrendered and were going for retraining with 500 more due to do so, said Lawrence Kanyuka, a spokesperson for the AFC rebel alliance that includes the M23 group. The Congolese government did not immediately respond to a request for comment. The ongoing crisis in the eastern Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC) continues to escalate, with tensions involving the Congolese government, and the M23 rebel group. The DRC government has officially designated the M23 rebel group as a terrorist organization, while the United Nations and the United States classify it as an armed rebel group. Several locals expressed skepticism. The M23's arrival in Bukavu 'has paralyzed the entire life of the whole area, even if some activities are resuming in different ways,' said resident Josue Kayeye. 'We cannot applaud anything done by force.' Congolese troops are under pressure on multiple fronts. The town of Minembwe in the mountains of South Kivu and its airfield were captured Friday by a Tutsi militia allegedly allied with the M23, a local official, a military source and a U.N. source said. A few days earlier, its leader, Colonel Makanika, was killed by a Congolese military drone. East African defense chiefs met in Nairobi, Kenya, on Friday to discuss the crisis. An internal report on the meeting, seen by Reuters, showed that the group noted that there was 'no clear picture of the situation on the ground' amid the escalation and M23's occupation of major cities and airports. The group emphasized the need for direct engagement between all parties to the conflict, according to the report. Congo has repeatedly refused to hold talks with M23. The ethnic Tutsi-led M23 is the latest in a string of groups to take up arms in the name of Tutsis in Congo. The M23 and neighboring Rwanda reject allegations from Congo that it is a Rwandan proxy bent on looting the east's reserves of gold and coltan.	https://www.voanews.com/a/hundreds-of-congolese-police-join-rebels-in-occupied-city-/7984671.html	2025-02-22T13:49:33-08:00	
Cholera kills 58, sickens 1,300 over 3 days in Sudanese city	CAIRO — A cholera outbreak in a southern Sudanese city killed nearly 60 people and sickened about 1,300 others over the last three days, health authorities said Saturday. The outbreak in the southern city of Kosti was blamed mainly on contaminated drinking water after the city’s water plant stopped due to an attack by a notorious paramilitary group, the Health Ministry said. The group has been fighting the country’s military for about two years. The ministry said in a statement the disease killed 58 people and sickened 1,293 others between Thursday and Saturday. The ministry said it has taken a series of measures to fight the outbreak, including launching a vaccination campaign against cholera in the city. The disease killed more than 600 and sickened over 21,000 others between July and October last year.

1 dead, several police officers wounded in knife attack in France	STRASBOURG, FRANCE — One person died and two police officers were seriously injured in a knife attack in eastern France on Saturday that occurred during a demonstration, the local prosecutor said. Three more officers were lightly wounded in the attack in the city of Mulhouse, carried out by a 37-year-old suspect who is on a terror prevention watchlist, prosecutor Nicolas Heitz told AFP. The list, called FSPRT, compiles data from various authorities on people with the aim of preventing 'terrorist' radicalization. It was launched in 2015 following deadly attacks on satirical magazine Charlie Hebdo's offices and on a Jewish supermarket. The suspect attacked local police officers in Mulhouse shouting 'Allahu Akbar' ('God is greatest') Saturday afternoon, France’s national antiterror prosecutors’ unit PNAT said in a statement. A passerby was killed trying to intervene and help police, the prosecutor's office said. One of the seriously wounded police officers sustained an injury to the carotid artery, and the other to the thorax, Heitz said. Interior Minister Bruno Retailleau was expected to travel to the scene of the attack later Saturday. Police established a security parameter after the attack, which happened shortly before 4 p.m. local time during a demonstration in support of Congo. According to union sources, the suspect, born in Algeria, has been under judicial supervision and house arrest, and under an expulsion order from France. 'Horror has seized our city,' Mulhouse Mayor Michele Lutz said on Facebook. The incident was being investigated as a terror attack, she said, but 'this must obviously still be confirmed by the judiciary.' French President Emmanuel Macron said Saturday that the deadly knife attack was 'Islamist terrorism,' after France's anti-terrorism prosecutor's office confirmed it was investigating the case. 'It is without any doubt an act of Islamist terrorism,' Macron told reporters on the sidelines of the annual French farm show, adding that the interior minister was on his way to Mulhouse. The suspect has been arrested, the prosecutor's office said.

Sudan's RSF, allied groups to sign charter to form parallel government	Sudan's Rapid Support Forces will sign a charter with allied political and armed groups on Saturday evening to establish a 'government of peace and unity' in territories it controls, signatories al-Hadi Idris and Ibrahim Mirghani told Reuters. The RSF has seized most of the western Darfur region and swathes of the Kordofan region in an almost-two-year war, but it is being pushed back from central Sudan by the Sudanese army, which has condemned the formation of a parallel government. Such a government, which already has drawn an expression of concern from the United Nations, is not expected to receive widespread recognition. Those affiliated with the government say its formation will be announced from inside the country. General Mohamed Hamdan Dagalo, head of the paramilitary that has been accused of widespread abuses including genocide, was hit with sanctions by the United States earlier this year. The war, which erupted after disagreements between the RSF and the army over their integration during a transition toward democracy, has devastated the country, driving half the population into hunger. According to Idris, among the signatories to the charter and foundational constitution is powerful rebel leader Abdelaziz al-Hilu, who controls vast swathes of territory and troops in South Kordofan state and has long demanded that Sudan embrace secularism. Talks that began earlier this week were hosted in Kenya, drawing condemnation from Sudan and domestic criticism of Kenyan President William Ruto for plunging the country into a diplomatic melee.	https://www.voanews.com/a/sudan-s-rsf-allied-groups-to-sign-charter-to-form-parallel-government/7984593.html	2025-02-22T10:27:02-08:00	
New polio vaccination drive begins in Gaza	JABALIA, GAZA STRIP — A third mass polio vaccination campaign began in Gaza on Saturday, AFP journalists reported, with the aim of delivering the first dose to nearly 600,000 children across the Palestinian territory. Scores of children under the age of 10 received the dose at a mosque in Jabalia, in northern Gaza, where a blistering Israeli military assault last year reduced many buildings to rubble. The vaccination campaign involves multiple U.N. agencies, including the Israeli-boycotted U.N. Relief and Works Agency for Palestine refugees, or UNRWA, and comes at a time when Israel and Hamas are observing a ceasefire that has largely halted the fighting. The United States, United Kingdom and other Western nations designate Hamas as a terror group. The World Health Organization said the campaign aims to vaccinate more than 591,000 children by Feb. 26. 'Over 1,700 UNRWA team members will take part in this campaign,' UNRWA chief Philippe Lazzarini wrote on X. 'This campaign follows a recent detection of polio in wastewater, putting the lives of children at risk.' The previous two drives were conducted in late 2024 after the highly contagious disease resurfaced in Gaza for the first time in over 20 years. After more than 16 months of war between Israel and Hamas, the humanitarian situation in Gaza is dire. Even before the hostilities began, the territory had been struggling under an Israeli-imposed blockade for more than 15 years. Much of the water infrastructure has been destroyed, leaving sewage to stagnate in open pools near densely populated neighborhoods — conditions that contributed to the reemergence of the virus last autumn. The WHO reported on Feb. 19 that traces of poliovirus had again been detected in wastewater samples. Polio is highly contagious and can cause paralysis, primarily affecting children under the age of 5. The disease has been nearly eradicated worldwide. Hoping for a lasting truce, Bassam al-Haou, a resident of Jabalia, brought his daughters to receive the vaccine. 'I also hope for stability for our innocent children so they can remain safe from violence,' he told AFP. The war erupted following Hamas's unprecedented terror attack on Israel on Oct. 7, 2023. A fragile ceasefire took effect on Jan. 19.	https://www.voanews.com/a/new-polio-vaccination-drive-begins-in-gaza/7984585.html	2025-02-22T10:15:59-08:00	
Malian army investigates deaths of civilians blamed on soldiers, Wagner group	BAMAKO, MALI — Mali's army said it is investigating soldiers who were accused by separatist Tuareg rebels of killing at least 24 civilians earlier this week. It is a rare probe of human rights abuses since the military took power in 2020. The Front for the Liberation of Azawad, the Tuareg independence movement in the north of the country, accused soldiers and Russian mercenaries from the Wagner group of intercepting two civilian transport vehicles bound for Algeria from Gao on Monday, and 'coldly executing' at least 24 people among the passengers. The general staff of the Malian armed forces, without referring to the killings, denounced the 'intoxicating campaigns' against the army Wednesday. On Friday, the authorities announced the opening of an investigation into the civilian deaths. Analysts say it's unlikely the investigation would fault the troops or the Russian mercenaries. 'The objective of the investigations is going to be more about countering the allegations against [the army] and Wagner, rather than trying to find any wrongdoing by the latter. The conclusion of the investigation is likely to say that those allegations are false,' said Rida Lyammouri, senior fellow at Policy Center for the New South, a Moroccan think tank. Mali has been in a crisis for more than a decade. In 2020, a military group, riding on popular discontent over attacks by armed jihadi groups, seized power in a coup that toppled the democratically elected president.	https://www.voanews.com/a/malian-army-investigates-deaths-of-civilians-blamed-on-soldiers-wagner-group/7984534.html	2025-02-22T09:09:10-08:00	
France says gangster ‘The Fly’ was arrested in Romania	PARIS — Mohamed Amra, a French fugitive known as 'The Fly,' who was freed by gunmen in a brazen attack against a prison van in May, was arrested in Romania on Saturday, the French interior minister said. French police had launched a massive manhunt for the fugitive, whose escape resulted in the deaths of two prison guards and was seized upon by right-wing politicians as evidence that France had lost its grip on drug crime. Three officers were wounded in the attack, which was caught on CCTV and shocked France because of its extraordinary violence. France had tasked more than 300 investigators with finding Amra and had requested an Interpol red notice, hoping for foreign assistance. 'I congratulate all forces which made Mohamed Amra’s arrest in Romania today possible. A warm thank you to Romania for its decisive cooperation,' Interior Minister Bruno Retailleau said on X. Amra is a 30-year-old from northern France, according to the Paris prosecutor’s office. Police sources said he was involved in drug trafficking and accused of being a major drugs gangland figure. Amra has a long history of convictions for violent crimes that started when he was 15. He was also suspected of ordering hits while in prison. At the time of his escape, Amra was facing two fresh charges, one for attempted murder and another for participation in a gangland killing in the southern city of Marseille on the French Riviera, a hub for drug trafficking and gang violence. But despite the government labelling him 'public enemy number one,' and the deployment of massive means, Amra was not captured as quickly as the authorities had hoped. The Paris prosecutor’s office said he had been convicted of burglary by a court in Evreux on May 10 and was being held at the Val de Reuil prison until his escape on May 14. He had also been indicted by prosecutors in Marseille for a kidnapping that led to a death, it said. On Saturday, the government reacted with relief that the chase was over. 'After a manhunt lasting several months, Amra has been arrested, finally!' Prime Minister Francois Bayrou said on X. President Emmanuel Macron hailed Amra’s capture as 'a formidable success.'

On eve of elections, Germany faces changing world situation	BERLIN — German politicians made a final scramble for votes Saturday on the eve of key elections in which conservatives hope to win despite the dramatic rise of the far right. Sunday's vote comes at a time of upheaval for Europe and its biggest economy as U.S. President Donald Trump has ended a united Western stance on the Ukraine conflict by reaching out to Russia. Trump's threats of a trade war spell more trouble ahead for Germany, after its economy has shrunk for the past two years, and as it also faces bitter social polarization on the flashpoint issues of immigration and security. Sunday's vote is being held more than half a year ahead of schedule after center-left Chancellor Olaf Scholz's three-way coalition collapsed in early November. The conservative CDU-CSU alliance, led by Friedrich Merz, has long had a strong lead in opinion polls at around 30%, double that of Scholz's SPD. The far-right Alternative for Germany, or AfD, has been polling in second place at around 20%, boosted by anger over a spate of deadly knife attacks and car rammings blamed on migrants. Just 10 days before the election, an Afghan man was arrested for ploughing a car through a street rally in Munich, killing a 2-year-old child and her mother and wounding dozens. Germany was again shocked by a stabbing that badly wounded a 30-year-old Spanish man at Berlin's Holocaust Memorial on Friday, although police have not yet spoken about the suspected motive. Two major problems The AfD has had strong support from Trump's inner circle, with tech billionaire Elon Musk and Vice President JD Vance speaking out in support of the party. With domestic tensions running high, two far-right demonstrations as well as a counter protest are expected to draw crowds in Berlin on Saturday. In a final TV debate with Scholz on Wednesday, the CDU's Merz called on Germans to give him a strong mandate to 'solve the country's two major problems: migration and the economy.' On Saturday afternoon, Merz will hold a final election rally in Munich alongside Markus Soeder, leader of the CSU, the CDU's sister party in the southern state of Bavaria. Scholz, speaking at his final campaign rally in Dortmund on Friday, stressed his support for Ukraine's sovereignty and defended Germany's commitment to free speech in a pushback against recent comments Vance made in a blistering speech at the Munich Security Conference. Scholz pledged that 'we won't leave Ukraine alone and decide things over their heads, and we will ensure that Ukraine is a country that can choose its own government.' Coalition complications Stephanus Remmert, an SPD supporter at Friday's rally, said he was 'still hopeful' about the election but regretted that some social, climate and economic issues had gotten short shrift during the campaign. 'I hope we don't slide too far to the right and that we can form a strong counterweight to America,' he said. In Berlin, 28-year-old Jonathan Winkler, a video editor, said he was planning to vote for the conservatives despite 'not being a big fan of Merz.' If the polls are correct, Merz will win but then need the support of at least one and possibly two other parties to form a government. The conservative leader has ruled out forming a ruling alliance with the AfD, which leaves his two most likely partners as the SPD and the Greens — who are polling at around 15% and 13% respectively. This would force them into a lengthy negotiating process to rebuild trust after a heated election campaign in which they clashed on migration and how to deal with the AfD, but also on fiscal policy questions. 'Forming a coalition is likely to be very difficult indeed,' said Jacob Ross, a researcher at the German Council on Foreign Relations. 'Nevertheless, it would be in Germany's interest to have people in place in Berlin who are capable of acting as quickly as possible.'	https://www.voanews.com/a/on-eve-of-elections-germany-faces-changing-world-situation/7984491.html	2025-02-22T08:19:00-08:00	
Trump urges Musk to be more aggressive in bid to shrink US government	WASHINGTON — U.S. President Donald Trump on Saturday urged billionaire Elon Musk to be more aggressive in his efforts to shrink the federal government despite the uproar over layoffs and deep spending cuts. 'Elon is doing a great job, but I would like to see him get more aggressive,' Trump posted all in uppercase letters on his Truth Social platform. 'Remember, we have a country to save, but ultimately, to make greater than ever before. MAGA!' Musk's Department of Government Efficiency, or DOGE — an entity created by Trump — has swept across federal government agencies, firing tens of thousands of federal government workers, from scientists to park rangers, mostly those on probation.	https://www.voanews.com/a/trump-urges-musk-to-be-more-aggressive-in-bid-to-shrink-us-government/7984399.html	2025-02-22T06:16:03-08:00	
Pope’s doctors say sepsis could threaten his fight against pneumonia	ROME — The Vatican carried on with its Holy Year celebrations without the pope Saturday, as Pope Francis battled pneumonia and a complex respiratory infection that doctors say remains touch-and-go and will keep him hospitalized for at least another week. Francis slept well overnight, Vatican spokesperson Matteo Bruni said in a brief early update Saturday. But doctors have warned that the main threat facing the 88-year-old Francis would be the onset of sepsis, a serious infection of the blood that can occur as a complication of pneumonia. As of Friday, there was no evidence of any sepsis, and Francis was responding to the various drugs he is taking, the pope’s medical team said in their first in-depth update on the pope’s condition. 'He is not out of danger,' said his personal physician, Dr. Luigi Carbone. 'So, like all fragile patients, I say they are always on the golden scale: In other words, it takes very little to become unbalanced.' Francis, who has chronic lung disease, was admitted to Gemelli hospital on Feb. 14 after a weeklong bout of bronchitis worsened. Doctors first diagnosed the complex viral, bacterial and fungal respiratory tract infection and then the onset of pneumonia in both lungs. They prescribed 'absolute rest' and a combination of cortisone and antibiotics, along with supplemental oxygen when he needs it. Carbone, who along with Francis' personal nurse, Massimiliano Strappetti, organized care for him at the Vatican, acknowledged he had insisted on staying at the Vatican to work even after he was sick 'because of institutional and private commitments.' He was cared for by a cardiologist and infectious specialist in addition to his personal medical team before being hospitalized. Dr. Sergio Alfieri, the head of medicine and surgery at Rome’s Gemelli hospital, said the biggest threat facing Francis was that some of the germs that are currently located in his respiratory system pass into the bloodstream, causing sepsis. Sepsis can lead to organ failure and death. 'Sepsis, with his respiratory problems and his age, would be really difficult to get out of,' Alfieri told a press conference Friday at Gemelli. 'The English say, ‘knock on wood,’ we say ‘touch iron.’ Everyone touch what they want,' he said as he tapped the microphone. 'But this is the real risk in these cases: that these germs pass to the bloodstream.' 'He knows he's in danger,' Alfieri said. 'And he told us to relay that.' Deacons, meanwhile, were gathering at the Vatican for their special Jubilee weekend. Francis got sick at the start of the Vatican’s Holy Year, the once-every-quarter-century celebration of Catholicism. This weekend, Francis was supposed to have celebrated deacons, a ministry in the church that precedes ordination to the priesthood. In his place, the Holy Year organizer will celebrate Sunday’s Mass, the Vatican said. And for the second weekend in a row, Francis was expected to skip his traditional Sunday noon blessing, which he could have delivered from Gemelli if he were up to it. 'Look, even though he's not [physically] here, we know he's here,' said Luis Arnaldo Lopez Quirindongo, a deacon from Ponce, Puerto Rico who was at the Vatican on Saturday for the Jubilee celebration. 'He's recovering, but he's in our hearts and is accompanying us because our prayers and his go together.' Beyond that, doctors have said that Francis' recovery will take time and that, regardless, he will have to live with his chronic respiratory problems back at the Vatican. 'He has to get over this infection, and we all hope he gets over it,' said Alfieri. 'But the fact is, all doors are open.'	https://www.voanews.com/a/pope-s-doctors-say-sepsis-could-threaten-his-fight-against-pneumonia/7984382.html	2025-02-22T05:39:00-08:00	
Trump-Putin summit preparations are underway, Russia says	Preparations are underway for a face-to-face meeting between U.S. President Donald Trump and Russia's Vladimir Putin, Russia's deputy foreign minister said Saturday, marking a dramatic shift away from Western isolation of Moscow over its war in Ukraine. Speaking to Russian state media, Sergei Ryabkov said a possible Putin-Trump summit could involve broad talks on global issues, not just the war in Ukraine. 'The question is about starting to move toward normalizing relations between our countries, finding ways to resolve the most acute and potentially very, very dangerous situations, of which there are many, Ukraine among them,' he said. But he said that efforts to organize such a meeting are at an early stage, and that making it happen will require 'the most intensive preparatory work.' Ryabkov said that U.S. and Russian envoys could meet 'within the next two weeks' to pave the way for further talks between senior officials. Russian and U.S. representatives on Tuesday agreed to start working toward ending the war in Ukraine and improving their diplomatic and economic ties, according to the two countries’ top diplomats, at a high-level meeting in Saudi Arabia that marked an extraordinary about-face in U.S. foreign policy under Trump. After the meeting, U.S. Secretary of State Marco Rubio told the AP that the two sides agreed broadly to pursue three goals: to restore staffing at their respective embassies in Washington and Moscow; to create a high-level team to support Ukraine peace talks; and to explore closer relations and economic cooperation. He stressed, however, that the talks — which were attended by his Russian counterpart, Sergey Lavrov, and other senior Russian and U.S. officials — marked the beginning of a conversation, and that more work needs to be done. Lavrov, for his part, hailed the meeting as 'very useful.' No Ukrainian officials were present at the meeting, which came as the beleaguered country is slowly but steadily losing ground against more-numerous Russian troops, three years after Moscow launched an all-out invasion of its smaller neighbor. Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy said his country would not accept any outcome from the talks since Kyiv didn’t take part, and he postponed his own trip to Saudi Arabia scheduled for last Wednesday. European allies also have expressed concerns they are being sidelined.	https://www.voanews.com/a/trump-putin-summit-preparations-are-underway-russia-says/7984365.html	2025-02-22T05:22:44-08:00	
Vietnam’s railway drive raises risk of mismanagement, debt traps, analysts say	HO CHI MINH CITY, VIETNAM — Analysts are pointing to management and funding issues for Vietnam’s planned north-south, high-speed rail initiative and express concerns over potential 'debt traps' and growing Chinese influence as Beijing funds a railway connecting the two countries. The comments come as Vietnam is expanding its infrastructure by building railways using Chinese and Vietnamese funding, projects that could help the country’s outlook in the long term. As part of the effort, Vietnam’s National Assembly on Feb. 19 gave near-unanimous approval to legislation allowing the country to use Chinese loans for a new $8.3 billion rail link from the port city of Haiphong to China. Nguyen Hong Minh, then the transport minister, announced Vietnam’s plans to use the Chinese loans for the 391-kilometer passenger and freight line from Lao Cai on the Chinese border and passing through Hanoi. 'Vietnam's current railway system is outdated, and the country needs a new system to support its economic development,' Minh, now the construction minister, said, adding that construction is expected to begin this year and be completed by 2030. The National Assembly vote followed its November approval of construction of a high-speed railway connecting Hanoi to the country's southern economic hub, Ho Chi Minh City. That project is Vietnam's most ambitious infrastructure initiative to date and is projected to cost Vietnam $67 billion. Authorities said construction should begin in 2027 and be completed by 2035. Ha Hoang Hop, chair of the Hanoi-based Think Tank Viet Know, told VOA on Feb. 17 that while both projects could modernize the country's transport network and improve its economy, 'public sentiment is cautious.' 'There have been several publicly funded railway and infrastructure projects in Vietnam that have led to public frustration due to delays, cost overruns and poor-quality outcomes,' Hop said. 'Public skepticism is also fueled by fears of debt traps associated with Chinese loans,' he said. Hop cited fear the construction of the high-speed rail project could be dogged by the country's 'historical issues with project management and corruption.' 'There is indeed concern that the north-south, high-speed rail could face similar challenges given the scale and complexity of the project,' Hop said. Mismanagement and corruption Albert Tan, associate professor at the Asian Institute of Management in Manila, told VOA on Feb. 18 that while Vietnam's railway modernization will improve the country's supply chain efficiency, the major problem is corruption. 'The corruption level in Vietnam is so high that when you have that amount of money that the Chinese are pumping in, I'm sure there will always be leakages,' he said. Tan said railway funds ending up in 'someone's pocket' have caused delays and cost overruns for Vietnam's two city Metro lines. In 2021, the Chinese-funded Cat Linh-Ha Dong Metro line began running in Hanoi, five years behind its originally planned opening. The first line of the Ho Chi Minh City Metro, primarily funded by Japan, opened in December 2024, six years behind schedule. Costs ballooned for both Metro lines while under construction and delayed payments to contractors slowed the process. 'Somehow the money doesn't go back to the contractor. Money goes somewhere to other stakeholders,' Tan said. For the north-south, high-speed rail, Hop said the country is planning to rely on domestic funding with capital likely to come in the form of 'government bonds, public investment and possibly some low-interest loans.' 'A $67 billion project will still be a significant challenge requiring careful financial management,' Hop said. Chinese influence Hanoi's decision to pursue domestic funding for its high-speed rail shows the country's drive to 'maintain strategic autonomy,' Hop said. As it looks to Chinese loans for another rail project, though, 'there remains a significant portion of the populace wary of increasing economic dependency on China,' he added. Tran Anh Quan, a Vietnamese social activist currently living in exile, told VOA on Feb. 18 he fears the Chinese-funded railway will leave Hanoi indebted to Beijing and could be a weak point if conflict were to break out between the countries. 'This is definitely a debt trap,' he said. 'Expanding the railway to China would be very dangerous if China attacked Vietnam.' Tan also shared concerns over the 'one-way' flow of money. He said the Chinese loans are likely to be paid to Chinese firms that will 'retain control over construction and maintenance, with little technology transfer to local engineers.' Joshua Kurlantzick, senior fellow for Southeast Asia and South Asia at the Council on Foreign Relations, told VOA that Chinese influence in the region is already 'massive.' He said Chinese funding for the Vietnamese railway is in line with Beijing's goal to expand its influence in Southeast Asia. The railway 'fits right into China’s efforts to link the Mekong region, and to connect them to China,' he wrote in an email. Kurlantzick said that in Vietnam's delicate balancing act between Washington and Beijing, China is taking the upper hand as he sees U.S. influence waning with the withdrawal of funding to Vietnam through USAID and weakening public diplomacy more broadly. 'China is by far the dominant economic power in Southeast Asia already, increasingly the dominant security power, and now, with the U.S. giving up its soft power in the region, China will increasingly bolster its soft power in the region, too, making it even more dominant,' Kurlantzick said. Minh Son To, a research assistant focused on Vietnamese and Chinese politics at Singapore’s Nanyang Technological University, told VOA February 20 Hanoi has looked to Laos with concern after a China-funded high-speed rail threw the country into an 'existential debt crisis.' Still, he said many are eager to see Vietnam develop. 'Any 'China' label is bound to evoke some concern, though I wouldn't overstate that,' he told VOA. 'Vietnamese know that they need development and infrastructure, regardless of where it comes from.'	https://www.voanews.com/a/vietnam-s-railway-drive-raises-risk-of-mismanagement-debt-traps-analysts-say/7984359.html	2025-02-22T05:07:53-08:00	
As war rages, Ukraine’s politicians circle presidential ‘electric chair’	Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy has been branded 'a dictator without elections,' but rivals are already circling for his job as expectations mount of a vote later this year. U.S. President Donald Trump’s broadside at Zelenskyy hit a sensitive spot. Presidential elections in Ukraine should have been held in March or April 2024. But they were not — due to Russia’s full-scale invasion. Ukraine’s constitution bars elections during martial law, which was imposed by Kyiv just a day after the Kremlin launched its all-out war in February 2022. There are also major security concerns. Packed polling stations would make tempting targets for a Russian military that has repeatedly struck civilian targets, including schools, hospitals and apartment buildings. RFE/RL’s Ukrainian Service found people in Kyiv opposed to the idea when it spoke to them on Feb. 20. 'We have Russian-occupied territory where people will not be able to vote and will not be able to make their own choice,' said one woman. 'Who can run a campaign in a time of war?' said another voter. The same day, some 130 Ukrainian civic groups issued a joint statement declaring the impossibility of holding elections under current circumstances. 'Only after the end of the war and the achievement of a stable peace … will it be possible to organize elections freely, fairly, democratically, and accessibly,' they wrote. Nevertheless, presidential hopefuls are already making what appear to be their first cautious moves. There’s expectation in the air that some kind of ceasefire or peace deal will emerge this year, making elections possible within a matter of months. Former President Petro Poroshenko has even given a date, Oct. 26, which he says was revealed by insiders in Zelenskyy’s office and which would coincide with other elections. 'According to the constitution, there should be parliamentary elections at the end of the year. Although they should have taken place two years ago. And at the end of October, we should have had local elections,' he said. Zelenskyy’s party denied any plans for Oct. 26. The president has said elections could take place this year if martial law is lifted — something that would be possible after a deal to stop the fighting. Pro-Russian figures have also started getting active. Yuriy Boyko, who came in fourth in the 2019 election, launched a TikTok campaign in December that echoed Kremlin talking points and earned him an invitation for questioning from Ukraine's Security Service. Sergey Lagondinsky, a member of the European Parliament for Germany’s Green Party who grew up in Russia in Soviet times, wrote recently: 'Putin hates Zelenskyy because he ruined his plans to subjugate Ukraine. And he dreams of getting a pro-Russian candidate after a grueling war.' But many analysts believe the aim of getting a pro-Kremlin puppet elected has little chance after three years of war in which Russian forces have killed tens of thousands of Ukrainian soldiers and civilians. Still, when the election does come, it could be brutal. 'Everyone will be accusing each other of being at fault at the start of Russia’s full-scale invasion,' said Oleh Saakyan, co-founder of the National Platform for Resilience and Cohesion, a civic group. Speaking to Current Time, he predicted a battle of 'veterans against veterans, soldiers against soldiers.' 'The president’s seat right now is an electric chair,' he said. Zelenskyy’s hottest potential challenger has not made any public moves. In fact, he’s not even said he wants to run. Yet former army commander-in-chief Valeriy Zaluzhniy is widely regarded as waiting in the wings from his current position as Ukraine’s ambassador in London. Opinion pollsters are already asking the public what they think — and Zaluzhniy has been coming out on top. But a lot can happen between now and any future polling day. Much will depend on what kind of diplomatic deal is struck, if any, to silence the guns.	https://www.voanews.com/a/as-war-rages-ukraine-s-politicians-circle-presidential-electric-chair-/7984328.html	2025-02-22T03:59:40-08:00	
2 more Israeli hostages released in Gaza following return of Bibas remains	Two more Israeli hostages were released Saturday in exchange for hundreds of Palestinian prisoners and detainees as part of a ceasefire deal as a body returned from Gaza Friday was confirmed to be that of hostage Shiri Bibas. Tal Shoham, 40, who was taken from Kibbutz Be’eri during the Oct. 7, 2023, attack on Israel by Hamas, a U.S.-designated terror group, and Avera Mengistu, 39, who crossed over into Gaza on his own around a decade ago, were handed over to the Red Cross early Saturday in the Gaza city of Rafah. Hundreds of people, including Hamas fighters carrying automatic weapons and wearing military fatigues, balaclavas and Hamas headbands, stood in a rain-soaked square in Rafah as the handover took place. In Tel Aviv, Israelis waving flags and carrying placards with pictures of the hostages watched the release via video and cheered as the two men were paraded on a makeshift stage surrounded by masked armed Hamas fighters. Four other hostages were due to be released later Saturday. Eliya Cohen, 27; Omer Shem Tov, 22; and Omer Wenkert, 23, were taken from a music festival during the Oct. 7, attack. Hisham Al-Sayed, 36, has been held since crossing into the Gaza Strip under unexplained circumstances around a decade ago. The six Israelis are expected to be the last living hostages to be freed during the first phase of the ceasefire. In exchange, Israel is set to release more than 600 Palestinians from Israeli prisons. Saturday’s hostage release followed the return late Friday of the remains of Shiri Bibas. Her body was supposed to be among three others, including two of her children, handed over by Hamas on Thursday. But the Israeli military said the female body was not hers, prompting a warning by Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu that Hamas will 'pay the price' for failing to release Bibas’ remains as prescribed by the peace agreement with Israel. In a video statement, Netanyahu said, 'We will act with determination to bring Shiri home along with all our hostages — both living and dead — and ensure Hamas pays the full price for this cruel and evil violation of the agreement.' A statement released late Friday by the Bibas family said forensic analysis confirmed Shiri Babas’ remains. 'Last night, our Shiri was returned home,' the family said. Hamas said Bibas' remains appeared to have been mixed up with other human remains taken from rubble after an Israeli airstrike hit the place she was held. Israeli officials said forensic evidence indicated Shiri Bibas and her children were killed by Palestinian militants. Israel and Hamas are in the first phase of a ceasefire that began on Jan. 19. Talks on the second phase are scheduled to begin this week, according to Israeli Foreign Minister Gideon Saar. Hamas killed about 1,200 people in the October 2023 attack on Israel and took about 250 people as hostages. More than half of the captives have been released in ceasefire agreements and other deals, while eight were rescued in military operations. Israel's air and ground war killed more than 48,200 Palestinians, mostly women and children, according to Gaza's Health Ministry, which does not say how many were combatants. The Israeli military says the death toll includes 17,000 militants. The offensive destroyed vast areas of Gaza and displaced most of its population of 2.3 million. Some information for this report came from The Associated Press, Agence France-Presse and Reuters.	https://www.voanews.com/a/more-israeli-hostages-released-in-gaza-following-return-of-bibas-remains/7984302.html	2025-02-22T00:54:26-08:00	
Sri Lanka's first elephant orphanage marks golden jubilee	PINNAWALA, SRI LANKA — Sri Lanka's main elephant orphanage marked its 50th anniversary Sunday with a feast of fruit for the 68 jumbos at the showpiece center, reputedly the world's first care home for destitute pachyderms. The Pinnawala Elephant Orphanage lavished pineapples, bananas, melons and cucumbers on its residents to celebrate the anniversary of their home, which is a major tourist attraction. A few officials and tourists invited to the low-key celebration were served milk rice and traditional sweets while four generations of elephants born in captivity frolicked in the nearby Maha Oya river. 'The first birth at this orphanage was in 1984, and since then there have been a total of 76,' said chief curator Sanjaya Ratnayake, as the elephants returned from their daily river bath. 'This has been a successful breeding program, and today we have four generations of elephants here, with the youngest 18 months old and the oldest 70 years,' he told AFP. The orphanage recorded its first twin birth in August 2021 — a rarity among Asian elephants — and both calves are doing well. Two years before the orphanage was formally established as a government institution in February 1975, five orphaned elephants were cared for at a smaller facility in the southern resort town of Bentota. 'Since the orphanage was set up at Pinnawala in 1975, in a coconut grove, the animals have had more space to roam, with good weather and plenty of food available in the surrounding area,' Ratnayake said. The home requires 14,500 kilos of coconut and palm tree leaves, along with other foliage, to satisfy the elephants' voracious appetites. It also buys tons of fruit and milk for the younger calves, who are adored by the foreign and local visitors to the orphanage, located about 90 kilometers (56 miles) east of the capital Colombo. It is also a major revenue generator for the state, earning millions of dollars a year in entrance fees. Visitors can watch the elephants from a distance or get up close and help scrub them during bath times. Tragic toll The facility lacked running water and electricity at its inception but things improved as it gained international fame in subsequent years, said retired senior mahout K.G. Sumanabanda, 65. 'I was also fortunate to be present when we had the first birth in captivity,' Sumanabanda told AFP, visiting the home for the jubilee celebrations. During his career spanning over three decades as a traditional elephant keeper, he trained more than 60 other mahouts and is still consulted by temples and individuals who own domesticated elephants. Twenty years ago, Sri Lankan authorities opened another elephant home in the south of the island to care for orphaned, abandoned or injured elephants and later return them back to the wild. While Pinnawala is seen by many as a success, Sri Lanka is also facing a major human-elephant conflict in areas bordering traditional wildlife sanctuaries. Deputy Minister of Environment Anton Jayakody told AFP on Sunday that 450 elephants and 150 people were killed in clashes in 2023, continuing an alarming trend of fatalities in the human-elephant conflict. The previous year saw 433 elephants and 145 people killed. Killing or harming elephants is a criminal offence in Sri Lanka, which has an estimated 7,000 wild elephants and where jumbos are considered a national treasure, partly due to their significance in Buddhist culture. But the massacre continues as desperate farmers face the brunt of elephants raiding their crops and destroying livelihoods. The minister was confident the new government could tackle the problem by preventing elephants from crossing into villages. 'We are planning to introduce multiple barriers — these may include electric fences, trenches, or other deterrents — to make it more difficult for wild elephants to stray into villages,' Jayakody told AFP.	https://www.voanews.com/a/a-feast-of-fruit-as-sri-lanka-s-first-elephant-orphanage-marks-golden-jubilee-/7982865.html	2025-02-22T00:30:27-08:00	
Ancient deity, pet, endangered species: Axolotl is Mexico's most beloved amphibian	MEXICO CITY — Legend has it the axolotl was not always an amphibian. Long before it became Mexico's most beloved salamander and efforts to prevent its extinction flourished, it was a sneaky god. 'It's an interesting little animal,' said Yanet Cruz, head of the Chinampaxochitl Museum in Mexico City. Its exhibitions focus on the axolotl and chinampas, the pre-Hispanic agricultural systems resembling floating gardens that still function in Xochimilco, a neighborhood on Mexico City's outskirts famed for its canals. 'Despite there being many varieties, the axolotl from the area is a symbol of identity for the native people,' said Cruz, who participated in activities hosted at the museum to celebrate 'Axolotl Day' in early February. While there are no official estimates of the current axolotl population, the species Ambystoma mexicanum — endemic to central Mexico — has been listed as 'critically endangered' by the IUCN Red List of Threatened Species since 2019. And though biologists, historians and officials have led efforts to save the species and its habitat from extinction, a parallel, unexpected preservation phenomenon has emerged. Axolotl, which is also the plural form, attracted international attention after Minecraft added them to its game in 2021 and Mexicans went crazy about them that same year, following the Central Bank's initiative to print it on the 50-peso bill. 'That's when the 'axolotlmania' thrived,' Cruz said. All over Mexico, the peculiar, dragonlike amphibian can be spotted in murals, crafts and socks. Selected bakeries have caused a sensation with axolotl-like bites. Even a local brewery — 'Ajolote' in Spanish — took its name from the salamander to honor Mexican traditions. Before the Spaniards conquered Mexico-Tenochtitlan in the 16th century, axolotl may not have had archeological representations as did Tlaloc — god of rain in the Aztec worldview — or Coyolxauhqui — its lunar goddess — but it did appear in ancient Mesoamerican documents. In the Nahua myth of the Fifth Sun, pre-Hispanic god Nanahuatzin threw himself into a fire, reemerged as the sun and commanded fellow gods to replicate his sacrifice to bring movement to the world. All complied but Xolotl, a deity associated with the evening star, who fled. 'He was hunted down and killed,' said Arturo Montero, archaeologist of the National Commission of Protected Natural Areas. 'And from his death came a creature: axolotl.' According to Montero, the myth implies that, after a god's passing, its essence gets imprisoned in a mundane creature, subject to the cycles of life and death. Axolotl then carries within itself the Xolotl deity, and when the animal dies and its divine substance transits to the underworld, it later resurfaces to the earth and a new axolotl is born. 'Axolotl is the twin of maize, agave and water,' Montero said. Current fascination toward the axolotl and its rise to sacred status in pre-Hispanic times is hardly a coincidence. It was most likely sparked by its exceptional biological features, Montero said. Through the glass of a fish tank, where academic institutions preserve them and hatcheries put them up for sale, axolotl are hard to spot. Their skin is usually dark to mimic stones — though an albino, pinkish variety can be bred — and they can stay still for hours, buried in the muddy ground of their natural habitats or barely moving at the bottom of their tanks in captivity. Aside from their lungs, they breathe through their gills and skin, which allows them to adapt to their aquatic environment. And they can regenerate parts of its heart, spinal cord and brain. 'This species is quite peculiar,' said biologist Arturo Vergara, who supervises axolotl preservation efforts in various institutions and cares after specimens for sale at a hatchery in Mexico City. Depending on the species, color and size, the axolotl's prices at Ambystomania — where Vergara works — start at 200 pesos ($10 US). Specimens are available for sale when they reach 4 inches in length and are easy pets to look after, Vergara said. 'While they regularly have a 15-year life span [in captivity], we've had animals that have lived up to 20,' he added. 'They are very long-lived, though in their natural habitat they probably wouldn't last more than three or four years.' The species on display at the museum — one of 17 known varieties in Mexico — is endemic to lakes and canals that are currently polluted. A healthy population of axolotl would likely struggle to feed or reproduce. 'Just imagine the bottom of a canal in areas like Xochimilco, Tlahuac, Chalco, where there's an enormous quantity of microbes,' Vergara said. Under ideal conditions, an axolotl could heal itself from a snake or heron bite and survive the dry season buried in the mud. But a proper aquatic environment is needed for that to happen. 'Efforts to preserve axolotl go hand in hand with preserving the chinampas,' Cruz said at the museum, next to a display featuring salamander-shaped dolls. 'We work closely with the community to convince them that this is an important space.' In addition to being places where axolotl lay eggs, chinampas are areas where pre-Hispanic communities grew maize, chili, beans and zucchini, and some of Xochimilco's current population grow vegetables despite environmental threats. 'Many chinampas are dry and don't produce food anymore,' Cruz said. 'And where some chinampas used to be, one can now see soccer camps.' For her, like for Vergara, preserving the axolotl is not an end, but a means for saving the place where the amphibian came to be. 'This great system [chinampas] is all that's left from the lake city of Mexico-Tenochtitlan, so I always tell our visitors that Xochimilco is a living archaeological zone,' Cruz said. 'If we, as citizens, don't take care of what's ours, it will be lost.'	https://www.voanews.com/a/ancient-deity-pet-endangered-species-axolotl-is-mexico-s-most-beloved-amphibian-/7982877.html	2025-02-22T00:29:39-08:00

Amid rising worldwide populism, America's premier conservative conference goes global	WASHINGTON — This week, thousands of conservative politicians, activists and influencers convened outside Washington for the Conservative Political Action Conference, the premier annual gathering of the American right. The four-day event, hosted by the American Conservative Union since 1974, features U.S. President Donald Trump and Vice President JD Vance, among other high-profile speakers from around the world. Dubbed the 'Woodstock for conservatives,' CPAC was once the go-to event for conservative Republicans and presidential hopefuls, with its presidential straw poll serving as a barometer of grassroots support. However, Trump's political rise in recent years has transformed it into a platform for populism. Driven by the rise of populist movements globally, the conference has ventured overseas in the past decade. It launched its first international conference in Japan in 2017, expanded to Australia, Brazil and South Korea in 2019, then added Hungary, Mexico and Israel in 2022. Argentina joined the fold last year following the election of populist President Javier Milei. The international conferences, CPAC says, serve to 'unite conservatives from all over the world, strengthen the movement, and challenge globalism.' They are also used for public outreach, recruitment and mobilization, according to a recent paper on CPAC by Grant A. Silverman, a research assistant at George Washington University in Washington. CPAC's growing international outreach mirrors a recent surge in far-right populism worldwide. Last year's foreign speakers included Presidents Nayib Bukele of El Salvador and Javier Milei of Argentina, as well as Prime Minister Victor Orbán of Hungary. Here's a look at some of the foreign speakers for this year's CPAC and what they're saying: Javier Milei, Argentine president Milei, wielding a chain saw, electrified the CPAC crowd Thursday when he shared the stage with billionaire Elon Musk and presented Musk, Trump's cost-cutting czar, with his signature campaign prop. 'This is the chain saw of bureaucracy,' Musk, the CEO of Tesla and SpaceX, shouted, waving the tool. As head of the Department of Government Efficiency, Musk, who made his first CPAC appearance, is spearheading the Trump administration's massive governmentwide cost-cutting efforts. This marks Milei's third CPAC appearance. The self-styled 'anarcho-capitalist' campaigned in 2023 on shrinking Argentina's government, often brandishing a chain saw at rallies. At last year's Washington conference, he vowed to eliminate unnecessary government agencies, declaring, 'We will not surrender until we make Argentina great again!' Speaking at CPAC Argentina in December, Milei declared that the 'new winds of freedom are sweeping through the world' and called on allies to fight against 'lefties.' 'We must stand together, establishing channels of cooperation throughout the world,' he told the crowd. Jair Bolsonaro, former president of Brazil Brazil's former right-wing president is a CPAC regular. After Bolsonaro lost a reelection bid in 2022, his supporters stormed federal government buildings in an alleged attempt to seize power. Banned from seeking office until 2030, Bolsonaro faces charges of plotting a coup. His son, Eduardo Bolsonaro, organizes CPAC Brazil. At last year's conference in Balneario Camboriu, the elder Bolsonaro joined Milei and other right-wing politicians from Latin America to hail conservatism's global rise and expressed hope for Trump's return to office. For his part, Milei used the platform to denounce socialism, saying it restricts liberties and breeds corruption. Robert Fico, prime minister of Slovakia Robert Fico makes his CPAC debut this year. Though he leads a left-wing populist party, he has drawn controversy for his attacks on journalists, immigrants and LGBTQ+ people. In October, he called journalists 'bloody bastards' and threatened new media restrictions. An opponent of same-sex marriage, he has called adoption by gay couples a 'perversion.' During the Ukraine conflict, Fico has opposed European sanctions on Moscow and echoed Moscow's messaging, drawing comparisons to Hungary's pro-Kremlin prime minister. In May, he survived an assassination attempt by a gunman opposed to his stance against military assistance to Ukraine. Mateusz Morawiecki, former Polish prime minister After speaking at CPAC Hungary last year, Morawiecki makes his first U.S. appearance this year. He served as prime minister from 2017 to 2023 and is now a leading figure in the opposition Law and Justice Party. Despite his party's strong support for Ukraine, Morawiecki maintains close ties with Hungary's Orban and Spain's Santiago Abascal, leader of the conservative Vox political party. Abascal is an invited speaker at CPAC. Immigration is a unifying issue for Europe's right-wing populists. At last year's Hungary conference, Morawiecki called Orban his friend and credited his tough response to Europe's 2015 migration crisis with preventing 'chaos' in Europe. Liz Truss, former British prime minister The former Conservative Party leader and prime minister made her second CPAC appearance in a row Wednesday. Calling Britain a 'failed state' ruled by a socialist government, she called for a Trump-style MAGA movement to save it. 'We want a Trump revolution in Britain,' she said to applause, praising Trump's second presidency as 'the golden age of America.' Blaming Britain's decline on unelected bureaucrats, she urged the dismantlement of the 'deep state,' a favorite theme among conference attendees. 'We want Elon and his nerd army of muskrats examining the British deep state,' Truss said. Truss served just 49 days as prime minister and lost her Parliament seat last year.	https://www.voanews.com/a/amid-rising-worldwide-populism-america-s-premier-conservative-conference-goes-global/7984267.html	2025-02-21T21:14:46-08:00	
Israel prepares to receive 6 more hostages as fragile ceasefire appears to hold	Israel prepared Saturday to receive six more hostages, the latest exchange to take place under a fragile ceasefire that was threatened this week by the return of a misidentified body. Four of the hostages set to be released Saturday at 8:30 a.m. were taken by Hamas, a U.S.-designated terror group, during its attack on Israel on Oct. 7, 2023. Another two have been held since long before the war, entering Gaza separately under unexplained circumstances around a decade ago. In exchange, Israel is set to release more than 600 Palestinians from Israeli prisons. The latest exchange is set to take place despite Israeli allegations that hostage Shiri Bibas’ body was not returned to Israel as promised on Thursday. Hamas said that Bibas' remains appeared to have been mixed up with other human remains taken from rubble after an Israeli airstrike hit the place she was held. It said it had handed over Biabas’ body to the Red Cross on Friday. The Red Cross confirmed receiving human remains and said it had transferred them to Israeli authorities. Israeli officials said the remains were taken to a forensics lab for testing. Earlier Friday, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said Hamas will 'pay the price' for failing to release the body of Bibas as prescribed by the peace agreement with Israel. In a video statement, Netanyahu said 'We will act with determination to bring Shiri home along with all our hostages — both living and dead — and ensure Hamas pays the full price for this cruel and evil violation of the agreement.' The bodies of three Israeli hostages and the body of a fourth, unidentified woman, were returned to Israel on Thursday in the latest release under the ceasefire between Israel and Hamas. Those released Thursday included the youngest captives — infant Kfir Bibas, who was 9 months old when he was kidnapped, and his 4-year-old brother, Ariel Bibas. The body of their mother, Shiri Bibas, was also supposed to be released. But the Israeli military said the female body was not Bibas. The body does not belong to any other hostage and remains unidentified, the military said. The Israeli military accused Hamas of violating the ceasefire agreement. 'This is a violation of utmost severity by the Hamas terrorist organization, which is obliged under the agreement to return four deceased hostages,' the military said in a statement. The Bibas family was abducted from Kibbutz Nir Oz by Hamas on Oct. 7, 2023. Video of the abduction showed Shiri Bibas swaddling the boys in a blanket and being whisked away by armed men. Hamas has said the boys and their mother were killed in an Israeli airstrike in November 2023. Israel never confirmed that claim. Their father, Yarden Bibas, was kidnapped separately and returned alive earlier this month. The body of fellow Nir Oz resident Oded Lifshitz, who was 83 when he was abducted from his home, was also released Thursday. Israel and Hamas are in the first phase of a ceasefire that began on Jan. 19. Talks on the second phase are scheduled to begin this week, according to Israeli Foreign Minister Gideon Saar. Hamas killed about 1,200 people in the October 2023 attack on Israel and took about 250 people as hostages. More than half of the captives have been released in ceasefire agreements and other deals, while eight were rescued in military operations. Israel's air and ground war killed more than 48,200 Palestinians, mostly women and children, according to Gaza's Health Ministry, which does not say how many were combatants. The Israeli military says the death toll includes 17,000 militants. The offensive destroyed vast areas of Gaza and displaced most of its population of 2.3 million.

In CPAC remarks, White House national security adviser pledges crackdown on Mexican cartels	Politicians, media personalities and conservative activists gathered outside Washington on Friday for the second day of a conference featuring a range of political allies of President Donald Trump. Speakers at the Conservative Political Action Conference (CPAC) heralded the Trump administration’s first month in office, with dozens of executive orders that have proposed sweeping changes to a wide range of government policies and positions on international issues. Mike Waltz, the president's national security adviser, told the CPAC audience Friday that the Trump administration’s efforts to end the Ukraine war are certain to include U.S. investments in Ukraine’s mineral assets as part of a plan to recoup some funding for Ukraine’s defense. Earlier this week, Ukraine’s President Volodymyr Zelenskyy rejected a proposal that would grant American companies 50% ownership of Ukraine’s rare earth minerals, but Waltz on Friday said the Ukrainian leader 'is going to sign' a revised U.S. offer. Waltz also said the Trump administration plans to 'unleash holy hell' on drug cartels. On Wednesday, the State Department designated several Mexican drug cartels as terrorist groups. Journalist-turned-politician Kari Lake, whom Trump said in December he would like to see lead Voice of America, spoke about what she sees as the president’s wins in his first month in office, and her views on legacy media. 'Watching what President Trump has accomplished and done in one month is so incredible,' Lake said, referring to actions by the Elon Musk-led Department of Government Efficiency and the State Department to search for corruption and curtail spending, including by ending foreign aid funding. A former TV journalist in Arizona for nearly 30 years, Lake spoke of how she quit journalism because of what she felt was disinformation about the coronavirus pandemic. 'We're still surrounded by too many fake journalists out there,' Lake said, adding that she believes the 'purpose of the mainstream media is no longer to inform us, it's to manipulate us.' She criticized Associated Press reporting on government officials and independent bodies who validated the results of the 2020 election, saying, 'They still pretend the 2020 election was the most secure election in all of history.' Lake also said that she is honored that Trump named her to lead VOA, and said she will focus the news agency on producing 'accurate and honest reporting.' 'VOA has been telling America's story to the world for 83 years this Monday. Sometimes the coverage has been incredible and sometimes it's been pitiful,' Lake said. 'We are fighting an information war, and there's no better weapon than the truth, and I believe VOA could be that weapon.' Among those who have called for the network to be cut is Musk. 'We won't become Trump TV,' she said, 'but it sure as hell will not be ‘TDS TV.’ You can find all the Trump Derangement Syndrome that you want over on CNN, MSNBC, PBS, '60 minutes,' The Washington Post and The New York Times.' Trump is expected to address the CPAC gathering on Saturday.	https://www.voanews.com/a/in-cpac-remarks-white-house-national-security-adviser-pledges-crackdown-on-mexican-cartels/7984247.html	2025-02-21T18:51:49-08:00

UN Security Council demands rebels withdraw from captured Congolese cities	united nations — The U.N. Security Council unanimously adopted a resolution Friday demanding that the M23 rebels in eastern Congo immediately cease hostilities and withdraw from territories they have seized. The council also threatened sanctions on those who prolong the conflict. France, which drafted the text, said it sends a clear message that there is no military solution to the conflict in the eastern Democratic Republic of Congo. 'The priority is to reach an effective, unconditional and immediate ceasefire agreement,' Ambassador Nicolas de Riviere said. 'A restoration of dialogue is urgent, with support from mediation at the regional level. The sovereignty and territorial integrity of the DRC needs to be respected.' The resolution also calls on the Rwanda Defense Forces to cease their support 'to the M23 and immediately withdraw from DRC territory without preconditions.' Council members accuse the Rwandan Defense Forces of 'direct support' of the M23. Rwanda has repeatedly denied allegations that it supports the rebels. The Security Council also strongly urged the the DRC and Rwanda 'to return without preconditions to diplomatic talks as a matter of urgency' and to implement their existing commitments under two regional mediations known as the Luanda and Nairobi processes. Land grab Thousands of Rwandan-backed M23 rebels continue to seize territory in the mineral-rich eastern part of the DRC with little resistance from the national army. Since mid-December, they have focused on the provinces of North and South Kivu, seizing North Kivu's capital, Goma, in late January and moving to South Kivu's capital, Bukavu, on February 14. The rebels have also taken control of other important towns, including Masisi, Sake and Nyabibwe, and have established 'parallel administrations' in some of the territories they control. On Friday, the head of the U.N. mission in the eastern DRC said the rebels appear to have their sights set on the capital, Kinshasa. 'Very public declarations and statements by AFC/M23, clearly repeated over time and including last week, show that the intent is to go up to Kinshasa,' Bintou Keita, the U.N. special representative of the secretary-general in the DRC, told reporters in a video briefing from Kinshasa. 'It is our understanding, looking at what is going on in North Kivu, but also the onward push towards South Kivu, and we understand they are pushing a bit further to Tanganyika.' Rwanda alleges that Kinshasa collaborates with the Democratic Forces for the Liberation of Rwanda, or the FDLR, a Hutu armed group with ties to the perpetrators of the 1994 Rwandan genocide, an allegation the DRC rejects. 'We believe that any outcome that doesn't take Rwanda's security concerns seriously will not offer a sustainable solution to the conflict,' said Rwandan Ambassador Ernest Rwamucyo. 'The security challenges posed by FDLR and its splinter groups are of very serious concern for Rwanda. DRC must be held accountable for its continued preservation of FDLR, embedding it in its army, equipping the FDLR with sophisticated weapons and using it as an ally and fighting force.' In its resolution, the council condemned 'support provided by DRC military forces to specific armed groups, in particular the FDLR,' calling for it to stop. The council also urged the parties to rapidly implement 'the harmonized plan for the neutralization' of the FDLR and the 'disengagement of forces from the territory of the DRC.' Hundreds of thousands of civilians have been caught up in the fighting. The U.N. refugee agency said Friday that it needs $40.4 million to assist 275,000 internally displaced people in eastern DRC and to support a potential influx of 258,000 refugees and returnees going to neighboring countries. The DRC government has officially designated the M23 as a terrorist organization, while the United Nations and the United States classify it as an armed rebel group. Congolese Ambassador Zenon Ngay Mukongo welcomed the council's action but said it came late, after weeks of repeated appeals from his government. 'In this particular case, the council's paralysis gave free rein to the illegal occupation of DRC territory by the Rwandan Defense Forces and their supporters in the AFC/M23,' he said, 'in the knowledge that every further day of inaction compromises regional and international peace and security, only strengthens the aggressor, and undermines the United Nations' credibility.' On Thursday, the United States unilaterally imposed sanctions on a senior Rwandan official and a spokesperson for a coalition of armed groups that includes the M23 for fueling violence in the eastern DRC. 'We applaud similar actions taken by other member states aimed at compelling Rwanda to return to the negotiating table and bring this violence to an end,' U.S. envoy Dorothy Shea said. Sierra Leone's envoy offered a lesson to the parties from his country's 11-year civil war in the 1990s. Ambassador Michael Kanu said that at some point the parties realized the conflict would not end on the battlefield and that dialogue was the only viable path to sustainable peace. 'We had to talk with each other in good faith and commit to signing a peace agreement with the necessary political will,' Kanu said. 'Talking to adversaries is hard. Perhaps a taboo for some. But we do not make peace with friends, but with adversaries.'	https://www.voanews.com/a/un-security-council-demands-rebels-withdraw-from-captured-congolese-cities/7984216.html	2025-02-21T17:39:27-08:00	
Trump fires chairman of Joint Chiefs of Staff	WASHINGTON — President Donald Trump abruptly fired Air Force General CQ Brown as chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff on Friday, sidelining a history-making fighter pilot and respected officer as part of a campaign to rid the military of leaders who support diversity and equity in the ranks. The ouster of Brown, only the second Black general to serve as chairman, is sure to send shock waves through the Pentagon. His 16 months in the job had been consumed with the war in Ukraine and the expanded conflict in the Middle East. 'I want to thank General Charles 'CQ' Brown for his over 40 years of service to our country, including as our current Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff. He is a fine gentleman and an outstanding leader, and I wish a great future for him and his family,' Trump posted on social media. Trump said he was nominating Air Force Lieutenant General Dan 'Razin' Caine to be the next chairman. Trump acted despite support for Brown among key members of Congress and a seemingly friendly meeting with him in mid-December, when the two were seated next to each other for a time at the Army-Navy football game. Brown had been meeting regularly with Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth, who took over the top Pentagon job just four weeks ago.	https://www.voanews.com/a/trump-fires-chairman-of-joint-chiefs-of-staff-/7984199.html	2025-02-21T17:01:47-08:00	
AP sues White House officials over denial of access	WASHINGTON — The Associated Press filed a lawsuit against three White House officials on Friday after the news agency was barred from some of U.S. President Donald Trump's events. The AP, in the suit filed in a federal court in Washington, said the denial of access violates the First Amendment of the U.S. Constitution, which guarantees freedom of speech and of the press. The White House began blocking AP journalists from the Oval Office 10 days ago over the news agency's refusal to follow Trump's executive order renaming the Gulf of Mexico the 'Gulf of America.' The ban on AP reporters was later extended to Air Force One. The news group said it was bringing the suit against three Trump administration officials to 'vindicate its rights to the editorial independence guaranteed by the United States Constitution.' 'The White House has ordered The Associated Press to use certain words in its coverage or else face an indefinite denial of access,' the AP said. 'The press and all people in the United States have the right to choose their own words and not be retaliated against by the government,' it said. 'The Constitution does not allow the government to control speech. Allowing such government control and retaliation to stand is a threat to every American's freedom.' The suit names as defendants White House chief of staff Susan Wiles and deputy chief of staff Taylor Budowich, as well as White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt. 'We'll see them in court,' Leavitt said during an appearance Friday at the Conservative Political Action Conference in Washington. 'We feel we are in the right. We are going to ensure that truth and accuracy is present at that White House every single day,' she said. In its style guide, the AP noted that the Gulf of Mexico has 'carried that name for more than 400 years.' 'The Associated Press will refer to it by its original name while acknowledging the new name Trump has chosen,' it said. 'As a global news agency that disseminates news around the world, the AP must ensure that place names and geography are easily recognizable to all audiences.' Trump called the AP a 'radical left organization' on Thursday and said the new Gulf of America name is 'something that we feel strongly about.' His leveraging of press access underscores the Republican president's long-standing animosity toward traditional news outlets, which he accuses of bias against him. The White House Correspondents' Association has called AP's exclusion from Trump events outrageous. The 180-year-old news agency has long been a pillar of U.S. journalism and provides news to print, TV and radio outlets across the United States and around the world. Voice of America subscribes to The Associated Press, which provides video, audio and written content.	https://www.voanews.com/a/ap-sues-white-house-officials-over-denial-of-access-/7984165.html	2025-02-21T16:19:02-08:00	
Pope's condition not life-threatening, but his life is still in danger, doctors say	Pope Francis' medical team said Friday that his medical condition was not life-threatening, but that the pontiff was not out of danger. 'If the question is, 'Is he out of danger?' the answer is, 'No,' ' Sergio Alfieri, the head of the team of doctors at Rome's Gemelli Hospital taking care of the pope, said. 'But if you then ask us if, at this moment, his life is in danger, the answer is [also], 'No.'' The doctors said Francis was in good spirits and had maintained his sense of humor. Alfieri said when he greeted the pope Friday in the pope's hospital suite as 'Holy Father,' the pope returned the greeting with 'Holy Son.' Francis, the leader of the world's Roman Catholics, was admitted to the hospital last week after a case of bronchitis worsened. At the hospital, he was diagnosed with double pneumonia and a complex bacterial, viral and fungal infection, and doctors placed Francis on a strengthened drug therapy. Francis also has been receiving supplements of oxygen when needed, his doctors said Friday. Alfieri said Francis was not on a ventilator. Alfieri said there was a possibility that germs from Francis' respiratory tract could enter his bloodstream, causing sepsis, but there was currently no evidence that it had happened. Sepsis is a complication of an infection that can lead to organ failure and death. The 88-year-old pontiff has been able to get out of bed and do some work, according to his doctors. They said Francis would remain in the hospital 'at least' through next week. With his hospitalization, there has been speculation about Francis stepping down from his duties as head of the Roman Catholic Church, a post he has held since 2013. His immediate predecessor, Pope Benedict XVI, was the first pope in 600 years to resign. In a recent memoir, Francis addressed the possibility of his own resignation if he became incapacitated. He said such a move would be a 'distant possibility,' justified only if he were facing 'a serious physical impediment.' However, in 2022, Francis confirmed he wrote a resignation letter not long after becoming pope. He said it was written in case medical issues prevented him from executing his papal duties. The Catholic faithful around the world have been encouraged to pray for Francis' rapid recovery. On Friday in the Philippines, a hourlong prayer was held for Francis at the Manila Cathedral. Francis celebrated Mass in a Manila park in 2015, drawing a record-breaking crowd of 6 million, according to official estimates. Saturday is the Feast of the Chair of St. Peter, a day commemorating the authority Jesus gave to the pope. Catholics are set to gather outside Gemelli Hospital to pray for Francis' health, according to the Catholic News Agency. Some information for this article came from Reuters and The Associated Press.	https://www.voanews.com/a/pope-s-condition-not-life-threatening-but-his-life-is-still-in-danger-doctors-say/7983943.html	2025-02-21T15:39:19-08:00	
N. Koreans' high casualties in Ukraine blamed on inexperience	washington — North Korean troops that joined Moscow's forces about four months ago in Russia's border region of Kursk are estimated to have suffered considerable casualties in the war against Ukraine, which analysts attribute to their lack of front-line combat experience. Numbers from different sources vary, but more than 3,000 North Korean soldiers are believed to have died or been injured while fighting Ukrainian forces. The South Korean National Intelligence Service cited the figure in mid-January, breaking it down to at least 300 killed and another 2,700 wounded. In an interview published Monday by South Korea's Chosun Daily, Kyrylo Budanov, head of Ukraine's military intelligence, said North Korean troops had suffered about 4,000 casualties. That would be one-third of the 12,000 North Korean soldiers who the U.S. in December estimated had been deployed to the Kursk region. A peace deal is being pushed by the Trump administration to end the war, which began with Russia's full-scale invasion of Ukraine on Feb. 24, 2022. Frontal assaults 'The North Korean military personnel fighting in the Kursk region are being used for frontal assaults without much military support such as artillery and armor and drones, against some of the very best Ukrainian forces,' said Bruce Bennett, senior defense researcher at the Rand Corporation. 'Many of the North Korean forces used by the Russians were trained to be special forces intended to penetrate into the enemy rear and operate there,' he said. 'Their North Korean training was not for frontal assaults, and they appear to not have been trained in Russia very well for such tactics, especially given the evolution of warfare to involve drones and other factors.' If the Russians are using North Korean special operations forces as light infantry units, then 'they are wasting their soldiers' lives' because they are not using the soldiers' special operations training, said David Maxwell, vice president of the Center for Asia Pacific Strategy. If the Ukrainian forces are 'employing effective combined arms maneuver with integrated fire support, they will inflict tremendous damage against frontal assaults,' he said. Another reason for high casualties among North Korean troops could be 'communications problems if they are working under the command of Russian forces,' Maxwell said. 'The language challenge hinders interoperability and the ability of the Russians to provide support' to the North Koreans. Many of the North Korean troops deployed to Russia are reportedly from the regime's elite special forces unit known as the 11th Corps of the Korean People's Army, also known as the Storm Corps. Headquartered in Tokchon, North Korea, the Storm Corps is trained to infiltrate and sabotage enemy operations and assassinate targets. North Korea began sending troops to Russia in October. Former U.S. Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin said at the time that if the forces entered the war, it would be 'a very, very serious issue' affecting not only Europe but also the Indo-Pacific region. The deployment of North Korean troops, in addition to the munitions the country had been sending to Russia since October 2023, represented an escalation of military ties between Pyongyang and Moscow and a dangerous expansion of Russia's war, NATO Secretary-General Mark Rutte said in October. The same month, South Korean Defense Minister Kim Yong-hyun described North Korean troops as 'mere cannon fodder mercenaries' for Russia's 'illegal war of aggression.' Russia has been using so-called meat-grinder tactics to fight Ukraine. The strategy involves mobilizing a large number of troops in a concentrated area of combat to bombard the enemy and break through its defenses. The attackers often suffer a high number of casualties. Escalation of conflict Ukrainian forces first reported encountering North Korean units on Nov. 5 in the Kursk region. Shortly afterward, Russia, reportedly using meat-grinder tactics, suffered a record number of casualties for the month. Russia suffered more than 2,000 casualties on Nov. 28 alone, which helped raise the average daily Russian casualties for the month to a new high of 1,523, according to the Institute for the Study of War, citing an analysis from the United Kingdom Ministry of Defense. Adding to the casualties are the lethal World War I-style combat tactics, such as heavy artillery bombardments and trench warfare, that have made a comeback in the Russian-Ukrainian conflict. Russians and North Koreans 'are fighting in this horrible, almost World War I-style combat, where all sides, including the Ukrainians, are taking huge casualties' with 'tons of artillery' and 'missiles and rockets and tanks,' said Bruce Bechtol, a professor focusing on East Asia and international security at Angelo State University in Texas. Since the start of the war, Russia is estimated to have incurred more than 860,000 casualties, the General Staff of Ukraine's Armed Forces reported Friday. Ukraine's President Volodymyr Zelenskyy said earlier this week that more than 46,000 Ukrainian soldiers had been killed and about 380,000 had been injured over that same period. Bechtol, a former intelligence officer for the Defense Intelligence Agency, said North Korean and Russian casualties could have been 'exaggerated,' and it might not be possible to assess exact figures, even after the war ends. In October, neither Moscow nor Pyongyang denied the possibility of North Korean troop deployment to Russia, nor did either fully acknowledge that North Korean soldiers were fighting Ukrainian forces.

Los Angeles mayor ousts fire chief for response to deadly fires	LOS ANGELES — Six weeks after the most destructive wildfire in city history, Los Angeles Mayor Karen Bass ousted the city's fire chief Friday amid a public rift over preparations for a potential fire and finger-pointing between the chief and City Hall over responsibility for the devastation. Bass said in a statement that she is removing Chief Kristin Crowley immediately. 'Bringing new leadership to the Fire Department is what our city needs,' Bass said in a statement. 'We know that 1,000 firefighters that could have been on duty on the morning the fires broke out were instead sent home on Chief Crowley's watch,' Bass disclosed. She added that the chief refused a request to prepare an 'after-action report' on the fires, which she called a necessary step in the investigation. The Palisades Fire began during heavy winds Jan. 7, destroying or damaging nearly 8,000 homes, businesses and other structures and killing at least 12 people in the Los Angeles neighborhood. Another wind-whipped fire started the same day in suburban Altadena, a community to the east, killing at least 17 people and destroying or damaging more than 10,000 homes and other buildings. Bass has been facing criticism for being in Africa as part of a presidential delegation on the day the fires started, even though weather reports had warned of dangerous fire conditions in the days before she left. In televised interviews this week, Bass acknowledged she made a mistake by leaving the city. But she inferred she wasn't aware of the looming danger when she flew around the globe to attend the inauguration of Ghanaian President John Dramani Mahama. She faulted Crowley for failing to alert her to the potentially explosive fire conditions. Crowley has publicly criticized the city for budget cuts that she said made it harder for firefighters to do their jobs. Crowley was named fire chief in 2022 by Bass' predecessor at a time when the department was in turmoil over allegations of rampant harassment, hazing and discrimination. She worked for the city fire department for more than 25 years and held nearly every role, including fire marshal, engineer and battalion chief.	https://www.voanews.com/a/los-angeles-mayor-ousts-fire-chief-for-response-to-deadly-fires/7983872.html	2025-02-21T14:14:58-08:00	
Thousands fly to Lebanon for funeral of Hezbollah's slain leader	BEIRUT — Nearly five months after Hassan Nasrallah was killed in an Israeli airstrike, thousands of supporters of the longtime leader of Lebanon's militant Hezbollah group have flown into Beirut for his funeral on Sunday. Nasrallah was killed on Sept. 27 when Israel's air force dropped more than 80 bombs on Hezbollah's main operations room in southern Beirut. It was the biggest and most consequential of Israel's targeted killings in years. The death of Nasrallah, one of the Iran-backed Shiite group's founders and the organization’s leader of more than 30 years, was a huge blow to the group he had transformed into a potent force in the Middle East. Hezbollah, which the United States and some of its allies have designated a terrorist organization, has suffered significant losses in the latest war with Israel, including the killing of several of its most senior military and political figures. Nasrallah's cousin and successor, Hashem Safieddine, who was killed in an Israeli airstrike on a Beirut suburb a few days later, will be laid to rest in his hometown in southern Lebanon. The two had temporarily been buried in secret locations. Hezbollah earlier this month announced plans for their official funerals. Crowds are expected to gather Sunday at Beirut's main sports stadium for a funeral ceremony before Nasrallah's interment. Flights from Iraq, where Hezbollah has a huge following among Iraqi Shiites, have been full for days. According to an Iraqi Transportation Ministry official, who spoke on condition of anonymity to discuss the flights, up to 6,000 people have flown to Beirut recently. Nasrallah, idolized by his supporters and with large followings among the Shiites and the Islamic world, also held the title of sayyid, an honorific meant to signify the Shiite cleric's lineage dating back to the Prophet Muhammad, the founder of Islam. However, Lebanese authorities revoked permission for a passenger plane from Iran, leaving dozens who had wanted to attend the funeral stranded in Tehran and triggering protests by Hezbollah supporters in Lebanon. The ban came after the Israeli army accused Iran of smuggling cash to Hezbollah by way of civilian flights, leading some in Lebanon to allege that their government had caved in the face of a threat from Israel. Some of those who were expected to fly in from Iran were now coming to Lebanon via Iraq. Also, members of Iran-backed groups in the region also were traveling to Beirut to attend Nasrallah's funeral. Kazim al-Fartousi, spokesperson for the Iran-backed Kataib Sayyid al-Shuhada group in Iraq, arrived on Friday. He said Nasrallah was 'the father, commander and the book that we read every day to learn about freedom.' Republican U.S. Representative Joe Wilson criticized Lebanese politicians who were planning to attend the funeral. 'Any Lebanese politician who attends the funeral of the murderous terrorist Hasan Nasrallah is standing with the Iranian Regime,' Wilson said on X.	https://www.voanews.com/a/thousands-fly-to-lebanon-for-funeral-of-hezbollah-s-slain-leader/7983886.html	2025-02-21T14:01:18-08:00	
Man wounded in stabbing at Berlin's Holocaust memorial	berlin — A man was seriously injured in a stabbing at Berlin's Holocaust memorial, police said Friday evening, two days before a watershed national election. Police said they did not know the identity or motive of the male attacker, who was still at large. The investigation was continuing. Video of the scene showed emergency vehicles and heavily armored police lined along one side of the memorial site, a vast field of grey concrete pillars. The memorial is across a street from the U.S. Embassy. 'An as yet unidentified male suspect attacked a person standing here, who was so seriously injured that he had to be taken by the fire brigade to hospital for emergency treatment,' police spokesperson Florian Nath said. The attack occurred around 6 p.m. (1700 GMT). The victim's life was not in danger, and he was being prepared for surgery, Nath said. He added that police did not believe there was any imminent danger to the public. The monument, one of the German capital's most sacred sites, commemorates the 6 million Jews murdered by Adolf Hitler's Nazis during World War II, one of the darkest episodes in human history and a continuing focus of German historical atonement. The area surrounding the monument was sealed off. The national election campaign, in which polls suggest a far-right party could come in second place for the first time in nine decades, has been marred by a series of high-profile attacks. One of those was a stabbing blamed on an Afghan immigrant, which prompted a fraught debate on immigration. Earlier on Friday, an 18-year-old ethnic Chechen was arrested on suspicion of planning an attack on the Israeli Embassy in Berlin, Bild newspaper reported.	https://www.voanews.com/a/man-wounded-in-stabbing-at-berlin-s-holocaust-memorial/7983855.html	2025-02-21T13:36:28-08:00	
Thousands rally in Slovakia to mark the 2018 slayings of an investigative journalist and his fiancee	BRATISLAVA, SLOVAKIA — Thousands rallied across Slovakia on Friday to mark the seventh anniversary of the slayings of an investigative journalist and his fiancee. The rallies are part of a wave of protests against the pro-Russia policies of populist Prime Minister Robert Fico. People in Slovakia's capital, Bratislava, observed a minute of silence to honor Jan Kuciak and Martina Kusnirova, both age 27. They were shot to death at their home in the town of Velka Maca, east of Bratislava, on Feb. 21, 2018. The killings prompted major street protests unseen since the 1989 anti-communist Velvet Revolution in Czechoslovakia. The ensuing political crisis led to the collapse of a coalition government headed by Fico. Kuciak had been investigating possible government corruption, among other issues, when he was killed. People applauded the parents of Kuciak and the mother of Kusnirova, who greeted them from the stage. 'I believe that our common fight will be successful,' said Jozef Kuciak, the father of Jan. Marian Kocner, a businessman who had been accused of masterminding the killings, has been acquitted twice. Prosecutors have said they believe Kocner paid the convicted triggerman to carry it out and appealed. The current anti-government protests are the biggest demonstrations since the 2018 slayings. They are fueled by Fico's recent trip to Moscow for talks with Russian President Vladimir Putin, a rare visit to the Kremlin by a European Union leader since Moscow's all-out invasion of Ukraine began almost three years ago and his recent remarks that Slovakia might leave the 27-nation EU and NATO. 'We've had enough of Fico,' people chanted. The crowds at rallies in 47 towns and cities at home and 16 abroad, according to organizers, demanded Fico's resignation. About 10,000 protesters chanted 'Resign, resign,' at Freedom Square in Bratislava. Fico's views on Russia have sharply differed from the European mainstream. He returned to power last year after his leftist party Smer (Direction) won a parliamentary election in 2023. He has since ended Slovakia's military aid for Ukraine, criticized EU sanctions on Russia and vowed to block Ukraine from joining NATO. He declared Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy as an enemy after Ukraine halted on Russian gas supplies to Slovakia and some other European customers.	https://www.voanews.com/a/thousands-rally-in-slovakia-to-mark-the-2018-slayings-of-an-investigative-journalist-and-his-fiancee-/7983798.html	2025-02-21T12:42:53-08:00	
Nearly 100 cases of measles reported in Texas, New Mexico	The measles outbreak in rural West Texas has grown to 90 cases across seven counties, the state health department posted online Friday, and 16 people are hospitalized. In neighboring eastern New Mexico, the measles case count is up to nine, though state public health officials said Thursday there's still no evidence this outbreak is connected to the one in Texas. The West Texas cases are concentrated in eight counties in West Texas. Texas state health department data shows that most of the cases are among people younger than 18. Twenty-six cases are in kids younger than 4 and 51 are in kids 5-17 years old. Ten adults have measles, and three cases are pending an age determination. The Ector County Health Department told the Odessa American its case was in a child too young to be vaccinated. State health officials have said this outbreak is Texas' largest in nearly 30 years. Health department spokeswoman Lara Anton said last week that cases have been concentrated in a 'close-knit, undervaccinated' Mennonite community — especially among families who attend small private religious schools or are homeschooled. In New Mexico, all of the cases are in Lea County, which borders Gaines County in Texas. The state health department has said people may have been exposed at a grocery store, an elementary school, a church, hospital and a pharmacy in Hobbs, New Mexico. Measles is a highly contagious respiratory virus that can survive in the air for up to two hours. Up to 9 out of 10 people who are susceptible will get the virus if exposed, according to the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. Most kids will recover from the measles if they get it, but infection can lead to dangerous complications like pneumonia, blindness, brain swelling and death. The vaccine for measles, mumps and rubella is safe and highly effective in preventing measles infection and severe cases of the disease. The first shot is recommended for children between 12 and 15 months old and the second between 4 and 6 years old. The vaccine series is required for kids before entering kindergarten in public schools nationwide. Before the vaccine was introduced in 1963, the U.S. saw some 3 million to 4 million cases per year. Now, it's usually fewer than 200 in a normal year. There is no link between the vaccine and autism, despite a now-discredited study and health disinformation. In communities with high vaccination rates — above 95% — diseases like measles have a harder time spreading through communities. This is called 'herd immunity.' But childhood vaccination rates have declined nationwide since the pandemic and more parents are claiming religious or personal conscience waivers to exempt their kids from required shots. The U.S. saw a rise in measles cases in 2024, including an outbreak in Chicago that sickened more than 60. Gaines County has one of the highest rates in Texas of school-aged children who opt out of at least one required vaccine, with nearly 14% of K-12 children in the 2023-24 school year. Health officials say that number is likely higher because it doesn't include many children who are homeschooled and whose data would not be reported. Health workers are hosting regular vaccination clinics and screening efforts in Texas, as well as working with schools to educate people about the importance of vaccination and offering shots. New Mexico health officials are also hosting several vaccination clinics in Hobbs next week.	https://www.voanews.com/a/nearly-100-cases-of-measles-reported-in-texas-new-mexico/7983785.html	2025-02-21T12:31:09-08:00	
US states push back against possible election security changes	WASHINGTON — Moves by U.S. President Donald Trump to potentially gut programs aimed at supporting election security are not sitting well with key state election officials, who are now asking the Trump administration to reconsider. The National Association of Secretaries of State sent a letter Friday to Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem warning that changes to the department’s Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency could endanger future elections. 'Information technology systems related to election administration have long been targeted by sophisticated cyber threat actors including nation-state and cybercriminal groups,' according to the letter, signed by NASS president, Minnesota Secretary of State Steve Simon and NASS president-elect, Mississippi Secretary of State Michael Watson. 'CISA’s prioritized services help election entities defend against these national security threats,' they added. NASS is a bipartisan group that represents chief election officials from nearly 40 U.S. states. Simon is a Democrat. Watson is a Republican. The letter says that while U.S. elections 'firmly remain a state and local responsibility,' several initiatives from CISA have provided valuable services and allowed for the sharing of critical information for states that choose to participate. It lists cybersecurity services, physical security assessments, information through the Election Infrastructure Information Sharing and Analysis Center (EI-ISAC), classified and unclassified intelligence briefings and on-the-ground incident response services as among the programs that NASS members would like to continue. VOA has reached out to the Department of Homeland Security about the letter but has not received a response. CISA was formally created in 2018, charged with protecting the country’s critical infrastructure. It has also served as a lead agency on election security. DHS officials announced a review of the agency earlier this month citing what they described as a need for CISA 'to refocus on its mission.' 'The agency is undertaking an evaluation of how it has executed its election security mission with a particular focus on any work related to mis-, dis-, and mal-information,' said Assistant Secretary Tricia McLaughlin. According to DHS, as of mid-February, more than 130 CISA employees had been placed on administrative leave. NASS expressed hope some of the election related programs can be preserved, offering to meet with DHS officials, including Noem. '[We] respect your authority to reassess existing priorities, structures, staffing, and missions,' the NASS letter said. 'We favor continuity of the core resources above and welcome the opportunity as Chief Election Officials to discuss any potential changes or impacts to election security-related services before making a final decision.'	https://www.voanews.com/a/us-states-push-back-against-possible-election-security-changes-/7983778.html	2025-02-21T12:26:54-08:00	
White House official expects Ukraine to accept mineral deal	President Donald Trump's national security adviser said Friday that he expected Ukraine to accept and sign a proposed deal that would include U.S. investments in its mineral assets to help recoup some U.S. defense funding. The Trump administration had proposed the rare earth mineral deal as part of the larger negotiation toward ending the war in Ukraine. Mike Waltz's comments followed reports that the Trump administration presented Kyiv with a revised version of a minerals agreement after Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy rejected the initial proposal. Speaking at the annual Conservative Political Action Conference (CPAC) outside Washington, Waltz said: 'Well, look, here's the bottom line: President Zelenskyy is going to sign that deal. And you will see that in the very short term. And that is good for Ukraine.' Those comments came following a sharp exchange between Trump and Zelenskyy. The Ukrainian president, responding to Trump’s suggestion that Ukraine started its war with Russia, said the U.S. president was living in a Russian-influenced 'disinformation space.' Trump countered on his Truth Social platform, calling Zelenskyy a 'dictator without elections.' On Friday, Trump referenced his indirect exchanges with Zelenskyy while speaking to a gathering of the Republican State Governors Association at the White House. The president described having 'very good talks with [Russian leader Vladimir] Putin,' and 'not such good talks with Ukraine.' He mentioned how Ukraine talks 'tough' but does not have a lot of bargaining chips. Trump sent Keith Kellogg, his special envoy for Ukraine and Russia, to Kyiv for meetings with Zelenskyy on Thursday. Comments following that meeting indicated the relationship had been smoothed over. On his X social media account, Zelenskyy had nothing but positive things to say. 'My meeting with General Kellogg was one that restores hope, and we need strong agreements with the U.S. — agreements that will truly work,' Zelenskyy said. 'I have instructed my team to work quickly and very sensibly.' 'We all need peace — Ukraine, Europe, America and the entire world,' Zelenskyy added. Kellogg, from his X account, reposted Zelenskyy’s comments, and stated, 'Extensive and positive discussions with [Zelenskyy], the embattled and courageous leader of a nation at war, and his talented national security team.' Much of the tension this past week involved talks on Ukraine between a U.S. delegation led by U.S. Secretary of State Marco Rubio and Russian counterparts in Saudi Arabia. No Ukrainian or European representatives were present. Rubio later noted that the meeting did not involve any fine points of the deal. Ukraine fears that Trump is moving to settle the war on terms that could be more favorable to Moscow. Russia controls about a fifth of Ukraine's internationally recognized territory. U.S. Vice President JD Vance told the CPAC meeting Thursday that Trump 'wants the killing to stop' in Ukraine and that 'peace is in the interest of the American people.' Vance said after the U.S.-Russian talks in Riyadh, 'We're on the cusp of peace.' He did not mention Ukraine's role in settling the conflict, although U.S. officials have said Kyiv and Moscow will both be involved in the settlement and will have to make concessions to achieve peace. European leaders have responded to Trump's recent remarks about Ukraine by pledging to step up spending on defense, and some are considering a U.S.-backed European peacekeeping force for the country if the fighting ends. The Kremlin says the plan is a major cause for concern, but Zelenskyy and NATO have welcomed it. Tatiana Vorozhko Koprowicz, Myroslava Gongadze and Patsy Widakuswara contributed to this report.

Suspect found guilty of attempted murder in author Salman Rushdie attack	MAYVILLE, NEW YORK — A New Jersey man was convicted Friday of attempted murder for stabbing author Salman Rushdie multiple times on a New York lecture stage in 2022. Jurors, who deliberated for less than two hours, also found Hadi Matar, 27, guilty of assault for wounding a man who was on stage with Rushdie at the time. Matar ran onto the stage at the Chautauqua Institution where Rushdie was about to speak on Aug. 12, 2022, and stabbed him more than a dozen times before a live audience. The attack left the 77-year-old prizewinning novelist blind in one eye. Rushdie was the key witness during seven days of testimony, describing in graphic detail his life-threatening injuries and long and painful recovery. Matar, sitting at the defense table, looked down but had no obvious reaction when the jury delivered the verdict. As he was led out of the courtroom in handcuffs, he quietly uttered, 'Free Palestine,' echoing comments he has frequently made while entering and leaving the trial. His public defender, Nathaniel Barone, said Matar was disappointed but also well-prepared for the verdict. District Attorney Jason Schmidt played a slow-motion video of the attack for the jury Friday during his closing argument, pointing out the assailant as he emerged from the audience, walked up a staircase to the stage and broke into a run toward Rushdie. 'I want you to look at the unprovoked nature of this attack,' Schmidt said. 'I want you to look at the targeted nature of the attack. There were a lot of people around that day but there was only one person who was targeted.' Assistant public defender Andrew Brautigan told the jury that prosecutors have not proved that Matar intended to kill Rushdie. The distinction is important for an attempted-murder conviction. 'You will agree something bad happened to Mr. Rushdie, but you don't know what Mr. Matar's conscious objective was,' Brautigan said. Matar had knives with him but no gun or bomb, his attorneys have said previously. And in response to testimony that the injuries were life-threatening, they have noted that Rushdie's heart and lungs were uninjured. Schmidt said while it's not possible to read Matar's mind, 'it's foreseeable that if you're going to stab someone 10 or 15 times about the face and neck, it's going to result in a fatality.' Schmidt reminded jurors about the testimony of a trauma surgeon, who said Rushdie's injuries would have been fatal without quick treatment. He also slowed down video showing Matar approaching the seated Rushdie from behind and reaching around him to stab at his torso with a knife. Rushdie raises his arms and rises from his seat, walking and stumbling for a few steps with Matar hanging on, swinging and stabbing until they both fall and are surrounded by onlookers who rush in to separate them. Rushdie is seen flailing on the ground, waving a hand covered in bright red blood. Schmidt freezes on a frame showing Rushdie, his face also bloodied, as he's surrounded by people. 'We've shown you intent,' Schmidt said. The recordings also picked up the gasps and screams from audience members who had been seated to hear Rushdie speak with City of Asylum Pittsburgh founder Henry Reese about keeping writers safe. Reese suffered a gash to his forehead, leading to the assault charge against Matar. The judge set sentencing for April 23. Matar could receive up to 25 years in prison.	https://www.voanews.com/a/suspect-found-guilty-of-attempted-murder-in-author-salman-rushdie-attack-/7983754.html	2025-02-21T12:12:46-08:00

UN Security Council weighs calling on Rwanda to pull troops from Congo	UNITED NATIONS — The United Nations Security Council will vote Friday to call on Rwanda's military to stop supporting the M23 rebel group in the eastern Democratic Republic of Congo and immediately withdraw all troops from Congolese territory 'without preconditions.' The M23 has captured the two largest cities in eastern Congo and stoked fears of a wider war. Rwanda denies allegations from Congo and the U.N. that it supports the M23 with arms and troops. It says it is defending itself against Hutu militias which it accuses of fighting alongside the Congolese military. The French-drafted U.N. resolution 'strongly condemns the ongoing offensive and advances of the M23 in North-Kivu and South Kivu with the support of Rwanda Defense Forces (RDF)' and demands that M23 immediately stop its hostilities and withdraw. A council resolution needs at least nine votes in favor and no vetoes by the United States, Russia, China, Britain or France to be adopted. Several diplomats said it is expected to pass. Congo says Rwanda has used the M23 rebels as a proxy to loot its minerals such as gold and coltan, used in smartphones and computers. The U.S. has imposed sanctions on a Rwandan minister and a senior rebel for their alleged role in the conflict. The text also condemns support by Congolese troops 'to specific armed groups, in particular the FDLR [Democratic Forces for the Liberation of Rwanda], and calls for the cessation of such support and for the urgent implementation of commitments to neutralize the group.' Rwanda accuses Congo of fighting alongside the FDLR. The Congolese military has vowed to arrest soldiers who cooperate with the FDLR, but the government has continued to use FDLR fighters as proxies, U.N. experts said in December. The M23 vows to defend Tutsi interests, particularly against ethnic Hutu militias such as the FDLR. The FDLR was founded by Hutus who fled Rwanda after participating in the 1994 genocide that killed close to 1 million Tutsis and moderate Hutus. The U.N. draft resolution urges the DRC and Rwanda to return to diplomatic talks to achieve a lasting peaceful resolution. The escalation of a decade-old insurgency has killed several peacekeepers with the U.N. force in Congo, known as MONUSCO. The draft U.N. resolution warns that 'attacks against peacekeepers may constitute war crimes and that planning, directing, sponsoring or participating in attacks against MONUSCO peacekeepers constitutes a basis for sanctions.'	https://www.voanews.com/a/un-security-council-weighs-calling-on-rwanda-to-pull-troops-from-congo/7983635.html	2025-02-21T11:56:58-08:00	
Lack of consensus' as G20 meets amid turbulent times	JOHANNESBURG — The two-day Group of 20 foreign ministers meeting wrapped up in Johannesburg on Friday. Aimed at addressing global problems, the talks between the world’s wealthiest countries instead underscored the fault lines in the current geopolitical climate. Despite the warm welcome foreign dignitaries received at the meeting in Johannesburg, hosted by current G20 president South Africa, tensions were apparent before the event even got underway. U.S. Secretary of State Marco Rubio announced earlier this month he was boycotting the meeting, citing what he called the 'anti-Americanism' on the agenda. These topics included climate change and equality for developing nations. South African President Cyril Ramaphosa addressed the discord head on in his opening speech, saying the world was under threat from rising intolerance and wars. 'Yet there is a lack of consensus among major powers, including the G20, on how to respond to these issues of global significance,' Ramaphosa said. Even a planned group photo fell through, though no official explanation was given for its last-minute cancellation. Steven Gruzd, an analyst at the South African Institute of International Affairs, spoke about the challenges the meeting presented. 'South Africa’s had a very difficult job of getting countries that are ideologically very far apart around the same table,' he said. South Africa has been under fire from the new U.S. administration, which accuses the government of land grabs, an accusation South Africa strongly denies. President Donald Trump recently cut financial assistance to the country over the allegations. Washington sent U.S. Embassy Charge d’Affaires Dana Brown in Rubio’s place. The embassy declined VOA’s request for an interview. But there were statements of support for South Africa leading the G20 from several European foreign ministers. Russia and China also sent their top envoys. In his remarks at the meeting, Chinese Foreign Minister Wang Yi expressed his support for South Africa’s G20 presidency. He also noted that, 'the current international landscape is marked by transformation and turbulence.' He added, China will 'work with all parties' on world peace, security and multilateralism. One topic that dominated at the meeting was Ukraine. The foreign ministers gathered days after Trump upended U.S. policy on the war, suggesting Ukraine was to blame for Russia’s 2022 invasion and labeling one-time U.S. ally Volodymyr Zelenskyy as a 'dictator.' Retired U.S. diplomat Brooks Spector said, 'Now that President Trump has effectively ended the general Western consensus on Ukraine, it’s obviously fallen to the European nations to be the primary source of support for Ukraine and its president and in fact its struggle against Russia.' The E.U. has indeed rallied in support of Zelenskyy after Trump’s comments. French Foreign Minister Jean-Noel Barrot, speaking on the sidelines of the meeting, voiced his concerns. 'A capitulation of Ukraine today would set a terrible example for every country in the world that would be under the threat of predation by its bigger neighbor,' he said. 'Is this the world in which we want to live?' However, in his closing remarks South African foreign minister Ronald Lamola put a positive spin on things, saying the meeting had been an overall success and delegates had held 'productive' talks.	https://www.voanews.com/a/lack-of-consensus-as-g20-meets-amid-turbulent-times-/7983605.html	2025-02-21T11:54:32-08:00	
Judge cancels New York City mayor’s trial, keeps corruption charges intact	NEW YORK — A federal judge on Friday canceled the corruption trial of New York City Mayor Eric Adams. The judge also appointed counsel to advise him on how to handle the Justice Department's controversial request to drop charges against the Democrat. Judge Dale E. Ho's written order means he won't decide before mid-March whether to grant the dismissal of the case against the mayor of the nation's largest city. At a hearing Wednesday, Acting Deputy U.S. Attorney General Emil Bove cited an executive order by President Donald Trump outlining his criminal justice priorities as he defended the request to drop charges. Adams confirmed at the hearing that he accepted that charges could later be reinstated. Critics suggest that the mayor would be required to carry out Trump's plans to round up New Yorkers who are in the country illegally if he wanted to remain free from prosecution. The request is 'virtually unreviewable in this courtroom,' Bove argued. Adams was indicted in September and accused of accepting more than $100,000 in illegal campaign contributions and travel perks from a Turkish official and business leaders seeking to buy influence while he was Brooklyn borough president. He faces multiple challengers in June's Democratic primary. He has pleaded not guilty and has insisted on his innocence. On Friday, the judge said he'd appointed Paul Clement, a former U.S. solicitor general and acting U.S. attorney general, as amicus curiae to present arguments on the government's request to throw out the charges. Ho said he wanted all parties and Clement to address the legal standard for dismissing charges, whether a court may consider materials beyond the motion itself and under what circumstances additional procedural steps and further inquiry would be necessary. He also said he wants to know under what circumstances dismissal can occur without the ability to reinstate charges or with the ability to reinstate charges. He scheduled briefs to be filed by March 7 and, if necessary, oral arguments to occur on March 14. Late Thursday, three former U.S. attorneys — from New York, Connecticut and New Jersey — submitted a letter urging Ho to 'hear from parties other than the government and the defendant in deciding about the appropriate next steps.' Adams will not be required to attend future hearings, the judge said. That could help mitigate some political damage for Adams as he could avoid being hauled back to court for hearings while he tries to convince the public that the case isn't distracting him from running the city. Adams has sought to project calm as questions over his independence have sparked a political crisis in his administration. This week, four of his top deputies resigned and Gov. Kathy Hochul announced that she had for now decided against removing Adams from office but would instead propose legislation to enhance state oversight of City Hall as a way to reestablish trust with New Yorkers.	https://www.voanews.com/a/judge-cancels-new-york-city-mayor-s-trial-keeps-corruption-charges-intact/7983729.html	2025-02-21T11:53:10-08:00	
German police arrest Russian man over attack plot	BERLIN — German police said Friday they have arrested an 18-year-old Russian man on suspicion of planning a 'politically motivated' attack in Berlin, two days before national elections. The man was detained late Thursday in the state of Brandenburg, which surrounds Berlin, police and prosecutors said in a statement. Authorities did not provide further details about the attack plot, but the Tagesspiegel newspaper reported the suspect was Chechen and is believed to have been planning an attack on the Israeli Embassy. The Israeli Embassy could not be reached for comment outside of business hours, while state prosecutors and the Russian Embassy did not immediately respond to written requests for comment from Reuters. German newspaper Bild reported Friday that the investigation had been the result of a tip-off from a foreign intelligence agency. It said the suspect had been trying to leave the country via Berlin's BER airport when he was detained. Riot police and specialist officers were involved in making the arrest, which came after that tip-off, officials said. 'No further details as to the background and motive can be given for the moment to protect the investigation,' they added. The man appeared in court Friday and was remanded in custody. German authorities are on high alert ahead of Sunday's federal elections. Some material in this report is from Reuters.	https://www.voanews.com/a/german-police-arrest-russian-man-over-attack-plot/7983573.html	2025-02-21T10:37:55-08:00	
US Treasury’s Bessent, China’s He trade economic complaints in call	WASHINGTON — U.S. Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent traded policy complaints with Chinese Vice Premier He Lifeng on Friday, with Bessent telling Beijing to do more to curb fentanyl trafficking and rebalance its economy, and He voicing concerns about President Donald Trump’s new tariffs, the two governments said. The top economic officials from the world’s two largest economies agreed to keep up communications, the Treasury said in a readout of the introductory video call. 'Secretary Bessent expressed serious concerns about the PRC’s counternarcotics efforts, economic imbalances, and unfair policies, and stressed the Administration’s commitment to pursue trade and economic policies that protect the American economy, the American worker, and our national security,' the Treasury said, using the acronym for China’s official name, the People’s Republic of China. Earlier, Chinese state media reported that He expressed concerns to Bessent over U.S. tariffs and trade restrictions on China during the call. The two sides had an 'in-depth' exchange of views on important issues in China-U.S. economic relations, and both agreed to keep communicating on matters of mutual concern, according to a readout released by Chinese state media. He, the lead China-U.S. trade negotiator on the Chinese side, and Bessent recognized the importance of bilateral economic and trade relations, the readout said. More tariffs China and the United States are seeking to manage their relationship as they stand on the precipice of a renewed trade war. Trump imposed 10% tariffs on all Chinese goods in early February, citing China's failure to stanch fentanyl trafficking. Beijing retaliated by imposing targeted tariffs of up to 15% on some U.S. imports, including energy and farm equipment, and put several companies, including Google, on notice for possible sanctions. Trump has also planned further reciprocal tariffs for all countries that tax U.S. imports, a move that is likely to further escalate global trade tensions. During his election campaign, Trump threatened 60% tariffs on all Chinese imports. Trump said earlier this week he expected Chinese President Xi Jinping to visit the U.S., without giving a timeline for such a trip. Bessent said on Thursday he would tell his Chinese counterpart that China needed to rebalance its economy and rely more on domestic consumption for growth and less on investment and exports. 'They are suppressing the consumer in favor of the business community,' Bessent told Bloomberg Television. Similar arguments The U.S. had a $295.4 billion goods trade deficit with China in 2024, down from a peak of $418.2 billion in 2018, the year Trump began imposing new tariffs on some $370 billion of Chinese imports. But last year’s deficit rose $16.3 billion from 2023 as Chinese exporters rushed to beat a new round of Trump tariffs. Bessent’s predecessor, former Treasury secretary Janet Yellen, met several times with He in recent years and lodged similar complaints about China’s state-led economic policies. She argued during a trip to China last year that those policies were leading to excess production capacity that was threatening the viability of firms in the U.S. and other market economies, a warning that laid the groundwork for former President Joe Biden’s steep tariff hikes on electric vehicles, semiconductors and solar products. He and other Chinese officials never accepted U.S. excess capacity assertions, arguing that China’s EV and other key industries are simply more competitive.	https://www.voanews.com/a/us-treasury-s-bessent-china-s-he-trade-economic-complaints-in-call/7983523.html	2025-02-21T10:19:03-08:00	
57% of Ukrainians trust President Zelenskyy, Ukrainian institute says	February 24 marks the three-year anniversary of Russia’s invasion of Ukraine, with international efforts aimed at ending the conflict in progress.

Four scenarios for securing peace in Ukraine	WASHINGTON — U.S. President Donald Trump is pushing for a peaceful resolution to Russia’s now three-year war in Ukraine. VOA examined several approaches floated by think tanks recently aimed at achieving a lasting peace to the war. Maximum pressure strategy A plan by the Center for European Policy Analysis, or CEPA, titled 'How to Win: A Seven-Point Plan for Sustainable Peace in Ukraine,' calls for 'a maximum pressure strategy to bring Russia to the negotiating table in good faith.' It proposes that the U.S. and its allies: 'Should provide immediate materiel support to Ukraine without caveats, aiming to wear down Russia’s military and thereby improve Ukraine’s negotiating position.' 'Should increase sanctions on Russian financial institutions and energy sector entities, release frozen Russian assets to support Ukrainian defense and reconstruction and enact secondary sanctions to intensify economic pressure not only on Russia but also on the authoritarian regimes of China, Iran, and North Korea.' CEPA says that 'Ukraine and Europe' must be included in any peace talks with Russia, that the U.S. should support 'a European-led coalition of the willing' to enforce any 'ceasefire line with an international force,' and that 'European allies must make consistent and as rapid as possible progress toward Ukraine’s accession to the European Union.' One of the report’s authors, Catherine Sendak, CEPA’s director for transatlantic defense and security, told VOA’s Ukrainian service that the United States should enter talks with Russia only having 'equipped Ukraine with the strongest possible means' and using its toughest 'diplomatic tools.' She added that the issue of Ukraine’s possible membership in NATO should not be included in talks with Russia. 'To discuss that with a non-NATO member … I don’t believe it is advantageous to any negotiation,' Sendak said, noting that it would give Russia 'veto power, if you will, over … choosing members to join the alliance or not.' Negotiating tactics Josh Rudolph, a German Marshall Fund senior fellow and head of its Transatlantic Democracy Working Group, worked on Russian and Ukrainian policy at the National Security Council during the first Trump administration. Last month, he offered policy recommendations to the current Trump administration on ending the Ukraine conflict. Among them: 'Approach [Russian President Vladimir] Putin from a position of strength. Whereas Putin looked tough and capable at the outset of Trump’s first term, his blunder in Ukraine has left him diminished. … As the dominant partner in this relationship, Trump, not Putin, can set negotiating terms.' 'Know when to walk away. A critical moment in the negotiations will come when Putin refuses to make major concessions. Trump must be prepared to walk away.' 'Combine sanctions with lower oil and gas prices. The best way to make Putin to see that pressing on in Ukraine would spell disaster for his rule is to pressure Russia financially. … Harnessing his warmer relationship with Saudi Arabia than [former President Joe] Biden enjoyed, Trump should flood the fossil fuel market, which would make the sanctions sustainable, starve Russia’s war machine, and generate political stability risks in Moscow.' Rudolph also recommended arming Ukraine 'to the hilt'; giving it 'all $300 billion of Russia’s frozen assets'; making Europe 'pay more for weapons' and provide 100,000 troops as 'peacekeepers'; enabling 'American companies to rebuild Ukraine'; and inviting Ukraine to join NATO should Putin refuse to accept 'reasonable' peace deal terms. Rudolph told VOA that Trump could convince those in the U.S. now skeptical of continuing to arm Ukraine that doing so as part of a peace deal would benefit American workers. '[H]e tells them, OK, now we’ve got a good deal, it’s secured by rare earth [minerals], it has ended the war, and in order to hold it together, we’re going to need to provide a continued stream of good old American-made weapons, which by the way, create all of these American jobs and facilities and factories across red states.' Touting economic benefits In a report titled 'Dollars and Sense: America’s Interest in a Ukrainian Victory,' Elaine McCusker, Frederick W. Kagan and Richard Sims of the American Enterprise Institute looked at the cost of ending support for Ukraine, concluding that this would lead to Ukraine’s defeat and Russia’s advance farther into Europe, forcing the U.S. to surge its presence in Europe. Among the report’s conclusions: 'Supporting Ukraine to victory against Russia is in the best interest of the United States.' 'A world in which Russia prevails would be more dangerous and more expensive for America — requiring an estimated increase of $808 billion in defense spending over five years.' 'Alternatively, an increased and accelerated multinational commitment to Ukraine and the conclusion of the war in the near term would result in a vibrant and free Ukraine with a newly modernized and battle-tested military and a thriving industrial base, which would help stabilize Europe.' In an interview with VOA, Frederick Kagan said a Russian victory in Ukraine would be a victory for Iran, China and North Korea, encouraging adventurism in their respective regions, and allow Russia to rebuild its army by obtaining additional human and material resources within Ukraine. A Russian takeover of Ukraine would send a wave of refugees into Europe, further destabilizing the continent, Kagan said. 'They’ve committed atrocities on the Ukrainian population in the areas they occupy. I would expect that would get worse the further west the Russians move and the more they move into the hardest traditional anti-Russian, pro-Western areas of western Ukraine. The horrors will be unspeakable,' he predicted. He said surged assistance to Ukraine would turn it into a bulwark for European peace and security — a country with a battle-tested army and rapidly developing military industry — thereby allowing the U.S. to focus on other regions. Middle road approach The Heritage Foundation’s 'Project 2025 Presidential Transition Project' includes policy recommendations concerning the Russia-Ukraine war. It noted that the American conservative movement is split over Ukraine — one side supports Kyiv, the other favors walking away — and offered a middle road. Among Project 2025’s recommendations: 'With respect to Ukraine, continued U.S. involvement must be fully paid for; limited to military aid (while European allies address Ukraine’s economic needs); and have a clearly defined national security strategy that does not risk American lives.' 'Regardless of viewpoints, all sides agree that Putin’s invasion of Ukraine is unjust and that the Ukrainian people have a right to defend their homeland. The conflict has severely weakened Putin’s military strength and provided a boost to NATO unity and its importance to European nations.' 'The next conservative president has a generational opportunity to bring resolution to the foreign policy tensions within the movement and chart a new path forward that recognizes Communist China as the defining threat to U.S. interests in the 21st century.' James Carafano, a national security expert at The Heritage Foundation who is responsible for its defense and foreign policy team, told VOA that it is in the U.S. interest to have a free and independent Ukraine that can defend itself. 'For the practical matter is, the United Europe can defend itself, and the United States can defend Europe if Ukraine’s occupied by Russia. Now, having said that, are we … way, way better off with the Russians on the other side of Ukraine? And the answer is ‘absolutely.’' In July, VOA published an interview with retired Army Lieutenant General Keith Kellogg, serving as Trump’s envoy for Ukraine and Russia, that focused on his vision of ending the war in Ukraine.	https://www.voanews.com/a/four-scenarios-for-securing-peace-in-ukraine/7983483.html	2025-02-21T09:51:15-08:00	
Motivations, ambitions of Congo’s M23 rebels unclear, analysts say	NAIROBI — A Rwandan government minister and the spokesperson of the M23 rebel group were sanctioned Thursday by the United States for alleged involvement in the recent conflict in the eastern Democratic Republic of Congo. This comes after M23 fighters on Feb. 16 marched unopposed through Bukavu, three weeks after taking over Goma — eastern Congo’s biggest city. The recent advances made by the group were not surprising, as the DRC, the United Nations and many foreign governments say the fighters are heavily armed and supported by Rwanda, a country with a strong military force, analysts told VOA. Sasha Lezhnev, senior policy adviser at The Sentry, a Washington NGO, who specializes in U.S.-Africa policy on human rights and conflict, cited numerous United Nations investigative reports over the last three years showing that Rwanda is arming and supporting the M23. 'The latest report in December stated that Rwanda had three to four thousand of its own troops in the DRC,' Lezhnev said. While Rwanda denies the allegations, Lezhnev said this crisis would have been preventable if the outside world had not recently taken its eyes off the situation. 'They [Rwanda] started rearming and reorganizing the M23 about four years ago and, back in 2023, the United States brokered an intelligence-sharing agreement and even sanctioned some Rwandan generals for supporting the M23,' Lezhnev said. 'Then Rwanda basically responded, promoting the generals and continuing to escalate the situation, as well as the DRC reneging on its promise to stop arming and supporting the FDLR.' Rwanda’s President Paul Kagame accuses the DRC of backing FDLR — the Democratic Forces for the Liberation of Rwanda, a Congo-based, mainly Hutu rebel group that includes some fighters who were involved in Rwanda’s 1994 genocide. The Tutsi-led M23, short for the March 23 Movement, first seized control of Goma in 2012. The group was pushed back the next year by the Congolese army, some of its regional allies, and special operations forces of the U.N. Stabilization Mission in the DRC. The group has been among more than 130 armed groups operating in the eastern DRC, mainly in the North and South Kivu provinces, vying for control of valuable and abundant mineral wealth including gold, diamonds, uranium and copper, as well as coltan and cobalt, major components in batteries used in electric cars, cellphones and other electronics. Claude Gatebuke, a Rwandan genocide survivor and coauthor of the book Survivors Uncensored, said Rwanda is not the only backer of the M23. 'It’s Rwanda and Uganda under the leadership of Paul Kagame and Yoweri Museveni who are invading Congo to provide access to Congo resources to ... mostly Western multinationals. This is all well documented,' Gatebuke said. Mvemba Phezo Dizolele, director of the Africa program at the Center for Strategic and International Studies, based in Washington, called the situation confusing. 'Uganda has troops in DRC that are fighting conjointly with the Congolese, against the ADF, the Allied Democratic Forces, an Islamist Ugandan group based in that part of the country,' Dizolele said. 'It’s confusing in the sense that on one level, Ugandans are collaborating with the government of DRC ... and on other hand, they’ve been reported to be engaged in this instabilization [instability], as well.' Uganda’s President Yoweri Museveni recently said he is ready to assist with peace initiatives in the DRC. M23 leaders have said they plan to go all the way to Kinshasa. 'We ... do not know fully what they want, so it’s gone anywhere from, ‘Are they only trying to hold part of the Kivus and surrounding areas and set some kind of domination there?’ Or are they willing to go to Kinshasa?' Dizolele said. Gatebuke added: 'For sure they are trying to carve off the Kivus. The problem that they have, they would’ve been able to do this a long time ago had it not been for the Congolese not wanting to be in separate countries. … So, they are going to try to keep that area by force for as long as they can ... set up their own government and pretty much try to run a parallel country inside of the [DR] Congo.' A statement posted Feb. 17 on X by the M23 reiterated the group’s call for a direct and sincere dialogue with the DRC government. Speaking at the Munich Security Conference last week, DRC President Felix Tshisekedi criticized the outside world for not taking action against Rwanda in light of the escalating violence in his country. On Thursday, a Rwandan government minister and the spokesperson of the M23 rebel group were sanctioned by the United States for their alleged involvement in the recent escalation. In response, Rwandan Foreign Minister Olivier Nduhungirehe told VOA the recent sanctions are unjustified. 'This kind of punitive measures cannot contribute toward peace and stability in our region,' Nduhungirehe said. The government also says the country’s only aim is a secure border and that for the last three years, the conflict has involved hostile forces — including Congolese armed forces and FDLR — that have not been sanctioned.	https://www.voanews.com/a/motivations-ambitions-of-congo-s-m23-rebels-unclear-analysts-say/7983473.html	2025-02-21T09:25:59-08:00	
Rubio highlights emerging terror threat in Afghanistan	ISLAMABAD — U.S. Secretary of State Marco Rubio suggested late Thursday there are ungoverned regions in Taliban-controlled Afghanistan that provide opportunities for extremist groups to operate. The comments came in an interview with former CBS correspondent Catherine Herridge on X, where Rubio was asked if intelligence indicates that al-Qaida and Islamic State had set up safe havens in Afghanistan, posing a threat comparable to the one preceding the Sept. 11, 2001, attacks. 'I wouldn’t say it’s the pre-9/11 landscape, but I think anytime you have governing spaces that are contested that you don’t have a government that has full control of every part of their territory, it creates the opportunity for these groups,' Rubio said. 'The difference between today and 10 years ago is that we don’t have American elements on the ground to target and go after them,' the top U.S. diplomat noted. Rubio added that in some cases, the Taliban has been cooperative when 'told that ISIS or al-Qaida is operating in this part of your country' and to go after them. Not so much in other cases, he said. 'So, I would say that I wouldn’t compare it to pre-9/11, but it’s certainly far more uncertain — and it’s not just limited to Afghanistan,' Rubio said. The Taliban did not immediately respond to Rubio’s remarks, but they have persistently claimed to be in control of the entire country and rejected that any foreign terrorist organizations are on Afghan soil. Rubio’s comments came just days after the United Nations reported that al-Qaida operatives continued to find shelter across Afghanistan under the protection of the Taliban's intelligence agency. 'The Taliban maintained a permissive environment allowing al-Qaida to consolidate, with the presence of safe houses and training camps scattered across Afghanistan,' read the report. It also described an Afghan-based Islamic State affiliate, the Islamic State-Khorasan, or IS-K, as 'the greatest extra-regional terrorist threat.' The U.N. assessment highlighted that in addition to attacks on Taliban authorities and Afghan religious minorities, IS-K supporters conducted strikes as far away as Europe, and that the group 'was actively seeking to recruit from among Central Asian states' bordering Afghanistan. The Taliban militarily swept back to power in August 2021 when the then-Afghan government collapsed as all U.S.-led NATO allied troops withdrew from the country after a nearly two-decade-long presence.	https://www.voanews.com/a/rubio-highlights-emerging-terror-threat-in-afghanistan/7983365.html	2025-02-21T08:03:28-08:00	
Half-billion people attend Hindu festival in India	MUMBAI, INDIA — Even for the world’s most-populous nation, the scale of a Hindu religious festival being held in India’s northern city of Prayagraj since mid-January is staggering. Surpassing previous numbers, the Maha Kumbh Mela that wraps up Wednesday has drawn more than half a billion devotees in the last six weeks, according to officials. The government of Uttar Pradesh, where the festival is being held, claims that this year's event is the largest congregation in human history for a religious, cultural and social event. Those who have taken a holy dip in waters that Hindus believe cleanses them of their sins and helps attain salvation include ordinary devotees from all walks of life, billionaires, Prime Minister Narendra Modi, politicians and Bollywood stars. Others went to simply witness the mesmerizing panorama of the religious spectacle that unfolds along the confluence of two rivers, the Ganges and the Yamuna, where Hindus believe a third, mythical river also exists. Among the first rush of pilgrims to attend the Kumbh Mela when it began last month was Deepinderr Singh Bindra, a resident of Gurugram in North India. 'It was the accumulation of my spiritual journey following my visit to several Hindu pilgrim sites in the last few years,' he said. He took an early morning dip on three consecutive days and 'found it a surreal, deeply satisfying experience.' The pull of the Maha or great Kumbh Mela, which is held every 12 years, became even greater for many devotees because this year’s event was considered special — it coincided with an alignment of the planets and stars that occurs once in 144 years. The festival was marred by a stampede on Jan. 29 that killed 30 pilgrims who were trampled amid the rush to take part in the bathing on a day considered particularly auspicious. That tragedy, however, failed to dampen the fervor as millions continued to pour into the vast temporary tented township that covers a stretch of 4,000 hectares, or 40 square kilometers, along the banks of the river. The tented township includes roads, hospitals, toilets and free community kitchens run by volunteers. A platform made of sandbags stretches along the Ganges riverbank for devotees to take part in the ritual immersion. But for many like Mumbai resident Nikhil Shirodkar, joining the festival was not just about the dip in the river but a once-in-a-lifetime experience that offered a chance for a connection with age-old Hindu traditions. 'I went more as a spiritual seeker and not with the belief that the dip cleanses one’s sins,' he said. He spent three days sleeping on the floor like an ascetic and helping serve meals to people. 'It was an eye opener. Everybody was reaching out to each other. On the roadside some would be serving tea, others biscuits, to the pilgrims who kept pouring in. It had an impact on my outlook,' Shirodkar said. Others, especially overseas visitors, were drawn to it by a sense of curiosity. Twenty-one-year-old Lucinda Pernell, who had come from Australia to India to attend a yoga camp, decided to attend after learning from her photographer friend about the festival’s immense scale. 'It was overwhelming because there were just so many people, which a Westerner like me has never seen. But I found it amazing. It was a kind of organized chaos, but what I will take back with me is that people respected each other. There was a sense of belief,' she said, recalling the experience. On one of the days that she was there, considered an especially auspicious day, an estimated 35 million took a dip in the waters in Prayagraj — that’s more people than the population of Australia. She visited the camp for Naga sadhus, the ash-smeared, often naked Hindu ascetics, who armed with tridents lead the religious spectacle. It’s one of the most dramatic sights of the festival. At this year’s festival, the sacred coexisted with high technology, as underwater drones and artificial intelligence systems were used to monitor the crowds and improve safety. The Kumbh Mela also reflected the growing synergy between religion and politics since Prime Minister Modi’s right-wing Bharatiya Janata party came to power 10 years ago, according to political analyst Nilanjan Mukhopadhyay. Giant billboards of Modi stood high at the festival site. 'The open, publicized participation of top political leaders at a religious festival is not something you witnessed in the past,' he said, pointing out that lines between religion and the state have been increasingly blurred. Besides Modi, who took a dip in the river, the Uttar Pradesh state government, led by a Hindu monk, held a Cabinet meeting at the site of the festival. Reasserting a Hindu cultural identity has been part of the BJP’s agenda. Under the rule of the country’s erstwhile Mughal rulers, the city where it took place was earlier known as Allahabad. It was renamed Prayagraj in 2018 by the BJP state government in a bid to restore its identity as a Hindu pilgrimage center. Mukhopadhyay also pointed out that the elaborate facilities built for the festival at a cost of over $8 billion, included upscale accommodations, airport and railway expansions and new roads. 'With facilities like air-conditioned tents and roads, the rich and upper middle classes no longer had to trek for miles as devotees did in earlier days. So for many of them, attending the Kumbh transitioned from a purely religious pilgrimage into a social talking point,' he said. Questions have been raised about the water in which the devotees immerse themselves. A report by the federal government’s Central Pollution Control Board earlier this month said that there were high levels of contamination in a key bathing place. But the Uttar Pradesh state government rejected the report, saying authorities were continuously monitoring water in the rivers to maintain its quality. At last count provided by the state government, 550 million had attended the festival. With five more days to go until it culminates on Wednesday, which is considered another auspicious day, those numbers will rise. Among those who plan to travel to Prayagraj on that day is Bindra, the resident of Gurugram. 'I will be going again to take another dip,' he said. 'It is a calling for me.'	https://www.voanews.com/a/half-billion-people-attend-hindu-festival-in-india/7983298.html	2025-02-21T07:39:41-08:00	
Russian region holding Ukrainian Prisoners of War as ‘bargaining chip’	RFE/RL — Iya Rashevskaya was told her husband — a member of the country’s armed forces – had gone missing in the frontline in the eastern Donetsk region, in April 2023. The news of Serhiy Skotarenko’s disappearance came just a month after he had joined the military, having given up his job abroad. Rashevskaya soon found out that her husband, a native of Ukraine’s southeastern Zaporizhzhya region, was alive and being held captive in Chechnya along with several other Ukrainian prisoners of war. A Ukrainian soldier who was released in a prisoner swap in June 2023 told Rashevskaya that he and Skotarenko had been held in the same jail in Chechnya. Rashevskaya recalls getting an unexpected, brief video call from her husband in August 2023. 'My husband asked about me and our children. He also asked me to help him to return home, saying we were his only hope,' Rashevskaya said. 'He looked awful, he has lost a lot of weight.' Ukrainian captives in Chechnya 'were being held in a basement and survived on instant noodles, bread, and water,' according to Rashevskaya. Ukrainian authorities estimate that more than 150 Ukrainian POWs are currently being held in Chechnya, a Russian region ruled by authoritarian leader Ramzan Kadyrov. Kadyrov says the soldiers were captured by Chechen military units fighting alongside other Russian forces in Ukraine. But Ukraine’s Coordination Headquarters for the Treatment of POWs has claimed that Chechnya also often 'buys' Ukrainian captives from various Russian military units to use them as a bargaining chip in negotiations. RFE/RL cannot independently verify the claim. Some of the Ukrainian captives were exchanged with Chechen fighters seized by Ukrainian forces. Kadyrov, a vocal supporter of Russian President Vladimir Putin, has sent thousands of Chechen fighters to Ukraine since the invasion began three years ago. In December 2024, Kadyrov threatened to use Ukrainian captives as human shields to protect strategically important buildings in Grozny from Ukrainian drone attacks. He said he would place them on the rooftops of buildings. He made the statement after Ukrainian drones reportedly hit a police campus in the Chechen capital. In January 2024, Kadyrov offered to release 20 Ukrainian captives in exchange for the removal of U.S. sanctions against his relatives and horses. Kadyrov, 48, and several of his family members, including his mother, Aymani Kadyrova, have been sanctioned by the United States and the European Union in recent years. Kadyrova, 71, is the head of the Kadyrov Foundation, which runs reeducation programs for Ukrainian children abducted by Russian forces from occupied territories. Washington imposed sanctions on Kadyrova and the Foundation in August 2023. Kadyrov was sanctioned by Washington in 2017 and 2020 over accusations of human rights abuses. PR campaign for Kadyrov Chechen human rights lawyer Abubakar Yangulbaev says Kadyrov directly controls any prisoner swaps involving the Ukrainians captives in Chechnya. 'While the Chechens fighting in Ukraine are part of Russian troops, Chechnya also has its own interests. It’s important for Kadyrov to secure the release of the Chechens captured in Ukraine to protect his own reputation before his people, whom he constantly calls to go to fight in Ukraine,' Yangulbaev told RFE/RL. 'It is a PR campaign for Kadyrov,' he added. Chechnya has never released the exact number or Ukrainian POWs it holds. According to Maria Klimik, a reporter for the Ukraine-based monitor, Media Initiative for Human Rights, in some cases the Ukrainian and Chechen sides have swapped captured soldiers 'informally' in the battlefields in Ukraine without involving a third party. Klimik told RFE/RL that Ukrainian POWs in Chechnya are usually held in dark, windowless basements of buildings – presumably police stations. Prisoners sleep on utility shelves as there are no beds in the basements, Klimik said citing accounts of former POWs. RFE/RL cannot independently verify the claims. In his New Year address, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy said that 3,956 Ukrainian soldiers had been freed in prisoners’ exchanges between Kyiv and Moscow since the beginning of the invasion. There has been no public mention of any direct prisoner exchanges between Ukraine and Chechnya, as the families of the captives in Grozny call for their release.	https://www.voanews.com/a/russian-region-holding-ukrainian-prisoners-of-war-as-bargaining-chip-/7983230.html	2025-02-21T06:11:06-08:00	
Netanyahu: Hamas will 'pay the price' for not returning body of Israeli hostage	Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said Friday Hamas will 'pay the price' for failing to release the body of hostage Shiri Babas, according to the peace agreement with Israel. 'We will act with determination to bring Shiri home along with all our hostages -- both living and dead -- and ensure Hamas pays the full price for this cruel and evil violation of the agreement,' Netanyahu said in a video statement. 'Not only did they abduct the father, Yarden Bibas, the young mother, Shiri, and their two small infants in an unimaginably cynical manner, but they also failed to return Shiri to her small children, the little angels, and instead placed the body of a Gazan woman in a coffin,' he said. Hamas said Friday Shiri Babas’ remains appeared to have been mixed with other human remains from rubble after an Israeli airstrike hit the place she was held, the Reuter News Agency reported. The bodies of three Israeli hostages and the body of a fourth, unidentified woman, were returned to Israel on Thursday in the latest release under a ceasefire between Israel and the militant group Hamas. Hundreds of people gathered in the southern Gaza city of Khan Younis where Hamas handed over four black coffins to the Red Cross, which took them away in a convoy and delivered them to the Israeli military. An Israeli procession passed through areas where people gathered on the side of the road holding Israeli flags. The bodies arrived several hours later at the National Center of Forensic Medicine in Tel Aviv to confirm their identities. Those released Thursday included the youngest captives – infant Kfir Bibas, who was 9 months old when he was kidnapped, and his 4-year-old brother, Ariel Bibas. The body of their mother, Shiri Bibas, was also supposed to be released. But on Friday, local time, the Israeli military said the female body was not Shiri Bibas. The body does not belong to any other hostage and remains unidentified, the military said. The Israeli military accused Hamas of violating the ceasefire agreement. 'This is a violation of utmost severity by the Hamas terrorist organization, which is obliged under the agreement to return four deceased hostages,' the military said in a statement. Israel’s United Nations representative Danny Danon also condemned Hamas for returning an unidentified body. 'Hamas returned an unidentified body, as if it were a worthless shipment. This is a new low, an evil and cruelty with no parallel,' Danon said in a statement. The Bibas family was abducted from Kibbutz Nir Oz by Hamas on Oct. 7, 2023. Video of the abduction showed Shiri Bibas swaddling the boys in a blanket and being whisked away by armed men. Hamas has said the boys and their mother were killed in an Israeli airstrike in November 2023. Their father, Yarden Bibas, was kidnapped separately and returned alive earlier this month. The body of fellow Nir Oz resident Oded Lifshitz, who was 83 when he was abducted from his home, was also released on Thursdsay. 'We received with deep sorrow the official and bitter news confirming the identification of our beloved Oded's body,' the Lifshitz family said in a statement released by a group representing family members of those taken hostage on Oct. 7, 2023. Israeli President Isaac Herzog said on X that the hearts of the entire nation 'lie in tatters.' 'On behalf of the State of Israel, I bow my head and ask for forgiveness,' Herzog said. 'Forgiveness for not protecting you on that terrible day. Forgiveness for not bringing you home safely.' Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said Thursday would be 'a day of grief' for his nation. Hundreds of people gathered in the southern Gaza city of Khan Younis where Hamas handed over four black coffins to the Red Cross, which took them away in a convoy and delivered them to the Israeli military. An Israeli procession passed through areas where people gathered on the side of the road holding Israeli flags. The bodies arrived several hours later at the National Center of Forensic Medicine in Tel Aviv to confirm their identities. Before transferring the four coffins to the Red Cross, Hamas had them displayed on a stage at the handover site along with flags and banners. One of the banners accused Netanyahu of being a war criminal and said Israeli airstrikes killed the hostages. The United Nations criticized what it called the 'abhorrent and cruel' staging of the event, with U.N. human rights chief Volker Türk saying Thursday the remains need to be respected. 'Under international law, any handover of the remains of deceased must comply with the prohibition of cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment, ensuring respect for the dignity of the deceased and their families,' Türk said in a statement. The International Committee of the Red Cross, which has facilitated the hostage and prisoner releases so far, also had called for handovers of bodies 'to be done privately out of utmost respect for the deceased and those left grieving.' On Saturday, six living hostages are set to be released in exchange for hundreds more Palestinians detained by Israeli forces in Gaza during the war. Israel and Hamas are in the process of implementing the first phase of a ceasefire that began on Jan. 19. Talks on the second phase are scheduled to begin this week, according to Israeli Foreign Minister Gideon Saar. A Hamas spokesperson on Thursday accused Netanyahu of 'procrastinating regarding the second phrase,' saying the group was 'ready to engage.' A Hamas official told Agence France-Presse that the remaining hostages may be released together during the next phase of the truce. 'We have informed the mediators that Hamas is ready to release all hostages in one batch during the second phase of the agreement, rather than in stages as in the current first phase,' senior Hamas official Taher al-Nunu told the news agency. Hamas is believed to be holding 66 more captives, about half of them living. The group has said it will release the remaining hostages only in exchange for a lasting halt to the fighting and a full Israeli troop withdrawal from Gaza. Meanwhile, Israel has not backed off its goal, supported by the United States, of eradicating any military or governing role for Hamas in Gaza. Hamas, a U.S.-designated terror group, killed about 1,200 people in the October 2023 attack and took about 250 as hostages. More than half of the captives have been released in ceasefire agreements and other deals, while eight were rescued in military operations. Israel's air and ground war killed more than 48,200 Palestinians, mostly women and children, according to Gaza's Health Ministry, which does not say how many were combatants. The Israeli military says the death toll includes 17,000 militants. The offensive destroyed vast areas of Gaza and displaced most of its population of 2.3 million. Some information for this report came from The Associated Press, Agence France-Presse and Reuters.	https://www.voanews.com/a/netanyahu-hamas-will-pay-the-price-for-not-returning-body-of-israeli-hostage-/7983003.html	2025-02-21T01:42:42-08:00	
Commercial airlines warned as Chinese navy holds live-fire exercises off Australia	SYDNEY — Airlines modified flight paths between Australia and New Zealand on Friday after China notified Australia that the People's Liberation Army Navy would hold live-fire exercises off the New South Wales coast in international waters, a rare event. Australia's Prime Minister Anthony Albanese told reporters on Friday afternoon that the time period for the Chinese navy exercises had expired, and it was unclear if live fire had been used by the Chinese navy. 'China issued, in accordance with practice, an alert that it would be conducting these activities, including the potential use of live fire. It's outside of Australia's exclusive economic zone,' he said, indicating it was at least 370 kilometers offshore. 'According to defense, there has been no imminent risk of danger to any Australian assets or New Zealand assets, and that's why this notification occurs,' he added. A People's Liberation Army Navy frigate, cruiser and replenishment vessel last week entered Australia's maritime approaches, and traveled down Australia's east coast this week, monitored by the navies and air forces of Australia and New Zealand. Airlines were contacted by Australia's air traffic control agency on Friday warning them of reports of live fire where the Chinese navy task group was operating, the agency and Australian officials said. 'The Civil Aviation Authority and Airservices Australia are aware of reports of live firing in international waters,' air traffic control agency Airservices Australia said in a statement. 'As a precaution, we have advised airlines with flights planned in the area,' it added. Qantas and its low-cost arm Jetstar were monitoring the airspace and temporarily adjusted some flights across the Tasman Sea between Australia and New Zealand. Air New Zealand said it had modified flight paths as needed to avoid the area, with no impact to its operations, while Virgin Australia was following instructions from Airservices Australia. Albanese said he had contacted New Zealand's Prime Minister Christopher Luxon about the matter. 'The chief of the defense force has advised that it's not clear whether there was any actual live fire used in this area, but it is consistent with international law,' Albanese said. Foreign Minister Penny Wong would raise the matter with her Chinese counterpart in South Africa, where they are attending the G20 foreign ministers meeting, he added. Wong said the live fire was 'an evolving situation.' 'We do have concerns about the transparency associated with this and the notice, and I certainly will be having a discussion with (China's) Foreign Minister Wang about that,' she said in an ABC television interview Friday.	https://www.voanews.com/a/commercial-airlines-warned-as-chinese-navy-holds-live-fire-exercises-off-australia/7982998.html	2025-02-21T01:15:09-08:00	
US tax agency fires 6,000 amid federal government downsizing	A tearful executive at the U.S. Internal Revenue Service told staffers on Thursday that about 6,000 employees would be fired, a person familiar with the matter said, in a move that would eliminate roughly 6% of the agency's workforce in the midst of the busy tax-filing season. The cuts are part of President Donald Trump's sweeping downsizing effort that has targeted bank regulators, forest workers, rocket scientists and tens of thousands of other government employees. The effort is being led by tech billionaire Elon Musk, Trump's biggest campaign donor. Musk was on stage at the Conservative Political Action Conference in National Harbor, Maryland, when Argentine President Javier Milei, known for wielding a chain saw to illustrate his drastic policies slashing government spending, handed him one. 'This is the chain saw for bureaucracy,' said Musk, holding the power tool aloft as a stage prop to symbolize the drastic slashing of government jobs. Labor unions have sued to try to stop the mass firings, under which tens of thousands of federal workers have been told they no longer have a job, but a federal judge in Washington on Thursday ruled that they can continue for now. Christy Armstrong, IRS director of talent acquisition, teared up as she told employees on a phone call that about 6,000 of their colleagues would be laid off and encouraged them to support each other, a worker who was on the call said. 'She was pretty emotional,' the worker said. The layoffs are expected to total 6,700, according to a person familiar with the matter, and largely target workers at the agency hired as part of an expansion under Democratic President Joe Biden, who had sought to expand enforcement efforts on wealthy taxpayers. Republicans have opposed the expansion, arguing that it would lead to harassment of ordinary Americans. The tax agency now employs roughly 100,000 people, compared with 80,000 before Biden took office in 2021. Independent budget analysts had estimated that the staff expansion under Biden would work to boost government revenue and help narrow trillion-dollar budget deficits. 'This will ensure that the IRS is not going after the wealthy and is only an agency that's really focused on the low income,' said University of Pittsburgh tax law professor, Philip Hackney, a former IRS lawyer. 'It's a travesty.' Those fired include revenue agents, customer-service workers, specialists who hear appeals of tax disputes, and IT workers, and impact employees across all 50 states, sources said. The IRS did not respond to a request for comment. The IRS has taken a more careful approach to downsizing than other agencies, given that it is in the middle of the tax-filing season. The agency expects to process more than 140 million individual returns by the April 15 filing deadline and will retain several thousand workers deemed critical for that task, one source said. The Trump administration's federal layoffs have focused on workers across the government who are new to their positions and have fewer protections than longer-tenured employees. Meanwhile, the Trump White House is also preparing to dissolve the leadership of the U.S. Postal Service and absorb the independent agency into the Commerce Department, the Washington Post reported on Thursday. Waiting for dismissal email At the IRS's Kansas City office, probationary workers found all functions had been disabled on their computers except email, which would deliver their dismissal notices, said Shannon Ellis, a local union leader. 'What the American people really need to understand is that the funds that are collected through the Internal Revenue Service, they fund so many programs that we use every day in our society,' Ellis told Reuters. The White House has not said how many of the nation's 2.3 million civil-service workers it wants to fire and has given no numbers on the mass layoffs. Roughly 75,000 took a buyout offer last week. The campaign has delighted Republicans for culling a federal workforce they view as bloated, corrupt and insufficiently loyal to Trump, while also taking aim at government agencies that regulate big business -- including those that oversee Musk's companies SpaceX, Tesla and Neuralink. The small unit within the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration that regulates the kind of autonomous cars that Musk says are the future of Tesla is losing nearly half of its staff, the Post reported on Thursday. Musk's Department of Government Efficiency team has also canceled contracts worth about $8.5 billion involving foreign aid, diversity training and other initiatives opposed by Trump. Both men have set a goal of cutting at least $1 trillion from the $6.7 trillion federal budget, though Trump has said he will not touch popular benefits programs that make up roughly one-third of that total. Democratic critics have said Trump is exceeding his constitutional authority and hacking away at popular and critical government programs at the expense of legions of middle-class families. Most Americans worry the cost-cutting could hurt government services, according to a Reuters/Ipsos poll released Thursday. Some agencies have struggled to comply with the rapid-fire directives Trump has issued since taking office a month ago. Workers who oversee U.S. nuclear weapons were fired and then recalled, while medicines and food exports have been stranded in warehouses by Trump's freeze on foreign aid.	https://www.voanews.com/a/us-tax-agency-fires-6-000-amid-federal-government-downsizing/7982991.html	2025-02-21T00:57:35-08:00	
Costa Rica and Honduras join Panama as stopovers for foreign deportees	SAN JOSE, COSTA RICA — A group of families and children hailing from Uzbekistan, China, Afghanistan, Russia and more countries climbed down the stairs of an airplane in Costa Rica's capital Thursday, the first flight of deportees from other nations Costa Rica agreed to hold in detention facilities for the Trump administration while it organized the return back to their countries. The flight of 135 deportees, half of them minors, added Costa Rica to a growing list of Latin American nations to serve as a stopover for migrants as U.S. President Donald Trump’s administration seeks to step up deportations. While Costa Rica joins Panama in holding deportees from mostly Asian origin until their repatriation can be arranged or they can seek protection somewhere, Honduras on Thursday also facilitated a handoff of deportees between the U.S. and Venezuela from a flight coming from Guantanamo Bay. The migrants arriving in Costa Rica will be bused to a rural holding facility near the Panama border, where they will be detained up to six weeks and be flown back to their countries of origin, said Omer Badilla, Costa Rica’s deputy minister of the interior and police. The U.S. government will cover the costs. The arrangement is part of a deal the Trump administration struck with Costa Rica during U.S. Secretary of State Marco Rubio's visit earlier this month. It comes as Trump has pressured countries across the region to help facilitate deportations at times under the threat of steep tariffs or sanctions. Costa Rican President Rodrigo Chaves told reporters Wednesday that his country is helping its 'economically powerful brother from the north.' Similar agreements have been reached with other Latin American nations, but the concept of using third countries as deportation layovers has drawn strong criticism from human rights advocates. Beyond the conditions of their detention in Costa Rica, concerns revolve around international protections for asylum seekers and whether these deportees will be appropriately screened before being returned to their countries or sent to yet another country. Panama this week became the first such country to accept 299 deportees from other nations, with the government holding them in hotel rooms guarded by police. About one-third of those who refused to voluntarily return to their countries were sent to a remote camp in Darien province bordering Colombia on Wednesday. The rest were awaiting commercial flights back home. 'We’ve thrown out the possibility of a hotel, precisely to avoid a situation similar to that in Panama,' Badilla, the Costa Rican official, told The Associated Press. Honduras said Thursday it also acted as a brief stopover for a deportation flight of Venezuelans coming from Guantanamo Bay in what it described as a 'humanitarian bridge' since there are no direct flights between the United States and Venezuela. A U.S. flight carrying 170 Venezuelans landed Thursday in a joint U.S.-Honduran military base in central Honduras, and within hours were transferred to a Venezuelan aircraft. An official with Honduras’ foreign ministry said this was not a routine arrangement, but that the Central American nation remains open to facilitating more transfers between the two adversaries. Badilla said that Thursday's deportation flight from San Diego is largely made up of families, including 65 children, two pregnant women and an elderly woman. He said Costa Rica was told by the Trump administration that most of the deportees have agreed to voluntarily return to their countries. If they refuse, Costa Rica is open to offering deportees refuge or will work with the U.N.'s International Organization for Migration, IOM, to facilitate travel to another third country. 'Costa Rica is a country that guarantees human rights,' he said. 'We are going to guarantee that they are returned to safe countries. We cannot leave that to chance because of an ethical and moral commitment of our country.' In the meantime, migrants will be detained in the border facility, where they will be accompanied by U.N. officials, the Red Cross and other aid-focused government entities to 'guarantee their rights,' Badilla said. The facility being used to hold migrants, a former factory, has faced criticisms for its conditions in the past. During a visit by the AP in October 2023, migrants were fenced off in cramped facilities and said they felt like 'prisoners.' Many slept in tents on the ground, where some said liquid from portable toilets leaked. Badilla said that facilities have since been improved, but the government has denied journalists access to the building. The facility will also be processing a 'reverse flow' of migrants from Venezuela, Colombia and Ecuador that previously sought asylum in the U.S. and now want to return home. Badilla said Costa Rica has seen between 50 and 75 migrants headed south entering the country a day. IOM said in a statement to the AP that 'we do not have direct involvement in the detention or restriction of movement of individuals' and that it was providing humanitarian support and supporting voluntary returns to their countries and 'identifying safe alternatives for others.'	https://www.voanews.com/a/costa-rica-and-honduras-join-panama-as-stopovers-for-foreign-deportees-/7982987.html	2025-02-21T00:43:08-08:00	
China's military says it drove away Philippine aircraft near Spratly Islands	BEIJING — China's military said it warned and drove away three Philippine aircraft that 'illegally intruded' into the airspace near the Spratly Islands on Thursday. There was no immediate comment from the Philippine Embassy in Beijing on the Chinese military's statement issued on Friday. China's Southern Theatre Command accused the Philippine side of attempting to 'peddle its illegal claims' through provocation and warned that the 'clumsy maneuver is doomed to failure.' China claims sovereignty over almost the entire South China Sea, a vital waterway for more than $3 trillion of annual ship-borne commerce, putting it at odds with Brunei, Indonesia, Malaysia, the Philippines, and Vietnam. A 2016 arbitration ruling invalidated China's expansive claim, but Beijing does not recognize the decision. On Thursday, the Philippines said its coast guard and fisheries bureau had jointly carried out a maritime domain awareness flight over the Kalayaan Islands, the Philippine name for Spratly Islands. The mission was to assert the Philippines' sovereignty, sovereign rights, and maritime jurisdiction in the West Philippine Sea, it said. More than 50 Chinese maritime militia vessels and a Chinese coast guard ship were spotted during the exercise. It was not immediately clear if that mission, which deployed two aircraft, was the one Chinese military said it responded to. The latest confrontation comes after Philippine coast guard accused the Chinese navy of performing dangerous flight maneuvers earlier this week when it flew close to a government aircraft patrolling the contested Scarborough Shoal in the South China Sea. Beijing disputed that account.	https://www.voanews.com/a/china-s-military-says-it-drove-away-philippine-aircraft-near-spratly-islands/7982985.html	2025-02-21T00:30:33-08:00	
South Korea's ousted PM says he tried to stop martial law decree	SEOUL, SOUTH KOREA — South Korea's ousted premier said on Thursday that he had opposed suspended President Yoon Suk Yeol's declaration of martial law, testifying for the first time at his former boss's impeachment trial about the events of a night that threw the country into turmoil. Han Duck-soo was impeached by parliament as acting president and prime minister in December over alleged obstruction of the trial that could formally remove Yoon from office for his martial law decree. He appeared before that trial for the first time on Thursday, telling Seoul's Constitutional Court he had 'expressed my opposition' to Yoon's decision to suspend civilian rule on the night of Dec. 3. Han said he and most of his fellow cabinet members 'believed such a declaration would put South Korea in serious difficulty' and that he recalled them 'being concerned and trying to dissuade it.' The court said later on Thursday the final hearing will be held on the 25th. The judges will then deliberate behind closed doors, with elections required within 60 days if Yoon is removed. Yoon walked out of the court just five minutes after proceedings began on Thursday, according to a pool report. His lawyer Yoon Kap-keun told reporters the ousted president felt it was 'inappropriate' for him to sit in the same court room with Han 'or for the president to watch the prime minister testify.' 'It is not good for the nation's prestige,' his lawyer quoted Yoon as saying. Yoon returned later to hear the testimony of former senior intelligence official Hong Jang-won, seen as a key figure in the decision to declare martial law. Hong has claimed to be in possession of a memo containing a list of names of individuals Yoon ordered arrested during the night of the martial law declaration, including the leaders of the opposition and Yoon's own ruling party. 'I will do my best to recount everything as I remember it,' Hong told reporters before the hearing. Court footage showed Yoon shouting at Hong, accusing him of plotting his impeachment. Given the opportunity to speak by one of the court's eight judges, Yoon acknowledged that it was 'unnecessary and wrong' to try to track the locations of politicians on the night of the decree but also said he was doing it simply to 'monitor movements' and not to 'arrest' them. The head of South Korea's National Police Agency, who is also on trial on insurrection charges related to the martial law decree, is another witness. Courting controversy The impeachment hearing was Yoon's second of the day. He also appeared in court in the morning to answer charges of insurrection, becoming South Korea's first sitting president to stand trial in a criminal case. The 64-year-old former prosecutor has been behind bars since he was arrested last month on those charges, for which he could be sentenced to life in prison -- or face the death penalty -- if convicted. Yoon attended that hearing but did not speak, an AFP journalist in the packed courtroom said. Prosecutors have accused the suspended president of being the 'ringleader of an insurrection.' They argued on Thursday against releasing him, saying he could try to 'influence or persuade those involved in the case.' Yoon's lawyer Kim Hong-il condemned the 'illegal probe,' telling the court the 'investigating body has no jurisdiction.' 'The declaration of martial law was not intended to paralyze the state,' Kim said. Instead, he said, it was meant to 'alert the public to the national crisis caused by the legislative dictatorship of the dominant opposition party, which had crippled the administration.' Much of Yoon's impeachment trial has centered on the question of whether he violated the constitution by declaring martial law, which is reserved for national emergencies or times of war. The crisis has plunged South Korea into months of political turmoil with protests, two impeachments and a surge of online disinformation. Yoon also sent a message rallying his supporters on Thursday, urging 'the older and established generations to work together with the younger generation.' 'If that happens, I will be able to swiftly return to my duties and lead South Korea with the power of generational integration,' Yoon said, according to his lawyers.	https://www.voanews.com/a/south-korea-s-ousted-pm-says-he-tried-to-stop-martial-law-decree/7982981.html	2025-02-21T00:18:34-08:00	
South Korea requests exclusion from US plan to increase tariffs	SEOUL, SOUTH KOREA — South Korean officials have asked the Trump administration to exclude their country from U.S. plans to impose aggressive tariffs on trade partners, emphasizing that Seoul is already applying low duties on American products under the free trade agreement between the two nations. South Korea’s government on Friday said Deputy Trade Minister Park Jong-won made the request while traveling to Washington this week for meetings with unspecified officials from the White House, the Department of Commerce and the Office of the U.S. Trade Representative. The South Korean Trade Ministry didn’t say what Park heard from the Americans. Park cited how South Korean companies were contributing to the U.S. economy through large-scale business investments and noted that the country was already imposing low duties on free trade partners such as the United States. He called for South Korea to be excluded from U.S. plans to establish reciprocal tariffs with trade partners and raise duties for imported steel and aluminum, the ministry said. South Korea’s top economic think tank this month slashed its growth forecast for the country’s economy for the second time since November, expressing concern about the impact of U.S. President Donald Trump’s expanding tariffs and other measures aimed at resetting global trade. The state-run Korea Development Institute projected the national economy to grow by 1.6% in 2025, which was 0.4 percentage points lower than its previous estimate. The group’s economists assessed that Trump’s steel and aluminum tariffs won’t likely have a major impact on South Korea’s economy, as those products account for less than 1% of its exports to the U.S. However, they expressed concern that possible increases in U.S. duties for semiconductors and cars would hurt the country’s trade-dependent economy more. South Korea’s acting president, Choi Sang-mok, on Friday called a meeting with trade and foreign policy officials to discuss the potential impact of Trump’s trade measures, including reciprocal tariffs and possible product-specific duties for semiconductors, cars and pharmaceuticals. Choi, who is also South Korea’s finance minister, instructed officials to examine how other major economies, including the European Union, Japan and China, are responding to Trump’s trade policies, and try harder to effectively communicate South Korea’s position to U.S. officials. South Korea’s trade surplus with the U.S. reached $55.7 billion in 2024. According to the South Korean trade ministry, the country’s tariff rates on U.S. manufacturing imports is around zero percent.	https://www.voanews.com/a/south-korea-requests-exclusion-from-us-plan-to-increase-tariffs/7982973.html	2025-02-20T23:45:09-08:00	
Philippine police arrest more than 450 in raid on alleged 'Chinese-run' scam center	MANILA, PHILIPPINES — Philippine police arrested more than 450 people in a raid on an allegedly Chinese-run offshore gaming operator in Manila, the country's anti-organized crime commission has said. Initial interrogations suggested the suburban site had been operating as a scam center, targeting victims in China and India with sports betting and investment schemes, the commission said after the Thursday raid, which saw 137 Chinese nationals detained. 'We arrested around five Chinese bosses,' commission chief Gilberto Cruz told AFP on Friday, adding they faced potential trafficking charges. Banned by President Ferdinand Marcos last year, Philippine online gaming operators, or POGOs, are said to be used as cover by organized crime groups for human trafficking, money laundering, online fraud, kidnappings and even murder. 'This raid proves that the previous POGO workers are still trying to continue their scamming activities despite the ban,' Cruz said. He previously told AFP that about 21,000 Chinese nationals have continued to operate smaller-scale scam operations in the country since the online gaming ban. International concern has grown in recent years over similar scam operations in other Asian nations that are often staffed by trafficking victims tricked or coerced into promoting bogus cryptocurrency investments and other cons. President Marcos has put POGOs at the center of recent campaign messaging in the run-up to May mid-term elections, framing predecessor Rodrigo Duterte's alleged tolerance of the sites as evidence of a too-cozy relationship with China. Thursday's raid is the latest in a series of busts this year, including one in January that saw some 400 foreigners arrested in the capital, including many Chinese nationals. The Washington-based think tank United States Institute of Peace said in a May 2024 report that online scammers target millions of victims around the world and rake in annual revenues of $64 billion.	https://www.voanews.com/a/philippine-police-arrest-more-than-450-in-raid-on-alleged-chinese-run-scam-center/7982967.html	2025-02-20T23:32:08-08:00	
Netanyahu orders 'intensive' West Bank operations after Israel bus blasts	JERUSALEM — Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu on Friday ordered an 'intensive operation against centers of terrorism' in the occupied West Bank, his office said, after three buses exploded in central Israel without causing any reported injuries. Three devices detonated on buses in the city of Bat Yam on Thursday evening and two others were being defused, according to police, with Israel's defense minister accusing 'Palestinian terrorist' groups of being behind the blasts. Netanyahu's office said on social media early Friday that he had completed a security assessment with top officials, ordering fresh counterterrorism operations as well as stepped up security in Israeli cities. 'The Prime Minister has ordered the IDF (military) to carry out an intensive operation against centers of terrorism in Judea and Samaria,' Netanyahu's office said on X, using the biblical term for the West Bank. 'The Prime Minister also ordered the Israel Police and the ISA (internal security agency) to increase preventative activity against additional attacks in Israeli cities,' he added. A large number of police were deployed to search for suspects after the 'suspected terror attack,' the police force said in a statement. 'Police bomb disposal units are scanning for additional suspicious objects. We urge the public to avoid the areas and remain alert for any suspicious items,' it added. Tzvika Brot, the mayor of Bat Yam, said in a video statement that there were 'no injured in these incidents.' Security forces and bomb disposal units were seen by an AFP journalist as they inspected the remains of destroyed buses. Israeli media said that bus drivers countrywide had been asked to stop and inspect their vehicles for additional explosive devices. 'Intensify' West Bank raids A police commander from central Israel, Haim Sargarof, said in a televised briefing that the devices used to set off the blasts were similar to those found in the West Bank. Separately, Defense Minister Israel Katz said he ordered the military to 'intensify operations to thwart terrorism' in West Bank refugee camps, particularly Tulkarem. The military has been carrying out near-daily raids in West Bank cities and camps for several weeks now targeting Palestinian militants. Multiple Palestinian civilians have also been killed in the raids, while Israeli security forces have destroyed homes and infrastructure. The military operation has displaced more than 40,000 Palestinians, according to the United Nations. Violence in the West Bank, which Israel has occupied since 1967, has escalated since the October 2023 outbreak of war in the Gaza Strip. At least 897 Palestinians including militants have been killed by Israeli forces or settlers in the West Bank since the Gaza war began, according to an AFP tally based on figures provided by the Palestinian health ministry in Ramallah. At least 32 Israelis, including some soldiers, have been killed in Palestinian attacks or confrontations during Israeli operations in the West Bank over the same period, according to official Israeli figures.	https://www.voanews.com/a/netanyahu-orders-intensive-west-bank-operations-after-israel-bus-blasts/7982955.html	2025-02-20T23:08:35-08:00

US Senate Republicans push to pass border bill without Trump tax cuts	WASHINGTON — The U.S. Senate on Thursday began a debate on a Republican bill to advance President Donald Trump's priorities on immigration, energy and defense, even after he urged lawmakers to scrap the effort in favor of a House of Representatives bill that would also include trillions of dollars in tax cuts. Trump this week came down firmly in favor of House Republicans' plan for a single sweeping bill. Backers of that plan fear that passing an immigration bill first could diminish their chances of extending $4.5 trillion in tax cuts in the House, where Republicans hold a narrow and fractious 218-215 majority. Senate Republicans said they would nonetheless push ahead with their narrower plan and address tax cuts in a later bill. They are seeking to bypass Democratic opposition in that chamber and secure an early legislative win for Trump. Democrats lack the votes to stop the bill but have vowed to fight it as long as possible, accusing Republicans of shortchanging American families to benefit the wealthy with tax breaks. 'We're going to be here all night,' Senate Democratic Leader Chuck Schumer proclaimed just before voting on amendments that began Thursday evening. Schumer introduced the first amendment, which seeks to prohibit tax cuts for those earning more than $1 billion. Republicans blocked the amendment. Democratic Senator Tim Kaine put the Senate on notice that he alone was seeking debate on about two dozen amendments ranging from middle-class tax cuts to measures protecting federal workers from termination and social safety net programs from cuts. Republican Senate Budget Committee Chairman Lindsey Graham said earlier in the evening that there was an urgent need to beef up border security and the U.S. military. He argued that the higher spending ordered in the legislation would be 'offset with $342 billion in cuts in other parts of the government.' In a rarely used Senate process known as a 'vote-a-rama,' amendments can be offered until both parties agree to stop. Normally, the two parties agree upon a narrow set of amendments for debate in the full Senate on legislation. Republicans, who hold a 53-47 advantage over Democrats in the Senate, were expected to defeat scores of opposition amendments. Both chambers of Congress need to pass the same budget resolution to unlock the parliamentary tool that would enable Republicans to enact Trump's legislative agenda in a way that circumvents Democratic opposition and the Senate filibuster. Democrats made use of this maneuver in the first two years of Joe Biden's presidency, when they held majorities in both chambers of Congress. The Senate's bill, which leaves the issue of Trump's desired extension of his 2017 tax cuts to a later date, could serve as a backup in case the House Republicans cannot agree on how to pay for the tax cuts in their bill without slashing funding for popular safety net programs like Medicaid and Social Security or potentially adding to the country's $36 trillion debt. The Senate measure, a $340 billion fiscal 2025 budget resolution, would boost spending by $85 billion a year for four years to fund tighter border security, Trump's deportation of immigrants in the country illegally, energy deregulation, and an increase in military spending. The House budget resolution includes those same priorities along with $4.5 trillion in tax cuts, while seeking to cover the cost through $2 trillion in spending cuts and accelerated economic growth based mainly on the tax and energy policy changes it would usher in.	https://www.voanews.com/a/us-senate-republicans-push-to-pass-border-bill-without-trump-tax-cuts-/7982905.html	2025-02-20T19:03:43-08:00

Mexico’s president calls for constitutional reform to protect nation's sovereignty	Mexico’s president said Thursday that she would propose constitutional reforms to protect her country’s sovereignty, after the administration of U.S. President Donald Trump designated eight Mexican drug cartels as foreign terrorist organizations. 'The Mexican people will not accept under any circumstances interventions, interference or any other act from abroad that could be harmful to the integrity, independence and sovereignty of the nation,' President Claudia Sheinbaum said Thursday in her morning press conference. Some in Mexico fear that the Trump administration’s designation of the drug cartels as terrorist organizations could be the first step to U.S. military action within Mexico, something Trump proposed during his presidential election campaign. On Thursday, the names of the cartels were published in the U.S. Federal Register, carrying out one of Trump’s Jan. 20 executive orders. The Mexican president said the U.S. did not consult with her government before making the designations, which are usually reserved for terrorist groups with political goals, not groups looking to make financial gains. Sheinbaum said that any foreign investigations or prosecutions conducted by foreign agents on Mexican soil could not move forward without the authorization by and collaboration with the Mexican government. 'What we want to make clear in the face of this designation is that we do not negotiate sovereignty,' Sheinbaum said. 'This cannot be an opportunity for the United States to invade our sovereignty.' Laws passed under Sheinbaum's predecessor, Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador, restricted the independence and movements of foreign agents in Mexico. Sheinbaum now wants those laws written into Mexico’s constitution. Sheinbaum also wants an addition to the constitution that would apply the stiffest penalties possible to people engaged in the manufacturing, smuggling and distribution of guns. This has long been a point of contention between Mexico and the U.S., as Mexico is flooded with guns from U.S. shops and manufacturers.

US flies Venezuelan migrants from Guantanamo to Honduras	The U.S. government flew 177 Venezuelan migrants from Guantanamo Bay to Honduras on Thursday, from where they are set to be transferred on to Venezuela, U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement and the Department of Homeland Security said. Earlier on Thursday, the Honduran government said about 170 Venezuelan migrants were set to arrive in the Central American nation from the United States, before being transported immediately back to Venezuela. The transfer of the migrants would take place at Soto Cano, a joint U.S.-Honduras military air base, the Honduran government said. Venezuela requested the repatriation of the citizens who it said were unjustly taken to Guantanamo naval base, Foreign Minister Yvan Gil said in a statement posted on Telegram, adding they would be flown from Honduras by Venezuelan airline Conviasa. The arrival in Venezuela is expected Thursday evening local time. Lawyers representing at least half a dozen of the deportees said they learned about the deportations on Thursday afternoon. The deportations come after the American Civil Liberties Union filed a lawsuit last week seeking access to dozens of migrants flown to the U.S. naval base in Guantanamo Bay, Cuba, saying they were being denied the right to an attorney. The deportees included 126 people with criminal charges or convictions, 80 of whom were allegedly affiliated with Tren de Aragua, a Department of Homeland Security spokesperson said, adding that 51 had no criminal record. There are no migrant detainees left at Guantanamo after Thursday’s deportations, the spokesperson said. The U.S. has designated Tren de Aragua a global terrorist organization along with other organized crime groups, as President Donald Trump steps up immigration enforcement against alleged gang members in the United States.	https://www.voanews.com/a/us-flies-venezuelan-migrants-from-guantanamo-to-honduras/7982890.html	2025-02-20T17:54:54-08:00	
Trump order challenges independence of FCC, other agencies	WASHINGTON — President Donald Trump this week signed an executive order intended to expand the White House’s authority over various independent regulatory agencies that Congress set up to be shielded from direct White House control, including the U.S. Federal Communications Commission. The order, signed Tuesday, would require independent agencies to submit proposed regulations to the White House for review. The order also would require agencies to consult with the White House on their 'policies and priorities' and 'strategic plans.' 'These regulatory agencies currently exercise substantial executive authority without sufficient accountability to the President, and through him, to the American people,' the order said. The executive order, titled 'Ensuring Accountability for All Agencies,' is expected to face challenges in court, according to legal experts. The move came as the president has worked to consolidate power within the executive branch, including by removing more than a dozen inspectors general who provided oversight at various government agencies. In addition to the FCC, agencies that would be affected by the new order include the Federal Trade Commission and the Securities and Exchange Commission. The FCC does not directly regulate major news networks, but it does evaluate the actions of broadcasting stations around the U.S. that hold FCC licenses to use public airwaves. Former FCC chairs told VOA that the move would be a significant change for the FCC. 'It makes an independent agency that was created to be independent like an agency in the executive branch,' said Tom Wheeler, who served as FCC chairman under former President Barack Obama. Reed Hundt, who served as FCC chairman under former President Bill Clinton, agreed that the order would mark a departure from the agency’s nearly 100-year history. 'For 90 years, the governmental idea was that the president should not be regulating the media,' Hundt told VOA. Harold Furchtgott-Roth, a Republican who served as an FCC commissioner under Clinton, told VOA that the order 'would have a major effect on rulemaking' at the FCC. He added that other areas, like enforcement, might not be affected. Democratic FCC Commissioner Anna Gomez told VOA that she was concerned by the order. 'Our informed decision-making is meant to be consistent with our technical expertise, not subject to political pressure,' Gomez told VOA in an emailed statement. Gomez added that Congress already provides oversight over the FCC. 'Efforts to expand executive influence on the FCC will only further diminish our standing as a stable, independent and expert-driven regulatory body,' said Gomez, who has served as a commissioner since 2023. Trump-appointed FCC Chairman Brendan Carr, as well as Commissioners Geoffrey Starks and Nathan Simington, did not immediately reply to VOA’s emails requesting comment on the order. Carr and Simington are Republicans, Starks is a Democrat. Kim Zarkin, a professor of communication at Westminster University in Utah who has researched the FCC for three decades, said she thought it was important for the FCC and other independent agencies to remain as nonpolitical as possible. Even though commissioners at agencies such as the FCC are nominated by the president, 'there was always this expectation that these were meant to be nonpolitical,' Zarkin told VOA. 'They were meant to bring in expertise.' Zarkin, who has written two books on the FCC, said time will tell whether the order has any material impact on how the FCC and other agencies operate. Trump’s executive order comes amid concerns that the FCC is being weaponized to intimidate broadcasters through investigations, according to Democratic FCC commissioners and media law experts. The FCC is currently investigating broadcasters, including NPR, PBS, CBS and NBC. The FCC is investigating whether NPR and PBS member stations violated FCC rules on airing commercial ads. Both broadcasters deny wrongdoing. The CBS inquiry pertains to whether the broadcaster doctored an October '60 Minutes' interview with former Vice President Kamala Harris. That interview is also at the center of a $10 billion lawsuit from Trump. CBS denied wrongdoing when Trump filed the lawsuit. Earlier this month, CBS published the interview’s unedited transcripts, which showed '60 Minutes' and 'Face the Nation' used slightly different parts of the same answer from Harris, which is common journalistic practice. The NBC investigation is into the company’s diversity, equity and inclusion practices. Democratic FCC commissioners and media law experts have expressed concern about the investigations.	https://www.voanews.com/a/trump-order-challenges-independence-of-fcc-other-agencies/7982860.html	2025-02-20T17:16:01-08:00	
Pope Francis' health condition is stable, Vatican says	Pope Francis 'had a restful night,' and Thursday morning 'got out of bed and had breakfast in an armchair,' the Vatican said in a statement. Francis was admitted to Rome's Gemelli Hospital last week with bronchitis, which then developed into double pneumonia. Vatican spokesperson Matteo Bruni said Thursday that the pope now has focal pneumonia with limited areas of infection in the lungs. Bruni said Francis is breathing on his own, and his heart is stable. An earlier statement Thursday reported the pope's clinical condition as 'stable,' and his blood tests had shown 'a slight improvement, particularly in the inflammatory indices.' Wednesday evening, Italian Prime Minister Giorgia Meloni visited the pope for 20 minutes in the hospital's special papal suite. 'We joked as always,' the prime minister said in a statement afterward. 'He hasn't lost his proverbial sense of humor.' Francis, whose birth name is Jorge Mario Bergoglio, has been the head of the Roman Catholic Church since 2013, when his predecessor, Pope Benedict XVI, resigned from the papacy. In a recent memoir, Francis addressed the possibility of his own resignation if he became incapacitated. He said such a move would be a 'distant possibility,' justified only if facing 'a serious physical impediment.' 'We are all worried about the pope,' Cardinal Matteo Maria Zuppi, head of the Italian Bishops’ Conference, told Agence France-Presse. Zuppi said, however, that the reports about Francis eating and greeting people are good indications that 'we are on the right path to a full recovery, which we hope will happen soon.' Speaking at a Vatican news conference about a Mediterranean youth peace initiative, Cardinal Juan Jose Omella Omella of Barcelona compared the papacy to a train to give reassurances that the work of the papacy will continue, even with Francis' hospitalization. 'Popes change, we bishops change, priests in parishes change, communities change, but the train continues being on the move,' the cardinal said. Some information in this report came from Reuters and Agence France-Presse.	https://www.voanews.com/a/pope-francis-health-condition-is-stable-vatican-says-/7982824.html	2025-02-20T17:00:09-08:00	
US State Department tweaks online fact sheet on China	WASHINGTON — PRC is out. China is in. That is among the significant modifications to the U.S. State Department’s online fact sheet on China, which drops the country’s official name, the People’s Republic of China (PRC), in favor of just China. Former President Joe Biden’s administration routinely referenced the Beijing government with the PRC abbreviation. Since former President Richard Nixon normalized relations with Beijing — ending recognition of the government in Taipei, the United States has maintained diplomatic ties with the communist-run government on the mainland while reducing the relationship with Taiwan — officially known as the Republic of China — to unofficial but friendly. 'Taipei should take solace in the fact that the change in the term [from PRC to China] does not represent a policy change in the United States. The fact of the matter is that the U.S. still has its ‘One China' policy, and under that policy, it maintains diplomatic relations with Beijing and robust unofficial relations with Taipei,' Russell Hsiao, Global Taiwan Institute executive director, told VOA. 'Since 1979, Washington has recognized the government in Beijing of the People’s Republic of China as the sole legal government of China, so the change in term is essentially a different way of presenting the same set of facts, all of which haven't changed,' Hsiao said. China considers Taiwan a rogue province. Nationalist forces, backed by the United States and commanded by Chiang Kai-shek, fled the mainland for Taiwan in 1949 after losing a civil war to the communist forces led by Mao Zedong. Chiang became Taiwan’s relatively benign dictator until his death in 1975. Mao ruled over the mainland as a rigid authoritarian until his death a year after Chiang died. Washington continues to provide Taipei with weapons and has left the question ambiguous as to whether the United States would use its military to defend the island if Taiwan were to be attacked. The Taiwan Relations Act commits the United States to help Taiwan defend itself, but the final decision on military intervention would rest with the president and Congress. Language changes last week by the State Department eliminated a reference to Washington not supporting Taiwan independence, but left intact was content noting that the United States opposes 'unilateral changes to the status quo' by either side of the Taiwan Strait. A significant change to the State Department’s web page on China, however, is the deletion of content on cooperating with allies on China-related issues and on helping Beijing with cultural matters and environmental protections. Instead, there is new language focusing on the U.S.-China trade relationship, noting the difficulty for American businesses to operate in China and that the Chinese economy is 'one of the most restrictive investment climates in the world.' Yet another shift in tone, in line with rhetoric used by President Donald Trump’s administration, is reflected by frequent references to the Chinese Communist Party (CCP). The party is directly accused of trying to 'manipulate and subvert' United Nations organizations and other international bodies and seeking to 'groom and install CCP members in leadership and other positions' in such groups. In the newly edited fact sheet, the CCP is also blamed for 'malicious cyber activity against U.S. government, private sector and critical infrastructure networks.' The document now notes the United States is dedicated to countering these activities 'to help protect American citizens, businesses and industries.' 'These moves reflect an overall sense in Washington and within the Trump administration that engagement with China has failed and a tougher approach is warranted,' Rorry Daniels, managing director of the Asia Society Policy Institute, told VOA. 'This mood has been building — particularly in Congress — for years, and a change of emphasis is no surprise. However, swapping out PRC for China reflects a deeper and more dangerous narrative that attacks the CCP’s legitimacy as the governing authority of China. I expect this will be viewed with grave concern by Beijing and raised at the highest levels in the coming days and weeks,' added Daniels. Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesman Guo Jiakun, responding during Thursday’s regular press briefing, expressed strong dissatisfaction with the website changes. The State Department’s actions 'misrepresent the facts, attack China’s foreign policy and peddle the so-called China-U.S. strategic competition. We strongly deplore and firmly oppose it,' Guo said. The changes come after Trump imposed an additional 10% tariff on all imports from China. The president said he was taking the action because Beijing’s government has failed to stop the flow into the United States of the illicit opioid fentanyl. Trump has also announced he intends to put in place further retaliatory tariffs on all trading partners that limit access for U.S. goods into their markets.

Trump administration reduces deportation protections for 521,000 Haitians	WASHINGTON — U.S. Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem on Thursday cut the duration of deportation protections and work permits for 521,000 Haitians covered by the Temporary Protected Status program so that they will expire in August, a Homeland Security Department spokesperson said. The decision reverses a Biden administration move last year to extend the protections through February 2026, the spokesperson said, saying the extension was unjustified. President Donald Trump, a Republican, tried to end most enrollment in the TPS program during his 2017-2021 presidency but was blocked by federal courts. Noem earlier this month revoked a Biden-era TPS extension for some 600,000 Venezuelans and terminated the status for half of them, whose protections and access to work permits expire in April. Trump falsely said during a September 2024 debate with Democrat Kamala Harris that Haitian immigrants in Springfield, Ohio, were eating pets, sparking fear of retaliation among Haitians in the city. Trump said a month later that if elected he would revoke TPS for Haitians and deport them. Noem will now need to decide whether to terminate the status for Haitians. 'President Trump and I are returning TPS to its original status: temporary,' she said in a statement. More than 1 million people, more than half of them children, are now displaced within Haiti where gang violence continues unabated despite the start of a United Nations-backed security mission last year, U.N. data published in January showed. Haiti has lacked elected representatives since 2023 and has not held elections since 2016. The country's capital is almost entirely controlled by armed gangs, and leaders have said security must first be established to hold a free and fair vote.	https://www.voanews.com/a/trump-administration-cuts-duration-of-deportation-protections-for-521-000-haitians/7982521.html	2025-02-20T15:01:19-08:00	
EU official meets with Trump counterparts to resolve tariff threats	WASHINGTON — Hoping to head off a potential trade conflict, a top European Union official stressed the importance of active engagement and fairness in trade during a four-hour meeting with Trump administration officials. 'The top objective as it was presented to us yesterday by our American partners is reciprocity,' Maros Sefcovic, the European commissioner for trade and economic security, told reporters at a Thursday briefing. Sefcovic met on Wednesday with Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick, White House National Economic Council Director Kevin Hassett and Jamieson Greer, President Donald Trump's nominee to be the U.S. trade representative. Trump has thrown the decades long partnership between the U.S. and Europe into turmoil by pledging to charge higher taxes on imports from Europe that he says would match the tariffs faced by American products. But Trump's plan for fair tariffs would also include the value added tax — which is akin to a sales tax — charged in Europe that could drastically push up import taxes and potentially trigger a broader trade conflict if the EU imposed retaliatory measures. A broader trade war risks both an economic slowdown and higher inflation that could create financial challenges for millions of families and potentially hurt political support for Trump, as voters in 2024's election specifically wanted him to lower price pressures. Trump also has proposed separate sectoral tariffs on autos, pharmaceutical drugs and computer chips, in addition to having already imposed 25% steel and aluminum tariffs with no avenues to provide exceptions or exemptions. Additionally, the U.S. president also has tariffs ready on Mexico and Canada over his claims that more should be done on illegal immigration and drug smuggling, though he suspended those tariffs for 30 days for ongoing talks. The import taxes that could potentially harm the U.S. auto sector and other industries could potentially begin in March. At Thursday's White House news briefing, Hassett said that he and Lutnick had talks with a Mexican delegation about resolving the issues. 'We want trade to be fair,' Hassett said. The EU official tried in his conversation with White House officials to equate the value added tax as similar to a sales tax as its paid by the final consumer, but he said that the issue had not been resolved. Sefcovic also said they discussed the industrial overcapacity of China, particularly in steel, and that the U.S. and EU should work together to tackle that problem, instead of targeting each other. He stressed that the meeting ended with a focus on looking for ways to 'generate positive momentum,' adding that the EU would like to 'see where we can, like, move first and fast, because I really would like to avoid the pain of measures and countermeasures.' The EU official said it was critical to establish a personal relationship with his U.S. counterparts. 'I’m glad that it happened and that we could have such an intense meeting,' he said. 'Now, I think we will both be thinking how to keep the momentum going on and how to hopefully avoid I would say, the pain.'	https://www.voanews.com/a/eu-official-meets-with-trump-counterparts-to-resolve-tariff-threats-/7982535.html	2025-02-20T14:51:00-08:00

European shipyards sustain Russia's Arctic gas trade	london — European shipyards are providing vital servicing contracts to vessels carrying Russian liquefied natural gas, sustaining a trade that Kyiv says is funding the Kremlin’s war on Ukraine. Meanwhile, a new analysis of the latest trade data shows that imports of Russian LNG to the EU rose last year, bucking the overall trend of declining imports from the rest of the world. A fleet of 15 specialized Arc7 tankers carry Russian LNG from its source on the Yamal Peninsula, high in the Russian arctic, to import terminals in Europe and beyond. The vessels are designed to smash through the arctic ice, allowing Moscow to ship its lucrative LNG year-round. The demanding conditions mean that the tankers require regular repairs. Satellite tracking data show 14 of the vessels are being serviced at two European ports: the Damen shipyard in Brest, France, and the Fayard A/S shipyard near Odense, Denmark. 'The European shipyards … are pretty much right along the natural export-import route that they're going along anyway. So, it's pretty convenient to stop there for a week or 10 days to do the hull maintenance, repainting, et cetera. For Russia, if those European shipyards would be off limits, the operation would definitely peter out over several years as the vessels would become more and more unusable,' said Malte Humpert, a senior fellow at The Arctic Institute and an expert on LNG shipping. Western expertise Western expertise appears crucial in keeping the tankers operational. A single Arc7 vessel, the Christophe de Margerie, is subject to Western sanctions and can no longer call at European shipyards. Attempts to repair the ship in China appear to have failed, and it is currently out of action. Even if other servicing facilities were found, the LNG trade might not be profitable, Humpert said. 'A large part of the economics is to have the shipyards very close to where you offload the gas. The operating costs are up to $100,000 per day for those vessels. So if suddenly you lose a journey from Europe to China, that's several weeks. If you lose weeks and weeks, that's millions of dollars you lose in terms of operating costs,' he told VOA via Zoom. There is no suggestion that the European shipyards – Damen in France and Fayard A/S in Denmark – have broken any EU sanctions. Damen told Britain’s Financial Times that no further servicing of the Arc7 tankers was planned 'for the coming period.' Fayard declined to comment. Imports rise The servicing is being carried out despite European pledges to stop buying Russian energy, following Moscow’s 2022 full-scale invasion of Ukraine. Kyiv says the profits fund the Kremlin’s war. Before 2022, Russia supplied about 40% of Europe’s gas. Most European countries no longer receive Russian gas via pipelines after Ukraine refused to renew a transit agreement with Moscow at the beginning of the year. It’s a different story for liquefied natural gas transported by sea. A new analysis shows LNG imports from Russia rose by 18% last year, bucking the overall trend of declining imports from the rest of the world. Market forces Ana Maria Jaller-Makarewicz, who co-wrote the European LNG Tracker report for the Institute for Energy Economics and Financial Analysis, said market forces dictate LNG trade patterns. 'The main suppliers decreased their exports to Europe: the U.S., Qatar. But we saw an increase in Russian LNG. So then we started thinking: What's going on? What is happening there?' 'Yamal [in Russia] has contracts with certain companies in Europe, so we see lots of companies involved in all this trade. The issue is that [the European Union] could say something, but these are commercial agreements. These are private companies. It's just business. ... They will try to secure LNG where it's best for them,' Jaller-Makarewicz told VOA via Zoom. For some European countries, that business is worth more than the aid they’re sending to Ukraine, Humpert said. 'Spain imported $2.5 billion of LNG from Russia last year, and they spent $500 million in military aid,' he said, adding that many of the tankers carrying Russian LNG are owned and insured by European companies. 'If the EU were to sanction them, then that definitely cuts into European companies' profits and there’s definitely losses. I mean, that’s always what you have to weigh up, right? Sanctions do cause economic harm,' he said. EU ban The EU so far has stopped short of banning Russian LNG imports. Officials told Reuters last month that the bloc wants to secure alternatives before taking any measures against Moscow. 'First you have to have a deal, because otherwise you will be left without gas from Russia and without the U.S.,' an unnamed EU diplomat told Reuters. European pledges to cut down on Russian energy imports are being undermined by the LNG trade, said analyst Jaller-Makarewicz. While some LNG importers are tied to long-term contracts, 'around 30% are done on spot rates,' she said. 'In 2022, Europe said, 'We definitely need to stop our dependency on Russian gas as a whole.' LNG from Russia was not a major factor at that moment; it was the gas coming via pipeline. So then why are we still buying on spot rates that are not really based on LNG long-term contracts?' she asked. An EU ban on the transshipment of Russian LNG to countries outside the bloc is due to come into force later this year.	https://www.voanews.com/a/european-shipyards-sustain-russia-s-arctic-gas-trade-/7982453.html	2025-02-20T13:55:17-08:00

Trump loyalist Kash Patel takes helm of FBI	WASHINGTON — The Trump administration's makeover of the United States' national security and law enforcement agencies took a major step forward Thursday, with Senate lawmakers voting 51-49 to confirm Kash Patel as the director of the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI). The vote puts Patel at the helm of the country's premier law enforcement agency, where he has promised to lead an overhaul of the bureau at a time when critics of President Donald Trump have accused the administration of leading a purge to end the bureau's tradition of independence and align the bureau with Trump's priorities. Two Republicans — Senators Susan Collins and Lisa Murkowski — voted with Democrats against Patel's confirmation. But support from the rest of the Senate Republican delegation gave Patel a slim victory, with many hailing the new FBI director as an agent of change. 'The FBI has lost trust among the American people in recent years. Much of that stems from a perception that politics has infected the FBI's important work,' said Senate Majority Leader John Thune, ahead of Thursday's vote. 'We need all law enforcement working together and focused on the real threats facing our country,' Thune said. 'I look forward to working with Mr. Patel to restore the integrity of the FBI and get it focused on its critical mission.' Other Republicans have echoed similar sentiments. 'The FBI has been infected by political bias and weaponized against the American people,' said Senate Judiciary Committee Chairman Chuck Grassley before advancing Patel's nomination to the full Senate earlier this month, noting 'Mr. Patel knows it, Mr. Patel exposed it, and Mr. Patel was targeted.' 'The American people are sick and tired of two tiers of access, two tiers of treatment, and two tiers of justice,' said Republican Senator Marsha Blackburn, also speaking earlier this month on the need for Patel to head the FBI. Patel is a former public defender and federal prosecutor who previously served as a Trump national security adviser and at the Pentagon. In a statement announcing Patel's nomination in November, Trump praised him as having 'played a pivotal role in uncovering the Russia, Russia, Russia hoax, standing as an advocate for truth, accountability and the Constitution.' Democrats, however, have repeatedly questioned Patel's qualifications and integrity, accusing him of describing some of the prosecuted, Jan. 6, 2021, Capitol rioters as 'political prisoners,' and of calling for the prosecution of Trump opponents. And citing whistleblowers, they have accused Patel of lying to lawmakers about knowledge of efforts at the FBI to force out officials and agents who were assigned to investigate the Capitol Hill riot. 'He is unprepared and unqualified. He has an enemies list. He has these foreign entanglements,' said Democratic Senator Richard Blumenthal, rallying against Patel's confirmation in front of FBI headquarters in Washington before Thursday's vote. 'To Republicans who may vote for Kash Patel, this vote will haunt you,' he said. 'You will rue the day of this vote.' Democrat Peter Welch, also speaking in front of FBI headquarters, called Patel 'a crown jewel' in what he described as a 'lawless rampage' by Trump. 'He's an instrument of Donald Trump's effort to destroy the Justice Department and the FBI so that he is absolutely and completely not only above the law, but beyond the law,' Welch said. Patel, during his confirmation hearing last month, rejected accusations he has an enemies list or that he will seek retribution against Trump's opponents or enemies. 'I have no interest nor desire and will not, if confirmed, go backwards,' Patel told lawmakers. 'There will be no politicization at the FBI. There will be no retributive actions taken by the FBI.' 'The only thing that will matter if I'm confirmed as a director of the FBI is a de-weaponized, de-politicized system of law enforcement completely devoted to rigorous obedience to the Constitution and a singular standard of justice,' he said. The FBI director is appointed by the president and confirmed by the Senate for a term not to exceed 10 years.

Israel reports several bus explosions; no injuries reported	Israeli police on Thursday reported a series of explosions on buses in central Israel in what they said appeared to be a militant attack. No injuries were reported. Police forces rushed to the scene in Bat Yam, a Tel Aviv suburb, as they searched for suspects. Police said bomb disposal units were searching for additional bombs. Police spokesman Asi Aharoni told Channel 13 TV that explosives were found on two other buses. He called on the public to be alert and report any suspicious objects to authorities. Police said the Shin Bet internal security agency was taking over the investigation. The explosions took place just hours after Hamas released the bodies of four Israeli hostages held in Gaza — the first of eight hostages that Israel believes are dead and to be returned during the current phase of the ceasefire.	https://www.voanews.com/a/israel-reports-several-bus-explosions-no-injuries-reported/7982435.html	2025-02-20T13:17:31-08:00	
Somali government says attacks on bases repulsed, 130 militants killed	Officials in Somalia say 130 militants were killed Thursday as Somali National Army troops 'repulsed' attacks on four government military bases in the center of the country. VOA Somali was not able to immediately confirm the death toll from the fighting, which took place in an area where government forces have clashed repeatedly with al-Shabab in recent days. In a statement, Somalia's Ministry of Information said that militants used explosives to attack the bases in the Middle Shabelle region. 'Al-Shabab suffered a heavy defeat and our brave heroes are actively pursuing the remaining militants. Somalia will never falter in its fight against terrorism,' the ministry said. The statement said government forces also recovered weapons from the defeated militant fighters. For the last couple of weeks, Somali government forces, supported by local clan militias, have carried out operations aimed at securing rural villages along the Shabelle River that were recently liberated from al-Shabab. General Ibrahim Mumin, the commander of the 3rd division of the Somali National Army, told VOA Somali that Thursday’s al-Shabab attacks 'failed' as government troops fought off the militants. Mumin said defensive barriers erected by the soldiers in anticipation of al-Shabab attacks prevented the explosives from penetrating the military bases. Neither the information ministry nor the commander provided casualty totals for government forces, but a local resident told VOA at least five soldiers were killed and more than 10 others injured. In separate clashes on Thursday, at least 20 Islamic State militants were killed, and dozens were injured in Somalia’s northeastern Puntland region, according to officials. Puntland police commissioner Brigadier General Mumin Abdi Shire told VOA that Islamic state militants suffered heavy casualties. 'Our brave men carried out military operations around the villages of Dhasaq and Dandamale near the Togga Jacel area of the Cal Miskaad mountains, killing at least 20 militants. All of them foreigners,' Shire said. Al-Shabab has been fighting Somali governments since 2007 to impose its strict brand of Islamic law on the country. In the northeast, Puntland began a major offensive against Islamic State in December and claims to have since killed nearly 200 Islamic State fighters, dozens of them foreign fighters, and captured villages and bases in the mountainous area controlled by IS. This month, U.S. warplanes twice targeted the Islamic State affiliate in the area, hitting what officials described as high-ranking operatives in the terror group's mountainous stronghold. Among those killed was Ahmed Maeleninine, an Omani-born leader of Islamic State, officials of the Puntland region said last week.	https://www.voanews.com/a/somali-government-says-attacks-on-bases-repulsed-130-militants-killed/7982300.html	2025-02-20T11:56:18-08:00	
McConnell, longest-serving US senator, to retire in early 2027	U.S. Senator and former Republican Majority Leader Mitch McConnell announced Thursday, on his 83rd birthday, that he will not seek reelection when his current term ends in early 2027. First elected in 1984, McConnell made the announcement from the Senate floor. 'Seven times, my fellow Kentuckians have sent me to the Senate. Every day in between, I’ve been humbled by the trust they’ve placed in me to do their business here,' he said. 'Representing our commonwealth has been the honor of a lifetime. I will not seek this honor an eighth time. My current term in the Senate will be my last.' McConnell will retire as the longest-serving senator in U.S. history and the longest-serving Senate leader from any party. He has led the Republicans since 2007 both as majority and minority leader before giving up the position to Senator John Thune last year. McConnell’s storied political career saw him guide the Senate chamber through a $1.5 trillion tax overhaul, presidential impeachment trials and fierce political fights. In recent years, McConnell had a series of health scares, including two separate incidents in which he froze while talking to reporters. He blamed those incidents on a previous concussion. In his comments Thursday, McConnell said he decided last year that he would not run for reelection. Some information for this report came from The Associated Press and Reuters.	https://www.voanews.com/a/mcconnell-longest-serving-us-senator-to-retire-in-early-2027/7982278.html	2025-02-20T11:51:04-08:00	
Azerbaijan suspends BBC	Azerbaijan’s government has ordered the suspension of the Azerbaijani operation of BBC News, the British news agency confirmed Thursday. In a statement, the BBC said it had made the 'reluctant decision' to close its office in the country after receiving a verbal instruction from the Ministry of Foreign Affairs. 'We deeply regret this restrictive move against press freedom, which will hinder our ability to report to and from Azerbaijan for our audiences inside and outside the country,' a BBC spokesperson said in a statement. The suspension comes after Azerbaijani state-run media last week reported that the Azerbaijani government wanted to reduce the number of BBC staff working in the country to one. The BBC said it has received nothing in writing about the suspension from the Azerbaijani government. While the news agency seeks clarification, its team of journalists in the country have stopped their journalistic activities, according to the BBC. Neither Azerbaijan’s Foreign Ministry nor its Washington embassy immediately responded to VOA’s emails seeking comment. The BBC has operated in Azerbaijan since 1994. The news agency says its Azerbaijani service reached an average of 1 million people every week. The BBC suspension marks the continuation of a harsh crackdown on independent media that the Azerbaijani government has engaged in for years. Azerbaijan is among the worst jailers of journalists in the world. As of last week, at least 23 journalists were jailed in the former Soviet country in retaliation for their work, according to the New York-based Committee to Protect Journalists. Many of the journalists jailed in Azerbaijan are accused of foreign currency smuggling, which media watchdogs have rejected as a sham charge. Among those jailed is Farid Mehralizada, an economist and journalist with the Azerbaijani Service of VOA’s sister outlet Radio Free Europe/Radio Liberty. Jailed since May 2024, Mehralizada faces charges of conspiring to smuggle foreign currency and 'illegal entrepreneurship, money laundering, tax evasion and document forgery.' He and his employer reject the charges, which carry a combined sentence of up to 12 years behind bars.	https://www.voanews.com/a/azerbaijan-suspends-bbc/7982159.html	2025-02-20T10:28:32-08:00	
US envoy Kellogg, Zelenskyy talk in Kyiv	U.S. envoy Keith Kellogg met in Kyiv Thursday with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy, but there was no immediate word on whether they had eased U.S.-Ukrainian relations after U.S. President Donald Trump and Zelenskyy traded barbs this week over Russia’s three-year war against Ukraine. Kellogg said upon arriving in the Ukrainian capital that he was there to listen to Zelenskyy’s views after officials in Kyiv voiced their anger at being excluded this week when the top U.S. and Russian diplomats met in Saudi Arabia to lay the groundwork for talks to end the fighting. After Kellogg met with Zelenskyy, the two men were expected to hold a news conference, but the Ukrainian side said the Americans asked that it be called off, and it was. Trump and Zelenskyy assailed each other this week. The U.S. president, echoing Russian attacks, called Zelenskyy a 'dictator without elections,' while Zelenskyy accused Trump of living in a Russian-influenced 'disinformation space' when the U.S. leader indicated that Ukraine started the war. It was Moscow that invaded its neighbor three years ago next week. Ukraine fears that Trump is moving to settle the war on terms more favorable to Moscow. Russia currently controls about a fifth of Ukraine’s internationally recognized territory. U.S. Vice President JD Vance told a gathering of conservative activists outside Washington on Thursday that Trump 'wants the killing to stop' in Ukraine and that 'peace is in the interest of the American people.' He said after the U.S.-Russian talks in Riyadh, 'We’re on the cusp of peace.' Vance did not mention Ukraine’s role in settling the conflict, although U.S. officials have said Kyiv and Moscow will both be involved in the settlement and have to make concessions to achieve peace. European leaders have responded to Trump's recent remarks about Ukraine by pledging to step up spending on defense, and some are considering a U.S.-backed European peacekeeping force for the country if the fighting ends. The Kremlin says the plan is a major cause for concern, but Zelenskyy and NATO have welcomed it. 'It is vital that ... Russia will never again try to take one more square kilometer of Ukrainian land,' NATO Secretary-General Mark Rutte said, adding that a peace pact would have to entail robust security guarantees for Ukraine. 'While there is much that still needs to be decided, there is no question that Europe has a vital role to play in securing peace in Ukraine,' he told reporters in Bratislava. In a string of comments on his Truth Social platform this week, Trump accused Zelenskyy of refusing to hold elections in Ukraine, which had been scheduled for April 2024 but were delayed after Russia invaded in 2022. Trump disparaged Zelenskyy as 'a modestly successful comedian' and said, 'The only thing he was good at was playing [former U.S. President Joe] Biden 'like a fiddle'' for more U.S. military assistance.' 'I love Ukraine,' Trump said, 'but Zelenskyy has done a terrible job, his Country is shattered, and MILLIONS have unnecessarily died — And so it continues.' Earlier, Trump had scoffed at Zelenskyy's complaint about not being invited to the Tuesday talks in Riyadh headed by U.S. Secretary of State Marco Rubio and Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov. 'Today I heard, 'Well, we weren't invited.' Well, you've been there for three years,' Trump said of Ukraine's leaders.	https://www.voanews.com/a/us-envoy-kellogg-zelenskyy-talk-in-kyiv/7982134.html	2025-02-20T10:23:34-08:00	
Creating inclusive Syrian government could help lift sanctions, UN envoy says	DAMASCUS, SYRIA — Creating an inclusive government in Syria in coming weeks will help determine whether Western sanctions are lifted as the country rebuilds after the ouster of former President Bashar al-Assad, the U.N. special envoy to Syria said Thursday. 'What I'm hoping is that with a truly new inclusive government in place on the 1st of March, this will help us in lifting sanctions' imposed on Syria by Western countries during Assad's rule, Geir Pedersen told The Associated Press in an interview during a visit to Damascus. After Assad was toppled in a lightning rebel offensive in December, Hayat Tahrir al-Sham, or HTS, the main former rebel group now in control of Syria, set up an interim administration comprising mainly members of its 'salvation government' that had ruled in northwestern Syria. The country's de facto authorities said at the time that a new government would be formed through an inclusive process by March. In January, former HTS leader Ahmad al-Sharaa was named Syria's interim president after a meeting of most of the country's former rebel factions. In recent weeks, a committee has been holding meetings in different parts of Syria in preparation for a national dialogue conference to chart the country's political future, the date of which has not yet been announced. Pedersen said that in his first meeting with al-Sharaa in December, al-Sharaa had insisted that the interim government would rule for only three months, although Pedersen warned him the timeline was tight. 'I think the important thing is not whether it is three months or not, but it is whether they will deliver on what they have said all along, that this is going to be an inclusive process where all Syrians will be included,' Pedersen said. The U.S. and European countries have not lifted sanctions that were imposed on the Syrian government under Assad's rule, which the new authorities have said is handicapping their ability to rebuild the country after nearly 14 years of civil war and restore essential services like state electricity. Officials from some Western countries have said they want to see if the interim rulers will follow through on their promises of inclusive governance and protecting minorities. Organizers of the national dialogue have said the conference will include all segments of Syrian society except for Assad loyalists and the Syrian Democratic Forces, a Kurdish-led force in the northeast that has so far refused to dissolve and be absorbed into the new national army. The SDF is currently in negotiations with the central government, and Pedersen said he hopes to see a 'political solution' to the impasse. Pedersen said he is also concerned about a security vacuum following the disbanding of the former national army and security services by the country's new rulers. 'It's very important that the new structures of the state are coming in place quickly and that there is an offer to those who are no longer in service of the army or the security services, that there are other job opportunities and that people do not feel that they are excluded from the future of Syria,' he said. The U.N. envoy said he also remains concerned about Israel's incursions into Syrian territory since the fall of Assad. The Israeli army has seized a U.N.-patrolled buffer zone in the Golan Heights established by a 1974 ceasefire agreement with Syria and has also made forays beyond the buffer zone. The U.N. has said that Israel is violating the agreement. Israeli officials have said they took the action to protect Israel's security and that their presence would be temporary. Pedersen said the security concerns are being addressed and 'there is really, in my opinion, no argument for why the Israelis should be staying.' 'The solution is very simple. The Israelis need to withdraw,' he said.	https://www.voanews.com/a/creating-inclusive-syrian-government-could-help-lift-sanctions-un-envoy-says/7982063.html	2025-02-20T09:31:16-08:00	
Former Spanish football chief guilty of sexual harassment	Spain’s High Court in Madrid on Thursday found former Spanish football federation chief Luis Rubiales guilty of sexual assault for kissing player Jenni Hermoso without her consent following the 2023 Women's World Cup final. The court fined the 47-year-old Rubiales $10,400, and he was ordered to stay at least 200 meters from Hermoso and refrain from communication with her for at least one year. Prosecutors had sought a prison sentence of 2½ years. Rubiales was cleared of charges of coercion. Prosecutors alleged he and three other male Spanish federation members and former women's team coach Jorge Vilda had pressured Hermoso into supporting Rubiales’ claim that the kiss had been consensual. They all were acquitted. The two-week trial was carried live on Spanish television and had been highly anticipated. Rubiales kissed Spanish women’s team member Hermoso on the lips during the awards ceremony in Sydney, Australia, after Spain beat England 1-0 in the Women’s World Cup final in August 2023. The incident sparked outrage within and outside Spain, marring the victory celebration, with many, including government ministers, players and coaches, demanding his resignation. International football’s governing body, FIFA, opened disciplinary proceedings against him. Rubiales, who had been football federation chief since 2018, initially dismissed the kiss as a 'peck' but gave in to pressure and resigned in September 2023 after an investigation began. A recent reform of the Spanish penal code classified a nonconsensual kiss as sexual assault. Following the verdict, Spain's equality minister, Ana Redondo, told the Reuters news service, the court’s decision proves their law is a good one. 'It is a law that protects women against aggression,' Redondo said. 'Consent, and this is the important thing, is the cornerstone of every relationship.'

In remote town in western Ukraine, all young men are gone	Makiv, a small town in western Ukraine, is grappling with the absence of men. Many have either fled, are fighting, or have died fighting the Russian invasion. It’s a common problem in many towns and villages in Ukraine. The war has worsened the country’s ongoing decline in population. Those left behind fear for Ukraine’s future as they struggle to rebuild their lives.

Trump signs order aimed at ending benefits for some immigrants	SAN DIEGO, CALIFORNIA — U.S. President Donald Trump signed an order aimed at ending federal benefits for people in the country illegally, the White House said Wednesday, his latest in a blizzard of moves to crack down on immigration. The White House said the order seeks to end 'all taxpayer-funded benefits for illegal aliens,' but it was not clear which benefits will be targeted. People in the country illegally generally do not qualify except for emergency medical care. Children are entitled to a free K-12 public education regardless of immigration status under a 1982 Supreme Court ruling. The order notes that a 1996 welfare overhaul denies most public benefits to people in the country illegally but says that law has been gradually undermined. 'Over the last 4 years, in particular, the prior administration repeatedly undercut the goals of that law, resulting in the improper expenditure of significant taxpayer resources.' Trump's words appear directed at former President Joe Biden's extensive use of parole authority to allow people in the country temporarily, including more than 900,000 through an online appointment app called CBP One used at border crossings with Mexico and more than 500,000 Cubans, Haitians, Nicaraguans and Venezuelans who flew to the United States at their own expense with a financial sponsor. Trump immediately ended both programs. Biden also granted parole to nearly 300,000 people from Ukraine and Afghanistan. People granted parole for at least a year are considered 'qualified noncitizens,' making them eligible for some income-based benefits, but only after five years. They include Medicaid and the Children's Health Insurance Program, which provides coverage to children in families that earn too much money to qualify for Medicaid, according to the U.S. Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services. Some states have shortened the five-year wait. Trump's order appears to have other targets, some already subjects of earlier edicts and Justice Department lawsuits. It directs all departments and agencies to identify federal benefit spending that is inconsistent with the 1996 welfare law. It also seeks to ensure that state and local governments are not using federal funds for policies that support 'sanctuary' policies or encourage illegal immigration. Trump signed 10 executive orders on immigration on his first day in office. They included ending automatic citizenship for people born in the United States and asylum at the southern border. The birthright citizenship order has been temporarily halted in court.	https://www.voanews.com/a/trump-signs-order-aimed-at-ending-benefits-for-some-immigrants/7981983.html	2025-02-20T08:35:36-08:00	
South Korea's Yoon makes 2 court appearances	Impeached South Korean President Yoon Suk Yeol appeared in two Seoul courtrooms Thursday, first to hear criminal insurrection charges and then to face a Constitutional Court impeachment trial, both in connection with his short-lived, Dec. 3 imposition of martial law. Yoon was taken by motorcade from the Seoul Detention Center, where he is being held, to the Central District Court for the preliminary hearing on the insurrection charges prosecutors filed last month. In that hearing, Yoon’s lawyers argued that his declaration of martial law was not intended to paralyze the state, but to 'alert the public to the national crisis caused by the legislative dictatorship of the dominant opposition party, which had crippled the administration.' The lawyers also asked for Yoon’s release from detention, although it was unclear when the court would rule on that request. Yoon next traveled to the Constitutional Court for the tenth and final scheduled hearing in the trial over validity of his impeachment for declaring martial law. In Yoon’s first appearance at that trial, the court heard testimony from Prime Minister Han Duck-soo, who was also impeached by National Assembly lawmakers for his role in the early December declaration. Yoon briefly left the courtroom during Han’s testimony, with Yoon’s lawyers explaining they felt it was inappropriate for the two to be seen together. Han told the court that while he shared Yoon’s views on the liberal opposition, he and the rest of the cabinet disagreed with the president’s declaration of martial law and even tried to dissuade him. To his knowledge, the prime minister added, none of the cabinet members supported the action. The Constitutional Court is reviewing parliament’s Dec. 14 vote to impeach Yoon and will decide whether to permanently remove him from office or reinstate him. The court is considering if Yoon violated the constitution while Yoon and his lawyers have argued that he never intended to fully impose martial law but had only meant the measures as a warning to break a political deadlock. If Yoon is removed, a new presidential election must be held within 60 days. The court is expected to deliver its ruling in early or mid-March. Some information for this report came from The Associated Press, Reuters and Agence France-Presse.	https://www.voanews.com/a/south-korea-s-yoon-makes-2-court-appearances/7981971.html	2025-02-20T08:12:23-08:00	
Ivory Coast takes control of last remaining French base	ABIDJAN, IVORY COAST — Ivory Coast officially took control of the last remaining French military base in the country Thursday as most French forces departed from countries across West Africa. Some 80 French troops will stay in the country to advise and train the Ivorian military, Tene Birahima Ouattara, the Ivorian defense and state minister, said at a news conference with the French minister of the armed forces. 'The world is changing and changing fast,' Ouattara said. 'It's clear that our defense relationship also had to evolve and be based more on future prospects in the face of the realities of threats and those of a world that has become complex in terms of security, and not on a defense relationship inspired by the past. 'France is transforming its presence. France is not disappearing,' he said. Ivory Coast's announcement follows that of other leaders across West Africa, where the French military is being asked to leave. Analysts have described the requests as part of a broader structural transformation in the region's engagement with Paris amid growing local sentiments against France, especially in coup-hit countries. French troops who have long been on the ground have in recent years been kicked out of several West African countries, including Niger, Burkina Faso, Senegal and Chad, considered France's most stable and loyal partner in Africa. France has now been asked to leave more than 70% of African countries where it had a troop presence since ending its colonial rule. The French remain only in Djibouti, with 1,500 soldiers, and Gabon, with 350 troops. After expelling French troops, military leaders of Niger, Mali and Burkina Faso have moved closer to Russia, which has mercenaries deployed across the Sahel who have been accused of abuses against civilians. However, the security situation has worsened in those countries, with increasing numbers of extremist attacks and civilian deaths from armed groups and government forces. The French government has been making efforts to revive its waning political and military influence on the continent by devising a new military strategy.	https://www.voanews.com/a/ivory-coast-takes-control-of-last-remaining-french-base/7981876.html	2025-02-20T07:10:42-08:00	
Hamas releases bodies of 4 Israeli hostages, including youngest	The bodies of four Israelis held hostage in Gaza returned to Israel on Thursday in the latest release under a ceasefire between Israel and the militant group Hamas. Hundreds of people gathered in the southern Gaza city of Khan Younis where Hamas handed over four black coffins to the Red Cross, which carried them away in a convoy and delivered them to the Israeli military. An Israeli procession passed through areas where people gathered on the side of the road holding Israeli flags, and the bodies arrived several hours later at the National Center of Forensic Medicine in Tel Aviv to confirm their identities. Those released Thursday included the youngest captives – infant Kfir Bibas, who was 9 months old when he was kidnapped, and his 4-year-old brother, Ariel Bibas – and their mother, Shiri Bibas. They were abducted from Kibbutz Nir Oz by Hamas on Oct. 7, 2023. Video of the abduction showed Shiri Bibas swaddling the boys in a blanket and being whisked away by armed men. The boys and their mother were killed in an Israeli airstrike in November 2023, according to Hamas. Their father, Yarden Bibas, was kidnapped separately and returned alive earlier this month. The body of fellow Nir Oz resident Oded Lifshitz, who was 83 when he was abducted from his home, was also released. Israeli President Isaac Herzog said on X that the hearts of the entire nation 'lie in tatters.' 'On behalf of the State of Israel, I bow my head and ask for forgiveness,' Herzog said. 'Forgiveness for not protecting you on that terrible day. Forgiveness for not bringing you home safely.' Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said Thursday would be 'a day of grief' for his nation. Before transferring the four coffins to the Red Cross, Hamas had them displayed on a stage at the handover site along with flags and banners. One of the banners accused Netanyahu of being a war criminal and said Israeli airstrikes killed the hostages. U.N. human rights chief Volker Türk said Thursday the remains need to be respected. 'Under international law, any handover of the remains of deceased must comply with the prohibition of cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment, ensuring respect for the dignity of the deceased and their families,' Türk said in a statement. On Saturday, six living hostages are set to be released in exchange for hundreds more Palestinians detained by Israeli forces in Gaza during the war. Israel and Hamas are in the process of implementing the first phase of a ceasefire that began on January 19. Talks on the second phase are scheduled to begin this week, according to Israeli Foreign Minister Gideon Saar. A Hamas official told Agence France-Presse that the remaining hostages may be released together during the next phase of the truce. 'We have informed the mediators that Hamas is ready to release all hostages in one batch during the second phase of the agreement, rather than in stages as in the current first phase,' senior Hamas official Taher al-Nunu told the news agency. Hamas is believed to be holding 66 more captives, about half of them living. The group has said it will release the remaining hostages only in exchange for a lasting halt to the fighting and a full Israeli troop withdrawal from Gaza. Meanwhile, Israel has not backed off its goal, supported by the United States, of eradicating any military or governing role for Hamas in Gaza. Hamas, a U.S.-designated terror group, killed about 1,200 people in the October 2023 attack and took about 250 as hostages. More than half of the captives have been released in ceasefire agreements and other deals, while eight were rescued in military operations. Israel's air and ground war killed more than 48,200 Palestinians, mostly women and children, according to Gaza's Health Ministry, which does not say how many were combatants. The Israeli military says the death toll includes 17,000 militants. The offensive destroyed vast areas of Gaza and displaced most of its population of 2.3 million. Some information for this story came from The Associated Press, Agence France-Presse and Reuters.	https://www.voanews.com/a/hamas-releases-bodies-of-4-israeli-hostages-including-youngest/7981768.html	2025-02-20T05:31:21-08:00	
North Korea rights groups face collapse amid US funding halt	SEOUL, SOUTH KOREA — The vast majority of human rights groups focused on North Korea face an existential crisis after receiving notices from the U.S. government that their grant funds have been frozen, according to several sources among the predominantly Seoul-based NGOs. The National Endowment for Democracy, or NED, established by Congress to strengthen democratic institutions globally, and the State Department’s Democracy, Human Rights, and Labor Bureau, which provide most of the groups’ funding, sent the notices over the last several weeks, according to documents reviewed by VOA. The freeze threatens to devastate an already fragile collection of North Korea human rights groups, potentially wiping out vital sources of advocacy and research on one of the world’s most closed and repressive states, which has a population of 25 million. Hanna Song, executive director of the Database Center for North Korean Human Rights, told VOA her organization, like many others in Seoul, is now in 'survival mode' because of the funding freeze. 'I just really don’t know how many will be able to survive,' said Song, whose organization works directly with North Koreans who have fled the North and has long been a key repository of data on Pyongyang’s abuses. Trump policy shift The funding freeze is part of U.S. President Donald Trump’s broader push to reshape the federal bureaucracy and realign taxpayer spending with his 'America First' agenda, in coordination with billionaire businessman Elon Musk. The NED has been repeatedly attacked by Musk, who has called it a 'scam' and an 'evil organization [that] needs to be dissolved.' In a message sent last week to several North Korea-focused human rights organizations, the NED said it has 'unfortunately been unable to access our previously approved funds' and 'may not be able to provide additional payments to your organization.' 'Once you run out of money, consider your NED grant agreement suspended,' the message added. Meanwhile, a January 24 notice from the State Department bureau ordered organizations receiving grants to immediately stop all work, even if already funded. The bureau has reportedly fired dozens of contractors and is also subject to a Trump executive order suspending foreign aid for 90 days. Although aid could theoretically resume, the pause has already had devastating consequences for many North Korea advocacy groups. Survival mode Song’s Seoul-based center, whose mission includes providing psychosocial support to North Korean defectors, has had to postpone counseling sessions while they look for new funding, Song said. 'It’s just absolutely destroying groups working on North Korea,' said Sokeel Park, South Korea country director at Liberty in North Korea, which helps North Korean defectors escape and resettle. 'It’s by far the biggest crisis facing NGOs working on this issue since the start of the movement in the 1990s,' he said in an interview. Although the group does not receive direct U.S. government funding, Park said other organizations have been forced to reduce salaries, furlough staff, or halt projects midstream. The freeze threatens a broad range of activities, including support for North Koreans who have fled, efforts to transmit information into and out of the country, and raising global awareness of its abuses. The crisis comes at a time when gaining insight into North Korea is more challenging than ever. Since the COVID-19 pandemic, strict border controls have made escapes rare and slowed the flow of information, leaving the outside world with extremely little insight into the reclusive country. This isolation has coincided with a decline in global attention to North Korea more generally, which has made it harder for organizations to diversify their funding sources, activists say. Seoul’s inconsistency While South Korea, a wealthy democracy bordering the North, might seem like a natural alternative source of funds, it has failed to consistently support North Korea-focused NGOs, mainly because the issue is politically sensitive in Seoul. Conservative governments, which take a harder line on the North, often condemn its human rights abuses and provide more backing for civil society groups. In contrast, left-leaning governments tend to focus on improving ties with Pyongyang, favoring humanitarian aid directly to the North Korean government in the hope that better relations will eventually lead to improved human rights. South Korea’s inconsistency on the issue is unfortunate, Lee Jung-hoon, former South Korean ambassador for North Korean human rights under conservative President Park Geun-hye told VOA. 'In fact, we should be the ones providing funding to American NGOs working on North Korea… we should be at the forefront of this,' Lee, now a dean and professor of international relations at Seoul’s Yonsei University, said. After taking office in 2022, South Korean President Yoon Suk Yeol pledged to improve North Korea’s 'horrendous' human rights situation. However, in December, Yoon unexpectedly declared martial law to combat what he called 'anti-state forces,' leading to his impeachment and possible removal from office. With Yoon’s future uncertain, the left-leaning Democratic Party is seen as the favorite to reclaim the presidency. Such political volatility has made many NGOs hesitant to accept South Korean government funding, fearing it could be easily withdrawn. As a result, many organizations have felt compelled to rely on U.S. government funding – primarily from NED and the State Department. With that money now frozen, many groups are scrambling to fill the gaps by seeking support from European governments and major private donors, Park said. North Korea-focused groups, though, are competing with countless global causes for limited funds. Song said no one wants to be in a position where they’re saying North Korea is a more important issue events in Myanmar or Syria, 'But it’s gotten to the point where it’s just survival mode.'	https://www.voanews.com/a/north-korea-rights-groups-face-collapse-amid-us-funding-halt/7981751.html	2025-02-20T05:09:06-08:00	
Students lead 'Dark Indonesia' protests against budget cuts	YOGYAKARTA, Indonesia — Thousands of students staged 'Dark Indonesia' protests in cities across the country on Thursday against budget cuts and other policies of President Prabowo Subianto, fearing they will undermine social support systems and their futures. Clad in black, about a thousand placard-carrying students in the major city of Yogyakarta marched through a busy thoroughfare, yelling out demands for change, four months after Prabowo took office following a landslide election win. There were protests in other cities, including the capital Jakarta, and Medan on Sumatra island. 'Dark Indonesia' has gained traction on social media to represent concerns about the cuts. Another popular trend, 'Just Escape First', sees people sharing advice on how to escape to work and live overseas. Herianto, a student leader in Jakarta, said students are protesting cuts in the education sector after Prabowo ordered a cost-cutting drive to free up around $19 billion that can be used to fund his policies, including a school lunch plan. 'Indonesia is dark because there are many policies that aren't clear to our society,' said Herianto, who like many Indonesians goes by one name. 'The cuts are designed to plug a hole in the free meal program expenses. Education is one of the things that could be impacted. Students are so angry.' Speaking at the protest in Jakarta on Thursday, state secretariat minister Prasetyo Hadi said the government had received the students' demands and would study them. Prabowo's office has said the funding changes would not affect the education sector and teacher welfare, but with ministries cutting back a wide range of spending there are concerns that it could disrupt government services. The students were also demonstrating against the military's move into civilian roles and a lack of subsidized cooking gas. Prabowo remains broadly popular across the sprawling country, with his approval rating near 80% in surveys conducted by independent pollsters, including one last month by research firm Indikator Politik Indonesia. Indikator executive director Burhanuddin Muhtadi told Reuters Prabowo's popularity could dip as the policies were rolled out, when the country's middle class had shrunk. 'If the government does not respond well to this issue, there can be anxiety from the middle class and could lower its popularity,' he said. The demonstrations were the biggest since last August, before Prabowo took office, when the parliament shelved plans to revise election laws after thousands of protesters took to the streets, setting fires and facing down tear gas and water cannon.	https://www.voanews.com/a/students-lead-dark-indonesia-protests-against-budget-cuts/7981720.html	2025-02-20T04:37:18-08:00	
Rwanda says DRC criticism of Arsenal, Bayern and PSG deals threatens regional peace	London — Rwanda on Thursday described recent criticism of its Arsenal, Bayern Munich and Paris St Germain football sponsorship deals by the Democratic Republic of Congo’s foreign minister as a threat to regional peace and stability. Earlier this month, DRC's foreign minister, Therese Kayikwamba Wagner, urged the three prominent European clubs to end their 'blood-stained' sponsorship agreements with 'Visit Rwanda,' questioning the morality of such partnerships while fighting raged in eastern Congo. Rwanda-backed M23 rebels have seized key parts of eastern DR Congo in recent weeks, in what is the gravest escalation in more than a decade of a long-running conflict rooted in the spillover into Congo of Rwanda's 1994 genocide and the struggle for control of Congo's vast mineral resources. 'The Government of Rwanda rejects recent attempts by the Democratic Republic of Congo to undermine Rwanda’s international partnerships through misinformation and political pressure,' Rwanda Development Board, which oversees the deals, said in a statement on Thursday. 'These efforts not only misrepresent the truth but also threaten the foundations of regional peace, stability, and economic cooperation that we have worked tirelessly to build.' Congo's foreign affairs minister did not immediately respond to a request for comment on WhatsApp. The fighting in eastern Congo has led to human rights violations including summary executions, the bombing of displacement camps, reports of gang rape and other sexual violence, according to the United Nations. Rwanda says it is defending itself, accusing Congo's military of joining forces with ethnic Hutu-led militias bent on slaughtering Tutsis in Congo and threatening Rwanda, where Hutus targeted Tutsis in a 1994 genocide and some of them later fled to Congo. 'Visit Rwanda' began their sponsorship of Arsenal in 2018, with the latest deal reported to be worth more than $12 million per year. Bayern Munich signed a five-year football development and tourism promotion partnership with Rwanda in 2023, while 'Visit Rwanda' has been a sponsor of PSG since 2019. Reuters previously contacted the three clubs about the sponsorship deals but none replied.	https://www.voanews.com/a/rwanda-says-drc-criticism-of-arsenal-bayern-and-psg-deals-threatens-regional-peace/7981705.html	2025-02-20T04:23:01-08:00	
Taliban withdraw Afghanistan from International Criminal Court	Islamabad — Afghanistan's radical Taliban leaders on Thursday rejected the jurisdiction of the International Criminal Court (ICC) over their country, declaring as ‘unlawful’ the decision in 2003 by their predecessors to join the Hague-based court’s founding treaty. The decision follows the ICC chief prosecutor’s announcement last month, seeking arrest warrants for the reclusive Taliban supreme leader, Hibatullah Akhundzada, and a close associate, accusing them both of being 'criminally responsible for persecuting Afghan girls and women.' The Taliban militarily regained power in August 2021, succeeding the internationally recognized government in Kabul, which collapsed alongside the withdrawal of U.S.-led NATO troops after nearly two decades in Afghanistan. The Taliban, now governing as the Islamic Emirate, have imposed their strict interpretation of Islamic law, known as Sharia, placing sweeping restrictions on freedom of speech and women’s access to education and public roles in society. No country has recognized the Taliban as a legitimate government primarily over their harsh treatment of Afghan women and girls. 'As an entity that upholds the religious and national values of the Afghan people within the framework of Islamic Sharia, the Islamic Emirate of Afghanistan does not recognize any obligation to the Rome Statute or the institution referred to as the ‘International Criminal Court,'' the Taliban stated in an English-language declaration. It accused the ICC of political bias and failing to take any 'substantive measures against the war crimes perpetrated in Afghanistan by occupying forces and their allies.' 'Given that many of the world's major powers are not signatories to this 'court,' it is unwarranted for a nation such as Afghanistan, which has historically endured foreign occupation and colonial subjugation, to be bound by its jurisdiction,' the Taliban asserted. In October 2001, Western forces led by the U.S. invaded Afghanistan, overthrowing the then-Taliban government for sheltering al-Qaida leaders held responsible for the terrorist attacks in the United States that occurred in September of that year. In February 2003, the Washington-backed successive government in Kabul formally deposited its instrument of accession to the Rome Statute, which founded the ICC, thereby granting the court jurisdiction over crimes committed within its territory or by Afghan nationals. 'In light of the aforementioned considerations, the Islamic Emirate of Afghanistan formally asserts that it does not recognize any legal obligation under the Rome Statute and deems the previous administration’s accession to this statute to be devoid of legal validity,' said Thursday’s Taliban statement. Karim Khan, the ICC prosecutor, stated in his January 23 announcement that his decision to seek arrest warrants for Akhundzada and Taliban chief justice, Abdul Hakim Haqqani, was based on a thorough investigation and evidence collected into their alleged crimes against humanity. The ICC is mandated to rule on the world’s worst offenses, such as war crimes and crimes against humanity. The court has no police force and relies on 125 member states to execute its arrest warrants. Akhundzada seldom leaves his office in the southern Afghan city of Kandahar and rules the country through religious decrees. He has banned girls’ education beyond the sixth grade and prohibited women from most public as well as private sector employment, among other restrictions on their rights. In a speech he delivered in Kandahar last week, the Taliban chief again dismissed criticism of his governance, asserting that it was rooted in divine commands. A government spokesperson quoted Akhundzada as stating that 'every decree he issues is based on consultation with scholars and derived from the Quran and Hadith [sayings of Islam’s prophet] and represents commands of Allah.'	https://www.voanews.com/a/taliban-withdraw-afghanistan-from-international-criminal-court/7981683.html	2025-02-20T03:58:54-08:00	
Indian police seize books by Islamic scholar in Kashmir	Srinagar, India — Indian police in disputed Kashmir have raided dozens of bookshops and seized hundreds of copies of books by an Islamic scholar, sparking angry reactions by Muslim leaders. Police said searches were based on 'credible intelligence regarding the clandestine sale and distribution of literature promoting the ideology of a banned organization.' Officers did not name the author but store owners said they had seized literature by the late Abul Ala Maududi, founder of the Islamist political party Jamaat-e-Islami. Kashmir has been divided between India and Pakistan since their independence from British rule in 1947, and both claim the Himalayan territory in full. Rebel groups, demanding Kashmir's freedom or its merger with Pakistan, have been fighting Indian forces for decades, with tens of thousands killed in the conflict. Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi's Hindu-nationalist government banned the Kashmir branch of Jamaat-e-Islami in 2019 as an 'unlawful association.' New Delhi renewed the ban last year for what it said were 'activities against the security, integrity and sovereignty' of the nation. Plainclothes officers began raids in the main city of Srinagar on Saturday, before launching book seizures in other towns across the Muslim-majority region. 'They (police) came and took away all the copies of books authored by Abul Ala Maududi, saying these books were banned,' a bookshop owner in Srinagar, who asked not to be identified, told AFP. Pakistan's Foreign Ministry said it was 'the latest step in a series of measures to crush dissent and to intimidate the local people.' 'They must be given freedom to read the books of their choice,' spokesman Shafqat Ali Khan said. Police said the searches were conducted 'to prevent the circulation of banned literature linked to Jamaat-e-Islami.' 'These books were found to be in violation of legal regulations, and strict action is being taken against those found in possession of such material,' police said in a statement. The raids sparked anger among supporters of the party. 'The seized books promote good moral values and responsible citizenship,' said Shamim Ahmed Thokar. Umar Farooq, Kashmir's chief cleric and a prominent leader advocating for the right to self-determination, condemned the police action. 'Cracking down on Islamic literature and seizing them from bookstores is ridiculous,' Farooq said in a statement, pointing out that the literature was available online. 'Policing thought by seizing books is absurd -- to say the least -- in the time of access to all information on virtual highways,' he said. Critics and many residents of Kashmir say civil liberties were drastically curtailed after Modi's government imposed direct rule in 2019 by scrapping Kashmir's constitutionally enshrined partial autonomy.	https://www.voanews.com/a/indian-police-seize-books-by-islamic-scholar-in-kashmir/7981662.html	2025-02-20T03:32:55-08:00	
EU approves $960 million in German aid for Infineon chips plant	BRUSSELS — The European Commission said Thursday it had approved 920 million-euro of German state aid, or $960 million, to Infineon Technologies for the construction of a new semiconductor manufacturing plant in Dresden. The measure will allow Infineon to complete the MEGAFAB-DD project, which will be able to produce a wide range of different types of computer chips, the Commission said. Chipmakers across the globe are pouring billions of dollars into new plants, as they take advantage of generous subsidies from the United States and the EU to keep the West ahead of China in developing cutting-edge semiconductor technology. The European Commission has earmarked 15 billion euros for public and private semiconductor projects by 2030. 'This new manufacturing plant will bring flexible production capacity to the EU and thereby strengthen Europe's security of supply, resilience and technological autonomy in semiconductor technologies, in line with the objectives set out in the European Chips Act,' the Commission said in a statement. The Commission said the plant -- which is slated to reach full capacity in 2031 -- will be a front-end facility, covering wafer processing, testing and separation, adding that its chips will be used in industrial, automotive and consumer applications. The aid will take the form of a direct grant of up to 920 million euros to Infineon to support its overall investment, amounting to 3.5 billion euros. Infineon, Germany’s largest semiconductor manufacturer, which was spun off from Siemens 25 years ago, has said the plant will be the largest single investment in its history. Infineon has agreed with the EU to ensure the project will bring wider positive effects to the EU semiconductor value chain and invest in the research and development of the next generation of chips in Europe, the Commission said. It will also contribute to crisis preparedness by committing to implement priority-rated orders in the case of a supply shortage, in line with the European Chips Act.	https://www.voanews.com/a/eu-approves-960-million-in-german-aid-for-infineon-chips-plant/7981638.html	2025-02-20T02:49:18-08:00	
China's sprawling rail projects around Asia	TOKYO — Vietnam approved plans on Wednesday for a multibillion-dollar railway with China, boosting links between the two communist countries. Around the region, China has been financing railways under its Belt and Road Initiative, which funds infrastructure projects globally but has come under fire with a number of plans stalled or mired in controversy. Here are some of the key installments in Asia's China-backed railway network: Indonesia: Southeast Asia first Indonesia launched Southeast Asia's first high-speed railway in October 2023, after years of delays. The $7 billion China-backed project links the capital Jakarta to the city of Bandung in 45 minutes -- slashing the journey by about two hours. Built by a joint venture of four Indonesian state companies and Beijing's China Railway International Co, it was initially set to cost less than $5 billion and be completed by 2019. But construction challenges and the pandemic led to delays and surging expenses. Indonesia's then-president Joko Widodo nevertheless hailed its opening as a symbol of modernization. Laos: On the move Laos unveiled its $6 billion Chinese-built railroad in 2021, bringing hopes of an economic boost despite backlash after thousands of farmers had to be evicted to make way for construction. The 414-kilometer route connects the Chinese city of Kunming to Laotian capital Vientiane, with plans for the high-speed line to ultimately reach Singapore. Infrastructure-poor Laos, a reclusive communist country of about 7.4 million people, previously had only four kilometers of railway tracks. It was hoped that the railway would boost the Southeast Asian country's ailing tourism industry, which struggled to rebound from the pandemic. But experts also raised concerns over whether cash-strapped Laos -- where public debt made up 116% of GDP in 2023 -- would ever be able to pay back Beijing. Thailand: Full steam ahead After long delays, Thailand is pressing ahead with a Chinese-backed high-speed line set to partially open in 2028. The $5.4 billion project aims to expand the connection to Kunming, running to Bangkok via Laos by 2032. Thailand already has nearly 5,000 kilometers of railway but the sluggish, run-down network has long driven people to favor road travel -- despite extremely high accident rates. When the new railroad is fully complete, Chinese-made trains will run from Bangkok to Nong Khai, on the border with Laos, at up to 250 kph. Unlike Laos, Thailand signed a deal to cover project expenditures itself and has pitched it as a way to boost the economy through trade with China. China-Kyrgyzstan-Uzbekistan: Bridge to Europe Kyrgyz President Sadyr Japarov inaugurated construction in December of a railway linking China, Kyrgyzstan and Uzbekistan, with hopes it will serve as a supply route to Europe. 'This route will ensure supply of goods from China to Kyrgyzstan and then onto Central Asia' and nearby countries 'including Turkey' and 'even to the European Union,' he said. The project, which Kyrgyz authorities estimate could cost up to $8 billion, includes construction through mountains and in areas of permafrost, where the ground never fully thaws. Vietnam: Link to manufacturing hubs Vietnam this week approved an $8 billion railroad running from its largest northern port city to China. The line will operate through some of Vietnam's key manufacturing hubs, home to Samsung, Foxconn and Pegatron factories, many of which rely on components from China. Another yet-to-be-approved line to China would connect Hanoi to Lang Son province, traveling through more areas packed with manufacturing facilities. Malaysia: Back on track Malaysia has revived construction of a nearly $17 billion railroad to carry passengers and freight between shipping ports on its east and west coasts. The China-backed, 665-kilometer project was originally launched in 2011 under ex-leader Najib Razak but shelved due to a dispute about payments. After blowing past several deadlines and budgets, it now looks set to be operational by 2027. Pakistan, Myanmar, Philippines: Stalled In Pakistan, a railway linking southwestern Gwadar Port with China's northwestern Xinjiang province has long been on the cards but has yet to materialize. If the project moves ahead, a 2023 Chinese study estimated an eyewatering price tag of $58 billion. In coup-hit Myanmar, talks on building a railway from Mandalay to China's Yunnan province appear to have stalled. And in the Philippines, plans for China to fund three railways flopped after Manila backed out of talks in 2023 as the South China Sea dispute heated up.	https://www.voanews.com/a/china-s-sprawling-rail-projects-around-asia/7981628.html	2025-02-20T02:33:29-08:00	
China says it’s 'doing its best' to push for tariff negotiations with EU	BEIJING — China has been 'doing its best' to push for negotiations with the European Union over its tariffs on Chinese-made electric vehicles, a commerce ministry spokesperson said on Thursday, almost four months after the punitive import curbs took effect. The bloc voted to increase the tariffs to as much as 45.3% in October after the European Commission -- which oversees EU trade policy -- launched an anti-subsidy probe into whether Chinese firms benefited from preferential grants and financing as well as land, batteries and raw materials at below market prices. 'China has been doing its best to push for negotiations with the EU,' He Yadong said. 'It is hoped that the EU will take notice of the call from industry and promote bilateral investment cooperation through dialogue and consultation.' China launched its own probes last year into imports of EU brandy, dairy and pork products. He told reporters China's anti-dumping probe into Europe's pork products and anti-subsidy investigation into the 27-strong bloc's dairy trade were still ongoing, when asked how the cases were progressing. 'We will conduct the investigation in an open and transparent manner in accordance with Chinese laws and regulations and World Trade Organization rules,' he added. China's commerce ministry in December decided to extend its anti-dumping investigation into EU brandy imports by three months to April 5.	https://www.voanews.com/a/china-says-it-s-doing-its-best-to-push-for-tariff-negotiations-with-eu/7981611.html	2025-02-20T01:50:34-08:00	
Crews in Ukraine’s Odesa region work to restore power after Russian attacks	Tens of thousands of people remained without power Thursday in the southern Ukrainian city of Odesa as a result of several days of Russian aerial attacks. Odesa Governor Oleh Kiper said on Telegram that crews were working to restore electricity service, and had brought 40,000 customers back online, with another 49,000 still without power. Russian attacks continued Thursday in multiple parts of Ukraine, including in the central region of Cherkasy where Governor Ihor Taburets said air defenses shot down 14 Russian drones. Taburets said on Telegram there was damage to a business and a power line, but no casualties. Mykolaiv Governor Vitaliy Kim reported the military shot down a drone over his region. Russia’s Defense Ministry said Thursday it destroyed four Ukrainian drones overnight, including three over Russia-occupied Crimea and one over Bryansk. Bryansk Governor Alexander Bogomaz said on Telegram there were no reports of damage or casualties.	https://www.voanews.com/a/crews-in-ukraine-s-odesa-region-work-to-restore-power-after-russian-attacks/7981587.html	2025-02-20T00:03:52-08:00	
North Korea criticizes US over AUKUS nuclear submarine deal	SEOUL, SOUTH KOREA — North Korean state media on Thursday criticized the United States for a nuclear submarine deal with Australia under the AUKUS partnership signed in 2021, calling it a 'threat to regional peace.' A commentary carried by KCNA said Washington should be wary of consequences for what it said were nuclear alliances, naming AUKUS and the trilateral cooperation with South Korea and Japan. Australia just made its first $500 million payment to the U.S. under the AUKUS nuclear submarine deal. Under AUKUS, Australia will pay the United States $3 billion to boost the capacity of the U.S. submarine industry, and Washington will sell several Virginia-class nuclear-powered submarines to Australia in the early 2030s. The KCNA commentary also argued the U.S. sees North Korea as an obstacle to its establishment of hegemony in the region and said nuclear states will not sit idly by, referring to itself. North Korea has been criticizing the trilateral military cooperation between South Korea, Japan and the U.S. and has called the relationship 'the Asian version of NATO.' South Korea's defense ministry on Thursday said that a joint air drill was held with the U.S. with at least one B-1B strategic bomber taking part. The drill was to show extended deterrent capabilities by the United States in response to threats from North Korea's nuclear and missile program, the ministry said in a statement.	https://www.voanews.com/a/north-korea-criticizes-us-over-aukus-nuclear-submarine-deal/7981578.html	2025-02-19T23:06:47-08:00

'This is a good initiative; it is also beneficial for Kazakhstan,' he said. 'We will try to support it as much as possible.' Tokayev's comments are the first official response from Central Asia to the talks, which sparked serious international debate.

Trump expects visit from Chinese President Xi without giving timeline	ABOARD AIR FORCE ONE/ WASHINGTON — U.S. President Donald Trump said on Wednesday he expected Chinese President Xi Jinping to visit the United States, without giving a timeline for his trip. Trump made the remarks to reporters on Air Force One and said 'it's possible' for the U.S. and China to have a new trade deal. A conversation or interaction between Xi and Trump is seen as crucial to a potential easing or delay of trade tariffs. 'We'll have, ultimately, President Xi, we will have everybody coming (to the U.S.),' Trump said, while also speaking about other leaders potentially visiting the United States. Xi last travelled to the U.S. in November 2023, in his fifth visit to the country as Chinese president, for a summit with then U.S. President Joe Biden, resulting in agreements to resume military-to-military communications and curb fentanyl production. Trump and Xi had spoken just before Trump took office on January 20 and discussed issues including TikTok, trade and Taiwan. Trump told reporters on Wednesday that he was talking to China about TikTok as the United States seeks to broker a sale of the popular app owned by Chinese parent firm ByteDance. Trump said last week he had spoken to Xi since taking office as well, but did not offer details on the topics of that conversation. China's foreign ministry did not directly comment on Trump's remarks that day and instead referred reporters to their 'scheduled' call before Trump took office. Washington and Beijing have had tense relations for years over differences ranging from trade and tariffs and cybersecurity, and TikTok, Taiwan, Hong Kong, human rights and the origins of COVID-19. Trump also again told reporters he could make a deal with Russia over the war in Ukraine. 'We can make a deal with Russia to stop the killing,' Trump said, adding he thought the Russians wanted to see the war end. 'I think they have the cards a little bit because they've taken a lot of territory, so they have the cards,' Trump said.	https://www.voanews.com/a/trump-expects-visit-from-chinese-president-xi-without-giving-timeline/7981566.html	2025-02-19T22:42:27-08:00	
Native American activist Leonard Peltier, freed from prison, welcomed on reservation	BELCOURT, NORTH DAKOTA — Native American activist Leonard Peltier was defiant toward the government but grateful for his supporters as they welcomed him home to North Dakota on Wednesday, a day after his release from a Florida prison where he had been serving a life sentence in the 1975 killings of two FBI agents. Peltier, 80, grew emotional as he addressed about 500 people who gathered at the festive event that included food, a drum circle and dancers at a center in Belcourt. The small town is just south of the Canadian border on the Turtle Mountain Band of Chippewa Indians' reservation. 'I'm so proud of the showing and support you've given me,' Peltier said. 'I've got a hard time keeping myself from crying. A strong warrior can't be up crying in front of his people.' Before leaving office, former President Joe Biden commuted Peltier's life sentence to home confinement, leading to his release Tuesday from the Coleman penitentiary. Peltier was convicted of two counts of first-degree murder and given two consecutive life sentences stemming from a 1975 confrontation on the Pine Ridge Indian Reservation in South Dakota. FBI agents Jack Coler and Ronald Williams were killed, and while Peltier acknowledged firing shots during the confrontation, he denied being the person whose shots killed the men. Native Americans widely believe he was a political prisoner who was wrongly convicted because he fought for Indigenous rights as a member of the American Indian Movement. For years, many in law enforcement argued against freeing Peltier. Current and former FBI agents disputed his claims of innocence. As Biden considered his options as his term ended, former FBI Director Christopher Wray sent the president a letter in which he called Peltier 'a remorseless killer' who should remain in prison. In a statement about the commutation, Biden said numerous individuals and groups supported releasing Peltier due to the time he spent in prison, his age and his leadership role among Native Americans. For decades, Peltier has maintained he was innocent of the murder charges, and he said Wednesday: 'I spent 49 years straight in prison for something I didn't do.' Peltier said he went into prison a young man and emerged far older at age 80. During all that time, Peltier said he tried to keep Native American issues in the forefront of his activism, and he thanked tribes across the nation for their decades of support. 'From day one, from the first hour I was arrested, Indian people came to my rescue, from all over the country,' Peltier said. Tribal leaders presented Peltier with an eagle feather staff that supporters had carried to Washington and other places as they campaigned for his release, and a traditional star quilt that Peltier draped over his shoulder. Nick Tilsen, an Oglala Lakota and founder of the NDN Collective, an Indigenous-led advocacy group, paid tribute to Peltier and his generation of American Indian Movement leaders for standing up 'against the most powerful government in the world. And they instilled that pride back into our people. They instilled that fight back into our people.' 'All around the world, Leonard Peltier's name will be remembered as a warrior, as a warrior who outlasted one of the strongest governments in the world, and came out victorious.' Turtle Mountain Band of Chippewa Tribal Chair Jamie Azure said the welcome shown by hundreds of people at the event was a testament to what he means to the tribe and other Native Americans. 'What I think you can see from the turnout here today, it means a lot to a lot of people on a lot of different levels to see Mr. Peltier come back to his homeland, to just be home,' Azure said. As tribal member Denise Lajimodiere said, 'It's a big day. A day of celebration.'	https://www.voanews.com/a/native-american-activist-leonard-peltier-freed-from-prison-welcomed-on-reservation-/7981521.html	2025-02-19T22:39:31-08:00	
Rights groups: Iran executed 975 people in 'horrifying' 2024 escalation	PARIS — Iran executed at least 975 people last year in a 'horrifying escalation' of its use of capital punishment, two human rights groups said on Thursday. Norway-based Iran Human Rights (IHR) and French group Together Against the Death Penalty (ECPM) said the figure was the highest since IHR began recording executions in Iran in 2008. The figure 'reveals a horrifying escalation in the use of the death penalty by the Islamic republic in 2024,' they said in a joint report, accusing Iran of using the death penalty as a 'central tool of political oppression.' 'These executions are part of the Islamic republic's war against its own people to maintain its grip on power,' IHR director Mahmood Amiry-Moghaddam said. 'Five people were executed on average every single day in the last three months of the year as the threat of war between Iran and Israel escalated.' Last year's figure represented a 17% increase on the 834 executions recorded in 2023, the report said. Of the 975 people executed, four people were hanged in public and 31 were women, also the highest figure for the past 17 years. Executions over protests Human rights groups, who say that Iran is the world's most prolific executioner after China, accuse the authorities of using the death penalty to sow fear among the public, particularly after nationwide protests broke out in 2022. Capital punishment remains a key pillar of the sharia-based judicial system established after the 1979 revolution ousted the Western-backed shah. Crimes punishable by death include murder, rape and drugs offenses but also more vaguely worded charges like 'corruption on earth' and 'rebellion' which activists say are used against dissidents. In recent years, executions have been carried out by hanging, mostly in prison yards but occasionally in public, though other methods remain on the statute books. Two of last year's executions were in connection with the nationwide protests that erupted in September 2022 after the death in custody of Mahsa Amini, an Iranian-Kurdish woman arrested for an alleged breach of Iran's mandatory dress code. Mohammad Ghobadlu, 23, was executed in January 2024 on charges of killing a police officer with a car during a protest in October 2022. Human rights groups have charged that his trial was deeply flawed, with judges ignoring evidence presented by the defense that he suffered from bipolar disorder. Gholamreza Rasaei, 34, was executed in secret in August on charges of killing a Revolutionary Guard during a 2022 protest. Activists said his confession had been obtained by torture. The rights groups said there was evidence Iran might have carried out more executions last year that they were unable to confirm for their report. They said there were reports of an additional 39 executions in 2024 that they had been unable to corroborate through second sources. Already this year, Iran has carried out at least 121 executions, according to IHR's count.	https://www.voanews.com/a/rights-groups-iran-executed-975-people-in-horrifying-2024-escalation/7981559.html	2025-02-19T22:31:09-08:00	
Australia, Papua New Guinea vow to strike defense treaty	SYDNEY — Australia said Thursday it will strike a defense treaty with Papua New Guinea, bolstering ties with a Pacific state that has been courted persistently by China. The historically close Pacific nations said in a joint statement they were committed to negotiating the treaty to deepen integration of their forces and make it easier to offer security support. 'This will enable our two defense forces to walk down a pathway of increasing integration and increasing interoperability,' Australian Defense Minister Richard Marles said. 'We live in a world which is increasingly strategically complex,' he told reporters at a press conference with his Papua New Guinea counterpart. 'It is really important that we are working with our closest friends, but in this case, we are working with family and that is very much how we see our relationship with Papua New Guinea.' Few details were given on the future treaty, which would build on an overarching security agreement signed between the two countries in 2023. Papua New Guinea Defense Minister Billy Joseph said the treaty was important 'with the geopolitics and all the different contests that are going on.' 'We have consciously made a decision to choose who should be our friends as far as security is concerned,' he said. Papua New Guinea has many friends but it counts Australia as 'very close,' Joseph said. Perched less than 200 kilometers from Australia's northernmost border, Papua New Guinea is the largest and most populous state in Melanesia. Australia has been signing security deals, dishing out aid funding and ramping up diplomatic visits to cement its influence in the South Pacific, while China renews its efforts to woo island nations in the region. Over the past decade, China has committed billions of dollars to Pacific nations, funding hospitals, sports stadiums, roads and other public works. It is an approach that appears to be paying dividends. Solomon Islands, Kiribati and Nauru have all severed diplomatic ties with Taiwan in recent years in favor of China.	https://www.voanews.com/a/australia-papua-new-guinea-vow-to-strike-defense-treaty/7981558.html	2025-02-19T22:25:05-08:00	
Stax Music Academy's teen students mark 25th anniversary, Black History Month with concert	MEMPHIS, TENNESSEE — The Memphis music studio where some of America’s most recognizable songs were recorded decades ago is now a museum. But next door, trumpets blare, drums boom, and singers craft the soulful sounds of Stax Records’ biggest hits. At Stax Music Academy, young musicians rehearse the unmistakable intro to 'Theme from Shaft,' the Isaac Hayes tour de force that won an Oscar in 1972 and tantalizes listeners with its pulsating bass line, crisp hi-hat and funky guitar. There's an air of professionalism among the students as their teacher hands out sheets of music and words of wisdom. 'Here we go. Read the ink that’s on the paper. From the top, one, two, ready and …,' says Sam Franklin IV, the academy's music director. When they finish, Franklin says, 'Hey y’all, that was good.' Under the guidance of Franklin and other instructors, the students are practicing for three concerts in Memphis, Tennessee, on Friday to celebrate Black History Month and the academy's 25th anniversary. Created in 2000, the academy is an after-school program for teens that teaches them to sing, dance and play instruments. Some pay nothing to attend. The academy has graduated more than 4,000 students since it started in the working-class neighborhood of Soulsville, where Stax Records produced soul and R&B classics in the 1960s and 1970s. Since 2008, every high school senior has been accepted to a college or university, many on full scholarships. The academy has performed at the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in Cleveland, the Kennedy Center in Washington, and in Europe and Australia. Students take pride and joy in continuing the legacy of the influential record company, where Otis Redding cut '(Sittin’ On) the Dock of the Bay,' Sam and Dave worked on 'Soul Man,' and The Staple Singers made 'Respect Yourself.' Other mainstays of the Stax catalog include Booker T. and the MGs, Rufus and Carla Thomas, Wilson Pickett and Johnnie Taylor. Before it went bankrupt in 1975, Stax Records helped develop the raw, emotional Memphis Sound, driven by tight horn and rhythm sections, and strong-voiced singers. Some Stax songs were energetic and raucous, others smooth and sexy. Stax Records no longer churns out chart-topping music, although it still has a program for songwriters. The building has been converted into the Stax Museum of American Soul Music. The Stax Music Academy group practicing on a rainy January evening includes both Black and white players. Before the work begins, some students joke around and dance in the hallway outside the rehearsal room, which boasts a high ceiling and a whiteboard with musical notes written on it. In a separate room, vocalists clap for each other as they take turns singing for their instructors. 'It’s so fun,' said Tatiyana Clark, a 17-year-old singer who joined the academy in 2023. 'I’ve been in places where we would have the same interest in music, but nothing is like the connection that I have here. Honestly, it’s a different level of friendship, when you have the exact same feelings towards music, the same experiences — almost.' Stax began online Black History Month presentations in 2021 during the COVID-19 pandemic. Previous programs have included specific themes, with this year's being the U.S. labor movement and how it involved and affected Black people, including work training, entrepreneurship and unionization. But this year's show is a series of in-person concerts at a downtown Memphis venue where attendees will hear Sam and Dave's 'Hold On, I'm Comin'', Arthur Conley's 'Sweet Soul Music,' and 'Cause I Love You,' by the father and daughter duet of Rufus and Carla Thomas. A companion study guide includes lessons and activities highlighting key figures and events that shaped labor policies and standards. 'It’s all about the message for me,' said Johnathan Cole, an 18-year-old singer and songwriter. 'It feels good because with the world going crazy right now, everybody just needs a little bit of love, happiness and music. That’s what Stax Music Academy has always been about: love, music, creativity.' When the labor and civil rights movements were striving for racial equality and social justice, Booker T. and the MGs churned out 'Green Onions' and other toe-tapping instrumental songs, with Black men at organ and drums — Booker T. Jones and Al Jackson Jr. — and white players on lead and bass guitar — Steve Cropper and Donald 'Duck' Dunn. 'I would describe Stax as ‘change,'' said Johnathan McKinnie, a 16-year-old piano and organ player. 'It drastically changed how music was formed … It was definitely an advocate for civil rights.' In the vocalists' rehearsal room, the group is perfecting Eddie Floyd's song about luck and love, 'Knock on Wood.' 'It’s like thunder, and lightning, the way you love me is frightening … better knock, knock, knock on wood,' three vocalists sing in harmony. 'Breathe. You’re not breathing,'' one instructor tells a student, who smiles and nods. The exchange exemplifies the spirit of cooperation and dedication that permeates the academy. Pasley Thompson, a 17-year-old singer and songwriter, calls the academy 'an escape from the every day.' 'Being able to be in a space with people that get you on a creative level, and on a personal level, because we’re around each other all the time, it’s a really great feeling to have,' she said.	https://www.voanews.com/a/stax-music-academy-s-teen-students-mark-25th-anniversary-black-history-month-with-concert-/7981556.html	2025-02-19T22:17:54-08:00	
Trump, Vance among speakers at gathering of conservatives	Conservative leaders, including U.S. President Donald Trump and politicians from Argentina, Britain, Poland and Italy, are among those set to address a three-day meeting of conservatives outside of Washington beginning Thursday. U.S. Vice President JD Vance leads off the Conservative Political Action Conference, with other sessions Thursday set to include discussions of cryptocurrency and Middle East peace, and a panel featuring relatives of hostages being held in Gaza. The CPAC conference helped Trump emerge as a figure in conservative politics and one which he addressed every year during his prior term in office. He used an address last year at the conference to pledge that a victory in the November presidential election would bring 'judgment day' for 'the liars and cheaters and fraudsters and censors and imposters who have commandeered our government.' In addition to U.S. House Speaker Mike Johnson, Thursday’s agenda also includes remarks from former British Prime Minister Liz Truss and Balazs Orban, the political director for Hungarian Prime Minister Viktor Orban. Santiago Abascal, head of the far-right Spanish political party Vox is set to address the event Thursday, as is British lawmaker Nigel Farage and former Polish Prime Minister Mateusz Morawiecki. Later conference speakers include Slovakian Prime Minister Robert Fico, Argentina’s President Javier Milei and Italian Prime Minister Giorgia Meloni. Some information for this report came from The Associated Press.	https://www.voanews.com/a/trump-vance-among-speakers-at-gathering-of-conservatives/7981546.html	2025-02-19T21:47:27-08:00	
Trump says he has not seen the Egyptian counter to his plan for Gaza	WASHINGTON — U.S. President Donald Trump said Wednesday evening he has not seen the proposal being discussed by Arab leaders as an alternative to his plan to take over Gaza once the war between Hamas and Israel ends. 'I haven’t seen it,' Trump said in response to a reporter’s question on Air Force One. 'Once I see it, I’ll let you know,' he added. Trump said early this month he wants to forcibly relocate almost 2 million Palestinians from Gaza into neighboring Jordan and Egypt. He said the United States will 'own' the territory and turn it into the 'Riviera of the Middle East,' which prompted rejection by Arab countries. It’s unclear whether Trump is serious or merely threatening to extract concessions from Arab states. During a meeting with Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman in Riyadh this week, U.S. Secretary of State Marco Rubio suggested that it could be the latter, urging regional leaders to make a counteroffer. Envoys of Egyptian, Jordan, Saudi Arabia, Qatar and the United Arab Emirates will meet Friday in Riyadh to discuss options, including an Egyptian plan to raise up to $20 billion over three years from Arab and Gulf states for Gaza’s reconstruction. Under this plan, Gazans would not be forced out and the strip would be governed by Palestinians. Saudi connection Trump spoke en route to Washington after delivering remarks at a conference in Miami, hosted by the Future Investment Initiative Institute, the nonprofit arm of Saudi Arabia's Public Investment Fund – the kingdom’s sovereign wealth fund led by the crown prince. His speech marked the first time a U.S. president addressed the annual gathering of global financiers and tech executives. It is a testament to how the Saudi crown prince, known by his initials MBS, has leveraged his connection to Trump, Laura Blumenfeld, senior fellow at the Johns Hopkins School for Advanced International Studies, said. The prince established close ties during Trump’s first term and continued business ties with the Trump organization while the president was out of office, including investing $2 billion to a firm belonging to Trump’s son-in-law and former aide, Jared Kushner. 'Trump believes in the Golden Rule, but not the Golden Rule from Sunday school,' Blumenfeld told VOA. 'It's if you're rich, you're right.' As Riyadh leads the charge to unify Arab nations to support postwar Gaza, there may be signs that Trump is softening his demand. In his remarks, Trump did not mention Gaza beyond repeating what he said was his role on the ceasefire signed January 19, during the last day then-President Joe Biden was in office. 'We've secured a ceasefire in Gaza, and we're bringing in the hostages, and we're bringing them home to their families,' Trump said, adding that some of the hostages 'are in pretty bad shape.' He lauded Yasir Al-Rumayyan, governor of the Saudi wealth fund, and Saudi Finance Minister Mohammed bin Abdullah al-Jadaan. The White House did not immediately respond to VOA’s query on whether Trump met with any of the Saudi delegation during the event. During his Wednesday remarks Trump thanked the Saudi crown prince for hosting talks between U.S. and Russian officials Wednesday to find a way to end the war in Ukraine. Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy and European allies have decried the meeting as an effort to sideline Kyiv. Egyptian proposal on Gaza Egypt's state-run Al-Ahram newspaper said under the proposal, 'secure areas' equipped with mobile houses and shelters will be established as living areas in Gaza while Egyptian and international construction firms rebuild the devastated infrastructure. The proposal also calls for forming a national Palestinian committee of technocrats and community leaders unaffiliated with Hamas to govern postwar Gaza. It is unclear whether the plan has the support of the Palestinian Authority, the internationally recognized body that currently rules parts of the West Bank and administered Gaza until it lost the 2006 election to Hamas. 'What is needed now is a political solution to Gaza to make that reconstruction both physically possible and long term sustainable,' said Tariq Kenney-Shawa, U.S. Policy Fellow at the Palestinian Policy Network Al-Shabaka. The goal is that 'we don't return to a situation where Gaza remains under occupation,' he told VOA. On Monday Hamas indicated a willingness to cede any postwar governance role. 'It is not necessary for Hamas to be part of the political and administrative arrangements in the next phase for Gaza, especially if it serves the interests of our people,' Hamas spokesperson Hazem Qasim told Al Arabiya TV. Hamas made the conciliatory statement as negotiations toward phase two of the ceasefire is set to begin in days, after weeks of delay. However, it fulfils only part of Israel’s and the United States’ key demand – the elimination of governance and military role for Hamas in postwar Gaza. So far Hamas has not shown it would disarm. Meanwhile Israel has not defined what it considers an acceptable alternative governing entity to Hamas and has rejected any involvement of the Palestinian Authority. The Egyptian proposal also does not solve a longstanding issue between the warring parties. Israeli leaders oppose any postwar plans that would pave the way to a two-state solution, while a sovereign Palestine remains a key requirement for Palestinians and Arab countries. Expedited hostage release A top Hamas official announced earlier this week that the group will return the remains of four deceased Israeli hostages and free six living ones in exchange for hundreds of Palestinian prisoners, including 47 senior Hamas members. Israel will also allow mobile homes and construction equipment into Gaza. The six living hostages are the last set to be freed under phase one of the ceasefire that called for the gradual release of 33 hostages, eight of whom are believed to be dead. Hamas took about 250 hostages and killed about 1,200 people in the October 2023 attack on Israel. Analysts said the expedited exchange of hostages and prisoners could mean that both parties are anxious to secure what they can now, due to concerns the truce will collapse before phase one expires next week. 'What we're looking at now is possibly – possibly a swifter resolution to phase two,' said Mirette Mabrouk, senior fellow at the Middle East Institute. 'But if that happens, then that sort of signals near the end of the conflict,' she told VOA. 'And that's something that [Israeli] Prime Minister Netanyahu has said he's not going to want without Hamas being disarmed.' Hamas is believed to be holding about 70 more captives, half of them living. It insists it will only release them in exchange for a permanent end to fighting and a full Israeli troop withdrawal from Gaza. Israel's counteroffensive to the Hamas attack has displaced more than 2 million Palestinians and killed more than 48,200, mostly women and children, according to Gaza's Health Ministry. The Israeli military says the death toll includes 17,000 militants.	https://www.voanews.com/a/trump-says-he-has-not-seen-the-egyptian-counter-to-his-plan-for-gaza/7981543.html	2025-02-19T21:23:41-08:00	
Vietnam parliament approves $8 billion railway with loan from China	WASHINGTON — The Vietnam National Assembly on Wednesday gave a near-unanimous approval to a railway bill that allows the country to utilize Chinese loans for the construction of a new $8.3 billion link aimed at improving transport connections between the two neighboring countries. The country's rubber-stamp parliament gave the go-ahead to the project, with 455 of the 459 members voting for the project. The approval marks a significant step forward in Vietnam’s infrastructure modernization efforts, as the country seeks to boost connectivity and economic growth, local media reported. The 427-kilometer railway project will run from the Vietnam-China border gate at Lao Cai-Hekou, through the capital of Hanoi and port city of Haiphong, to Ha Long City, the official Vietnam News Agency reported. It is one of two railway lines to China that Vietnam plans as part of its 'Two Corridors, One Belt' initiative, which connects to Beijing's Belt and Road global infrastructure program. Phase 1 of the project will build a single-track standard gauge rail with a designed speed of 160 kph. Phase 2 will upgrade it to a double-track line able to support a speed of 200 kph. The government has proposed paying for the project with money from the state budget, domestic capital sources and loans, including from the Chinese government. The Vietnam News Agency reported that the railway will be financed through a concessional loan provided by the Chinese government. Funding will also be sourced from the Export-Import Bank of China (China Eximbank), the news agency said. Neither Vietnam nor China disclosed the amount of the loan. 'Investing in a new railway line ensures meeting transportation needs, restructuring the transportation market shares, reducing logistics costs and ensuring sustainable development,' Le Quang Tung, general secretary of Vietnam’s 15th legislature, told Vietnam Television (VTV). Minister of Construction Nguyen Hong Minh, formerly the transport minister, highlighted the necessity of the project during a parliamentary session last week. He emphasized that Vietnam’s current railway system is outdated and insufficient for the nation’s needs. The government hopes the new railway will stimulate economic development by improving transportation efficiency between major cities and regions. Tran Thanh Canh, a poet and resident in Hanoi, told VOA by phone that he welcomed the Vietnamese National Assembly's approval of the railway project. 'This project should have been done a long time ago, to connect the western part of China via the shortest route to the sea at Hai Phong port. It brings many economic benefits to both Vietnam and China,' he said. 'This is a very necessary project and suitable for the economic development of both countries.' The plan to build these major railway lines is part of Beijing's ambitious Belt and Road Initiative and was agreed upon during meetings between Vietnamese General Secretary To Lam and Chinese President Xi Jinping in Beijing in late August 2024, as well as between Vietnamese Prime Minister Pham Minh Chinh and Chinese Prime Minister Li Cuong in Hanoi in mid-October 2024. 'The project comes with both advantages and disadvantages for Vietnam as the borrower, but the disadvantages are predominant,' Nguyen Minh Le, a longtime expert in China-Vietnam relations in California, told VOA by phone. Nguyen said Xi has recently narrowed down the scope of the BRI and just focused on neighboring countries like Vietnam. 'Vietnam has actively become engaged in China’s BRI projects and receiving funding. It should stay cautious about sovereignty and autonomy because of Chinese debt-trap diplomacy,' Nguyen added. The new rail line will run through some of Vietnam’s key manufacturing hubs, home to Samsung, Foxconn, Pegatron and other global giants, many of whom rely on a regular flow of components from China, Agence France-Presse reported. 'Railway infrastructure projects are hugely expensive, incur numerous land rights and environmental issues and nearly always run over budget and deadline. Even if these projects are approved, it will be many years before passengers jump on board,' Gary Bowerman, director of Check-in Asia, a travel and hospitality research company, told VOA by email. China’s Foreign Ministry spokesperson Guo Jiakun on Wednesday said that since last year, China and Vietnam have exchanged views on multiple occasions on enhancing railway connectivity between the two countries. 'The two sides agreed to accelerate the feasibility study of the Lao Cai-Hanoi-Hai Phong standard-gauge railway, speed up the plan compilation of the Dong Dang-Hanoi standard-gauge railway and the Mong Cai-Ha Long-Hai Phong standard-gauge railway, and advance the work of building a standard-gauge railway connection point between Hekou and Lao Cai,' Guo said during a news conference in Beijing. Vietnam's Ministry of Transport has indicated that more details on the bidding process and project timeline will be released in the coming months. The project is expected to take approximately six years to complete following its approval and the finalization of the loan agreement, according to the Vietnam Railway Authority.

Thousands without power, heat in Odesa	Thousands of residents in Ukraine's city of Odesa were without electricity or heating after Russia launched a massive drone attack for the second night in a row. In his address to the nation on Wednesday night, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy said repair work was underway after 80,000 people lost power and the same number lost heating. Governor Oleh Kiper, writing on the Telegram messaging app, said drone strikes damaged an administration building and triggered a fire at a restaurant and a storage facility. One person was injured. During the Tuesday attack, four people were injured, including a child. Officials said 500 apartment buildings, 13 schools, a kindergarten, and several hospitals lost heating. In Ukraine's northeastern city of Kupiansk, one person was killed Wednesday by a Russian guided bomb, Regional Governor Oleh Syniehubov said. Two others were injured in an attack on a village south of the city. Guided bombs also hit an apartment building in the Ukrainian city of Kherson, the head of the city's military administration posted on Telegram. Three people, including 13-year-old twins, were injured. One man was killed in a Ukrainian drone attack on Russia's border region of Belgorod, the regional governor Vyacheslav Gladkov said on Wednesday.

Migrants in Panama deported from US moved to Darien jungle region	PANAMA CITY — A group of migrants deported from the U.S. to Panama last week were moved on Tuesday night from a hotel in the capital to the Darien jungle region in the south of the country, a lawyer representing a migrant family told Reuters on Wednesday. Susana Sabalza, a Panamanian migration lawyer, said the family she represents was transferred to Meteti, a town in the Darien, along with other deported migrants. La Estrella de Panama, a local daily, reported on Wednesday that 170 of the 299 migrants who had been in the hotel were moved to the Darien. Panama's government did not respond to a request for comment. The 299 migrants have been staying at a hotel in Panama City under the protection of local authorities and with the financial support of the United States through the U.N.-related International Organization for Migration and the U.N. refugee agency, according to the Panamanian government. The migrants include people from Afghanistan, China, India, Iran, Nepal, Pakistan, Sri Lanka, Turkey, Uzbekistan and Vietnam, according to Panama's president, Jose Raul Mulino, who has agreed with the U.S. to receive non-Panamanian deportees. The deportation of non-Panamanian migrants to Panama is part of the Trump administration's attempt to ramp up deportations of migrants living in the U.S. illegally. One of the challenges to Trump's plan is that some migrants come from countries that refuse to accept U.S. deportation flights, due to strained diplomatic relations or other reasons. The arrangement with Panama allows the U.S. to deport these nationalities and makes it Panama's responsibility to organize their onward repatriation. The process has been criticized by human rights groups that worry migrants could be mistreated and also fear for their safety if they are ultimately returned to violent or war-torn countries of origin, such as Afghanistan. Sabalza said she had not been able to see her clients while they were held at the hotel in Panama City and said she is seeking permission to visit them at their new location. She declined to identify their nationality, but said they were a Muslim family who 'could be decapitated' if they returned home. Sabalza said the family would be requesting asylum in Panama or 'any country that will receive them other than their own.' Mulino said previously the migrants would be moved to a shelter in the Darien region, which includes the dense and lawless jungle separating Central America from South America that has in recent years become a corridor for hundreds of thousands of migrants aiming to reach the United States. Panama's security minister said on Tuesday that more than half of the migrants deported from the United States in recent days had accepted voluntary repatriations to their home countries. On Wednesday morning the hotel in Panama City where the migrants had been held appeared quiet, according to a Reuters witness. On Tuesday some migrants had been seen holding hands and looking out a window of the hotel to get the attention of reporters outside. Migrants in the hotel were not allowed to leave, according to media reports. On Wednesday, Panama's migration service said in a statement that a Chinese national, Zheng Lijuan, had escaped from the hotel. It asked that she return and accused unspecified people outside the hotel of aiding her escape.	https://www.voanews.com/a/migrants-in-panama-deported-from-us-moved-to-darien-jungle-region/7981522.html	2025-02-19T19:25:55-08:00	
Israel prepares for ‘very difficult day’; bodies of youngest hostages to be returned	Hamas is scheduled to turn over the bodies of four slain hostages Thursday, including those of the youngest captives – infant Kfir Bibas, who was 9 months old when he was kidnapped, and his 4-year-old brother, Ariel Bibas. Both were abducted from Kibbutz Nir Oz by Hamas on Oct. 7, 2023. Video footage of the abduction showed their mother, Shiri Bibas, swaddling her redheaded boys in a blanket and being whisked away by armed men. The boys and their mother were killed in an Israeli airstrike in November 2023, according to Hamas. Their father, Yarden Bibas, was kidnapped separately and returned alive earlier this month. Hamas leader Khalil al-Hayya announced the return of the Bibas family earlier this week. The body of fellow Nir Oz resident Oded Lifshitz, who was 83 when he was abducted from his home, will also be released. Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said Thursday would be a day of grieving for his nation. 'Tomorrow will be a very difficult day for the State of Israel. A wrenching day, a day of grief. We are bringing home four of our beloved hostages, deceased. We embrace the families, and the heart of the entire nation is torn. My own heart is torn. So is yours. And all of the world's heart should be torn, because this demonstrates who we are dealing with, what we are dealing with — with such monsters,' Netanyahu said. 'We are grieving, we are in pain, but we are also determined to ensure that such a thing never happens again.' Israel Defense Forces will hold a ceremony for the hostages immediately after their bodies are transferred from the Red Cross. They will be moved to coffins covered by the Israeli flag. Soldiers will salute, a rabbi will read from Psalms, and the coffins will be carried to military vehicles. The Hostages and Missing Families Forum invited the public to hold Israeli flags and stand along the military convoy’s route to the Institute of Forensic Medicine in Abu Kabir, Tel-Aviv, where the bodies will undergo an identification process. On Saturday, six living hostages are set to be released in exchange for hundreds more Palestinians detained by Israeli forces in Gaza during the war. Israel and Hamas are in the process of implementing the first phase of a ceasefire that began Jan. 19. Talks on the second phase are scheduled to begin this week, according to Israeli Foreign Minister Gideon Saar. A Hamas official told Agence France-Presse that the remaining hostages may be released together during the next phase of the truce. 'We have informed the mediators that Hamas is ready to release all hostages in one batch during the second phase of the agreement, rather than in stages as in the current first phase,' senior Hamas official Taher al-Nunu told the news agency. He did not clarify how many hostages were currently being held in Gaza. Hamas is believed to be holding about 70 more captives, half of them living. So far during the ceasefire, Hamas has released 24 hostages, and Israel has freed more than 1,000 Palestinian prisoners. Hamas has said it will only release the remaining hostages in exchange for a lasting halt to the fighting and a full Israeli troop withdrawal from Gaza. Meanwhile, Israel has not backed off its goal, supported by the United States, of eradicating any military or governing role for Hamas in Gaza. Hamas, a U.S.-designated terror group, killed about 1,200 people in the October 2023 attack and took about 250 as hostages. More than half of the captives have been released in ceasefire agreements and other deals, while eight were rescued in military operations. Israel's air and ground war killed more than 48,200 Palestinians, mostly women and children, according to Gaza's Health Ministry, which does not say how many were combatants. The Israeli military says the death toll includes 17,000 militants. The offensive destroyed vast areas of Gaza and displaced most of its population of 2.3 million. Some information for this report came from The Associated Press, Agence France-Presse and Reuters.	https://www.voanews.com/a/israel-prepares-for-very-difficult-day-bodies-of-youngest-hostages-to-be-returned/7981519.html	2025-02-19T19:24:50-08:00	
Senate Republicans to push ahead with border bill despite Trump opposition	WASHINGTON — U.S. Senate Republicans will push ahead on Thursday with a measure to kickstart President Donald Trump's agenda on immigration, energy and defense, Majority Leader John Thune said on Wednesday, after Trump called on them to drop the plan in favor of a sweeping resolution prepared by House Republicans. Trump came down firmly in favor of the House of Representatives' plan for one sweeping bill that would also include trillions of dollars in tax cuts. House Republicans fear that the Senate's 'skinny' plan could diminish their chances of extending Trump's tax cuts later in their own chamber, where the party holds a narrow and fractious 218-215 majority. 'We need both Chambers to pass the House Budget to 'kickstart' the Reconciliation process, and move all of our priorities to the concept of, 'ONE BIG BEAUTIFUL BILL',' the president wrote on social media on Wednesday morning. After a lunch meeting with Vice President JD Vance and his own Senate Republicans, Thune told reporters that he would still go ahead with the smaller bill. 'In the end, we'll be able to, whether it's one bill or two bills, to get all the things that the president's outlined -- his objectives -- across the finish line,' said Thune, adding that he expected the Senate to vote on its own blueprint on Thursday. Some Republicans said they were confused about the plan to proceed after Trump's message. 'It seems a little strange to me,' Senator Josh Hawley said. 'If the president supports it and ... I have some assurance of that, I’ll support it,' the Missouri Republican added. 'But it just seems a little bizarre to me. I can't quite figure out what we're doing.' Meanwhile, Democrats promised a long, drawn-out fight. 'Senate Democrats will expose Republicans' reconciliation budget bill exactly for what it is: a sinister front for clearing the way to cut taxes for Donald Trump's billionaire buddies,' Senate Democratic leader Chuck Schumer of New York said. The Senate measure, a $340 billion fiscal 2025 budget resolution, would boost spending by $85 billion a year for four years to fund tighter border security, Trump's deportation of immigrants in the country illegally, energy deregulation and an increase in military spending. Republicans say the plan would offset the higher spending with funding cuts in other areas. The House budget resolution includes those same priorities along with $4.5 trillion in tax cuts, while seeking to cover the cost through $2 trillion in spending cuts and accelerated economic growth based mainly on the tax and energy policy changes it would usher in. 'FULL agenda' Both chambers of Congress need to pass the same budget resolution to unlock the parliamentary tool that would enable Republicans to enact Trump's legislative agenda in a way that circumvents Democratic opposition and the Senate filibuster. Republican lawmakers in recent weeks have backed away from concerns that extending Trump's 2017 tax cuts could add to the nation's fast-growing $36 trillion in debt. The nonpartisan Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget estimated that Trump's full tax cut agenda could cost more than $5 trillion over the next decade. House Republicans welcomed Trump's intervention as they try to forge unity for a floor vote on their own budget blueprint expected next week. '@realDonaldTrump is right! House Republicans are working to deliver President Trump’s FULL agenda - not just a small part of it. Let’s get it done, @HouseGOP!' tweeted House Speaker Mike Johnson, Thune's Republican counterpart. The difference between the House and Senate strategies comes down to Trump's proposed tax cuts. House Republicans fear the two-step Senate approach could lead to a stalled standalone tax cut bill if lawmakers cannot agree on offsetting cuts in spending. Senate Republicans worry that the rush for all-encompassing legislation may not provide enough time to adequately handle the intricacies of the tax component. Senate Republicans began moving forward with their own budget resolution last week in response to what they described as a plea for border and immigration funding from Trump 'border czar' Tom Homan and White House budget director Russ Vought.	https://www.voanews.com/a/senate-republicans-to-push-ahead-with-border-bill-despite-trump-opposition/7981515.html	2025-02-19T19:05:43-08:00	
Trump's comments on Ukraine draw mixed reaction from US lawmakers	U.S. President Donald Trump's comments this week claiming Ukraine was responsible for starting the three-year conflict with Russia and calling Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy 'a dictator without elections' drew criticism from congressional Democrats and pushback from some members of the Republican Party. 'Clearly, Vladimir Putin is responsible for this war,' Republican Senator Thom Tillis told reporters. 'His decision has resulted in the murder, rape, torture and kidnapping of untold numbers of Ukrainians. He owns responsibility for this war. I don't know how more plainly it can be stated.' Republican Senator John Kennedy told reporters he believes Russia started the war. 'I also believe, through bitter experience, that Vladimir Putin is a gangster. He's a gangster with a black heart,' he added. But Senate Majority Leader John Thune declined to criticize Trump when speaking to reporters Wednesday. 'The president speaks for himself,' Thune said. 'What I want to see is a peaceful result, a peaceful outcome. And I think right now, there's a negotiation going on, and let's see where that ultimately leads.' Republican Senator Josh Hawley said Trump has blamed Russia 'as well, and threatened to sanction Russia if they didn't come to the negotiating table.' The conflict between Trump and Zelenskyy comes as U.S. envoy Keith Kellogg arrived in Kyiv on Wednesday to meet with Zelenskyy. Ukraine was not included in peace talks that began this week in Riyadh, Saudi Arabia, between the United States and Russia. Trump brushed off Ukraine's complaints at not being included in negotiations, saying Tuesday, 'You never should have started it.' Russia invaded Ukraine on Feb. 24, 2022, claiming eastern parts of the country needed to be liberated. U.S. officials say nearly half a million Ukrainian civilians have died in the war and at least 124,000 Ukrainian soldiers. After Trump's comment, seeming to blame the Ukrainian leader for starting the war, Zelenskyy responded on social media that Trump lives in a 'disinformation space' influenced by Russia. Trump responded to Zelenskyy on Truth Social on Wednesday: 'Think of it, a modestly successful comedian, Volodymyr Zelenskyy, talked the United States of America into spending $350 Billion Dollars, to go into a War that couldn't be won, that never had to start, but a War that he, without the U.S. and 'TRUMP,' will never be able to settle. A Dictator without Elections, Zelenskyy better move fast or he is not going to have a Country left.' Hawley told reporters Wednesday that he supported Trump's calls for an election in Ukraine. 'The suspension of elections in Ukraine is a bad deal,' Hawley said. 'Zelenskyy should hold elections. He's the elected leader of the country. Our president is right — they haven't had elections in a long time, and they are basically under martial law. That's not good when you claim to be defending democracy. You need to practice it.' But Democrats said Trump's comments endanger America's standing on the global stage. 'This is outrageous. It's outrageous if not humorous that the president does these sorts of things, goes off on wild tangents and says things that are clearly false,' Senate Minority Whip Dick Durbin told reporters. Democratic Senator Elissa Slotkin said Wednesday, 'It is what we all feared, which is he understands incorrectly what's happening in the span of history and is blaming the head of a country that has been invaded by an autocratic regime; a democracy was invaded. 'And however you want to solve it, however you want to negotiate, is one thing,' Slotkin said. 'But he put down his cards.'

First Egyptian pharaoh's tomb discovered since King Tut’s	Archaeologists in Egypt say they have unearthed the ancient tomb of King Thutmose II, the first discovery in 100 years of a tomb of an Egyptian royal. The discovery near Luxor is the first of a pharaonic royal tomb since the treasures of Tutankhamun’s tomb were found over a century ago in 1922, Egypt's Ministry of Tourism and Antiquities said Tuesday. Thutmose’s tomb was found west of the Valley of the Kings, one of the world’s most important archaeological sites and home to the burial sites of many ancient Egyptian royals and nobles, including Tutankhamun, also known as King Tut. Thutmose, an ancestor of Tutankhamun, lived nearly 3,500 years ago. His wife, Queen Hatshepsut, was one of the few women known to have ruled Egypt. Her mortuary temple is on the west bank of the Nile at Luxor, not far from where her husband’s tomb was found. Thutmose was a king of ancient Egypt’s 18th dynasty. His tomb was the last undiscovered tomb of that group. An archaeology team found the entrance to Thutmose’s tomb in October 2022, according to the online magazine Archaeology News, but they thought it was likely the burial site of a queen. As they dug deeper, they found inscriptions referring to Thutmose II as the 'deceased king' and Hatshepsut. The tomb flooded soon after the king’s burial, damaging most of its contents, but some funerary furniture was recovered. Egypt’s antiquities ministry said Tuesday the discovery of the tomb is 'one of the most significant archaeological breakthroughs in recent years.' Professor Mohamed Abdel-Badel, who heads Egypt’s Antiquities Sector, told Archaeology News that the team 'recovered and restored fallen plaster fragments' that had blue inscriptions on them, including from the Book of the Amduat, which the website described as 'a key funerary text used in royal burials.' Thutmose’s tomb can now be listed among the wonders of ancient Egypt that draw hordes of tourists to the country. Last year, Egypt hosted 15.7 million tourists and aims to attract 18 million visitors in 2025, according to Agence France-Presse. Egypt may reach that goal with the long-awaited opening this year of the Grand Egyptian Museum at the foot of the legendary pyramids in Giza. Some information for this report came from Reuters and Agence France-Presse.	https://www.voanews.com/a/first-egyptian-pharaoh-s-tomb-discovered-since-king-tut-s/7981486.html	2025-02-19T18:08:52-08:00	
US figures do not support Trump claims on Ukraine spending	President Donald Trump on Wednesday repeated a claim that the United States has spent $350 billion on Ukraine’s war — a figure that far eclipses the amount recorded by the Department of Defense and the interagency oversight group that tracks U.S. appropriations to Ukraine. Since Russia’s illegal invasion in February 2022, the U.S. Congress has appropriated about $183 billion for Ukraine, according to the interagency oversight group that is charged with presenting reports to Congress. Of that, the Pentagon confirmed to VOA that the U.S. has sent $65.9 billion in military aid to Ukraine, and an additional $3.9 billion that Congress has authorized in military aid to Kyiv remains unspent. About $58 billion of the $183 billion in total aid for Ukraine was spent in the U.S., going directly toward boosting the U.S. defense industry, either by replacing old U.S. weapons given to Kyiv with new American-made weapons, by procuring new U.S.-made weapons for Kyiv or by making direct industrial investments. VOA asked the White House to clarify Trump’s comments, specifically seeking any documentation for the mathematical discrepancy. The White House replied by referring VOA back to the president’s comments. In a post Wednesday on his social media site Truth Social, Trump said, 'Think of it, a modestly successful comedian, Volodymyr Zelenskyy, talked the United States of America into spending $350 Billion Dollars, to go into a War that couldn’t be won, that never had to start, but a War that he, without the U.S. and 'TRUMP,' will never be able to settle.' Zelenskyy on Wednesday told Ukrainian reporters the total cost of the war since February 2022 was about $320 billion. 'One hundred and twenty billion of that comes from us, the people of Ukraine, the taxpayers, and $200 billion from the United States and the European Union,' Zelensky said. 'This is the cost of weapons. This is the weapons package — $320 billion.' Trump, who has mentioned the $350 billion figure several times, also said in his Wednesday social media post: 'The United States has spent $200 Billion Dollars more than Europe, and Europe’s money is guaranteed, while the United States will get nothing back.' The Kiel Institute for the World Economy, a Germany-based nonprofit that tracks military, financial and humanitarian support to Ukraine, says European nations —specifically the EU, United Kingdom, Iceland, Norway and Switzerland — have allocated about $140 billion in total in aid for Ukraine, while the United States has allocated about $120 billion in total aid. Total aid includes military, humanitarian and financial aid to Ukraine. The U.S. has provided about $2 billion more than Europe in military aid for Ukraine, but 'European donors have been the main source of [total] aid to Ukraine since 2022, especially when it comes to financial and humanitarian aid,' the institute said in its latest report last week. The aid to Ukraine constitutes a very small amount of GDP for several nations. For example, the U.S., Germany and the U.K. have mobilized less than 0.2% of their GDP per year to support Kyiv, while contributions from France, Italy and Spain to Ukraine have amounted to about 0.1% of their annual GDP. U.S. government math is complex, and spending is massive in scale. A live tracker of U.S. government spending says that the U.S. government has spent about $2.4 trillion in the early part of the 2025 fiscal year. The previous year’s spending was $6.75 trillion. Still, scholars were quick to dismiss the accuracy of Trump’s numbers. 'This figure is not true,' said Liana Fix, fellow for Europe at the Council on Foreign Relations. 'It's possible to track how much the United States has spent for Ukraine.'	https://www.voanews.com/a/us-figures-do-not-support-trump-claims-on-ukraine-spending/7981441.html	2025-02-19T16:49:09-08:00

Pentagon chief eyes funding cuts to some parts of military by 8%	WASHINGTON — U.S. Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth has asked some parts of the military to propose what could be cut as part of a potential 8% spending reduction for them over each of the next five years, U.S. officials said on Wednesday, although it was unclear if the total defense budget would shrink. In a memo described to Reuters by U.S. officials, Hegseth called for the proposals by Feb. 24. Officials said it did not appear that Hegseth wanted a major budget cut but was looking to reprioritize funding to better align with President Donald Trump's national security priorities. There was a long list of exemptions, including U.S. Indo-Pacific Command, funding for the military's mission along the U.S. border with Mexico, as well as missile defense and autonomous weapons, one of the officials said. The military's commands that oversee operations in Europe, the Middle East and Africa were not exempt. The Pentagon's budget is approaching $1 trillion per year. In December, former President Joe Biden signed a bill authorizing $895 billion in defense spending for the fiscal year ending Sept. 30. Hegseth has said publicly that the Pentagon's focus is on U.S. border security and threats posed by China. He has said the U.S. can no longer be 'primarily focused on the security of Europe.' Pentagon employees have braced for firings after businessman Elon Musk's government downsizing teams started working out of the Pentagon. Some civilian employees in the military said they had started receiving emails on Thursday saying they could be separated from the government since they were hired less than a year ago. Leaders from across the political spectrum have long criticized waste and inefficiency at the Defense Department. But Democrats and civil service unions have said Musk, the world's richest person, lacks the expertise to restructure the Pentagon, and the efforts of his team risk exposing classified programs. Attempting to cancel defense programs could trigger pushback from lawmakers to defend spending in their electoral districts, a fact defense contractors are well aware of. The F-35, for example, has suppliers located in all 50 U.S. states, a point Lockheed makes with a map on its website detailing the economic value derived from production of the fighter jets. Musk, himself a major U.S. defense contractor, has a particular disdain for certain defense projects, especially the F-35. He has posted on X that 'Some U.S. weapons systems are good, albeit overpriced, but please, in the name of all that is holy, let us stop the worst military value for money in history that is the F-35 program!'	https://www.voanews.com/a/pentagon-chief-eyes-funding-cuts-to-some-parts-of-military-by-8-/7981185.html	2025-02-19T15:53:46-08:00

VOA Persian: Activists protest death penalty outside Iran's Evin prison	A group of civil rights activists and supporters of the 'No to Execution Tuesdays' campaign gathered outside Evin Prison in Tehran, Iran, on Tuesday night, chanting slogans against capital punishment. Videos shared on social media on Wednesday show prominent activists, including Narges Mohammadi, Sedigheh Vasmaghi, Alieh Motallebzadeh, Kambiz Norouzzadeh, Hasti Amiri, Shaghayegh Moradi, Ali Nanvayi, Majid Mosafer and Elham Salehi, participating in the protest. Marking the 56th week of the 'No to Execution Tuesdays' campaign, female protesters were seen without the mandatory hijab. They chanted slogans such as 'Until the abolition of the death penalty, we will stand to the end.' In a powerful symbolic act, Mohammadi set fire to a hangman’s noose, emphasizing the call for an end to executions.

After decades in exile, Syria's Jews visit Damascus	DAMASCUS, Syria — For the first time in three decades, Rabbi Joseph Hamra and his son Henry read from a Torah scroll in a synagogue in the heart of Syria's capital Damascus, carefully passing their thumbs over the handwritten text as if still in awe they were back home. The father and son fled Syria in the 1990s, after then-Syrian president Hafez al-Assad lifted a travel ban on the country's historic Jewish community, which had faced decades of restrictions including on owning property or holding jobs. Virtually all of the few thousand Jews in Syria promptly left, leaving less than 10 in the Syrian capital. Joseph Hamra and Henry, who was just a child at the time, settled in New York. 'Weren't we in a prison? So we wanted to see what was on the outside,' said Joseph Hamra, now 77, on his reasons for leaving at the time. 'Everyone else who left with us is dead.' But when Assad's son and successor as president, Bashar al-Assad, was toppled in December, the Hamra family began planning a once-unimaginable visit to Damascus with the help of the Syrian Emergency Task Force, a U.S.-based advocacy group. They met with Syria's deputy foreign minister at the ministry, now managed by caretaker authorities installed by the Islamist rebels who ousted Assad after more than 50 years of family rule that saw itself as a bastion of secular Arab nationalism. The new authorities have said all of Syria's communities will play a role in their country's future. But incidents of religious intolerance and reports of conservative Islamists proselytizing in public have kept more secular-minded Syrians and members of minority communities on edge. Henry Hamra, now aged 48, said Syria's foreign ministry had now pledged to protect Jewish heritage. 'We need the government's help, we need the government's security and it's going to happen,' he said. Walking through the narrow passages of the Old City, a UNESCO-listed World Heritage Site, Henry and Joseph ran into their onetime neighbors — Palestinian Syrians — and later marveled at hand-painted Hebrew lettering at several synagogues. 'I want to see my kids come back and see this beautiful synagogue. It's a work of art,' said Henry Hamra. But some things were missing, he said, including a golden-lettered Torah from one of the synagogues that was now stored in a library in Israel, to where thousands of Syrian Jews fled throughout the 20th century. While the synagogues and Jewish school in the Old City remained relatively well-preserved, Syria's largest synagogue in Jobar, an eastern suburb of Damascus, was reduced to rubble during the nearly 14-year civil war that erupted after Assad's violent suppression of protests against him. Jobar was home to a large Jewish community for hundreds of years until the 1800s and the synagogue, built in honor of the biblical prophet Elijah, was looted before it was destroyed.	https://www.voanews.com/a/after-decades-in-exile-syria-jews-visit-damascus/7981169.html	2025-02-19T15:21:43-08:00	
VOA Russian: Experts say US-Russia talks start of long process	VOA Russian talked to experts after the U.S.-Russia talks in Saudi Arabia on how to end the Ukraine war. They warned that this is only the beginning of negotiations that may last for some time and take several turns. Exiled independent Russian political analyst Dmitry Oreshkin compared the first meeting to 'not even a warm-up of two boxers, but just a weigh-in ahead of the future bout.' Ukrainian expert Volodymyr Fesenko noted that it should come as no surprise that Washington deems negotiations with Moscow more important at this stage than negotiations with Kyiv, as Russia is a nuclear power and will need to be persuaded to consider any compromises.

VOA Mandarin: What do Canadians think about the threat of US tariffs?	While the U.S. is holding off on imposing 25% tariffs on Canada, a new poll shows Canadians are angered by U.S. President Donald Trump's threat of tariffs against Canada and his comments about making their nation the 51st U.S. state. Observers believe that once the U.S. tariffs are implemented, it will hit the Canadian economy hard and may also allow China to reap the benefits. However, some Chinese American entrepreneurs in Canada say the U.S.-Canada tariff war has limited impact on their business.

US Army Corps seeks to fast-track 600 'emergency' projects through environmental review	WASHINGTON — The U.S. Army Corps of Engineers has identified over 600 energy and other infrastructure projects that could be fast-tracked under President Donald Trump's National Energy Emergency declaration, according to data posted on its website. Among the projects on the list were Enbridge's Line 5 oil pipeline under Lake Michigan, several natural gas power plants, and liquefied natural gas export terminals proposed by Cheniere and Venture Global. The Army Corps posted the list, without sending a public notice, last week, marking the projects as eligible for emergency permitting treatment. Trump had ordered the Army Corps to issue permits enabling the filling of wetlands and dredging or building in waterways as part of the 'National Energy Emergency' he declared in a day-one executive order. The Army Corps was not immediately available for comment. The fast-tracking of these projects could trigger legal fights over many of the permits that will be issued, with environmental groups warning they are flouting federal laws. 'This end-run around the normal environmental review process is not only harmful for our waters but is illegal under the Corps’ own emergency permitting regulations,' said David Bookbinder, director of Law and Policy at The Environmental Integrity Project. Courts may be unwilling to weigh in on the president's criteria for what constitutes a national energy emergency but will more likely weigh how individual projects adhere to the language of the executive order, he said. Companies with projects awaiting key permits applauded the move to 'streamline' the review process. 'Line 5 is critical energy infrastructure,' said Enbridge spokesperson Gina Sutherland, saying the company has been awaiting a permit for building a Great Lakes Tunnel under Lake Michigan for nearly five years. 'We are very encouraged to see this action to expedite review for responsible critical mineral development projects,' said Jon Cherry, CEO of Perpetua Resources, which is developing a U.S. antimony and gold mine in Idaho with financial support from the Pentagon and U.S. Export-Import Bank. The Biden administration had issued the mine a permit, but it still needs a wetlands permit, which Cherry said he expects to receive by July. The Army Corps has in the past issued emergency designations to skip over environmental reviews in cases in which the project addressed poses a threat to human life. Environmental and watchdog groups say that most of the projects marked as emergencies on the list do not meet the Army Corps' definition of an emergency. They also question the Trump administration's justification for declaring a national energy emergency. 'It is laughable to see Line 5 on this list,' said Debbie Chizewer, managing attorney for the Midwestern office of Earthjustice, which represents the Bay Mills Indian Community in opposition of the project. 'It's a pipeline that carries crude oil from Canada to Canada and will not increase U.S. capacity or respond to Trump's declared energy emergency.' Other projects do not relate to energy production, including a home-building project built on land owned by oil giant Chevron in California, as well as an aerial electrical distribution line to private waterfront residences in Alabama. There are at least five dozen solar energy projects on the list. Solar and wind energy were excluded from the definition of energy in Trump's energy emergency order. West Virginia has the largest number of projects on the list at 141. There are 60 in Pennsylvania, 57 in Texas, 42 in Florida, and 41 in Ohio, according to the Environmental Integrity Project, which is tracking the permits. Officials at Venture Global and Cheniere were not immediately available to comment.	https://www.voanews.com/a/us-army-corps-seeks-to-fast-track-600-emergency-projects-through-environmental-review/7981113.html	2025-02-19T14:13:48-08:00

US judge delays ruling on federal request to drop case against New York City mayor	NEW YORK — New York City Mayor Eric Adams told a federal judge Wednesday that he is innocent and doesn't fear corruption charges could be refiled if a Justice Department request to dismiss them is granted. Judge Dale E. Ho ended the hearing by saying he wouldn't rule immediately but he was aware that 'it's not in anyone's interest here for this to drag on.' During the hearing, Ho asked the mayor questions to ensure he understood that if the charges were dropped, they could later be reinstated. 'I have not committed a crime,' Adams said. 'I'm not afraid of that.' Deputy U.S. Attorney General Emil Bove said the request to drop the corruption charges against the mayor resulted from 'a straightforward exercise in prosecutorial discretion guided' by President Donald Trump's executive order on weaponization of the justice system and Attorney General Pam Bondi's memorandum outlining the same. Bove said he believed the request to drop charges, when tied to Trump's order and Bondi's conclusions, made it 'virtually unreviewable in this courtroom.' Bove said he also believed 'the continuation of this prosecution is interfering with both national security and immigration enforcement initiatives being carried out by the executive branch.' Ho scheduled the hearing after three Trump administration lawyers, including Bove, made the dismissal request on Friday. Manhattan's top federal prosecutor resigned after she refused an order to do so. An indictment charges the first-term Democrat with accepting more than $100,000 in illegal campaign contributions and lavish travel perks from a Turkish official and business leaders seeking to buy Adams' influence while he was Brooklyn borough president. Adams has pleaded not guilty. He faces multiple challengers in the Democratic primary in June. Closely watching the judicial proceedings is Democratic Governor Kathy Hochul, who is considering whether to remove Adams from office amid concerns that he reached a deal to have the case dropped in exchange for the mayor's political fealty to Trump. Early last week, Bove told prosecutors in New York to drop the charges because the prosecution 'has unduly restricted Mayor Adams' ability to devote full attention and resources to the illegal immigration and violent crime.' Bove said charges could be reinstated after November's mayoral election. Two days later, then-interim U.S. Attorney Danielle Sassoon told Bondi in a letter that dismissing the charges in return for Adams' assistance in enforcing federal immigration laws would betray Bondi's own words that she 'will not tolerate abuses of the criminal justice process, coercive behavior, or other forms of misconduct.' 'Dismissal of the indictment for no other reason than to influence Adams's mayoral decision-making would be all three,' said Sassoon, a Republican. She said it amounted to a 'quid pro quo' deal and disclosed that prosecutors were about to bring additional obstruction of justice charges against Adams. Bove, in accepting Sassoon's resignation, accused her of 'pursuing a politically motivated prosecution despite an express instruction to dismiss the case.' He informed her that two other prosecutors assigned to the case were being suspended with pay and that an investigation would determine if they would keep their jobs. One prosecutor, Hagan Scotten, quit the following day. In all, seven prosecutors, including five high-ranking prosecutors at the Justice Department, had resigned by Friday.	https://www.voanews.com/a/us-judge-delays-ruling-on-federal-request-to-drop-case-against-new-york-city-mayor/7981080.html	2025-02-19T13:34:51-08:00	
WTO holds 'constructive' talks after China condemns Trump tariffs	GENEVA — The World Trade Organization said on Wednesday that discussions on trade tensions were 'constructive,' after China accused the United States of imposing 'tariff shocks' that could upend the global trading system. China condemned tariffs launched or threatened by U.S. President Donald Trump at a WTO meeting on Tuesday. Washington dismissed China's comments as hypocritical. Trump has announced sweeping 10% tariffs on all Chinese imports, prompting Beijing to respond with retaliatory tariffs and to file a WTO dispute against Washington in what could be an early test of Trump's stance towards the institution. The majority of the six countries that participated in the talks on trade turbulence, put on the agenda by China, raised concern about mounting tensions, but also called for restraint, said WTO spokesperson Ismaila Dieng in a press conference in Geneva on Wednesday. The United States, Nicaragua, Namibia, Malaysia, Trinidad and Tobago, and Russia took part in the discussions, which were part of broader talks on trade. The large majority 'stressed the importance of upholding WTO principles and values and called for action to preserve the stability and effectiveness of the global trading system,' Dieng added. Two trade sources at the meeting told Reuters that some countries expressed deep concern about the ramifications of tariffs, while others criticized China for alleged market distortions. It is the first time that mounting trade frictions were formally addressed on the agenda of the watchdog's top decision-making body, the General Council. 'Tariff shocks' 'These 'tariff shocks' heighten economic uncertainty, disrupt global trade, and risk domestic inflation, market distortion, or even global recession,' China's ambassador to the WTO, Li Chenggang, said at a closed-door meeting of the global trade body on Tuesday, according to a statement sent to Reuters. 'Worse, the U.S. unilateralism threatens to upend the rules-based multilateral trading system.' U.S. envoy David Bisbee called China's economy a 'predatory non-market economic system' in response and accused it of violating and evading WTO rules. Negotiating tactic Some delegates said they saw China's intervention as an attempt to show itself supporting WTO rules — a posture that can help China win allies in ongoing global trade negotiations. Disputes between the two top economies at the WTO long pre-date Trump's arrival. Beijing has accused Washington of breaking rules while Washington says Beijing does not deserve its 'developing country' status at the WTO. The Trump administration has announced plans to withdraw or disengage from other global organizations, but the WTO has not yet been a major focus for the White House. However, incoming U.S. Trade Representative Jamieson Greer has called the WTO 'deeply flawed.'	https://www.voanews.com/a/wto-holds-constructive-talks-after-china-condemns-trump-tariffs/7981049.html	2025-02-19T13:21:42-08:00	
Europe frozen out of peace talks as Russia's war on Ukraine enters fourth year	LONDON — Russia’s tanks rolled across the Ukrainian border three years ago this month, triggering the worst conflict on European soil since World War II. Ukraine has resisted the full-scale invasion largely thanks to the support of the United States and Europe. But on the frozen front lines, the war grinds on — and Russia’s forces are slowly edging forward. 'Every day, it pushes back the Ukrainian front line somewhere by a kilometer or so. My judgment is that it could continue to do that over the rest of this year,' said Ben Barry, senior fellow for land warfare at the International Institute for Strategic Studies in London. 'We must remember this is a terrible war. My judgment is that over a million people have been killed or seriously wounded. Now the balance of casualties is probably in Ukraine's favor. A figure of 700,000 or 800,000 Russian casualties seems credible to me. President [Volodymyr] Zelenskyy says Ukraine has only suffered 48,000 killed. That seems implausibly low to me,' Barry told Agence France-Presse. Europe excluded As the war enters its fourth year, Europe and Ukraine fear they are being excluded from deciding their own fate. Behind the scenes, the geopolitical forces that are shaping the conflict appear to be changing fast. Russia and the United States began peace talks this week in Saudi Arabia. Ukraine and Europe were not invited. 'There will be some very significant alarm in European capitals about what might be discussed with regards to the security of their continent, their whole region,' said David Blagden, associate professor of international security at the University of Exeter. 'One sort of potentially really bad outcome for European capitals is to discover that the Americans have basically put them on the hook for attempting to do some sort of peacekeeping mission in Ukraine or whatever without their say-so,' he told Reuters. Peacekeepers Britain and France have already said they may be willing to contribute to a peacekeeping force in Ukraine, a requirement of an estimated 100,000 troops. There are deep concerns over the potential risks of sending peacekeeping troops, according to Armida van Rij, head of the Europe program at London’s Chatham House. 'The U.S. seemed to have taken away NATO's Article 5 protection [on collective self-defense] for any troops that would be put in Ukraine. That means that they would not be protected, so that deterrent effect is gone. We know that Russia tends to break agreements. It has a long history of doing that under [President Vladimir] Putin and previous presidents. So, it is quite likely that Russia may well break the terms of any ceasefire or peace agreement that may come ... and then the question is, ‘OK, so what do the Europeans then do in response?' That might put them in direct confrontation with Russia, which is a terrifying thought,' van Rij told VOA. Defense spending The European Union says it has provided around $145 billion in military, financial, humanitarian and refugee aid to Ukraine over the past three years, more than half the total global assistance for Kyiv. U.S. Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth said this month that European security will no longer be a priority, and Washington is demanding NATO allies increase their defense spending. 'Where that money's going to come from is a key question,' said van Rij. 'The European Commission seems open to allowing some flexibility to their fiscal rules, which will make it a little bit easier for countries to spend on defense. But all of that still takes time, so it's still going to be really difficult.' Hard decisions will have profound implications for Europe, according to British Defense Secretary John Healey. 'The decisions that we make right now over the coming weeks will not only define the outcome of the conflict in Ukraine, but the security of our world for a generation to come,' Healey said in a speech Tuesday in London.	https://www.voanews.com/a/europe-frozen-out-of-peace-talks-as-russia-s-war-on-ukraine-enters-fourth-year/7981053.html	2025-02-19T13:04:48-08:00

Does AI detect breast cancer better than doctors can?	WASHINGTON — A German study shows that the cancer detection rate improves by almost 18% when doctors get help from artificial intelligence. For the study, radiologists — doctors who analyze the results of mammograms and other diagnostic tests — used artificial intelligence to examine the mammograms of more than 460,000 German women between the ages of 50 and 69. They found one more cancer for every 1,000 women than humans alone did, according to researchers. It was the largest real-world exploration to date into the use of AI to help detect breast cancer. 'The breast cancer detection rate is better, and this is really strong evidence,' said Dr. Alexander Katalinic, of the University of Lubeck in Germany, who was the study’s principal investigator. 'And based on this evidence, we should start to use more AI in breast cancer screening, and in the end, this should be standard.' The mammograms of 463,094 German women were examined between July 2021 and February 2023. About half were reviewed by two radiologists, which is standard procedure in Germany. In just over half of the cases, the humans were assisted by AI. When AI was involved, the breast cancer detection rate was 6.7 per 1,000 women, compared to 5.7 per 1,000 women screened solely by humans. 'AI really is suitable for replacing human readers to a certain extent,' Katalinic said. 'But how far do you want to go? This is not only a question of science, it's also a social question. How is the society’s trust in AI?' The study found that AI also helped reduce the number of false positive results. Artificial intelligence, however, did miss some cancers. 'The AI is not perfect in the same way that the humans are not perfect,' said Stefan Bunk, cofounder of Vara, a health care technology company in Berlin that developed the artificial intelligence used in the study. 'There were 20 cases in our study where the AI said this case is normal but actually a radiologist found cancer.' Humans, however, missed a malignancy 10 times more than the AI, according to the study results. 'AI, unlike humans, doesn't get tired, right?' Bunk said. 'AI works in the same way at 2 a.m. in the morning like in the middle of the day. So, it's definitely an advantage, and it's also one of the reasons why I think AI finds cancers that otherwise humans would miss.' AI could help reduce the workload for radiologists, freeing them to focus on more complex cases, according to Bunk, who added that increasing reliance on AI could lead to the risk of losing human expertise over time. 'Those complex cases — those cases where you need to take into account multiple angles, where you need to talk to the patient, right — is something where expertise and an actual radiologist is very important and should continue to be trained,' Bunk said. Dr. Wei Yang, a professor in breast radiology at the University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center in Houston, Texas, believes increased use of AI could energize radiologists. 'I think that the advent of AI is an opportunity and a trigger for us to become more excited about our field so that highly trained radiologists will have the open space, the time and the concentration to focus on more complex tasks,' Yang said. Using a human radiologist along with artificial intelligence offers the best of both worlds, according to Katalinic. 'The combination of a human together with AI is much better than only having the human reading,' he said. Yang, who was not involved in the study, is encouraged by the results. 'The data is very compelling,' she said. 'The increased cancer detection rate, the reduction in the false positive callbacks and the potential impact this can have on the workforce and burnout. So overall, very, very positive.'	https://www.voanews.com/a/does-ai-detect-breast-cancer-better-than-doctors-can/7980983.html	2025-02-19T12:10:50-08:00	
US agriculture secretary calls for federal action on foreign farm ownership	The new head of the U.S. Department of Agriculture said seeking a federal solution to ban China from purchasing farmland in the United States will be one of her top priorities. 'One of the very, very top of the list perhaps is the Chinese purchase of our farmland. A lot of that land is around some of our military outposts,' Secretary of Agriculture Brooke Rollins told Breitbart News in an exclusive interview, the details of which were released on Tuesday. In recent years, Chinese entities or individuals purchasing land near sensitive locations such as military installations have drawn growing scrutiny from lawmakers and security officials. According to data from the Committee of 100, a nonprofit that advocates for Chinese Americans, as of mid-December of last year, 215 bills restricting property ownership by foreign entities have been introduced across 40 states, of which 164 prohibit or otherwise restrict Chinese citizens from purchasing or owning some form of property. Thirty-six of the bills have passed, and 16 of them limit Chinese citizens from purchasing or owning some form of property, the Committee of 100 said on its website. In her interview with Breitbart News, Rollins said that the Trump administration is looking to take these state-level legislative concerns to the federal level. 'For the last several years my organization America First Policy Institute, we actually worked among multiple states to get states to act on this to pass state legislation [on banning Chinese purchase of farmland], but we also are looking at a federal solution too,' she told Breitbart on Friday. She said there is 'no doubt' that the people are concerned about Chinese foreign investment of farmland, and Americans want U.S. farmland to be owned by fellow Americans as opposed to foreigners such as those loyal to the Chinese Communist Party. She also praised President Donald Trump for promoting an 'America First' ideology that has posed China as a potential security threat to the U.S. A 2023 report containing data from the U.S. Department of Agriculture’s Farm Service Agency shows that Canada currently owns the largest amount of foreign-held agricultural and nonagricultural land, with 33%. In comparison, China holds slightly less than 1% of foreign-held farmland. Other notable countries owning U.S. agricultural land include the Netherlands (11%), Italy (6%), the United Kingdom (6%), and Germany (5%). Collectively, these countries account for 28% of foreign-held agricultural land in the U.S., totaling approximately 5 million hectares, according to the Farm Service Agency report. In the report, the USDA noted that despite China’s relatively low percentage holding of foreign-owned farmland, 'there is considerable interest in their holdings.' Indiana is one example of a state that took action over Chinese ownership of agriculture land. In March 2024, Indiana State Representative Kendell Culp’s legislation to 'protect Hoosier farmland and military bases from foreign adversaries' was signed into law. 'Our foreign adversaries like China and Russia should not be able to buy up Hoosier land, which could compromise our ability to protect our food and national security,' Culp said in a press release about the legislation. 'We can't afford to let even a fraction more of our valuable farmland to be gobbled up,' he said. The Committee of 100 said the development of legislation restricting foreign-owned land ownership would 'legitimize harmful and xenophobic claims about immigrants that would exacerbate rising anti-Asian violence that has negatively affected U.S. citizens and non-citizens alike.' 'Should they take effect, these laws would also disproportionately affect a wide range of people of color living in the United States; most of the countries targeted in this legislation are majority nonwhite,' the organization said on its website.	https://www.voanews.com/a/us-agriculture-secretary-calls-for-federal-action-on-foreign-farm-ownership/7980929.html	2025-02-19T12:07:13-08:00	
Trump administration orders halt to NYC toll meant to fight traffic, fund mass transit	new york — President Donald Trump's administration on Wednesday ordered a halt to New York City's congestion pricing system, which thins traffic and funds mass transit by imposing high tolls on drivers entering some parts of Manhattan. Launched Jan. 5, the city's system uses license plate readers to impose a $9 toll on most vehicles entering Manhattan neighborhoods south of Central Park. In its early days, transit officials say the toll has brought modest but measurable traffic reductions. In a statement, U.S. Transportation Secretary Sean P. Duffy announced the federal government has rescinded its approval of the program, calling it 'slap in the face to working class Americans and small business owners.' Duffy said his agency will work with the state on an 'orderly termination of the tolls.' Trump, whose namesake Trump Tower penthouse and other properties are within the congestion zone, had vowed to kill the plan as soon as he took office. He previously characterized it as a massive, regressive tax, saying 'it will be virtually impossible for New York City to come back as long as the congestion tax is in effect.' Similar tolling programs intended to force people onto public transit by making driving cost-prohibitive have long existed in other global cities, including London, Stockholm, Milan and Singapore, but the system had never before been tried in the U.S. The Trump administration order kicked off a wave of criticism from congestion pricing supporters in New York City. 'By blocking this successful policy, Trump will be directly responsible for more traffic, more crashes, more polluted air, slower buses and less funding for our transit system,' said state Senator Andrew Gounardes, a city Democrat. New York planned to use the toll revenue to issue bonds that would fund billions of dollars in improvements and repairs for the city's creaky and cash-strapped transit system, which carries 4 million riders daily. The tolling system has been divisive. Transit advocates and environmentalists have heralded it as an innovative step to reduce air pollution from vehicle exhaust, make streets safer for pedestrians and bikers, while speeding up traffic for vehicles that truly need to be on the road, like delivery trucks and police cars. But the high tolls are hated by many New Yorkers who own cars, particularly those who live in the suburbs or parts of the city not well-served by the subway system. New Jersey Governor Phil Murphy, a Democrat, had fought the tolls in court and wrote a letter Trump on Inauguration Day imploring him to kill the program. New York Governor Kathy Hochul, a Democrat, also had misgivings. Last June, she abruptly halted the tolling system's planned launch, citing concerns about its impact on the local economy. The Democrat then revived the toll in November following Trump's election, but reduced the toll for passenger vehicles from $15 to $9. Since then, she has lauded it as a win for the city and has discussed the issue multiple times with the president. A spokesperson for Hochul did not immediately respond to an emailed request for comment. New York lawmakers approved the tolling plan in 2019, but it was stalled for years awaiting a required federal environmental review during Trump's first term before President Joe Biden's administration approved it. As in other cities, the New York congestion fee varies depending on the time and the size of the vehicle. Trucks and other large automobiles pay a higher rate, and the fee goes drops to $2.25 for most cars during the quieter overnight hours. The toll survived several lawsuits trying to halt it before its launch, including from the state of New Jersey, unionized teachers in New York City, a trucking industry group and local elected leaders in the Hudson River Valley, Long Island and northern New Jersey.	https://www.voanews.com/a/trump-administration-orders-halt-to-nyc-toll-meant-to-fight-traffic-fund-mass-transit-/7980931.html	2025-02-19T11:43:33-08:00	
Solar refrigerators in Kenya reduce food waste	NAIROBI, KENYA — Milk and egg vendor Caroline Mukundi has lost a lot of her stock in her years of selling fresh food at a Nairobi market. Mukundi said she had no way to keep food fresh, and the cost of refrigerating was out of reach. 'The food would go bad,' she said, and she would have to throw it away. 'It was a big challenge for me.' Mukundi said her situation turned around when she acquired a solar-powered refrigerator. The refrigerators, named Koolboks and manufactured in Kenya, are fitted with ice compartments that can chill food even without a source of power. The devices can keep food cool for up to four days without electricity, even with limited sunlight. Customers can buy the refrigerators on a customized payment model, said Natalie Casey, chief business officer at the Koolboks startup company. 'They can be between 1,500 and 3,000 US dollars, because it includes not only the appliances but also the solar panels and battery storage to enable the continuous cooling,' she said. 'We’ve decided what might be more accessible to them is to first pay a down payment between 20 and 35% of the total, and the customer can pay in installments of up to 24 months.' Koolboks has sold about 7,000 solar-powered refrigerators. Conventional refrigerators for businesses can cost anywhere from $11,000 to $100,000 or more, said Dorothy Otieno, program manager at the Center for Environmental Justice and Development. 'Some businesses, especially small businesses, are not able to afford it,' she said. 'We are looking at, for example, how businesses can be supported to get access to [the Koolboks refrigerators], especially for communities that are not able to afford,' she said. The refrigerator was among dozens of innovations showcased at the recent Africa Tech Summit in Nairobi. The conference’s founder, Andrew Fassnidge, told VOA that such creations are crucial to solving local problems on the continent. 'What’s interesting with ... Koolboks refrigeration is, if we look at the Covid vaccine, one of the biggest issues at the time was refrigeration, and it’s still an issue in most markets,' he said. Koolboks markets a refrigerator specifically for vaccines. The refrigerators could have an impact on climate change, too. A 2024 survey by the U.N. Environmental Program showed Kenya has a high level of food waste, with annual waste ranging from 40 to 100 kilograms per person. Environmentalists say high levels of organic waste worsen climate change, so preventing food waste can have an impact.	https://www.voanews.com/a/solar-refrigerators-in-kenya-reduce-food-waste/7980847.html	2025-02-19T11:39:09-08:00

Trump administration labels 8 Latin American cartels as 'foreign terrorist organizations'	WASHINGTON — The Trump administration is formally designating eight Latin American crime organizations as 'foreign terrorist organizations,' upping its pressure on cartels operating in the U.S. and on anyone aiding them. The move, carrying out a Jan. 20 executive order by President Donald Trump, names Tren de Aragua in Venezuela, MS-13 in El Salvador and others. The notification is due for formal publication Thursday in the Federal Register. The Republican president has made securing the U.S.-Mexico border among his top priorities, vowing to carry out mass deportations, sending active duty troops to the border and reaching deals with some countries to take in more migrants. The 'foreign terrorist organization' label is unusual because it deploys a terrorist designation normally reserved for groups like al-Qaida or the Islamic State group that use violence for political ends — not for money-focused crime rings such as the Latin American cartels. The Trump administration argues that the international connections and operations of the groups — including drug trafficking, migrant smuggling and violent pushes to extend their territory — warrant the designation. Critics of the move call it an unnecessarily broad and harsh one that could damage relations and paralyze trade with Latin America. Businesses, banks and buyers could fear possible U.S. prosecution if they knowingly or unknowingly have any transactions that touch the world of the cartels. Such cartels permeate Mexico's economy, dealing not only in drug trafficking and migrant smuggling but fighting for control of the multibillion-dollar avocado business. Aid groups say some past U.S. designations of groups as foreign terrorist organizations have threatened overall food imports into countries, for example, by making shipping companies fearful that U.S. prosecutors may accuse them of directly or indirectly supporting the targeted groups. Mexico President Claudia Sheinbaum responded to Trump's order last month that set up the new formal designation by saying Mexico would defend its sovereignty and independence while seeking coordination. 'We all want to fight the drug cartels,' Sheinbaum said. The U.S. 'in their territory, us in our territory.'	https://www.voanews.com/a/trump-administration-labels-8-latin-american-cartels-as-foreign-terrorist-organizations-/7980775.html	2025-02-19T10:16:21-08:00	
Italian Premier Meloni visits Pope Francis in hospital, says he's ‘alert and responsive’	Italian Premier Giorgia Meloni visited Pope Francis in the hospital Wednesday and reported he was 'alert and responsive' and full of good humor, despite his diagnosis of pneumonia and a complicated bronchial infection that has sidelined the 88-year-old pontiff for six days. Meloni said she wanted to bring get-well wishes to the pope on behalf of the government and the entire nation. 'We joked around as always. He has not lost his proverbial sense of humor,' she said in a statement issued by her office. Meloni's visit marked the first confirmed outside visitor known to have called on the pope, beyond his secretaries and medical team, since his admission Friday at Rome's Gemelli hospital, where popes have their own suite on the 10th floor. The Vatican has said Francis, who had part of one lung removed as a young man, was up, eating and had gotten out of bed after a tranquil night, a day after tests confirmed he had pneumonia in both lungs on top of asthmatic bronchitis. The visit by Meloni appeared aimed at sending a reassuring message, especially to Italians who haven't seen even a photograph of Francis since Friday. The Italian premier, who came to power in 2022 with a message touting her Christian credentials, has referred in glowing terms to Pope Benedict XVI, who was a reference point for European conservatives like herself. She also has teamed up constructively with Francis on a campaign to reverse Italy's low birth rate, though they don't necessarily see eye-to-eye on her government's crackdown on migrants. Her visit came as prayers were pouring in for Francis' recovery. On Wednesday, Francis' vicar for Rome urged all the faithful to devote an hour of silent prayer for the pope before evening vespers services, some visitors to Gemelli lit a candle in his honor and pilgrims who had planned to attend his weekly general audience came to St. Peter's Square anyway to offer a prayer after it was cancelled. 'I think many people are disappointed but I think more importantly we really have to pray for his health,' said Sister Charlene, a nun from Singapore who was in the piazza. Francis also received another get-well wish from U.S. Vice President JD Vance, whom Francis has recently targeted in criticizing the Trump administration's plans for mass deportations of migrants. 'Let's all say a prayer for Pope Francis, who appears to have some serious health issues,' Vance, a Catholic, posted on X from his private account. Francis was admitted to the Gemelli hospital Friday after a weeklong bout of bronchitis worsened. On Monday, medical personnel determined that he was suffering from a polymicrobial respiratory tract infection, meaning a mix of viruses, bacteria and possibly other organisms had colonized in his respiratory tract. Late Tuesday, the Vatican said a chest CT scan showed the onset of bilateral pneumonia on top of asthmatic bronchitis, which is being treated with cortisone and antibiotics. 'I think the key will be how well and quickly he responds to treatment,' said Dr. Andrew Chadwick, a respiratory and intensive care specialist at Oxford University Hospitals. Bronchitis can lead to pneumonia, which is a deeper and far more serious infection of the lungs' air sacs. Pneumonia can develop in part or all of one lung or in both lungs. It tends to be more serious when both lungs are affected because there isn't healthy tissue to compensate. Treatment varies by severity but can include providing oxygen through a nasal tube or mask, intravenous fluids — and treatment of the underlying cause of the infection. To date, Francis is breathing on his own and his heart function is said to be good. He has eaten breakfast every day, gotten out of bed, read the newspapers and done some work from his hospital room. 'Pope Francis is a strong man who does not let difficulties get him down,' said the Rev. Enzo Fortunato, who heads a new Vatican committee on children. The fact that Francis is keeping up with his ordinary routine, including receiving the Eucharist, 'is a sign of a man who wants to experience the ordinariness of illness in the hospital.' The Vatican hasn't provided any information about how Francis is responding to any of the drugs he has been given other than to say he isn't running a fever. The Argentine pope, who has previously admitted to being a non-compliant patient, has a number of conditions that make him particularly at risk for complications: Aside from his age, he is not physically active and uses a wheelchair, limiting his ability to clear the fluids building up in his lungs. Dr. Meredith McCormack, director of pulmonary and critical care medicine at Johns Hopkins University, said doctors will be looking to see if Francis responds to the therapy, which can include physiotherapy to help clear the lungs. Severe cases of pneumonia are typically treated for about one to two weeks, but recovery in an older person could extend beyond that. 'Lack of worsening would be an encouraging sign,' said McCormack, who is not involved in Francis' care. The Vatican has given no indication of how long the pope might remain hospitalized, only saying that the treatment of such a 'complex clinical picture' would require an 'adequate' stay. Despite the less than positive news about Francis' condition, Francis was receiving get-well drawings and cards from children being treated in the hospital's oncology ward. And at the Vatican on Wednesday, Holy Year pilgrimages continued, with groups of faithful walking through the Holy Door of St. Peter's Basilica on a chilly and cloudy day. 'We are very happy to be here but we are also sad for the pope's sickness,' said Amparo Alcala, who was leading a large group of pilgrims from Valencia, Spain. 'He is doing great things, most of all for the women in the church, and this gives us a lot of joy. We are praying for his recovery and that he might come back, if this is God's will.' A group of South Korean pilgrims in traditional costumes had planned to attend Francis' weekly Wednesday general audience and show off their national dress, as pilgrims often do for the pope's weekly appointment. When it was cancelled, they came anyway. 'The Lunar New Year was very recent so we also wanted to bow traditionally and formally in front of him,' said Junhee Christina Kim, a pilgrim from Seoul, South Korea. 'It was too good of a chance to pass up so we came anyway so that we can be in the Vatican in our traditional costumes.	https://www.voanews.com/a/italian-premier-meloni-visits-pope-francis-in-hospital-says-he-s-alert-and-responsive-/7980724.html	2025-02-19T09:47:47-08:00

Mexico says US drone flights part of years-old collaboration	MEXICO CITY — Mexico’s president said Wednesday that U.S. drone flights were part of a collaboration that has existed for years between the two countries, after U.S. media reported increased cross-border aerial surveillance of drug cartels. 'There is nothing illegal, and it is part of a collaboration and coordination,' Claudia Sheinbaum said at her morning news conference. 'It is a coordination and collaboration protocol that has existed for years between the United States and Mexican governments,' she said. According to The New York Times, Washington has stepped up secret drone flights over Mexico in search of fentanyl labs as part of U.S. President Donald Trump’s campaign against drug cartels. The CIA has not been authorized to use the drones to take lethal action, and any information collected is passed to Mexican officials, the Times said, adding that the covert program began under Trump’s predecessor, Joe Biden, but had not been previously disclosed. Last week, Mexico’s government said U.S. military aircraft may have spied on drug cartels during recent flights near Mexican territory. Mexico was aware of two such U.S. military flights in late January and early February that were in international airspace, Defense Minister Ricardo Trevilla said.	https://www.voanews.com/a/mexico-says-us-drone-flights-part-of-years-old-collaboration/7980616.html	2025-02-19T08:28:58-08:00	
Austria arrests teen over foiled plot to attack Vienna station	VIENNA — Austria arrested a 14-year-old on Feb. 10 on suspicion of planning a militant attack on a Vienna train station, the Interior Ministry said Wednesday, calling the suspect an Islamic State supporter who became radicalized online. The announcement follows a knife attack in the southern town of Villach on Saturday in which a 23-year-old Syrian refugee is suspected of killing a teenager and wounding five people. That man was rapidly radicalized after watching Islamist videos on TikTok, Austrian authorities have said. 'Domestic intelligence and the police have prevented a terrorist attack in Vienna,' the ministry said in a statement. 'The suspect is 14 years old, an Austrian citizen with Turkish roots, and he became radicalized on the internet.' The ministry said he had been planning an attack on the Westbahnhof station, a striking mid-20th century building that is the departure point for lines that include a private train company's service to cities such as Salzburg and Innsbruck. A search of the suspect’s home found numerous Islamist books as well as two knives, handwritten instructions for producing explosives to be used as a detonator for a bomb, as well as material including aluminum pipes that were intended to be used for bomb-making, the ministry said. 'The Directorate for State Security and Intelligence received information that an initially unknown supporter of a terrorist organization was spreading stories and videos with Islamist ideas on several TikTok profiles,' the ministry said, describing how the investigation started. 'After an intensive investigation the DSN was able to establish the identity of the IS supporter,' it said, without naming him.	https://www.voanews.com/a/austria-arrests-teen-over-foiled-plot-to-attack-vienna-station/7980578.html	2025-02-19T08:27:42-08:00	
Philippines to hold large military drills as China tensions simmer	TAIPEI, TAIWAN — Philippine defense officials say they will hold a large, 10-day military training exercise next month, aiming to strengthen the country’s ability to respond to any crisis caused by an 'external threat.' Although Manila did not name China explicitly when it announced the drills — the biggest in recent years — they come as Beijing has increased the frequency of its maritime patrols and coast guard maneuvers around several disputed reefs that lie within the Philippines’ Exclusive Economic Zone, or EEZ. Several of those patrols have resulted in clashes and the use of aggressive maneuvers and accusations of vessel ramming. China, which claims almost all of the South China Sea as its own despite an international ruling to the contrary, insists that its actions have been in accordance with the law. The Combined Arms Training Exercise, or Catex, will take place March 3-12, involving approximately 6,000 soldiers and live-fire drills involving some of the Philippines’ most advanced artillery weapons. Expanded drills In the announcement on Monday, defense officials said that unlike past exercises, this year’s Catex will be conducted across the archipelago, including the northern island of Luzon, the island of Visayas in Central Philippines, and the southern island of Mindanao. The expanded drills will 'strengthen our command-and-control capabilities, further enhancing our preparedness to respond to any challenge that may threaten our national security,' Philippine Army Chief Lieutenant General Roy Galido told media during a news conference on Monday. Typhon missile system While the Philippine military is expected to test the Autonomous Truck-Mounted Howitzer Systems, its largest artillery weapon, during the live-fire drills, Galido said the U.S.-made Typhon missile system, which has prompted concerns from China, won’t be part of the large-scale exercise. The Philippine military is still 'appreciating the system and being able to understand how to utilize it in our defense concept,' he told Hong Kong’s South China Morning Post in an interview on Monday. The deployment of the Typhon missile system to the northern Philippines has prompted concerns from China. During a press conference Friday, Chinese Defense Ministry spokesperson Zhang Xiaogang urged Manila to 'remove the [Typhon] system as soon as possible.' Analysts say the Philippines should focus on building up anti-ship missile capabilities and procuring more unmanned aerial vehicles rather than buying expensive items like submarines, which the Philippines is reportedly considering purchasing from India. 'The anti-ship missiles can survive in a modern war with China, and it can really force the Chinese military planners to rethink their strategies,' Zachary Abuza, an expert on Southeast Asian affairs at the National War College in Washington, told VOA by phone. Other experts say the military drills and the ongoing efforts to acquire missile or air defense systems are part of the Philippines’ attempt to strengthen its sea capabilities and deterrence against China. 'Given the Philippines’ limited materiel capabilities, these efforts are part of a long-term endeavor that will need continuity to ensure the Philippines will be able to muster the capabilities to pursue the objective of countering China’s maritime aggression,' Don McLain Gill, a lecturer in international studies at De La Salle University in the Philippines, told VOA in a recorded voice message. ‘Aggressive’ China action The announcement of the drills comes amid another uptick in tensions between China and the Philippines after a Chinese navy helicopter allegedly flew within 10 feet of a Philippine patrol plane near the disputed Scarborough Shoal in the South China Sea on Tuesday. The Philippine coast guard characterized the Chinese aircraft’s actions as 'aggressive and escalatory' and said they remained 'committed to asserting our sovereignty, sovereign rights and maritime jurisdiction' in the South China Sea. Meanwhile, Southern Theater Command of the People’s Liberation Army — China's military — accused the Philippine aircraft of 'illegally' intruding on the airspace above Scarborough Shoal, which China views as its territory, and said its troops 'are resolute in defending national sovereignty and security as well as peace and stability in the South China Sea.' Weakest link? Experts say the latest incident reflects Beijing’s attempt to test the Philippines’ defense capabilities and the United States’ commitment to supporting Manila, which has a mutual defense treaty with Washington. 'China sees the Philippines as the weakest link in the U.S. security architecture in the Indo-Pacific region, so they are testing how effective Manila can push back against its assertive behaviors,' Stephen Nagy, a professor of politics and international studies at International Christian University in Japan, told VOA by phone. He said while it’s important for the Philippines to strengthen defense cooperation with like-minded democracies, including conducting joint patrols and military exercises, Manila should also carefully calibrate its responses to Chinese aggression. The Philippines’ response should 'reciprocate the pressure that the Chinese are putting on them because the Chinese strategic mindset is based on the idea of active defense, which means when they pressure their opponents to escalate the conflict, that gives them the right to escalate their behaviors,' Nagy said. New legal challenge possible In addition to strengthening defense capabilities, the Reuters news agency reported last month that the Philippines may soon initiate a second legal challenge against China over the South China Sea by suing Beijing for allegedly damaging the marine environment. Despite the report, Philippine Foreign Secretary Enrique Manalo said in response to a question from VOA during a public event held by the London-based think tank Chatham House on Tuesday that Manila has no plan to launch a legal challenge against China right now. Joshua Espena, a lecturer of international relations at the Polytechnic University of the Philippines, told VOA that since the Philippines is gearing up for the parliamentary election in May, Manila is unlikely to initiate a new legal challenge against China at this point. 'The 2016 South China Sea Arbitration ruling gives the Philippines sufficient ground to do what the government needs to do,' he said. As the U.S. focuses on facilitating a peace deal to end Russia’s war in Ukraine, Nagy said, China will likely maintain its pressure campaign against the Philippines in the coming months.	https://www.voanews.com/a/philippines-to-hold-large-military-drills-as-china-tensions-simmer/7980497.html	2025-02-19T07:03:56-08:00

Taliban confirm Pakistan’s new plan for swift mass eviction of Afghan refugees	Islamabad — Diplomats from Afghanistan’s ruling Taliban reported Wednesday that neighboring Pakistan is implementing a plan for the 'imminent' and swift mass deportation of nearly three million Afghan refugees from its territory. The Taliban-operated embassy in Islamabad issued the statement, ending days of uncertainty about an ongoing police crackdown to arrest and remove Afghan citizens, including legal refugees, from the Pakistani capital and the adjoining city of Rawalpindi. The Afghan diplomatic mission stated that Pakistan did not formally notify Kabul about its latest refugee deportation plans. It added that several attempts were made through diplomatic channels to seek clarification from the host government regarding the reasons behind the detentions and removals of Afghan nationals from the two cities. 'Ultimately, officials from Pakistan’s Ministry of Foreign Affairs confirmed that there is a definitive and final plan to deport/remove all Afghan refugees not only from Islamabad and Rawalpindi but also from the entire country in the near future,' the Wednesday statement noted. The Taliban reaction comes nearly three weeks after Pakistani Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif approved a multistage plan targeting the Afghan refugee population in the country. They include more than 1.4 million legally declared refugees with UNHCR-granted proof of registration cards, or PoRs, who have been granted permission by Pakistan to remain in the country until June 30, 2025. The rest of the population in question comprises nearly 900,000 documented economic migrants holding the Afghan Citizenship Card (ACC), an estimated 40,000 awaiting promised relocation to the United States or other Western countries, and individuals living in Pakistan without legal status or having exceeded their visa duration. The Taliban embassy stated Wednesday that Pakistani officials informed it that only Afghan nationals with valid legal visas would be permitted to reside in Islamabad and Rawalpindi. 'They further stated that the government has decided to immediately remove all Afghan refugees, including those holding ACC and PoR cards, from Islamabad and Rawalpindi and that their expulsion from the entire country is imminent,' the statement added. The UNHCR has meanwhile also confirmed that the Pakistani government plans to relocate all Afghan refugees out of Islamabad and Rawalpindi by February 28, except for holders of valid visas. The Afghan embassy noted that it expressed 'serious concerns' to Islamabad and international organizations regarding 'the mass expulsion of Afghan refugees within such a short timeframe and the unilateral nature of Pakistan’s decision.' The spokesperson for the Pakistani Foreign Ministry rejected the Taliban embassy's claims of mistreatment of Afghan nationals during the repatriation process as misplaced. 'In this connection, we also extensively engaged the Afghan side to ensure smooth repatriation of Afghan nationals,' Shafqat Ali Khan stated in a brief statement. The deportation plan, seen by VOA, requires authorities to relocate around 40,000 Afghans out of Islamabad and Rawalpindi by March 31 and subsequently arrange for their repatriation to Afghanistan if their relocation and resettlement cases to third countries are not processed expeditiously. These individuals fled their country after the Taliban militarily recaptured its control in 2021, primarily seeking shelter from potential retribution due to their affiliations with the U.S. and NATO forces. Last month, President Donald Trump halted the U.S. Refugee Admission Program to assess whether reinstating it serves the interests of Washington, stranding thousands of Afghan allies in Pakistan approved for, or being evaluated for, relocation to the U.S. The UNHCR says that more than 825,000 undocumented Afghans have already been forcibly repatriated from Pakistan since 2023, resulting from a government crackdown on foreigners living in the country without legal permission or whose visas had expired. Islamabad has defended the crackdown, attributing a recent rise in crime in Pakistan and increased militancy to Afghan nationals.	https://www.voanews.com/a/taliban-confirm-pakistan-s-new-plan-for-swift-mass-eviction-of-afghan-refugees-/7980321.html	2025-02-19T04:17:45-08:00	
China proposes new rules to tighten control over rare earth sector	BEIJING — China on Wednesday began public consultation on new regulations designed to protect its domestic rare earth industry, a sector where Beijing has previously weaponized its dominance via export controls and other restrictions. The draft regulations were released by the Ministry of Industry and Information Technology late on Wednesday and touched on issues including quotas for mining, smelting and separating, as well as monitoring and enforcement. The rules are the latest in a series of attempts to bring the globally critical sector under tighter state control. China already dictates output via a system of quotas and state-controlled companies. Rare earths are a group of 17 minerals whose production China dominates, accounting for nearly 90% of global refined output. In 2023, Beijing banned the export of technology to make rare earth magnets, adding it to an existing ban on technology to extract and separate the critical materials.	https://www.voanews.com/a/china-proposes-new-rules-to-tighten-control-over-rare-earth-sector-/7980313.html	2025-02-19T04:04:08-08:00	
China opposes Vietnam's building work on disputed reef in South China Sea	BEIJING — China opposes Vietnam's construction activities on a disputed islet in the South China Sea known as the Barque Canada Reef, its foreign ministry said on Wednesday. Occupied by Vietnam since the 1980s, the reef in the Spratly Islands is claimed by several countries, in a dispute that has intensified as China and the United States vie for influence in the strategic Southeast Asian nation. The reef is 'part of China's territory,' ministry spokesperson Guo Jiakun told a regular news conference, adding that China had always opposed 'illegal occupation' of islands and reefs. Vietnam's foreign ministry did not immediately respond to a request for comment. China claims almost the entire South China Sea despite overlapping claims in the busy waterway by Brunei, Malaysia, the Philippines and Vietnam. Vietnam's land reclamation had expanded the reef by 10 times since 2022, according to a study by Guangdong Ocean University and China's natural resources ministry, and which is being reviewed for publication in the Journal of Tropical Oceanography. The study added that Vietnam had dredged a channel 299 meters in width at the reef, sufficient to berth large vessels, such as warships. Last year, China rebuffed Vietnam's claims of sovereignty over the Paracel and Spratly island chains, saying its own claims to the two were backed by history. Vietnam has previously cited 'full legal basis and ample historical evidence' for its claims to the reef. The neighbors, who have close economic ties, agreed to step up cooperation on security matters in a move towards building a community with a 'shared future' during a trip to Hanoi last December by Chinese President Xi Jinping. In 2016, the Permanent Court of Arbitration in the Hague ruled that China's South China Sea claims were not supported by international law, a decision Beijing rejects. 'China will strive for an early conclusion of the code of conduct in the South China Sea and jointly safeguard peace and stability' in the region, Guo said in response to a query about disputes in the South China Sea. He was referring to a framework the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN) grouping is striving to finalize.	https://www.voanews.com/a/china-opposes-vietnam-s-building-work-on-disputed-reef-in-south-china-sea-/7980305.html	2025-02-19T03:54:58-08:00	
UAE says it rejects any attempt to displace Palestinian people	United Arab Emirates President Sheikh Mohammed bin Zayed Al Nahyan told U.S. Secretary of State Marco Rubio that the UAE rejects 'any attempts to displace the Palestinian people from their land' as Rubio made a visit Wednesday to Abu Dhabi. UAE state media reported the comments and said the president highlighted the need to prevent an expansion of the conflict in Gaza. 'He also underscored the importance of linking Gaza’s reconstruction to a path that leads to a comprehensive and lasting peace based on the two-state solution, as the only manner of ensuring stability in the region,' the report said. Arab leaders have rejected plans suggested by U.S. President Donald Trump that Palestinians leave Gaza for other countries in the region, and that the U.S. take over and rebuild the Palestinian enclave. Rubio’s visit was part of a multi-nation tour that also included talks with leaders in Israel and in Saudi Arabia, which came as the first phase of a ceasefire between Israel and Hamas in the Gaza Strip moved into its final weeks. Hostage release A top Hamas leader said Tuesday that the militant group plans to release six more living Israeli hostages from their Gaza captivity on Saturday and the bodies of four others on Thursday. Hamas leader Khalil al-Hayya made the surprise announcement in a recorded statement, an apparent response to the Israeli decision to allow long-requested mobile homes and construction equipment into the Gaza Strip. The six living hostages are the last set to be freed under the first phase of the ceasefire that expires in early March, with Hamas believed to be holding about 70 more captives, half of them living. Four more bodies of hostages are set to be returned next week. So far during the ceasefire, Hamas has released 24 hostages, and Israel freed more than 1,000 Palestinian prisoners. The warring sides have yet to negotiate the second and more difficult phase of their truce, in which Hamas says it will only release the remaining hostages in exchange for a lasting halt to the fighting and a full Israeli troop withdrawal from Gaza. Meanwhile, Israel has not backed off its goal, supported by the United States, of eradicating any military or governing role for Hamas in Gaza. Israeli Foreign Minister Gideon Saar said Tuesday that Israel was ready to open negotiations on the details of the second phase. Those talks were supposed to have started two weeks ago, according to the ceasefire deal. In his remarks, Hayya said the 'Bibas family' would be included in the handover of the four bodies, apparently referring to Shiri Bibas and her two young sons, Ariel and Kfir, who for many Israelis embody the captives' plight. Israel has not confirmed their deaths, and Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu’s office urged the public not to distribute 'photos, names and rumors.' Israel has said it was gravely concerned about the Bibas family, while Hamas said they were killed in an Israeli airstrike early in the war. Yarden Bibas, the husband and father, was kidnapped separately and released this month. Kfir, who was 9 months old at the time, was the youngest hostage taken in Hamas' October 7, 2023, attack on Israel that triggered 15 months of fighting. Video footage of the abduction showed Shiri swaddling her redheaded boys in a blanket and being whisked away by armed men. 'In recent hours we have been shaken after the Hamas spokesman's announcement was published about the return of our Shiri, Ariel and Kfir this coming Thursday as part of the movement to release kidnapped civilians,' the family said in a statement. 'It is important for us to say that we are aware of the reports but have not yet received an official update on the matter.' 'Until we receive certainty, our journey will not end,' the family said. An Israeli official said Netanyahu had agreed to allow the mobile homes and construction equipment into Gaza to accelerate the hostages' release. Hamas last week threatened to hold up the release of more hostages, citing the mobile home issue and other alleged violations of the truce. Israel is expected to continue releasing hundreds of Palestinian prisoners, including many serving life sentences for deadly attacks, in exchange for the hostages. Hamas, a U.S.-designated terror group, killed about 1,200 people in the October 2023 attack and took about 250 as hostages. More than half the captives have been released in ceasefire agreements and other deals, while eight were rescued in military operations. Israel's air and ground war killed more than 48,200 Palestinians, mostly women and children, according to Gaza's Health Ministry, which does not say how many were combatants.

VOA Mandarin: Xi Jinping meets with Chinese tech tycoons	Chinese leader Xi Jinping hosted a meeting with Chinese high-tech tycoons on Monday. Observers said that Xi’s meeting sends a positive signal to 'help promote the private sector.' But Xi needs to do more, such as rolling back the tightened internet security framework or the cyber administration’s regulatory reviews before the private sector’s confidence in the Chinese economy can be restored, they added.

US envoy in Ukraine for talks following US-Russia meeting	U.S. President Donald Trump’s envoy for Ukraine and Russia said Wednesday the United States understands the need for security guarantees for Ukraine, as he visited the country for talks with Ukrainian officials. Gen. Keith Kellogg told reporters in Kyiv that he was in Ukraine 'to listen,' hear the concerns of Ukrainian leaders and return to the United States to consult President Trump. Kellogg said the United States wants the war in Ukraine to end, saying that would be good for the region and the world. The talks come amid a flurry of diplomatic efforts focused on Russia’s war in Ukraine, including French President Emmanuel Macron hosting European leaders Wednesday for a second round of talks about the conflict and European support for Ukraine. Kellogg also met earlier this week with European leaders, and on Tuesday U.S. Secretary of State Marco Rubio held talks with Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov in Saudi Arabia. Rubio said both Ukraine and Russia would have to make concessions to achieve peace. 'The goal is to bring an end to this conflict in a way that's fair, enduring, sustainable and acceptable to all parties involved,' Rubio told reporters. No Ukrainian or European officials were at the table for the talks. Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy objected to being excluded from the meeting, a position that drew criticism from U.S. President Donald Trump. 'Today I heard, ‘Well, we weren’t invited.’ Well, you’ve been there for three years,' Trump said of Ukraine’s leaders. 'You should have never started it.' Russia began the war with its February 2022 full-scale invasion of Ukraine. While speaking to reporters at his Florida residence, Trump said he thought he had a 'good chance' to end the war. But Zelenskyy has said his country will not agree to a U.S.-Russian dictated settlement of the war. Zelenskyy postponed a trip to Saudi Arabia that had been scheduled for this week, suggesting that he wanted to avoid his visit being linked to the negotiations. The United States and Russia agreed to 'appoint respective high-level teams to begin working on a path to ending the conflict in Ukraine as soon as possible,' State Department spokeswoman Tammy Bruce said in a statement. Bruce characterized the meeting as 'an important step forward' toward peace. Rubio said Ukraine and European nations would have to be involved in talks on ending the war. He said that if the war is halted, the United States would have 'extraordinary opportunities … to partner' with Russia on trade and other global issues. European Union foreign policy chief Kaja Kallas said she and other European foreign ministers spoke to Rubio after the U.S.-Russia meeting, and she expressed support for a Ukraine-led resolution. 'Russia will try to divide us. Let’s not walk into their traps,' Kallas said on X. 'By working together with the US, we can achieve a just and lasting peace – on Ukraine’s terms.' Russia now controls about one-fifth of Ukraine’s internationally recognized 2014 territory, including the Crimean Peninsula that it unilaterally annexed in 2014, a large portion of eastern Ukraine that pro-Russian separatists captured in subsequent fighting, and land Russia has taken over since the 2022 invasion. As the invasion started, Moscow hoped for a quick takeover of all of Ukraine. But with stiff Ukrainian resistance, the war instead evolved into a grinding ground conflict and daily aerial bombardments by each side. Zelenskyy has long demanded that his country’s 2014 boundaries be restored, but U.S. officials have said that is unrealistic, as was Kyiv’s long-sought goal of joining NATO.

Swedish Supreme Court: Activists can't sue over climate action	STOCKHOLM — Sweden's Supreme Court ruled on Wednesday that Greta Thunberg and hundreds of other young activists cannot sue the state in a Swedish court over what they say is insufficient action against climate change. Activists filed a class action lawsuit in 2022 with a district court claiming the state violates their rights as laid out in the European Convention on Human Rights by not doing enough to limit climate change, nor to mitigate its effects. The district court in 2023 asked the Supreme Court to clarify whether a lawsuit of this kind can effectively be tried in a Swedish court, after the state requested the case be dismissed. 'A court cannot decide that the Riksdag or the government must take any specific action. The political bodies decide independently on which specific climate measures Sweden should take,' the Supreme Court said in a statement on Wednesday. The currently around 300 plaintiffs, which call themselves the Aurora group, wanted the district court to order Sweden to do more to limit global warming to 1.5 degrees Celsius.	https://www.voanews.com/a/swedish-supreme-court-activists-can-t-sue-over-climate-action/7980241.html	2025-02-19T01:11:28-08:00	
South Korea court finds former officials guilty of forcible return of N. Koreans	SEOUL, South Korea — A South Korean court found four former government officials guilty on Wednesday of forcibly repatriating two North Korean fishermen in 2019, despite their intention to defect, in a case that provoked criticism from global human rights activists. At the time they were deported, the government of former President Moon Jae-in called the fishermen 'dangerous criminals' who had killed 16 colleagues in a fight over an abusive captain on their ship before crossing the sea border. The Seoul Central District Court suspended sentencing for the four, who had held office under Moon, and had all denied wrongdoing. They were former National Security Office chief Chung Eui-yong, former presidential chief of staff Noh Young-min, former National Intelligence Service chief Suh Hoon and former Unification Minister Kim Yeon-chul. South Korea hands down suspended sentences for crimes seen as relatively minor that are not viewed as convictions in the traditional sense, but figure in the criminal record. In 2022, South Korea reopened the case, with the office of now-impeached President Yook Suk Yeol denouncing the repatriation to North Korea that called the defectors 'human scum,' as a potential 'crime against humanity.' The deportation was also criticized by rights watchdogs, including U.S.-based Human Rights Watch, which called it illegal under international law because of the likelihood the men would be tortured. Their fate has not been confirmed. Photographs and videos released by the Yoon administration in 2022 showed South Korean security officials dragging the men over the border into the hands of North Korean troops. Outside the court, former National Security Office chief Chung defended the repatriations and said he would discuss whether to appeal the ruling. 'Those repatriated ... in November 2019 were not just North Korean defectors who committed criminal acts in the course of defection, as prosecutors claim,' Chung told reporters. 'They brutally killed 16 of their fellow sailors (and) fled from North Korean society.' Prosecutors could not immediately be reached for comment.	https://www.voanews.com/a/south-korea-court-finds-former-officials-guilty-of-forcible-return-of-n-koreans/7980237.html	2025-02-19T01:00:32-08:00	
Vietnam raises GDP growth target to at least 8%, approves China rail link	HANOI, VIETNAM — Vietnam's National Assembly on Wednesday approved raising the economic growth target for this year and also voted in favor of major infrastructure projects, including the country's first nuclear power plants and a rail link to China. Lawmakers approved a new growth target for 2025 of at least 8% proposed by the government, an increase from the previous goal of 6.5% to 7.0%. 'With faster economic growth, macro stability must still be ensured while inflation must be kept under control,' the government said in a report to parliament. The report said inflation would be kept between 4.5% and 5.0% this year. Parliament also passed a resolution supporting construction of a new railway, linking a major seaport in northern Vietnam with China. The project is expected to cost $8.3 billion, part of which to be funded by loans from the Chinese government. Vietnam, a regional manufacturing hub heavily reliant on exports to drive its economy, has been seeking to ramp up infrastructure investment to boost growth. Lawmakers approved policies to develop nuclear power plants, the first of which is set to be built by the end of 2031. Under the policies, the government can appoint contractors to construct the plants without holding a tender process. Parliament approved rules that would allow Elon Musk's Starlink to provide satellite internet services in the country while maintaining full ownership of any local subsidiary. And a plan to offer financial support to local firms that enter the semiconductor industry was also supported. On Tuesday, the assembly approved a bold bureaucratic reform plan that will slash up to a fifth of government bodies, as it tries to cut costs and improve administrative efficiency.	https://www.voanews.com/a/vietnam-raises-gdp-growth-target-to-at-least-8-approves-china-rail-link/7980234.html	2025-02-19T00:47:16-08:00	
Immigration, cost of living frustrate voters as German elections loom	LONDON — Germany is set to hold a general election on Sunday, with voter frustrations over migration at the forefront of a heated campaign. The center-right Christian Democrats are leading the polls with about 29% support, with party leader Friedrich Merz the front-runner to become Germany’s next chancellor. The anti-immigration Alternative for Germany, or AfD, Party, which domestic intelligence services are monitoring as a suspected extremist organization, is polling in second place, with 21% support ahead of Sunday’s election. 'I am in favor of the principle that we must make a fundamental distinction between asylum and immigration. The state has not done that so far. Everything is mixed up, and we have had illegal migration into our country for 10 years,' AfD co-leader Alice Weidel said during a televised election debate on Monday. The AfD has steadily risen in support over recent months, said political scientist Wolfgang Schroeder, a fellow at the Berlin Social Science Center. 'This party has gained more and more support over time, interestingly to the same extent that it has become more radicalized,' he told The Associated Press. 'And the main driving force behind this success is, on the one hand, its anti-migration policy, which is very popular in Germany, even in the center of the political spectrum. Then there is their fight against the environmental transformation and their positioning in the Russia war.' The AfD has campaigned against sending military aid to Ukraine and advocates a closer relationship with Russia. The party’s policies have caught the attention of U.S. billionaire Elon Musk, who wrote on his social media platform X in December that 'only the AfD can save Germany.' In an opinion article for Germany’s Welt am Sonntag newspaper, Musk wrote, 'The portrayal of the AfD as right-wing extremist is clearly false, considering that Alice Weidel, the party’s leader, has a same-sex partner from Sri Lanka! Does that sound like Hitler to you? Please!' Musk later hosted a live chat on X with Weidel. Terror attacks Meanwhile, a recent spate of deadly terror attacks in Germany has intensified the debate over migration. 'And this has been one of the main reasons why the election has been really shifted toward focusing around migration,' said Sarah Wagner, an assistant professor at Queen's University Belfast. 'It’s quite different to the election campaigns that we saw back in 2021, where a lot of the parties were talking quite a lot about climate change, for example,' Wagner told VOA. Despite its growing popularity in some parts of the country, the rhetoric of the AfD and its supporters repulses many Germans. Large protests against the far right have been held in Berlin and other cities in the lead-up to the election. Cost of living While immigration is dominating the campaigns, analysts say the cost of living is at the forefront of voters’ minds as Europe’s biggest economy struggles to emerge from an inflation crisis. Germany’s past reliance on cheap Russian energy and Europe’s rapid severing of ties with the Kremlin have seen prices soar. Germany’s powerhouse carmakers are facing stiff competition from China, while the threat of U.S. import tariffs looms over the election, along with U.S. demands for a huge rise in defense spending. Economic pressures led to the collapse of the three-party coalition government in November. Chancellor Olaf Scholz of the Social Democrats wants to increase borrowing to fill a $26 billion hole in the 2025 budget and to help fund military aid for Ukraine. Friedrich Merz, leader of the Christian Democratic Union, argues that the country shouldn’t take on more debt and should instead seek to stimulate greater economic growth. 'The economy of the Federal Republic of Germany is now bringing up the rear in the European Union. We are in last place,' Merz told lawmakers on Feb. 11. Firewall Polls suggest that the Christian Democrats will win the election but finish well short of a majority. Merz has ruled out forming a coalition with the AfD, despite relying on their votes to pass a recent motion in parliament calling for tougher immigration controls. Mainstream German parties have sought to exclude the far right from power since the end of World War II by refusing to enter coalitions or relying on their votes in parliament, a policy known as the 'firewall.' The policy drew criticism from U.S. Vice President JD Vance, who surprised delegates at the Munich Security Conference on Friday with a speech focusing on a purported democratic backsliding among European allies. 'Democracy rests on the sacred principle that the voice of the people matters. There’s no room for firewalls. You either uphold the principle or you don’t,' Vance said before meeting Weidel on the sidelines of the Munich summit. ‘American interference’ Mainstream German parties united in rejecting Vance’s intervention. On Monday, Scholz said, 'When a vice president interferes in the German election campaign and says extreme right-wing parties are not so bad, I say that we think extreme right-wing parties are bad, and we don’t want to work with them.' Merz echoed those concerns. 'The Americans are questioning democratic institutions. And they are interfering quite openly in an election, including in relation to democratic parties and their majorities. And I have to say, it disturbs me,' Merz told German broadcaster Deutsche Welle.	https://www.voanews.com/a/immigration-cost-of-living-frustrate-voters-as-german-elections-loom/7979704.html	2025-02-19T00:13:38-08:00	
Russian attack injures at least 4 in Odesa	Officials in southern Ukraine said Wednesday that Russian aerial attacks overnight injured at least four people and damaged civilian infrastructure. Odesa Governor Oleh Kiper said on Telegram that Russian forces carried out what he called a 'massive' drone attack that disrupted power and heat services. He said the damage included a children’s clinic and a kindergarten. Russian attacks overnight also damaged power lines in the Cherkasy region, where Governor Ihor Taburets said debris from destroyed drones damaged eight houses. Ukraine’s military said it shot down 106 of the 167 drones that Russian forces launched overnight. The intercepts took place over the Cherkasy, Chernihiv, Dnipropetrovsk, Kharkiv, Kherson, Khmelnytskyi, Kirovohrad, Kyiv, Mykolaiv, Odesa, Poltava, Sumy, Zaporizhzhia and Zhytomyr regions, the military said. Russia’s military said Wednesday it shot down about 30 Ukrainian drones overnight, mostly over the Bryansk region where officials said there were no reports of damage or casualties. Ukrainian forces attacked an oil refinery overnight in the Russian city of Syzran, in the Samara region. Governor Vyacheslav Fedorishchev said on Telegram that the situation at the refinery was under control, and that the attack caused no major damage. Syzran is about 800 kilometers from the Russia-Ukraine border, making the attack unusual in how far into Russia Ukrainian forces decided to strike. Most Ukrainian attacks take place in regions along the border between the two countries. Oil facilities and military airfields are among the most common targets for the deeper attacks.

Panama says many migrants deported from the US agree to be returned to home countries	PANAMA CITY — Panama's security minister said on Tuesday that more than half of the migrants deported from the United States to transit points Panama in recent days had accepted voluntary repatriations to their home countries, largely in Asia or the Middle East. U.S. President Donald Trump's administration recently deported the migrants on three flights, part of his crackdown on unlawful migration. The 299 migrants have been staying at a hotel in Panama City under the protection of local authorities and with the financial support of the United States through the International Organization for Migration and the U.N. refugee agency, Security Minister Frank Abrego said. 'Today I can tell you that 171 of the (migrants) have accepted to return voluntarily,' said Abrego, adding that the others will leave gradually when the U.N. provides them with their return transportation. In the interim, those migrants will likely be transferred to a shelter near the Darien Gap jungle in southern Panama that connects Central America with South America. After talks with U.S. Secretary of State Marco Rubio this month, Panama's President Jose Raul Mulino announced that a deal signed in July with the U.S. Department of Homeland Security could be expanded so that Venezuelan, Colombian and Ecuadorean migrants could also be repatriated from Panama.	https://www.voanews.com/a/panama-says-many-migrants-deported-from-the-us-agree-to-be-returned-to-home-countries/7980201.html	2025-02-18T22:59:34-08:00	
New Zealand must ‘reset’ Cook Islands ties after China pact, foreign minister says	New Zealand Foreign Minister Winston Peters said on Wednesday his country must 'reset' its relationship with the Cook Islands government after its Pacific neighbor signed agreements with China without consultation. In a speech to the Pacific Island Political Science Association in Wellington, Peters said Cook Islands Prime Minister Mark Brown’s opaque dealings with Beijing was the latest attempt to test constitutional ties with New Zealand. 'While the connection between the people of the Cook Islands and New Zealand remains resolutely strong, we currently face challenges in the government-to-government relationship,' he said. 'We are going to need to reset the government-to-government relationship.' The Cook Islands is a self-governing nation and maintains free association with Wellington, sharing a head of state and citizenship rights. It is permitted an independent foreign policy, but the two countries are required to consult on security, defense and foreign policy issues. Brown’s visit to Beijing this month resulted in a strategic partnership with China spanning education, the economy, infrastructure, fisheries, disaster management and seabed mining. It set off alarm bells in New Zealand due to concerns with China’s growing presence in the region and the potential threats to the country’s national security. While the Cook Islands government has released details of the strategic partnership, Peters said New Zealand had not seen a number of memoranda of understanding also signed with China. 'New Zealand and the Cook Islands people remain, as of this evening, in the dark over all but one the agreements signed by China and the Cooks last week,' Peters said. Brown’s deal with China follows an attempt by the Cooks to create its own passports and citizenship, a proposal New Zealand said would require the islands to become fully independent to do. Separately, Peters also addressed tensions with Kiribati after its government canceled a planned visit by New Zealand officials at short notice. Kiribati has also signed a series of bilateral deals with China in recent years. Peters said Wellington had committed more than $57 million in aid to the Pacific island nation over the past three years and needed to reassess how funds were being used.	https://www.voanews.com/a/new-zealand-must-reset-cook-islands-ties-after-china-pact-foreign-minister-says/7980196.html	2025-02-18T22:13:20-08:00	
Questions emerge about what may have caused Delta plane to burst into flames and flip over	TORONTO — Investigators will consider the weather conditions, as well as the possibility of human error or an aircraft malfunction as they try to determine why a Delta Air Lines jet burst into flames and flipped upside down as it tried to land in Toronto, aviation experts said Tuesday. Witnesses and video from the scene Monday afternoon shows the plane landing so hard that its right wing is sheared off. It bursts into flames before sliding down the runway and flipping over. Miraculously, all 80 people on board the flight from Minneapolis to Toronto’s Pearson International Airport survived. 'It appears from the video that the plane landed so hard that the right main gear collapsed. The tail and right wing began skidding causing the plane to roll over to the right,' Ella Atkins, the head of Virginia Tech’s aerospace and ocean engineering department and a pilot. 'During the rollover, the right wing and tail sheared off, and a fire ignited, likely due to skidding and fuel leakage at least from a right-wing tank.' All but two of the 21 people injured on the flight have been released from hospitals, the airport CEO said Tuesday. 'How grateful we are there was no loss of life, or life-threatening injuries,' Deborah Flint, CEO of Greater Toronto Airports Authority, said during a news conference. 'The crew heroically led passengers to safety.' Crash investigation Communications between the tower and pilot were normal on approach and it’s not clear what went wrong when the plane — a Mitsubishi CRJ-900 made by the Canadian company Bombardier — touched down. Aviation experts said investigators will consider conditions on the ground, the pilot's actions before landing, and potential problems with the landing gear. The Transportation Safety Board of Canada is leading the investigation with support from the U.S. National Transportation Safety Board. Juan Browne, a commercial pilot who discusses aviation incidents on his popular YouTube channel, said preliminary data suggests the speed and rate of descent, crosswinds and the weather were 'within limits.' But Browne raised concerns about the pilots' actions before landing. 'It appears that the aircraft simply did not flare at all,' Browne said. Flaring slows the aircraft’s rate of descent. 'They just drove it into the runway.' At the time of the crash, Pearson was experiencing blowing snow and winds of 51 kph, gusting to 65 kph, according to the Meteorological Service of Canada. The temperature was about minus 8.6 degrees Celsius. Browne said blowing snow reduces visibility. Michael McCormick, an assistant professor and program coordinator for air traffic management at Embry-Riddle Aeronautical University in Daytona Beach, Florida, said investigators would look closely at the landing gear to make sure it was properly locked in place, and would consider staffing on the ground and in the aircraft. 'They will look at the number of people working both on the aircraft and the control towers. And they will look at their schedules,' McCormick said. 'Are they well-rested? Are they well-staffed?' A Canadian investigator refused to comment on preliminary theories. 'At this point, it’s far too early to say what the cause of this accident might be,' TSB Senior Investigator Ken Webster said in a video statement Tuesday, as he stood near the remains of the aircraft. He said investigators will examine the wreckage and runway, and have removed the cockpit voice and flight data recorders and sent them to the lab for analysis. ‘Everything just kind of went sideways’ Peter Carlson, who was traveling to Toronto for a paramedics’ conference, said the landing was 'very forceful.' 'All the sudden, everything just kind of went sideways and the next thing I know, it’s kind of a blink, and I’m upside down, still strapped in,' he told CBC News. That everyone survived the Delta crash is a testament to the safety improvements made by airlines and aircraft manufacturers, including wings that are designed to come off to reduce explosions, well-trained flight crews and seats built to withstand impacts of up to 16 times the force of gravity. 'That seat is your single best resource in order to keep you protected,' McCormick said. 'There’s a reason why the flight attendants walk around the aircraft prior to (landing) ... to make sure everybody has their seat belts fastened.' But is it safe to fly? The crash was the fourth major aviation accident in North America in recent weeks. A commercial jetliner and an Army helicopter collided near Reagan National Airport in Washington, D.C., on Jan. 29, killing 67 people. A medical transportation plane crashed in Philadelphia on Jan. 31, killing the six people on board and another person on the ground. And on Feb. 6, 10 people were killed in a plane crash in Alaska. Nevertheless, according to Jeff Guzzetti, an airline safety consultant and a former FAA and NTSB investigator, air travel is 'extremely safe.' 'The odds of getting injured or killed in a commercial airline accident is far less than driving in your car,' Guzzetti said. Still, he worries about layoffs at the Federal Aviation Administration under the Trump administration. ‘’I am concerned that the proposed cuts and changes to the FAA may increase the risk of further accidents,' he said. The Delta flight was cleared to land at about 2:10 p.m. Audio recordings show the control tower warned the pilots of a possible air flow 'bump' on approach. 'It was windy, but the airplanes are designed and certified to handle that,' said John Cox, CEO of aviation safety consulting firm Safety Operating Systems in St. Petersburg, Florida. 'The pilots are trained and experienced to handle that.' Carlson said when he took off his seat belt, he crashed onto the ceiling, which had become the floor. He smelled gas, saw aviation fuel cascading down the cabin windows and knew they all had to get out. Carlson and another man assisted a mother and her son out of the plane, then Carlson dropped onto the snowy tarmac. 'All of us just wanted to be out of the aircraft,' he said.	https://www.voanews.com/a/questions-emerge-about-what-may-have-caused-delta-plane-to-burst-into-flames-and-flip-over-/7980194.html	2025-02-18T22:07:15-08:00	
US condemns 'dangerous' maneuvers by Chinese navy in South China Sea	MANILA, Philippines — The United States condemned the 'dangerous' maneuvers of a Chinese navy helicopter that endangered the safety of a Philippine government aircraft patrolling a disputed shoal in the South China Sea, its ambassador to Manila said on Wednesday. In a post on X, Ambassador MaryKay Carlson also called on China 'to refrain from coercive actions and settle its disputes peacefully in accordance with international law.' The Philippines said late on Tuesday it was 'deeply disturbed' by the Chinese navy's 'unprofessional and reckless' flight actions and that it will make a diplomatic protest. Manila's coast guard said the Chinese navy helicopter performed dangerous flight maneuvers when it flew close to a government aircraft conducting surveillance over the Scarborough Shoal, endangering the lives of its pilots and passengers. China disputed the Philippines' account, saying on Tuesday its aircraft 'illegally intruded' into China's airspace and accused its Southeast Asian neighbor of 'spreading false narratives.' Named after a British ship that was grounded on the atoll nearly three centuries ago, the Scarborough Shoal is one of the most contested maritime features in the South China Sea, where Beijing and Manila have clashed repeatedly. 'The Philippines has undeniable sovereignty and jurisdiction over Bajo de Masinloc,' its maritime council said in a statement, using Manila's name for the shoal. China claims sovereignty over almost the entire South China Sea, a vital waterway for more than $3 trillion of annual ship-borne commerce, putting it at odds with Brunei, Indonesia, Malaysia, the Philippines and Vietnam. A 2016 arbitration ruling invalidated China's expansive claims but Beijing does not recognize the decision.	https://www.voanews.com/a/us-condemns-dangerous-maneuvers-by-chinese-navy-in-south-china-sea/7980179.html	2025-02-18T21:08:50-08:00	
Senate advances nomination of Trump FBI pick Kash Patel	WASHINGTON — The U.S. Senate on Tuesday voted to advance the nomination of Kash Patel to be the director of the FBI, putting a staunch ally of President Donald Trump and a critic of the bureau on track to run the most prominent U.S. law enforcement agency. The Senate voted 48-45 along party lines on a procedural measure setting the stage for a final confirmation vote on one of Trump’s most controversial nominees later this week. Patel, a former intelligence and Defense Department official in Trump’s first term, has called for a radical reshaping of the FBI, pledging to expand its role on illegal immigration and violent crime, core Trump priorities. Patel has been among the most vocal critics of FBI investigations into Trump on issues ranging from Russian interference in the 2016 election, Trump’s retention of classified documents at his Florida club and his attempts to overturn the 2020 election. Democrats have called Patel unfit to lead the FBI, pointing to his embrace of false claims about voter fraud in the 2020 election and FBI agents fomenting the January 6, 2021 attack on the U.S. Capitol. But Patel has attracted broad support from Republicans, who have touted him as a reformer. A Senate panel voted 12-10 along party lines last week to send his nomination to the full Senate.	https://www.voanews.com/a/senate-advances-nomination-of-trump-fbi-pick-kash-patel/7980183.html	2025-02-18T21:00:05-08:00	
Senate confirms Howard Lutnick as commerce secretary	Washington — The Senate confirmed wealthy financier Howard Lutnick as commerce secretary Tuesday, putting in place a staunch supporter of President Donald Trump's hardline trade policies. At the Commerce Department, Lutnick, who was CEO at the investment firm Cantor Fitzgerald, will oversee 50,000 employees who do everything from collecting economic statistics to running the census to issuing weather reports. But he's likely to spend a lot of time — along with Jamieson Greer, Trump's nominee to be the top U.S. trade negotiator — managing the president's aggressive plans to impose import taxes on U.S. trading partners, including allies and adversaries alike. The Senate vote to confirm Lutnick was 51-45. Trump views the tariffs as a versatile economic tool. They can raise money to finance his tax cuts elsewhere, protect U.S. industries and pressure other countries into making concessions on such issues as their own trade barriers, immigration and drug trafficking. Mainstream economists mostly view tariffs as counterproductive: They are paid by import companies in the United States, which try to pass along the higher costs to consumers and can thereby add to inflationary pressures throughout the economy. At his confirmation hearing last month, Lutnick dismissed as 'nonsense'' the idea that tariffs contribute to inflation. He expressed support for deploying across-the-board tariffs 'country by country'' to strong-arm other countries into lowering barriers to American exports. Trump last week announced plans for 'reciprocal'' tariffs — raising U.S. import tax rates to match the higher taxes that other countries impose on goods from the U.S. The move would shatter the rules that have governed world trade for decades. Since the 1960s, tariff rates have mostly emerged from negotiations between dozens of countries. Trump is commandeering the process. The president has also imposed 10% tariffs on Chinese imports and effectively raised U.S. taxes on foreign steel and aluminum. He has threatened — and delayed until March 4 — 25% tariffs on goods from Canada and Mexico. Lutnick was CEO at Cantor Fitzgerald when its offices were hit in the Sept. 11, 2001, attack on the World Trade Center. The firm lost two-thirds of its employees — 658 people — that day, including Lutnick's brother.

Ukrainian drone hits oil pumping station	Russia shot down 21 Ukrainian drones late Tuesday, but a drone attack on an oil pumping station in southern Russia reduced oil supplies for Kazakhstan and the global market, Russian officials said. Meanwhile, Ukrainian forces said one of their drones struck and knocked out a North Korean self-propelled howitzer on the eastern front. 'In Luhansk region, fighters of the 412th separate regiment of Nemesis drones struck a very rare M-1978 North Korean self-propelled artillery vehicle with a gun caliber of 170 mm,' the Ukrainian military posted on the Telegram messaging app. The Russian defense ministry said 20 drones in the Bryansk region on the Ukrainian border and another in Crimea were shot down within an hour late Tuesday. Russian Deputy Prime Minister Alexander Novak said the drone attack on the pumping station reduced oil flows through the Caspian Pipeline Consortium by 30%-40% on Tuesday. 'As a result of the attack, energy equipment, a gas turbine unit, and a substation were damaged,' he said on Russian television. CPC pumps crude from companies that include Chevron and Exxon Mobil, Reuters reported. Novak said repairs might take several months. Earlier Tuesday, a Russian drone hit an apartment building in the central Ukrainian city of Dolynska, officials said Tuesday, injuring at least three people. Andriy Raikovych, governor of the Kirovohrad region where the attack took place, said on Telegram that authorities evacuated dozens of people from the building and that those injured included a mother and two children. The attack was part of a widespread Russian aerial assault overnight, which the Ukrainian military said included 176 drones. Ukrainian air defenses shot down 103 of the drones, with intercepts taking place over the Cherkasy, Chernihiv, Dnipropetrovsk, Kharkiv, Kherson, Kirovohrad, Kyiv, Mykolaiv, Poltava, Sumy, Vinnytsia and Zhytomyr regions, the military said Tuesday. Cherkasy Governor Ihor Taburets said on Telegram that debris from a destroyed drone damaged four houses in his region. Some information for this story was provided by Reuters.	https://www.voanews.com/a/ukrainian-drone-hits-oil-pumping-station/7980173.html	2025-02-18T20:19:14-08:00	
Brazil's former President Bolsonaro charged with attempting coup	RIO DE JANEIRO — Brazil's prosecutor-general on Tuesday formally charged former President Jair Bolsonaro with attempting a coup to stay in office after his 2022 election defeat, in a plot that included a plan to poison his successor and current President Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva and kill a Supreme Court judge. Prosecutor-General Paulo Gonet alleges that Bolsonaro and 33 others participated in a plan to remain in power. The alleged plot, he wrote, included a plan to poison Lula and shoot dead Supreme Court Justice Alexandre de Moraes, a foe of the former president. 'The members of the criminal organization structured a plan at the presidential palace to attack institutions, aiming to bring down the system of the powers and the democratic order, which received the sinister name of 'Green and Yellow Dagger,'' Gonet wrote in a 272-page indictment. 'The plan was conceived and taken to the knowledge of the president, and he agreed to it.' Bolsonaro is often seen in Brazil's yellow-and-green national soccer jersey and the colors have become associated with his political movement In November, Brazil's Federal Police filed a 884-page report with Gonet detailing the scheme. They allege a systematic effort to sow distrust in the electoral system, drafting a decree to provide legal cover for the plot, pressuring top military brass to go along with the plan and inciting a riot in the capital. In the indictment, Gonet described the alleged crimes as part of a chain of events articulated with an overarching objective of stopping Bolsonaro from leaving office, 'contrary to the result of the popular will at the polls.' The Supreme Court will analyze the charges and, if accepted, Bolsonaro will stand trial. The far-right leader denies wrongdoing. 'I have no concerns about the accusations, zero,' Bolsonaro told journalists earlier on Tuesday during a visit to the Senate in Brasilia. 'Have you seen the coup decree, by any chance? You haven't. Neither have I,' he added. Fabio Wajngarten, a lawyer for Bolsonaro, did not immediately comment on the charges but said there will be a statement without saying when. As well as participating in a coup d'état, the 34 defendants are accused of participating in an armed criminal organization, attempted violent abolition of the democratic rule of law, damage qualified by violence and serious threat against the state's assets, and deterioration of listed heritage, according to a statement from the Prosecutor General's press office. Gonet said the criminal organization he charged 'had, as leaders, the (then) president himself and his running mate, Gen. Braga Netto.' 'Both accepted, stimulated, and performed acts that are described in our criminal legislation as attacking the existence and the Independence of (the branches) of power and of the democratic rule,' Gonet wrote in his report. The indictments, based on manuscripts, digital files, spreadsheets, and message exchanges, expose a scheme to disrupt democratic order, according to the prosecutor-general's office. The charges are 'historic,' said Luis Henrique Machado, a criminal attorney and professor at the IDP university in Brasilia, adding that he expects the Supreme Court to accept the charges and put Bolsonaro on trial sometime before the end of next year. 'The charges show Brazil's institutions are robust, independent and agile,' Machado said. 'They are a role model for other countries where democracy is at risk.' Bolsonaro is barred from running in the 2026 election after judges with the country's top electoral court ruled that he abused his power and cast unfounded doubts on the country's electronic voting system. Following Tuesday's charges, Bolsonaro will 'position himself as a victim,' said Carlos Melo, a political science professor at Insper University in Sao Paulo. Bolsonaro has previously said his legal woes are an attempt to stop him from returning to office. 'There are polls saying he would be competitive in the 2026 elections against Lula, one of them published today,' said Melo. 'There's going to be political dust, but it will settle.'	https://www.voanews.com/a/brazil-s-former-president-bolsonaro-charged-with-attempting-coup/7980166.html	2025-02-18T19:44:51-08:00	
Chinese influence in South Korea a focus in Yoon impeachment hearings, analysts say	WASHINGTON — South Korea’s Constitutional Court is approaching the final phase of proceedings before it decides in March whether to impeach President Yoon Suk Yeol over his brief martial law bid in December. Since its first official hearing on Jan. 14, exactly a month after the National Assembly voted to impeach Yoon, the court has held nine hearings; the last is scheduled for Thursday. China has become a central issue at some of the hearings, with analysts saying that South Korea-U.S. counterintelligence coordination is crucial in deterring Beijing influence operations that threaten both countries. Yoon's attorney, Cha Gi-hwan, raised concerns about what he alleged was China's interference in South Korean politics, elections and media at several proceedings, apparently in defense of Yoon's statement made in December. Yoon had said 'anti-state forces' were operating in South Korea while explaining his decision to impose martial law at the time and highlighted Chinese nationals using a drone to film a U.S. aircraft carrier docked at the port city of Busan. He had said the opposition parties blocked a revision to anti-espionage law, preventing the prosecution of foreign nationals spying on South Korea. The ruling People Power Party (PPP) pushed for an amendment to the law to broaden its scope from targeting 'enemy states' to include 'foreign countries,' citing threats posed by Chinese espionage. The opposition Democratic Party of Korea (DPK) blocked the revision for fear of potential misuse of the law. Cha said at a hearing on Feb. 11 that China has been interfering in South Korean politics by having its companies and people residing in South Korea fund and support pro-China politicians, manipulate public opinion and spread fake news unfavorable to those who oppose pro-China politicians running for election. Chinese Ambassador to Seoul Dai Bing on Feb. 10 denied widespread accusations among Yoon's supporters that Beijing interfered in South Korean politics and elections. He wrote on X that Beijing 'has all along upheld the principle of noninterference in other countries' internal affairs.' Growing threat In testifying before the Senate Foreign Relations Committee last month, Dartmouth University professor Jennifer Lind said the Chinese Communist Party (CCP) conducts malign influence operations that aim 'to bolster authoritarianism, discredit democratic governance and reshape global norms in China's interests.' The Senate hearing was about 'The Malign Influence of the People’s Republic of China' in the U.S. and abroad. Analysts in Washington said if Yoon is removed from the office, China will conduct full-fledged malign operations in the country. 'I would expect Beijing to increase its efforts, as it sees South Korea's political upheaval as ripe for Chinese malicious intervention,' said Dennis Wilder, a senior fellow at the Initiative for U.S.-China Dialogue on Global Issues at Georgetown University. 'China's goal will be to weaken the democracy and to support those in favor of better ties with Beijing at the expense of the U.S. alliance,' said Wilder, who served as the CIA's deputy assistant director for East Asia and the Pacific from 2015 to 2016. 'The key to defeating China's ambition is intense and sustained counterintelligence programs. The United States has a great deal to teach South Korea in this area, and the CIA and the FBI should work with the South Koreans to improve their ability to spot and deter Chinese covert operations,' Wilder added. 'Everything on the Korean Peninsula affects U.S. security,' said David Maxwell, vice president of the Center for Asia Pacific Strategy. 'President Yoon is right to call attention to what China is doing. Ideally, it would be wonderful to have a coordinated [U.S.] response with South Korea.' US-South Korea coordination If the court decides to remove Yoon from office, main opposition party leader Lee Jae-myung is considered a candidate for an election to be held within 60 days. Bruce Klingner, senior research fellow at the Heritage Foundation, said, 'Statements by party chief Lee Jae-myung indicate the party will pursue a more conciliatory policy toward China and North Korea, more antagonistic toward Japan, and place less emphasis on strengthening the alliance with the United States.' Klingner, formerly the CIA's deputy division chief, told VOA on Thursday, 'The Trump administration will look for South Korea and other Indo-Pacific democracies to pursue stronger policies against the multifaceted China threat, including supporting roles in Taiwan contingencies. The [main] Democratic Party of Korea would resist such entreaties, which will cause strains with Washington.' Secretary of Defense Pete Hegseth said at a news conference after meeting with NATO defense ministers in Belgium on Thursday that working with Pacific allies South Korea, Japan and Australia will be 'critical' in dealing with the Chinese threat. Korean Service's Kim Hyungjin contributed to this report.	https://www.voanews.com/a/chinese-influence-in-south-korea-a-focus-in-yoon-impeachment-hearings-analysts-say/7980160.html	2025-02-18T19:21:57-08:00	
66 measles cases reported in US states of Texas, New Mexico	Measles is making a comeback in the United States. Fifty-eight cases of the highly contagious disease were reported Tuesday by health officials in rural West Texas, while eight cases were confirmed in neighboring eastern New Mexico. Texas officials say the outbreak there, the largest in almost 30 years, is mainly confined to Gaines County, with 45 infections, but four other counties account for an additional 13 cases. The Texas measles cases, according to health officials, have occurred mainly among a 'close-knit, undervaccinated' Mennonite community. Authorities say at least three of the New Mexico cases are in counties that border Texas' Gaines County. Earlier this month, the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention reported 14 measles cases across the country. Mayo Clinic describes measles as 'a childhood infection caused by a virus. Once quite common, measles can now almost always be prevented with a vaccine ... measles spreads easily and can be serious, and even fatal, for small children.' Measles is a respiratory virus that can survive in the air for two hours. As many as nine out of 10 people who are susceptible will get the virus if exposed, according to the CDC. However, in recent years, the necessity and safety of the vaccinations designed to prevent the disease have come under question, with some parents citing a now-discredited study that linked the measles vaccine to autism. Another unfortunate development in the fight against measles happened during the COVID-19 pandemic when many children missed their vaccinations. Los Angeles Cedars Sinai said in a statement in February 2024 that 61 million fewer doses of the measles vaccine were distributed nationwide from 2020 to 2022. Before the MMR vaccination, which addresses not only measles, but also mumps and rubella, was introduced in the U.S. in 1963, there were 3 million to 4 million measles cases every year. Now there are usually fewer than 200 cases per year, but pockets of measles persist in areas that still resist the vaccinations. The shots are first given to toddlers between 12 and 15 months and then again at 4 to 6 years of age.	https://www.voanews.com/a/measles-cases-reported-in-us-states-of-texas-new-mexico/7980149.html	2025-02-18T19:04:11-08:00	
Saudi prince proving crucial to Trump efforts to end Ukraine, Gaza wars	WASHINGTON — Top U.S. and Russian officials wrapped up their meetings Tuesday in Riyadh, Saudi Arabia, to discuss a pathway to end the war in Ukraine, days before Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman is set to convene a summit with leaders from Egypt, Jordan, Qatar and the United Arab Emirates to discuss an Arab response to U.S. President Donald Trump's vow to take over Gaza. The two separate talks reflect the growing role of the prince in Trump's efforts to fulfill his campaign promise to end the wars in Ukraine and Gaza. On Tuesday, Trump again declared he would swiftly end fighting. 'I have the power to end this war,' Trump said from Mar-a-Lago, his residence in Florida, dismissing Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy's concern that Kyiv was excluded from the Riyadh meeting. 'Well, you've been there for three years, you should have ended it,' he said of Zelenskyy in response to a reporter's question. 'I could have made a deal for Ukraine that would have given them almost all of the land.' Trump did not clarify which part of land would remain Ukrainian. Russia began its full-scale invasion in February 2022 and now controls parts of the Donetsk, Kherson, Luhansk and Zaporizhzhia regions, and fighting has been ongoing at the borders of Kharkiv and Mykolaiv. Russia annexed Crimea in 2014. The Saudi talks signaled a major détente between Washington and Moscow and an abrupt end of U.S. policy under former President Joe Biden to isolate Russia and support Ukraine 'for as long as it takes.' Instead, U.S. Secretary of State Marco Rubio dangled the prospects of 'the incredible opportunities that exist to partner with the Russians' on trade and other global issues when the war ends. Arab response to Gaza plan Later this week, Prince Mohammed will bring together leaders from Egypt, Jordan, Qatar and the UAE to discuss an Arab response to Trump's vow to take over Gaza and create a 'Riviera in the Middle East' by expelling Palestinians from Gaza to neighboring countries. Trump's plan has angered regional leaders, who are now scrambling to come up with a counteroffer that they will discuss in Riyadh ahead of a broader Arab League gathering in Cairo next week. One of the Arab proposals being discussed is an Egyptian-led plan that involves forming a national Palestinian committee to govern Gaza without Hamas and raising up to $20 billion from Arab and Gulf states over three years for reconstruction. As Saudi Arabia makes a play for the diplomatic mainstage, Prince Mohammed is motivated to be proactive rather than reactive, to counsel pragmatism rather than rigidity, said Laura Blumenfeld, a senior fellow and Middle East analyst at the Johns Hopkins School for Advanced International Studies. Blumenfeld told VOA that the prince could pair his approach with a language that Trump likes to speak: investments. This week, global financiers and tech executives will gather in Miami, Florida, in a conference hosted by the Future Investment Initiative Institute, a nonprofit arm of Saudi Arabia's Public Investment Fund — the kingdom's sovereign wealth fund led by the prince. Reuters, quoting several people with knowledge of the event, reported that Trump is scheduled to deliver an address at the meeting. 'Trump is a peacemaker in a hurry, with his eye on the Nobel Prize. [The prince] is a dealmaker in a hurry, with his eye on the Saudi Vision 2030 economic diversification plan,' Blumenfeld added. 'The two men are a match made in transactional heaven.' Prince Mohammed the power broker With his efforts focused on Ukraine and Gaza, the 39-year-old de facto leader of Saudi Arabia has emerged as a power broker that Trump leans on for his foreign policy goals. Prince Mohammed has done this in part by leveraging close ties during Trump's first term, maintaining business ties while Trump was out of office, and further expanding the relationship since the president's inauguration last month. Saudi Arabia was Trump's first foreign trip in 2017, where he signed several deals, including a $110 billion arms deal, which could expand up to $350 billion over 10 years. Trump spoke openly about the transactional nature of the visit, telling reporters days after his second inauguration in January that the reason he chose Riyadh for that first visit was because 'they agreed to buy $450 billion worth of our products.' Trump suggested on the day of his last inauguration that he would again make Saudi Arabia his first destination in return for Saudi funds, and days later, the prince told him during a phone call that he planned to invest $600 billion or more in the U.S. over the next four years. In 2021, Saudi Arabia invested $2 billion with a firm that belonged to Jared Kushner, Trump's son-in-law and former aide. The Trump Organization has also expanded its real estate presence in the region, announcing it had leased its brand to two real estate projects in Riyadh in December after launching the Trump Tower project in Jeddah. As Prince Mohammed cultivated his political and business ties with Trump, he maintained a relationship with Russian President Vladimir Putin amid Biden's effort to isolate the Russian leader following his 2022 invasion of Ukraine. 'The crown prince has been making the argument for the last five years that it's in America's interest that Saudi Arabia maintains very good ties with Russia and China,' said Ali Shihabi, author and commentator on the politics and economics of Saudi Arabia. 'Saudi Arabia was insisting on maintaining a multipolar policy while maintaining very strong ties with the United States,' he told VOA. The prince is poised to host a summit between the two leaders that Trump said he agreed to during his call with Putin last week. The summit, Shihabi said, would be an example of how the prince's gambit has paid off. 'I don't think there are any leaders in the world that have the relationship that the crown prince has with both Mr. Putin and Mr. Trump,' he said. There is also a practical reason. The kingdom is not a signatory of the Rome Statute of the International Criminal Court, which issued an arrest warrant for Putin in 2023.	https://www.voanews.com/a/saudi-prince-proving-crucial-to-trump-efforts-to-end-ukraine-gaza-wars/7980148.html	2025-02-18T18:54:02-08:00

Sudanese RSF paramilitaries kill 100s in White Nile state	CAIRO — Attacks by Sudan's paramilitary Rapid Support Force have killed hundreds of civilians, including infants, in White Nile state, Sudanese officials and rights groups said Tuesday. Sudan's Foreign Ministry said in a statement that the paramilitary group targeted civilians in the past few days in villages in the al-Gitaina area after they were 'overwhelmed by its devastating defeat' by the Sudanese army. The statement put the death toll at 433, while the Preliminary Committee of Sudan Doctors' Trade Union put that figure at 300. Emergency Lawyers, a rights group tracking violence against civilians, said in a statement Tuesday morning that more than 200 people, including women and children, were killed in RSF attacks and hundreds of others were injured over the past three days. 'The attacks included executions, kidnapping, forced disappearance, looting, and shooting those trying to escape,' the group said. Minister of Culture and Information Khalid Ali Aleisir said on Facebook that recent attacks by the RSF in Al-Kadaris and Al-Khalwat villages in White Nile state are the latest 'systematic violence against defenseless civilians.' The Sudanese military said Saturday it had advanced in White Nile and 'liberated more cities and villages,' cutting crucial supply routes to the RSF, a rival group it has battled for control of the country since April 2023. The war in Sudan has killed more than 24,000 people and driven more than 14 million people — about 30% of the population — from their homes, according to the United Nations. An estimated 3.2 million Sudanese have escaped to neighboring countries. The U.N. on Tuesday said that throughout 2024, its human rights office documented more than 4,200 civilian killings, adding that the total number is likely much higher. The U.N. Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs appealed on Monday for $6 billion for its 2025 humanitarian response in Sudan, to help about 21 million people in the country and the millions who fled the war abroad. 'This is a humanitarian crisis that is truly unprecedented in its scale and gravity,' said U.N. aid chief Tom Fletcher in a statement, 'and it demands a response unprecedented in scale and intent.' Meanwhile, Norwegian Minister of International Development Asmund Aukrust denounced the escalation in violence and attacks against civilians. 'I am deeply concerned about the sharp increase in civilian deaths caused by the intensified conflict in Sudan. I am also shocked by reports of indiscriminate attacks against civilians and civilian infrastructure. Any such attacks must stop immediately,' Aukrust said in a statement published on the web portal for the Norwegian government. The developments on the ground have given the military the upper hand in the war as the paramilitary suffered multiple blows, including losing control of the city of Wad Medani, the capital of Gezira province, and other areas in the province. The Sudanese military also regained control of the country's largest oil refinery. The RSF appears to have lost control of the Greater Khartoum area and the cities of Omdurman and Khartoum Bahri. The war has shown no end in sight despite international mediation attempts, including a U.S. assessment that the RSF and its proxies are committing genocide.	https://www.voanews.com/a/sudanese-rsf-paramilitaries-kill-100s-in-white-nile-state-/7980135.html	2025-02-18T18:24:46-08:00

Yazidi woman enslaved by Islamic State relocates to Germany months after rescue	WASHINGTON — A Yazidi woman who survived rape and enslavement by Islamic State and was rescued from Gaza last October in a U.S.-led operation arrived in Germany on Tuesday, February 18. Fawzia Amin Saydo, 21, was kidnapped by IS militants from her hometown of Sinjar, northern Iraq, in August 2014, just a month before her 11th birthday. She endured a decade of suffering, including rape, enslavement and forced marriage to a Palestinian IS fighter in Syria before being sent to Gaza to live with her captor's mother. She was rescued from Gaza on October 1, 2024, during a secret U.S.-led operation that involved cooperation among human rights activists, as well as Israeli, Jordanian, Iraqi and United Nations officials. Saydo arrived about 5 p.m. local time at Hannover Airport in Langenhagen, Germany, where she was received by her lawyer, Kareba Hagemann, a group of relatives and human rights activists. 'She has arrived in Germany safely, and she is very relieved,' Hagemann told VOA. 'The first thing Fawzia said upon her arrival was, 'Please make sure my family can also come join me and live here with me.'' The German consulate in Baghdad on February 10 issued Saydo a visa on a humanitarian basis. Her mother, grandmother and five siblings are still in Iraq. 'Her family, except her two sisters, wanted to go as well, but the German government made it clear that they will only agree to take in Fawzia,' Hagemann said. 'There is no legal obligation to take her, but it is an act of humanity, which is why I was thankful to them to agree to take Fawzia at least.' According to the United Nations Refugee Agency, Germany is the third-largest refugee-hosting country in the world and the largest in the European Union, with 2.5 million refugees from all over the world, including more than 1 million refugees from Ukraine. Since the 2014 Yazidi genocide carried out by Islamic State in northern Iraq, the number of Yazidi asylum-seekers in Germany has risen to more than 200,000. The ongoing debate within German society about deporting refugees, however, has put many asylum-seekers from the religious minority at risk of deportation. This is particularly due to some politicians arguing that the defeat of IS in 2017 has ended group-specific persecution in Iraq — a claim contested by human rights organizations. On Monday, German authorities announced the deportation of 47 Iraqis whose asylum applications had been denied. Among the more than 300,000 Iraqi refugees and migrants living in Germany, refugee organizations estimate that nearly 700 Iraqis were deported in 2024 alone, with about 10,000 currently facing the risk of deportation. Hagemann, who is also a Yazidi, told VOA the uncertainty has taken a psychological toll on many Yazidi asylum-seekers who fled Iraq due to persecution. While the exact number of deported Yazidis remains unclear, she estimated that at least five have been sent back to Iraq and the Kurdistan region. 'Those Yazidis want to build their new life and integrate, even though some of them find it hard to learn a new language because of their trauma,' Hagemann said. 'Unfortunately, most of them are not as lucky as Fawzia to be supported, and [they] decide to come to Germany illegally, where they face deportation and have been held in captivity for years.' In January 2023, the German Bundestag [parliament] passed a resolution that recognized Islamic State's crimes against Yazidis as genocide. Since then, the federal states of North Rhine-Westphalia and Schleswig-Holstein have enacted laws to protect Yazidi asylum-seekers from deportation. Hagemann argued that allowing Yazidi survivors, particularly those who have been victims of rape, to remain in Germany would provide them with a chance to heal — an opportunity, she said, they cannot find in Iraq. 'We have been able to schedule a therapy session for Fawzia on Thursday, just two days after her arrival in Germany, to enable her start a self-determining life again,' Hagemann said. Rights organizations, including Human Rights Watch, have reported that Yazidi survivors do not get adequate psychological support upon their return to Iraq. Activists from the Montreal-based Liberation of Christian and Yazidi Children of Iraq (CYCI), who assisted Saydo in relocating to Germany, stated that her return from Gaza to Iraq only marked a minor improvement in her life, as she continued to endure neglect and targeting from militants in her hometown of Sinjar. 'She kept saying, 'I have been brought from one hell to another,'' said human rights activist and CYCI member Dawood Jajju, describing Saydo's dire situation in Iraq. Activists say Saydo and her family were threatened by Iraqi militants three weeks after her return to Sinjar after she appeared in a news article in which she praised Israel for its role in taking her out of Hamas-controlled Gaza. Iraqi officials tasked to work on her case were not available to comment. Steve Maman, founder of CYCI, told VOA that Saydo was summoned several times by Iraqi authorities 'who mistakenly believe she is a Zionist and an Israeli-trained agent.' 'Fawzia did not receive any therapy at all. The country has not made any effort or gesture to help her. It seems that Yazidis are second-class citizens in their own country,' Maman said. When Islamic State attacked the Sinjar region in 2014, the group killed nearly 10,000 Yazidis and enslaved more than 6,000 of women and children. Data from the Iraqi government and the Kurdistan Region show that some 3,500 Yazidis have been rescued or freed, with some 2,600 still missing.	https://www.voanews.com/a/yazidi-woman-enslaved-by-islamic-state-relocates-to-germany-months-after-rescue/7979829.html	2025-02-18T17:29:29-08:00

Judge won't block Musk, DOGE from federal data, layoffs	WASHINGTON — A federal judge refused Tuesday to immediately block billionaire Elon Musk and the Department of Government Efficiency from accessing government data systems or participating in worker layoffs. U.S. District Judge Tanya Chutkan found that there are legitimate questions about Musk's authority but said there isn't evidence of the kind of grave legal harm that would justify a temporary restraining order. The decision came in a lawsuit filed by 14 Democratic states challenging DOGE's authority to access sensitive government data. The attorneys general argued that Musk is wielding the kind of power that the Constitution says can only be held by those who are elected or confirmed by the Senate. The Trump administration, for its part, has maintained that layoffs are coming from agency heads, and asserted that despite his public cheering of the effort, Musk isn't directly running DOGE's day-to-day operations himself. DOGE has tapped into computer systems across multiple agencies with the blessing of President Donald Trump, digging into budgets and searching for what he calls waste, fraud and abuse, even as a growing number of lawsuits allege DOGE is violating the law. Chutkan recognized the concerns of the group of states, which include New Mexico and Arizona. 'DOGE's unpredictable actions have resulted in considerable uncertainty and confusion,' she wrote. Their questions about Musk's apparent 'unchecked authority' and lack of Congressional oversight for DOGE are legitimate and they may be able to successfully argue them later. Still, at this point, it remains unclear exactly how DOGE's work will affect the states, and judges can only issue court only issue orders to block specific, immediate harms, she found. Chutkan, who was nominated by Democratic President Barack Obama, previously oversaw the now-dismissed criminal election interference case against Trump in Washington.	https://www.voanews.com/a/judge-won-t-block-musk-doge-from-federal-data-layoffs-/7979818.html	2025-02-18T16:35:52-08:00	
Trump signs order to study how to make IVF more accessible, affordable	WEST PALM BEACH, FLORIDA — U.S. President Donald Trump on Tuesday signed an executive order to study how to expand access to in vitro fertilization and make it more affordable. The order calls for policy recommendations to 'protect IVF access and aggressively reduce out-of-pocket and health plan costs for such treatments,' according to the White House. On the campaign trail, Trump called for universal coverage of IVF treatment after his Supreme Court nominees helped to overturn Roe v. Wade, leading to a wave of restrictions in Republican-led states, including some that have threatened access to IVF by trying to define life as beginning at conception. Trump, who was at his Florida residence and club Mar-a-Lago, also signed another executive order and a presidential memorandum. The second executive order outlined the oversight functions of the Office of Management and Budget, while the presidential memorandum called for more transparency from the government, according to White House staff secretary Will Scharf, who Trump called to the podium to detail the orders. The order called for 'radical transparency requirements' for the government, requiring it to detail the 'waste, fraud and abuse' that's found as the Department of Government Efficiency, overseen by Elon Musk, looks to cut government spending. DOGE has often fallen short of the administration's promises of transparency. Musk has taken questions from journalists only once since becoming Trump's most powerful adviser, and he's claimed it's illegal to name people who are working for him. Sometimes DOGE staff members have demanded access to sensitive government databases with little explanation. According to a fact sheet provided by the White House, Trump's IVF order will focus on prioritizing whether there are any current policies 'that exacerbate the cost of IVF treatments.' Last year, Trump declared public support for IVF after the Alabama Supreme Court ruled that frozen embryos can be considered children under state law. The decision, which some Republicans and conservatives cheered, touched off immediate backlash. Families 'appreciative,' says Trump On the campaign trail, IVF quickly became a talking point for Trump, who said he strongly supports its availability. In vitro fertilization offers a possible solution when a woman has trouble getting pregnant. The procedure involves retrieving her eggs and combining them in a lab dish with a man's sperm to create a fertilized embryo, which is then transferred into the woman's uterus in an attempt to create a pregnancy. IVF is done in cycles, and more than one may be required. 'I think the women and families, husbands, are very appreciative of it,' Trump said in brief remarks on the order, before he took questions on a variety of topics. Trump, who spent the morning at his golf club in West Palm Beach, Florida, spoke to reporters hours before his first joint TV interview with adviser Elon Musk airs in prime time. Trump and Musk gave their first joint interview to Sean Hannity of Fox News Channel. The interview was taped on Friday at the White House and is set to air as Musk leads Trump's effort to cut federal spending and slash the federal workforce. Musk has drawn criticism from Democrats in Congress and others for the methods he and his team at DOGE are using to cut spending, including foreign aid, and eliminate jobs across the bureaucracy. The Fox News interview also follows Musk's appearance with Trump in the Oval Office last week, when both defended Musk's approach to federal cost-cutting. In an excerpt from the interview that Fox News released on Sunday, Musk said he 'used to be adored by the left' but 'less so these days' because of the work he's doing at Trump's direction. 'They call it Trump derangement syndrome. You don't realize how real this is until you can't reason with people,' Musk said, adding that normal conversations with Democrats about the president are difficult because 'it's like they've become completely irrational.' Event celebrates 'American Exceptionalism' Trump's Mar-a-Lago Club is the setting Tuesday night for an awards program by America's Future, a conservative group led by Mike Flynn, who briefly served as national security adviser in the Republican president's first term. The program aims to preserve individual rights and promote American values and traditions, according to its website. The event, called Celebrate American Exceptionalism 2025, will honor one member from the Army, the Navy, the Marines, the Air Force and the Space Force. The event includes a poolside reception, musical performances and dinner in Mar-a-Lago's Grand Ballroom, where other award presentations are expected from a lineup that includes such names as comedian Russell Brand, singer Ted Nugent and former pro boxer Mike Tyson. It's unclear whether Trump will participate in the event.	https://www.voanews.com/a/trump-signs-order-to-study-how-to-make-ivf-more-accessible-affordable/7979778.html	2025-02-18T16:28:35-08:00

US Postal Service head to step down after 5 years	Louis DeJoy, the head of the U.S. Postal Service, intends to step down, the federal agency said Tuesday, after a nearly five-year tenure marked by the coronavirus pandemic, surges in mail-in election ballots and efforts to stem losses through cost and service cuts. In a Monday letter, Postmaster General DeJoy asked the Postal Service Board of Governors to begin looking for his successor. 'As you know, I have worked tirelessly to lead the 640,000 men and women of the Postal Service in accomplishing an extraordinary transformation,' he wrote. 'We have served the American people through an unprecedented pandemic and through a period of high inflation and sensationalized politics.' DeJoy took the helm of the Postal Service in the summer of 2020 during President Donald Trump's first term. He was a Republican donor who owned a logistics business before taking office and was the first postmaster general in nearly two decades who was not a career postal employee. DeJoy developed a 10-year plan to modernize operations and stem losses. He previously said that postal customers should get used to 'uncomfortable' rate hikes as the Postal Service seeks to stabilize its finances and become more self-sufficient. The plan calls for making the mail delivery system more efficient and less costly by consolidating mail processing centers. Critics, including members of Congress from several states, have said the first consolidations slowed service and that further consolidations could particularly hurt rural mail delivery. DeJoy has disputed that and told a U.S. House subcommittee during a contentious September hearing that the Postal Service had embarked on long-overdue investments in facilities and making other changes to create 'a Postal Service for the future' that delivered mail more quickly. DeJoy also oversaw the Postal Service during two presidential elections that saw spikes in mail-in ballots. Ahead of the 2020 presidential election, a federal judge limited one of the Postal Service's cost-cutting practices after finding it contributed to delays in mail delivery. DeJoy had restricted overtime payments for postal workers and stopped the agency's longtime practice of allowing late and extra truck deliveries in the summer of 2020. The moves reduced costs but meant some mail was left to be delivered the following day. DeJoy said in his letter that he was committed to being 'as helpful as possible in facilitating a transition.'	https://www.voanews.com/a/us-postal-service-head-to-step-down-after-5-years-/7979825.html	2025-02-18T15:48:40-08:00

Hong Kong publisher Jimmy Lai's 'time is running out,' son says	As pro-democracy publisher Jimmy Lai spoke in his defense at a Hong Kong court Tuesday, his son Sebastien Lai was in Geneva calling for the United States and other world leaders to help secure this father's release. Speaking on Tuesday at the latest hearing in his national security trial, Lai, 77, denied any intention to incite violence among protesters. He defended an opinion piece published in 2019 in the now-shuttered Apple Daily newspaper that he founded in which he suggested that pro-democracy protesters establish a leadership structure to weed out those who wished to engage in violence during protests that year. 'By saying they should choose a leadership group, [it means that] they should put down some principle or bottom line for the valiant acts which, basically, is for them to stop the violence,' Lai said in court. The British national has been standing trial for more than a year on charges of collusion with foreign forces and sedition under Hong Kong’s national security law. Lai rejects the charges, which foreign governments and press freedom groups have said are politically motivated. Hong Kong authorities deny that the trial is unfair and have previously told VOA that the government respects press freedom and the rule of law. Lai has been in solitary confinement since late 2020. Sebastien Lai raised concerns about his father’s health as he advocated for him in Geneva. 'I ask that you join my call to free Jimmy Lai and champion him for all he’s given in the hope of freedom,' the younger Lai said Monday at the annual Human Rights and Democracy summit in Geneva. When Beijing’s national security law was enacted in Hong Kong in 2020, Sebastien Lai said his father knew he would be a target. 'But he refused to leave,' he said. 'Six decades after landing on the shore of this island in pursuit of freedom, he decided to stay and stand with his fellow protesters.' Jimmy Lai was born in Guangzhou, China, and fled to Hong Kong when he was 12. He worked in a garment sweatshop before eventually founding the successful clothing brand Giordano. He later moved into media, founding Apple Daily in 1995. Both the United States and Britain have criticized Hong Kong’s case against him. During his presidential campaign, Donald Trump in October said he would '100%' get Lai released, without specifying details. Sebestien Lai said Trump’s comment gave the family 'a lot of hope.' But he cautioned that time is running out for his father, who has diabetes. The publisher’s international legal team says he isn’t receiving adequate medical care, which authorities deny. 'His body is breaking down,' Sebastien Lai told Reuters ahead of the summit. 'Time is running out for my father.' Lai’s international legal team urged global leaders to stand up for press freedom at the U.N. Human Rights Council next week. 'How the world responds will send a vital message to authoritarians across the world,' Caoilfhionn Gallagher, head of Lai’s international legal team, told Reuters. Gallagher and her team at the London law firm Doughty Street Chambers have faced significant harassment for their role defending Lai. On social media and in email, Gallagher has faced threats of death, rape and dismemberment, The Guardian reported. She has also been targeted with hundreds of attempts to hack her bank account. The Bar Council, the representative body for barristers in England and Wales, expressed concern about the harassment. Some information in this report came from Reuters.	https://www.voanews.com/a/hong-kong-publisher-jimmy-lai-s-time-is-running-out-son-says-/7979761.html	2025-02-18T14:24:40-08:00	
More than 170 migrants now detained at Guantanamo Bay	WASHINGTON — The United States has more than doubled the number of detainees — both those deemed to be a 'high threat' as well as others slated for deportation — at the U.S. naval base at Guantanamo Bay, Cuba. As of Tuesday, there were more than 120 of what the administration calls 'criminal aliens' under guard at the detention facility at Guantanamo Bay, according to a U.S. defense official. Approximately 50 other individuals are also being held at the base's migrant facility, which was being readied to hold nonviolent individuals. Separately, a second U.S. defense official told VOA that as of Monday, the U.S. military had sent a total of 13 flights of undocumented migrants to Guantanamo aboard a mix of C-17 and C-130 military cargo jets. So far, none of the detainees brought to the facilities at Guantanamo Bay have been deported to other countries. Both officials spoke to VOA on the condition of anonymity in order to discuss details of the military's deportation operation. VOA has also reached out to the Department of Homeland Security, which is spearheading the U.S. deportation efforts, as well as Immigration and Customs Enforcement, about the growing number of detainees. Last Thursday, the commander of U.S. Southern Command, which oversees operations at the naval base at Guantanamo Bay, told lawmakers there were about 68 detainees at the base's prison facility. Admiral Alvin Holsey also told lawmakers that the base's migrant facility had the capacity to hold about 2,500 nonviolent detainees. Efforts are underway to allow it house as many as 30,000 nonviolent migrants slated for deportation. Holsey said that it was too soon to determine how much it will cost to house the growing number of individuals. 'We're working with DHS to understand the flow of migrants,' he said during Thursday's hearing before the Senate Armed Services Committee. 'We're not going to go to 30,000 unless we know that migrant flow will come. So, we're waiting at this point.' Details about the growing population of detainees at the U.S. naval base in Cuba come just a day after the Department of Homeland Security unveiled what it described as a multimillion-dollar ad campaign warning migrants not to enter the U.S. illegally. 'If you are considering entering America illegally, don't even think about it,' Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem said in a video targeting an international audience. 'If you come to our country and you break our laws, we will hunt you down,' she said. 'Criminals are not welcome in the United States.' Noem, who visited the prison facility last Friday and oversaw the transfer of a third flight of detainees to the detention center, has repeatedly described the men as 'murderers and vicious gang members' from Venezuela and as 'the worst of the worst.' In one social media post, Noem said that at least one of the migrants sent to Guantanamo Bay had confessed to murder, while others were wanted for attempted murder, assault, weapons trafficking and impersonation. One official, speaking to VOA on the condition of anonymity to discuss the deportation efforts, said that all of the individuals held at Guantanamo Bay have been issued final deportation orders. But DHS has not yet provided charging documents or other details regarding the crimes the detainees are accused of committing. Last Wednesday, the American Civil Liberties Union, along with several immigration rights groups, filed a lawsuit against DHS, alleging the detainees being held at the Guantanamo Bay prison facility have been improperly denied access to lawyers. DHS has dismissed the lawsuit's allegations. 'There is a system for phone utilization to reach lawyers,' said a senior Homeland Security official in a written statement shared with VOA. 'If the AMERICAN Civil Liberties Union cares more about highly dangerous criminal aliens including murderers & vicious gang members than they do about American citizens — they should change their name,' the official added, responding to the lawsuit only on the condition of anonymity.	https://www.voanews.com/a/more-than-170-migrants-now-detained-at-guantanamo-bay/7979741.html	2025-02-18T14:23:41-08:00	
Iran charges British couple with spying	A British couple detained in Iran last month has been charged with spying, Iran's state media reported Tuesday. Britain's Foreign Office has identified the couple as Craig and Lindsay Foreman. 'The detained individuals entered the country as tourists and collected information in several provinces of the country,' reported Iran's judiciary-affiliated Mizan news agency. Iran has accused the couple of having connections with 'hostile countries.' 'We are deeply concerned by reports that two British nationals have been charged with espionage in Iran,' a British Foreign Office spokesman said Tuesday. 'We continue to raise this case directly with the Iranian authorities.' The Associated Press reported that Hugo Shorter, Britain's ambassador to Iran, has met with the couple in the southern city of Kerman, where they are jailed, with Iranian government officials in attendance. The Foreign Office said it is providing the couple with consular assistance and is in close contact with their family. The couple's family said in a statement on Saturday, after the couple's arrest, 'This unexpected turn of events has caused significant concern for our entire family, and we are deeply focused on ensuring their safety and well-being during this trying time.' The family said it is 'united on our determination to secure their safe return.' The two were traveling around the world on motorbikes, according to an AP report, which said that they crossed Armenia's border into Iran on December 30. Iran has long used Western detainees to gain concessions in negotiations with Western countries, a move Tehran denies. Some information in this report came from The Associated Press, Reuters and Agence France Presse.	https://www.voanews.com/a/iran-charges-british-couple-with-spying-/7979677.html	2025-02-18T12:53:46-08:00	
After resolutions on Sudan, DRC at African Union summit, analysts urge swift action	ABUJA, NIGERIA — Regional analysts are calling for the swift implementation of resolutions made at the recently concluded African Union (AU) Summit in Ethiopia. The summit was dominated by discussions on escalating conflicts in the eastern Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC) and Sudan, as well as concerns over the impact of U.S. aid cuts on the continent. African leaders and delegates from more than 50 countries gathered in Addis Ababa for the 38th AU Summit on Saturday and Sunday. Leaders at the summit called for dialogue to end conflicts in the DRC and Sudan and renewed calls to merge two existing peace processes — the Rwanda Process and the Nairobi Peace Process — to streamline negotiations between the DRC government and M23 rebels. Bankole Adeoye is the AU commissioner for political affairs, peace, and security, expressed concerns about the escalation of the conflict in the DRC. 'We are all very, very concerned about the risk of an open regional war over eastern DRC,' Adeoye said. 'We have reiterated the need for caution and called on the M23 rebels and their supporters to disarm and withdraw.' More than 3,000 people have been killed in clashes between government forces and the Rwanda-backed M23 rebel group. The rebels have captured large Congolese cities, including Goma and Bukavu. African leaders also condemned human rights violations caused by the nearly two-year conflict in Sudan. But security analyst Senator Iroegbu said African leaders need to match words with action this time. 'If what's happening in DRC is not well managed it will escalate,' Iroegbu said. '[It's] not just issuing a communique at the end of the meeting; it should be followed up with some strategic measures or plans to ensure that they bring some of these issues to the table and set up mediation teams and let’s look for African solutions to African problems.' Beyond security, leaders further addressed the impact of climate change and food security on the continent, while demanding reparations for centuries of slavery and colonialism. John Mahama, president of the Republic of Ghana, said the economic impact of colonialism has been profound. 'The continent lost trillions of dollars in both human and material resources due to colonial exploitation,' he said. 'Today the descendants of enslaved Africans continue to face economic disparities, social inequality, systemic discrimination and racial prejudices. Addressing these challenges [requires] more than just acknowledging them, it demands action.' African leaders also discussed the impact of U.S. aid cuts, urging the continent to focus on self-sufficiency and domestic funding for development projects. Ngozi Okonjo-Iweala, director-general of the World Trade Organization, spoke to Lagos-based Channels Television on the sidelines of the summit. 'Africa we really need to change our mindsets — access to aid I think we can think of it as a thing of the past,' she said. 'We really have to focus on two things — attracting investments and mobilizing our own domestic resources. I think that is the theme that is running through almost all the meetings here at the AU.' Many observers will be watching to see how quickly African leaders move to implement summit resolutions. But analysts warn that delays in securing peace in Sudan and Congo could lead to more casualties and prolonged instability.	https://www.voanews.com/a/analysts-urge-swift-action-after-resolutions-on-sudan-drc-at-african-union-summit-/7979599.html	2025-02-18T11:50:45-08:00	
Rubio snubs South Africa's G20 meeting amid diplomatic tensions	Johannesburg — South Africa will host a meeting of foreign ministers from the G20 group of major economies later this week, but the chief diplomat for the world’s largest economy, the U.S., is skipping it. Secretary of State Marco Rubio announced on X earlier this month that he would not attend the meeting, taking place Thursday and Friday in Johannesburg, because he objected to the meeting’s agenda, which he described as anti-American. He said South Africa was 'using G20 to promote ‘solidarity, equality, & sustainability.’ In other words: DEI and climate change. My job is to advance America’s national interests, not waste taxpayer money or coddle anti-Americanism.' DEI is short for Diversity, Equity and Inclusion, and in President Donald Trump’s first week in the White House, he signed an executive order to end DEI policies and hiring practices in the federal workforce. 'I think the whole topic of the G20 gathering is one that I don’t think we should be focused on, talking about global inclusion, equity, and these sorts of things,' Rubio later told the press. He continued by saying the forum should be focused on issues 'like terrorism and energy security and the real threats to the national security of multiple countries.' The G20 is a group of the world’s 19 major individual economies as well as the EU and African Union. This year marks the first time an African country is in the rotating presidency position of the G20. While Rubio will not attend, the South African government has confirmed the U.S. will still have a presence at the meeting, likely at a lower level. South Africa’s Department of International Relations and Cooperation responded to Rubio in a statement saying: 'Our G20 Presidency, is not confined to just climate change but also equitable treatment for nations of the Global South, ensuring an equal global system for all.' Ronald Lamola, minister of international relations and cooperation, told local TV that the meeting’s agenda had been adopted by all members of the G20 and carries on the themes from previous summits, such as the one in Brazil last year. Deteriorating relations Even before the announcement that Rubio would not be taking part in the foreign ministers’ meeting, there had been a swift deterioration in U.S.-South Africa relations under the new administration in Washington. President Trump accused South Africa’s government of engaging in land grabs and mistreating white minority Afrikaners. He cut U.S. financial assistance to the country. While the South African government did pass a controversial land reform law earlier this year, no land has been seized. The white minority is still one of the country’s most privileged communities and owns the majority of private farmland. Response from other G20 members Several other nations were quick to affirm their attendance at the meeting after Rubio said he will not attend. Those included EU members Germany, Italy and France, whose ambassadors to South Africa posted a joint video on X saying they were 'united in diversity' and shared the South African government’s democratic values. Russia also confirmed Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov will attend. 'The priorities stated by the South African presidency are designed to encourage economic growth, reduce inequality and imbalances, and ensure equitable access to financing for countries in the Global South.,' said Russian foreign ministry spokesperson Maria Zakharova. China likewise confirmed its commitment to the meeting, with ambassador to South Africa Wu Peng meeting foreign minister Lamola just after Rubio’s announcement and posting on X: 'I also expressed China's readiness to support South Africa's G20 Presidency.' Last week, Chinese foreign ministry spokesman Guo Jiakun, said in a press briefing, 'China stands ready to work with all parties to make this meeting a productive one, and send a strong message of supporting multilateralism, strengthening solidarity and cooperation, and jointly responding to global challenges,' he said. Analysts weigh in Political analysts said Rubio’s absence could provide space for countries hostile to the U.S. to advance their agendas. 'Will we see the increase of countries like Russia and China pushing their lines, their issues, their perspectives in the absence of the US? That’s entirely possible,' Steven Gruzd, from the South African Institute of International Affairs, told VOA. Brooks Spector, a retired U.S. diplomat, said Rubio’s boycott of the meeting was 'a serious misstep.' 'You get to make your points at a meeting, boycotting it simply means your voice is not heard,' he said. 'Calling the meeting 'anti-American' is a misunderstanding of the nature of bilateral, international and multi-lateral discussions.' However, he said he expected Trump would likely still attend the major G20 summit in South Africa in November. In December, the U.S. will take on the presidency of the G20.	https://www.voanews.com/a/rubio-snubs-south-africa-s-g20-meeting-amid-diplomatic-tensions/7979557.html	2025-02-18T11:26:58-08:00	
Pakistan set to host first major cricket event in three decades	ISLAMABAD — Pakistan is ready to host the International Cricket Council Champions Trophy 2025 on Wednesday, with eight teams coming together for a major cricketing event in the country for the first time in three decades. Pakistan last hosted a men’s Cricket World Cup in 1996 under the International Cricket Council. The Champions Trophy will see players from Afghanistan, Australia, Bangladesh, England, India, New Zealand Pakistan, and South Africa compete over almost three weeks, with the final scheduled for March 9. All the teams except India will play in three stadiums across Pakistan. All matches involving India will be staged in Dubai, United Arab Emirates, after the Indian cricket board refused to send the team to the archrival country, citing security concerns. Afghanistan’s cricket team faced boycott calls from politicians in England and South Africa, who did not want their cricket boards to play the team because of the Afghan Taliban’s severe restrictions on women’s mobility, education and ability to work. The cricket series begins in Pakistan’s biggest metropolis, Karachi, with the host team playing New Zealand. Long wait for this opportunity International cricket dried up in Pakistan after a 2009 attack on the Sri Lankan national team in Lahore injured six players. Six Pakistani police officers and two passersby were killed. The incident deprived Pakistan of the chance to host the 2009 Champions Trophy and the 2011 Men’s Cricket World Cup. International cricket returned with Zimbabwe’s visit in 2015. Since 2019, several major foreign teams have played in Pakistan. For the nation of cricket lovers, attending a large event at home after more than a decade is nothing short of a dream come true. 'It’s the biggest event for us since 2009, so we are very excited,' said Mohsin Ali. Ali told VOA he paid just over $10 for a ticket to see Pakistan face Bangladesh on Feb. 27 in Rawalpindi, near the capital, Islamabad. 'Pakistani team would play overseas, and we would watch it on TV, which wasn’t much fun,' said Ubaid Hassan, who was a child when international teams shunned Pakistan. Hassan, a captain of the cricket team in his village, has tickets to two matches. Tight security for the event Pakistan is deploying almost 20,000 police officials and personnel across Karachi, Lahore and Rawalpindi for security on game days, with snipers deployed on buildings surrounding the stadiums. The security situation remains poor in Pakistan with near daily deadly militant attacks in the northwestern Khyber Pakhtunkhwa and southwestern Balochistan provinces. However, the country’s eastern province of Punjab and the southern province of Sindh, where the matches will be played, remain largely calm. Still, in Karachi, the capital of Sindh, paramilitary troops and the military will be on standby to respond to security emergencies during the event. Players are receiving state guest-level security. That means a heavy police contingent at hotels where teams are staying, with their travel routes cleared of all traffic. Only personnel with security clearances are allowed to interact with them. Muhammad Waqas, deputy inspector general of operations for the Punjab police, told VOA that since the 2009 attack, 'sports security and security of international events has become very important for us.' 'Even the slightest administrative lapse will cause embarrassment at a very large level, and if we do a good job and manage things efficiently, the same positive impression will go to a billion odd people,' Waqas said. 'That is why it’s extremely important and is being planned and monitored at the highest level.' Fans coming to the stadium will go through several layers of security, including metal detectors and pat downs. Each ticket bears the name and national identity card number of the buyer. Could be good for nation's image While it’s not clear how many visas have been issued to foreign fans, cricket experts in Pakistan say the event will help improve the country’s image, which has suffered partly because of a lack of international exposure. 'When you don’t have tourists, then people will not know how your country is and people will keep thinking poorly of Muslims and Pakistanis,' said Tauqir Zia, former chairman of the Pakistan Cricket Board. Although India’s absence from Pakistan’s grounds is a disappointment for many Pakistani cricket lovers who wanted to see the sport’s biggest rivalry play out at home, some say the arrival of other cricketing powers is a vote of confidence. 'Six countries coming to play here is a very big victory for Pakistan. If India doesn’t come, it’s not stopping cricket. The game is still happening,' said cricket journalist Umar Farooq. The final will be played in Pakistan, unless India qualifies to play the last match, in which case the event will take place in Dubai. Pakistan has spent millions of dollars in recent months to upgrade the stadiums in Karachi, Lahore and Rawalpindi. Former Pakistani cricketer Mushtaq Ahmed said he hopes the arrival of heavyweights will usher in a new era for international cricket in the country. 'It’s the first step,' said Ahmed, who is a spin bowling coach for Bangladesh. 'I am very hopeful that this will open more doors.'

Hamas says it will release 10 more hostages, six of them living	A top Hamas leader says that the militant group plans to release six more living Israeli hostages from their Gaza captivity on Saturday and the bodies of four others on Thursday. Hamas leader Khalil al-Hayya made the surprise announcement in a recorded statement Tuesday, an apparent response to the Israeli decision to allow long-requested mobile homes and construction equipment into the Gaza Strip. The six living hostages are the last set to be freed under the first phase of the ceasefire that expires in early March, with Hamas believed to be holding about 70 more captives, half of them living. Four more bodies of hostages are set to be returned next week. So far during the ceasefire, Hamas has released 24 hostages, and Israel freed more than 1,000 Palestinian prisoners. The warring sides have yet to negotiate the second and more difficult phase of their truce, in which Hamas says it will only release the remaining hostages in exchange for a lasting halt to the fighting and a full Israeli troop withdrawal from the narrow territory along the Mediterranean Sea. Meanwhile, Israel has not backed off its goal, supported by the United States, of eradicating any military or governing role for Hamas in Gaza. Israeli Foreign Minister Gideon Saar said Tuesday that Israel was ready to open negotiations on the details of the second phase. Those talks were supposed to have started two weeks ago, according to the ceasefire deal. In his remarks, Hayya said the 'Bibas family' would be included in the handover of the four bodies, apparently referring to Shiri Bibas and her two young sons, Ariel and Kfir, who for many Israelis embody the captives' plight. Israel has not confirmed their deaths, and Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu’s office urged the public not to distribute 'photos, names and rumors.' Israel has said it was gravely concerned about the Bibas family, while Hamas said they were killed in an Israeli airstrike early in the war. Yarden Bibas, the husband and father, was kidnapped separately and released this month. Kfir, who was 9 months old at the time, was the youngest hostage taken in Hamas' shock Oct. 7, 2023, attack on Israel that triggered 15 months of fighting. Video footage of the abduction showed Shiri swaddling her redheaded boys in a blanket and being whisked away by armed men. 'In recent hours we have been shaken after the Hamas spokesman's announcement was published about the return of our Shiri, Ariel and Kfir this coming Thursday as part of the movement to release kidnapped civilians,' the family said in a statement. 'It is important for us to say that we are aware of the reports but have not yet received an official update on the matter.' 'Until we receive certainty, our journey will not end,' the family said. An Israeli official said Netanyahu had agreed to allow the mobile homes and construction equipment into Gaza to accelerate the hostages' release. Hamas last week threatened to hold up the release of more hostages, citing the mobile home issue and other alleged violations of the truce. Israel is expected to continue releasing hundreds of Palestinian prisoners, including many serving life sentences for deadly attacks, in exchange for the hostages. Israelis and Palestinians marked 500 days of the war on Monday. Hamas killed about 1,200 people in the October 2023 attack and took about 250 as hostages. More than half the captives have been released in ceasefire agreements and other deals, while eight were rescued in military operations. Israel's air and ground war killed more than 48,000 Palestinians, mostly women and children, according to Gaza's Health Ministry, which does not say how many were combatants. The Israeli military, without offering evidence, says the death toll includes 17,000 militants. The offensive destroyed vast areas of Gaza and displaced most of its population of 2.3 million. Meanwhile, Israeli troops remained in some areas of southern Lebanon on Tuesday, despite a deadline for their withdrawal as part of a ceasefire with the militant group Hezbollah. Israel withdrew from some villages in the region, but said it was leaving forces in place in five positions that it said were necessary to protect parts of northern Israel. A joint statement from Lebanon’s president, prime minister and parliament speaker on Tuesday called on the U.N. Security Council to demand Israel’s immediate withdrawal. The ceasefire agreement called for Israel to withdraw by late January, with Hezbollah also moving away from the border and U.N. peacekeepers deploying in the vacated buffer zone along with the Lebanese troops. An extension pushed the deadline to Tuesday. The U.N. envoy for Lebanon, Jeanine Hennis-Plasschaert, and the head of the U.N. peacekeeping mission and force commander in Lebanon, Lieutenant General Aroldo Lazaro, said in a joint statement that another delay in implementing the ceasefire deal 'is not what we hoped would happen.' Katz said the military 'will remain in a buffer zone in Lebanon with five control positions and will continue to act forcefully and uncompromisingly against any Hezbollah violation.' The ceasefire, reached in late November, halted more than a year of fighting in Lebanon, which had intensified in the months ahead of the truce, with Israeli troops conducting ground operations inside of Lebanon and repeated airstrikes targeting Hezbollah. The militants launched a cross-border rocket campaign in October 2023, attacking northern Israel a day after Hamas attacked southern Israel. Hamas and Hezbollah have been designated by the United States and others as terrorist organizations.

Pakistan claims 30 militants killed near Afghan border	ISLAMABAD — Pakistan reported Tuesday that its security forces killed at least 30 Islamist insurgents during clashes in a volatile region bordering Afghanistan. A military statement attributed the casualties to an overnight 'intelligence-based' operation against a militant location in the tribal district of South Waziristan. The slain people were referred to as 'khwarij,' a local term employed by the government to identify members of the banned Tehrik-i-Taliban Pakistan, or TTP, militant group. The TTP has not commented on the reported clashes, and it is not possible to verify government claims through independent sources in the violence-hit district. The Waziristan region and nearby districts along the Afghan border face almost daily militant raids targeting Pakistani troops, police officers and various government entities, with the TTP claiming responsibility for most of it. The violence has killed dozens of Pakistani security personnel within the first two months of 2025 alone. Military officials claim that retaliatory counterinsurgency operations have killed scores of TTP operatives, including key militant commanders, in recent days. Islamabad alleges that the TTP, listed as a global terrorist organization by the United Nations, uses havens and training camps in Afghanistan to carry out cross-border terrorist attacks. The Taliban government in Kabul, which is not recognized by any country, rejects Pakistani allegations. The latest report by the U.N. Analytical Support and Sanctions Monitoring Team, released last week, highlighted Pakistan's concerns, stating that the TTP has 'significantly increased' its attacks in the country and from Afghan territory. The report noted that Kabul 'continued to provide the TTP with logistical and operational space and financial support.' It added that the militant group 'established new training centers' in the Afghan provinces of Kunar, Nangarhar, Khost and Paktika, 'while enhancing recruitment within TTP cadres, including from the Afghan Taliban.' The Taliban government dismissed the U.N. findings as 'inaccurate' and contrary to reality.	https://www.voanews.com/a/pakistan-claims-30-militants-killed-near-afghan-border/7979417.html	2025-02-18T10:24:47-08:00	
Pope accepts resignation of Canadian bishop accused of sexual abuse	OTTAWA — Pope Francis on Tuesday said he had accepted the resignation of a Canadian bishop who has been named in a class-action lawsuit against the church that alleges sexual assault. The pope did not give a reason for replacing Jean-Pierre Blais, the 75-year-old bishop of Baie-Comeau in the predominantly French-speaking province of Quebec, and the diocese said the resignation was not linked to the allegations. He also named a replacement: Reverend Pierre Charland, 62, currently a leading member of Canada's Roman Catholic Franciscan order. In a statement, the pope noted that any bishop who turns 75 is automatically requested to offer his resignation. The pope makes a decision on whether to accept the offer 'after he has examined all the circumstances,' the statement said. Blais is mentioned in a list of sexual predators filed as part of a victims' class action against the Archdiocese of Quebec. He has denied any wrongdoing. 'The nomination of a new bishop ... is not linked to the allegations against Bishop Blais,' the Diocese of Baie-Comeau said in an emailed statement, noting the church's policy of requiring all those who hit 75 to offer their resignation. Blais would not be speaking to the media, it added.	https://www.voanews.com/a/pope-accepts-resignation-of-canadian-bishop-accused-of-sexual-abuse/7979365.html	2025-02-18T09:53:05-08:00	
Men, women experience near daily floggings in Afghanistan	ISLAMABAD — Afghanistan’s Taliban authorities publicly flogged six individuals on Tuesday after convicting them of offenses such as adultery, sodomy and eloping. The Supreme Court of the de facto Afghan rulers announced that the punishments were carried out in southeastern Khost and northern Faryab provinces and that the individuals received 39 lashes each, along with varying prison sentences of up to 18 months. Since the beginning of February, at least 61 Afghans, including nine women, have been flogged in sports stadiums packed with ordinary citizens and Taliban officials from the judiciary and administration, according to data from the top court. The individuals were accused of adultery, eloping, sodomy and robbery, with many of them also receiving prison sentences ranging from several months to six years. The United Nations and human rights organizations have condemned corporal punishment in Afghanistan as a violation of international law, urging the Taliban to immediately cease the practice. Despite global outcry, hundreds of Afghan men and women have faced public flogging, and several have been executed under the Taliban’s interpretation of retributive justice, known as qisas. Last week, reclusive Taliban Supreme Leader Hibatullah Akhundzada defended his governance, including the criminal justice system, saying they were rooted in divine commands. 'The esteemed supreme leader stated that every decree he issues is based on consultation with scholars and derived from the Quran and Hadith [sayings of Islam’s Prophet Muhammad] and represents commands of Allah,' a government spokesman quoted Akhundzada as telling a gathering in Kandahar. Akhundzada, who is based in the southern Afghan city of Kandahar, has issued numerous decrees in accordance with his stringent interpretation of Islamic law and principles, resulting in restrictions on freedom of speech and female access to education and employment in the country. The Taliban leader has banned girls’ education beyond the sixth grade and blocked many women from public and private sector employment. Afghan women cannot travel by road or air without a chaperone and cannot visit public places such as parks, gyms or beauty salons. The U.N. Assistance Mission in Afghanistan emphasized again on X Tuesday that restrictions on women 'are causing long-term damage' in the impoverished, war-torn country. The chief prosecutor of the Hague-based International Criminal Court last month announced he was seeking arrest warrants for Akhundzada and the Taliban chief justice, holding them 'criminally responsible for persecuting Afghan girls and women.' The Taliban dismissed the warrants as 'devoid of just legal basis, duplicitous in nature and politically motivated.' No country has recognized the Taliban as the legitimate governing authority of the country, primarily due to the harsh treatment of Afghan women.	https://www.voanews.com/a/men-women-experience-near-daily-floggings-in-afghanistan/7979256.html	2025-02-18T08:53:25-08:00	
Rubio: US looks for 'fair, sustainable' end to Russian war on Ukraine	U.S. Secretary of State Marco Rubio said Tuesday that the United States is working toward a 'fair' and 'sustainable' solution to end Russia’s three-year war on Ukraine, but that both Moscow and Kyiv would have to make concessions to achieve peace. Rubio offered his assessment after he and other key U.S. officials met for several hours in Saudi Arabia with Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov and his aides in a first effort toward ending the war and improving the contentious Washington-Moscow relationship. 'The goal is to bring an end to this conflict in a way that's fair, enduring, sustainable and acceptable to all parties involved,' Rubio told reporters, although no Ukrainian or European officials were at the table for the talks. Rubio said he was 'convinced' that Moscow was willing to engage in a 'serious process' to end the war, which Russia started with a full-scale invasion of its neighbor three years ago next week. Tens of thousands of Russian and Ukrainian soldiers, along with Ukrainian civilians, have been killed in the fighting, Europe’s worst conflict since World War II. The U.S. and Russia agreed to 'appoint respective high-level teams to begin working on a path to ending the conflict in Ukraine as soon as possible,' State Department spokeswoman Tammy Bruce said in a statement. Bruce characterized the meeting as 'an important step forward' toward peace. Rubio said Ukraine and European nations would have to be involved in talks on ending the war. He said that if the war is halted, the U.S. would have 'extraordinary opportunities … to partner' with Russia on trade and other global issues. 'The key to unlock that is the end to this conflict,' he said. National security adviser Mike Waltz and Middle East envoy Steve Witkoff joined Rubio for the talks. Waltz told reporters that negotiations to end the fighting will focus on territory and security guarantees for both Ukraine and Russia. 'This needs to be a permanent end to the war and not a temporary end, as we've seen in the past,' Waltz said. Russia now controls about a fifth of Ukraine’s internationally recognized 2014 territory. Moscow controls the Crimean Peninsula that it unilaterally annexed in 2014, along with a large portion of eastern Ukraine pro-Russian separatists captured in subsequent fighting and lands the Russian military have taken over since the 2022 invasion. As the invasion started, Moscow hoped for a quick takeover of all of Ukraine. But with stiff Ukrainian resistance, the war instead evolved into a grinding ground conflict and daily aerial bombardments by each side. Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy has long demanded that his country’s 2014 boundaries be restored, but U.S. officials have said that is unrealistic, as was Kyiv’s long-sought goal of joining NATO, the West’s main military alliance, as part of a negotiated peace settlement. Zelenskyy has said it will not agree to a U.S.-Russian dictated settlement of the war. He postponed a trip to Saudi Arabia that had been scheduled for this week, citing the fact that officials from his country were not invited to Tuesday’s U.S.-Russia talks. The Ukrainian leader suggested that he wanted to avoid his visit being linked to the talks and rescheduled the trip for March 10. Zelenskyy is due to host the U.S. envoy for Ukraine, Keith Kellogg, for talks on Wednesday. Bruce said the Rubio-Lavrov talks, the first extensive discussions between the two countries in more than three years, also laid the groundwork for more talks aside from the negotiations to end the war. She said the two sides would 'establish a consultation mechanism to address irritants to our bilateral relationship with the objective of taking steps necessary to normalize the operation of our respective diplomatic missions.' Bruce said the U.S. and Russia would 'lay the groundwork for future cooperation on matters of mutual geopolitical interest and historic economic and investment opportunities' once the war is ended. The U.S.-Russia engagement sparked concern among European leaders who in recent days have highlighted the need for Ukraine to be involved in discussions about its future, and for European nations to play a role in what they also see as a key development for their own security. French President Emmanuel Macron convened a group of European leaders for a Monday session in Paris, where they discussed boosting defense spending and potential security guarantees for Ukraine. There was division on the idea of deploying peacekeepers to Ukraine as part of a potential end to the war, with governments such as Britain and Sweden expressing openness to the idea while German Chancellor Olaf Scholz said that discussion was premature. Some information for this story came from The Associated Press, Agence France-Presse and Reuters.	https://www.voanews.com/a/rubio-us-looks-for-fair-sustainable-end-to-russian-war-on-ukraine/7979267.html	2025-02-18T08:48:09-08:00	
Uganda under fire for detention of opposition leader	NAIROBI, KENYA — Human rights activists, lawyers and medical practitioners in East Africa called on the Ugandan government Tuesday to release opposition leader Kizza Besigye, who has spent the past three months in military detention. Besigye, who was abducted while on a trip to Kenya in November, was recently rushed to a hospital after going on a hunger strike to protest his imprisonment. Reading a statement on behalf of 12 organizations in Nairobi, the head of one of the groups, Khalid Hussein, said they condemn the militarization of justice and escalating government repression in Uganda. 'We call on Ugandan authorities to immediately release Kizza Besigye, Hajj Obeid Lutale, Eron Kiiza and others unlawfully detained,' Hussein said. 'The abduction and rendition of Kizza Besigye and Hajj Obeid Lutale blatantly violated international human rights law and the principles of extradition treaties.' A politician who ran against Ugandan President Yoweri Museveni in three elections, Besigye was abducted by unidentified men while on a visit to Kenya in November and taken to Luzira Maximum Security Prison in the Ugandan capital, Kampala. He appeared before a military court, where former Kenyan justice minister and lawyer Martha Karua defended him. He is charged with treason, illegal possession of a firearm and threatening national security. Last week, the 68-year-old fell ill and was taken to a hospital after going on a hunger strike to protest his arrest and the charges. Ugandan lawyer Andrew Karamagi said the treatment of Besigye and other Museveni critics exposes ongoing rights violations in his country. 'The medical union has spoken out and given a scientific medical analysis of Dr. Besigye's health, which is in serious jeopardy,' he said. 'Citizens who have attempted to protest this have as well been detained, and I should add, violently arrested, as some of you might have seen. This is a culmination of years of human rights abuses [and] disregard for the constitution.' On Jan. 31, the Ugandan Supreme Court ruled that the trial of civilians in a military court is unconstitutional and that such cases must be transferred to ordinary courts. But the government rejected the ruling, saying such trials protect the country from criminals. In a statement posted on X, Museveni called on those demanding the release of Besigye to instead demand a quick trial to establish the facts. Otherwise, he said, such demands promote insecurity, which is dangerous for the country. Amnesty International East African regional researcher Roland Ebole said a united voice against human rights violations can help end abuses. 'We are having cross-border repression,' Ebole said. 'We are having a transnational repression where we are seeing abductions happening beyond borders. And these abductions are happening sanctioned or blessed by presidents, blessed by heads of state. And they are taking advantage of the fact that on the ground, we are not as united against them.' Rights groups say they will circulate petitions and reach out to other nations and organizations to demand the release of unlawfully detained Ugandans. The 12 organizations that took part in today’s demonstration have called for people to join a march on Friday to the Ugandan embassy in Nairobi and the parliament building to present a petition for justice and the release of Besigye and those detained alongside him.	https://www.voanews.com/a/uganda-under-fire-for-detention-of-opposition-leader/7979156.html	2025-02-18T08:03:11-08:00	
After Toronto plane crash, Delta says 19 of 21 passengers released from hospitals	Delta Air Lines said on Tuesday that 19 of the 21 passengers transported to local hospitals after a Toronto plane crash a day earlier have been released, as officials continue a probe into why the regional jet flipped over upon landing. Investigators from Canada's Transportation Safety Board (TSB) are leading the probe into why the CRJ900 aircraft operated by Delta Air Lines' Endeavor Air subsidiary went belly-up on Monday at Toronto's Pearson Airport. It's not yet clear what happened to Flight DL4819 from Minneapolis-St. Paul International Airport. Air crashes are usually caused by multiple factors. The 16-year-old CRJ900, made by Canada's Bombardier and powered by GE Aerospace engines, can seat up to 90 people. At least one of the two wings was no longer attached to the plane, video showed after the accident. Toronto Pearson Airport said earlier on Monday it was dealing with high winds and frigid temperatures as airlines attempted to catch up with missed flights after a weekend snowstorm dumped more than 22 centimeters (8.6 inches) of snow at the airport. The Delta plane touched down in Toronto at 2:13 p.m. (1913 GMT) after an 86-minute flight and came to rest near the intersection of runway 23 and runway 15, FlightRadar24 data showed. The weather at the time of the crash indicated a 'gusting crosswind and blowing snow,' the flight tracking website said.	https://www.voanews.com/a/after-toronto-plane-crash-delta-says-19-of-21-passengers-released-from-hospitals-/7979157.html	2025-02-18T08:01:11-08:00	
Uganda discharges last Ebola patients; No new deaths from contagious virus reported	KAMPALA — Uganda discharged on Tuesday the last eight patients who recovered from Ebola, health authorities reported, and there were no other positive cases in the outbreak declared last month. World Health Organization described the recoveries as a milestone that 'reflects the power of Uganda's quick and coordinated response.' Most of the Ebola patients were treated at the main referral facility in the Ugandan capital, Kampala. The lone Ebola victim was a male nurse who died the day before the outbreak was declared in Kampala on Jan. 30. His relatives are among those later hospitalized with Ebola. Tracing contacts is key to stemming the spread of Ebola, which manifests as a viral hemorrhagic fever. Ugandan officials documented at least 265 contacts, and at least 90 of them have completed a period of quarantine during which they were monitored for signs of Ebola, Health Minister Jane Ruth Aceng told reporters in Kampala. There are no approved vaccines for the Sudan strain of Ebola in Uganda's outbreak. But authorities have launched a clinical study to further test the safety and efficacy of a trial vaccine as part of measures to stop the spread of Ebola. The last outbreak of Ebola in Uganda, which began in September 2022, killed at least 55 people by the time it was declared over four months later. Ebola is spread by contact with the bodily fluids of an infected person or contaminated materials. Symptoms include fever, vomiting, diarrhea, muscle pain and at times internal and external bleeding. Scientists suspect that the first person infected in an Ebola outbreak acquires the virus through contact with an infected animal or eating its raw meat. Ebola was discovered in 1976 in two simultaneous outbreaks in South Sudan and Congo, where it occurred in a village near the Ebola River, after which the disease is named.	https://www.voanews.com/a/uganda-discharges-the-last-ebola-patients-no-new-deaths-from-contagious-virus-reported-/7979160.html	2025-02-18T07:59:25-08:00	
Leonard Peltier leaves prison after Biden commuted sentence in killing of FBI agents	SUMTERVILLE, FLORIDA — Native American activist Leonard Peltier was released from a Florida prison on Tuesday, weeks after then-President Joe Biden angered law enforcement officials by commuting his life sentence in the 1975 killings of two FBI agents. For nearly half a century, Peltier's imprisonment has symbolized systemic injustice for Native Americans across the country who believe in his innocence. The decision to release the 80-year-old to home confinement was celebrated by supporters. 'He represents every person who's been roughed up by a cop, profiled, had their children harassed at school,' said Nick Estes, a professor of American Indian Studies at the University of Minnesota and a member of the Lower Brule Sioux Tribe who advocated for Peltier's release. But the move just before Biden left office also prompted criticism from those who say Peltier is guilty, including former FBI Director Christopher Wray, who called him 'a remorseless killer' in a private letter to Biden obtained by The Associated Press. 'Granting Peltier any relief from his conviction or sentence is wholly unjustified and would be an affront to the rule of law,' Wray wrote. The commutation was not a pardon for crimes committed, something Peltier's advocates have hoped for since he has always maintained his innocence. Peltier left the prison Tuesday morning in an SUV, according to a prison official. He didn't stop to speak with reporters or his supporters outside the gates. One of his attorneys, Jenipher Jones, said Peltier was looking forward to going home. 'We're so excited for this moment,' Jones said. 'He is in good spirits. He has the soul of a warrior.' After being released from USP Coleman, a high-security prison, Peltier planned to return to North Dakota, where he is expected to celebrate with friends and family on Wednesday. Biden commuted Peltier's sentence Jan. 20, noting he had spent most of his life in prison and was now in poor health. 'We never thought he would get out,' Ray St. Clair, a member of the White Earth Band of the Minnesota Chippewa Tribe, said shortly before Peltier's release. 'It shows you should never give up hope. We can take this repairing the damage that was done. This is a start.' Peltier, an enrolled member of the Turtle Mountain Band of Chippewa Indians in North Dakota, was active in the American Indian Movement, which beginning in the 1960s fought for Native American treaty rights and tribal self-determination. The group grabbed headlines in 1969 when activists occupied the former prison island of Alcatraz in the San Francisco Bay, and again in 1972, when they presented presidential candidates with a list of demands including the restoration of tribal land. After they were ignored, they seized the headquarters of the Bureau of Indian Affairs. From then on, the group was subject to FBI surveillance and harassment under a covert program that sought to disrupt activism and was exposed in 1975. Peltier's conviction stemmed from a confrontation that year on the Oglala Sioux Indian Reservation in Pine Ridge, South Dakota, in which FBI agents Jack Coler and Ronald Williams were killed. According to the FBI, the agents were there to serve arrest warrants for robbery and assault with a dangerous weapon. Prosecutors maintained at trial that Peltier shot both agents in the head at point-blank range. Peltier acknowledged being present and firing a gun at a distance, but he said he fired in self-defense. A woman who claimed to have seen Peltier shoot the agents later recanted her testimony, saying it had been coerced. He was convicted of two counts of first-degree murder and given two consecutive life sentences. Two other movement members, co-defendants Robert Robideau and Dino Butler, were acquitted on the grounds of self-defense. Peltier was denied parole as recently as July and was not eligible to be considered for it again until 2026. 'Leonard Peltier's release is the right thing to do given the serious and ongoing human rights concerns about the fairness of his trial, his nearly 50 years behind bars, his health and his age,' Paul O'Brien, executive director with Amnesty International USA, said in a statement before Peltier's release. 'While we welcome his release from prison, he should not be restricted to home confinement.' Prominent Native American groups like the National Congress of the American Indian have called for Peltier's release for decades, and Amnesty International considered him a political prisoner. Prominent supporters over the years included South African Archbishop Desmond Tutu, civil rights icon Coretta Scott King, actor and director Robert Redford, and musicians Pete Seeger, Harry Belafonte and Jackson Browne. Generations of Indigenous activists and leaders lobbied multiple presidents to pardon Peltier. Former Interior Secretary Deb Haaland, a member of the Pueblo of Laguna and the first Native American to hold the secretary's position, praised Biden's decision. 'I am grateful that Leonard can now go home to his family,' she said Jan. 20 in a post on X. 'I applaud President Biden for this action and understanding what this means to Indian Country.' As a young child, Peltier was taken from his family and sent to a boarding school. Thousands of Indigenous children over decades faced the same fate, and were in many cases subjected to systemic physical, psychological and sexual abuse. 'He hasn't really had a home since he was taken away to boarding school,' said Nick Tilsen, who has been advocating for Peltier's release since he was a teen and is CEO of NDN Collective, an Indigenous-led advocacy group based in South Dakota. 'So he is excited to be at home and paint and have grandkids running around.'	https://www.voanews.com/a/leonard-peltier-leaves-prison-after-biden-commuted-his-sentence-in-the-killing-of-two-fbi-agents/7979095.html	2025-02-18T07:20:30-08:00	
Inclusivity, economic woes, and security challenge Syria post-Assad	Syria’s top diplomat says the country has gained freedom while managing to avoid another civil war, but observers point to major challenges ahead, such as the dire economy, uncertain security, and including Syria's diverse population in decision-making and governance. Syrian Foreign Minister Asaad al-Shibani told the Munich Security Conference last weekend that the country’s new leadership will set in place a government that reflects the will of the people. 'The Syrian people freed themselves by themselves. We are now putting the steps and principles to have a system that represents the people to be Syrian-led and Syria-owned. The dictatorship will not be repeated again,' he said. Al-Shibani said the country’s Islamist interim leaders want 'to bring the whole Syrian society with us to prevent any actions that will break this stability and our achievement.' Bassam Said Ishak is president of the Syriac National Council of Syria, based in northeast Syria and representing Syriac Christians. He told VOA it is important for Christians and all minorities in a post-Assad government to be represented and respected. Ishak spoke about a national dialogue conference scheduled for next month. 'My worry is that they wind up with a conference that it does not magnify the real voices of these diverse Syrians. That’s serious because this has been the traditional way. Assad did it this way. We just need a viable representation of everybody, whether it’s a Kurd, Syriac, Druze, Alawi, Ismaili. We just need to hear these voices. We need to hear people who are different, of different opinion and think of real solutions,' he said. Syrian American lawyer Dima Moussa, who is a member of the Syrian National Coalition, an organization that promotes constitutional reforms, said the caretaker government is applying the Islamist principles it enforced when it ruled just Idlib province to the rest of the country. She told the Washington-based Arab Center recently the interim leaders have 'not yet completely come out of that mentality,' but she expressed optimism for the future. 'Inclusivity is probably one of the most important issues on the table today. And if it is not carefully and diligently worked on, especially at the national conference stage, it can set up for the reoccurrence and failure of many problems in the future. There have been some positive steps. They’re getting lost amid the hardships of the living conditions and some incidents in some of the more sensitive areas that historically had sectarian tensions which were amplified during the last 14 years,' said Moussa. Some observers are concerned about a lack of clarity on how the new government will attempt to heal the still-divided country. Questions remain over Syria’s future relations with Russia and Iran, and stalwart Assad supporters, as it pursues reintegration in the Arab fold. Meanwhile, Syria’s economy is in tatters after nearly 14 years of civil war, widespread corruption under the Assad regime and sanctions by the West, including on its banking sector. U.N. Special Envoy for Syria Geir Pedersen told the Munich Security Conference the Syrian interim government faces 'enormous humanitarian challenges' as 17 million refugees and internally displaced people try to return home. 'They need to see there if a future in Syria, and they need to see it quickly,' Pedersen warned.	https://www.voanews.com/a/inclusivity-economic-woes-and-security-challenge-syria-post-assad/7979055.html	2025-02-18T06:54:15-08:00	
Social Security head steps down over DOGE access of recipient information: AP sources	Washington — The Social Security Administration's acting commissioner has stepped down from her role at the agency over Department of Government Efficiency requests to access Social Security recipient information, according to two people familiar with the official's departure who were not authorized to discuss the matter publicly. Acting Commissioner Michelle King's departure from the agency over the weekend — after more than 30 years of service — was initiated after King refused to provide DOGE staffers at the SSA with access to sensitive information, the people said Monday. The White House has replaced her as acting commissioner with Leland Dudek, who currently works at the SSA, the people said. White House spokesperson Harrison Fields released a statement Monday night saying: 'President Trump has nominated the highly qualified and talented Frank Bisignano to lead the Social Security Administration, and we expect him to be swiftly confirmed in the coming weeks. In the meantime, the agency will be led by a career Social Security anti-fraud expert as the acting commissioner.' Fields added, 'President Trump is committed to appointing the best and most qualified individuals who are dedicated to working on behalf of the American people, not to appease the bureaucracy that has failed them for far too long.' King's exit from the administration is one of several departures of high-ranking officials concerned about DOGE staffers' potential unlawful access to private taxpayer information. DOGE has accessed Treasury payment systems and is attempting to access Internal Revenue Service databases. Since Republican President Donald Trump has retaken the White House, his billionaire adviser Elon Musk has rapidly burrowed deep into federal agencies while avoiding public scrutiny of his work through the DOGE group. Nancy Altman, president of Social Security Works, an advocacy group for the preservation of Social Security benefits, said of DOGE's efforts that 'there is no way to overstate how serious a breach this is. And my understanding is that it has already occurred.' 'The information collected and securely held by the Social Security Administration is highly sensitive,' she said. 'SSA has data on everyone who has a Social Security number, which is virtually all Americans, everyone who has Medicare, and every low-income American who has applied for Social Security’s means-tested companion program, Supplemental Security Income.' 'If there is an evil intent to punish perceived enemies, someone could erase your earnings record, making it impossible to collect the Social Security and Medicare benefits you have earned.' The future of Social Security has become a top political issue and was a major point of contention in the 2024 election. About 72.5 million people, including retirees, disabled people and children, receive Social Security benefits.	https://www.voanews.com/a/social-security-head-steps-down-over-doge-access-of-recipient-information-ap-sources-/7978978.html	2025-02-18T05:55:09-08:00	
Vietnam parliament approves radical government cost-cutting drive	Hanoi, Vietnam — Vietnam will cut one in five public sector jobs and slash billions of dollars from government budgets, after the country's rubber-stamp parliament on Tuesday gave the go-ahead to a radical streamlining drive. The reform are creating unease in a communist country where working for the state long meant a job for life. Described as 'a revolution' by senior officials, the drive will see the number of government ministries and agencies slashed from 30 to 22. The National Assembly voted to pass the government's organizational structure, a statement on the parliament's website said. The ministries of transport, planning and investment, communications and labor have been scrapped, and state media, the civil service, the police and the military will face cuts. As part of the government restructuring, the National Assembly on Tuesday approved two new deputy prime ministers, taking the total to seven. Almost two million people worked in the public sector as of 2022, according to the government, although the International Labor Organization puts the figure much higher. One in five of these jobs will be eliminated over the next five years. The government has said that 100,000 people will be made redundant or offered early retirement, but it has yet to offer clarity on how the much larger target will be reached. Vietnam's top leader To Lam, who half a year ago became Communist Party general secretary following the death of his predecessor, has said that state agencies should not be 'safe havens for weak officials'. 'If we want to have a healthy body, sometimes we must take bitter medicine and endure pain to remove tumors,' Lam said in December. He has also said that the plan had received 'large consensus from the people'. But several workers told AFP they were laid off with little notice and were concerned that decisions about which employees to keep were not based on ability. Thanh, a pseudonym to protect his identity, told AFP his 12-year career as a TV producer was 'aggressively' terminated last month. The state-controlled news channel where he worked was shuttered, one of five broadcasters already closed, and Thanh was given two weeks' notice. 'It is painful to talk about,' said Thanh, a father who has turned to driving a taxi. Business impact Building on stellar economic growth of 7.1 percent in 2024, Vietnam —a global manufacturing hub heavily reliant on exports — is aiming for eight percent this year. But anxiety is mounting over the country's potential vulnerability to tariffs under the new Trump administration. A bloated bureaucracy is also seen as a brake on growth, as is a high-profile anti-corruption campaign that has slowed everyday transactions. Authorities say savings from the cuts in spending could total $4.5 billion over the next five years, despite costs of more than $5 billion for retirement and severance packages. Streamlining the bureaucracy has been a Communist Party policy for nearly a decade but Lam is pushing the scheme ahead rapidly. Lam has also enthusiastically pursued an anti-graft campaign that has swept up dozens of business leaders and senior government figures, including two presidents and three deputy prime ministers since 2021. Critics accuse him of targeting his rivals through the action, but the drive has proved popular with the public and analysts say Lam may be looking to bolster his legitimacy ahead of the next Communist Party congress in early 2026. The turmoil, however, has threatened the country's reputation for stability and there are fears the bureaucratic reforms could also cause short-term chaos. At a press conference last week, Pham Thu Hang, spokesperson for the foreign affairs ministry, said the drive 'would not affect the investment and business environment in Vietnam.'	https://www.voanews.com/a/vietnam-parliament-approves-radical-govt-cost-cutting-drive-/7978965.html	2025-02-18T05:54:07-08:00	
Vatican cancels pope's weekend engagements as he battles 'complex' infection	VATICAN CITY — Pope Francis, who began his fifth day in hospital on Tuesday for what doctors have described as a 'complex' respiratory infection, will not take part in this weekend's Holy Year events, the Vatican said on Tuesday. The 88-year-old pontiff has been suffering from a respiratory infection for more than a week and was admitted to Rome's Gemelli hospital on Friday. A planned public papal audience set for Saturday had been canceled 'due to the health condition of the Holy Father,' the Vatican said in a brief statement. A papal mass scheduled for Sunday will still take place, but will be led instead by a senior Vatican official, it added. The Vatican said on Monday that doctors had changed the pope's drug therapy for the second time during his hospital stay to tackle a 'complex clinical situation.' They described it as a 'polymicrobial infection of the respiratory tract.' Doctors say polymicrobial diseases can be caused by a mix of viruses, bacteria and fungi. Francis, who has been pontiff since 2013, has had influenza and other health problems several times over the past two years. As a young adult he developed pleurisy and had part of one lung removed, and in recent times has been prone to lung infections.	https://www.voanews.com/a/vatican-cancels-pope-s-weekend-engagements-as-he-battles-complex-infection-/7978833.html	2025-02-18T03:24:09-08:00	
Philippines reports intrusions targeting intelligence data	Manila, Philippines — The Philippines has detected foreign attempts to access intelligence data, but its cyber minister said on Tuesday no breaches have been recorded so far. Attempts to steal data are wide-ranging, said minister for information and communications Ivan Uy. Advanced Persistent Threats or APTs have repeatedly attempted but failed to infiltrate government systems, suggesting the country's cyber-defenses have held firm. APTs are a general term for cyber actors or groups, often state-backed, that engage in malicious cyber activities. 'These have been present for quite some time, and threats come from many actors, but a big majority of them are foreign,' Uy told Reuters. Some of these threats, which Uy referred to as 'sleepers,' had been embedded in systems before being exposed by government's cyber security efforts. 'Why are these things operating in those systems, without even anybody calling it out?,' he said. So far, the government has not seen any cyberattacks targeting critical infrastructure, he said. 'Hopefully it's because our cyber defenses and cyber security are strong enough,' he said. Uy acknowledged the difficulty of attributing cyber intrusions to specific attackers, as they sometimes leave misleading digital traces. However, the government is working through diplomatic channels and sharing intelligence with the military, including with other countries, to validate threats and strengthen defenses, he said. Last year, the Philippine said it thwarted attempts by hackers operating in China to break into websites and e-mail systems of the Philippine president and government agencies, including one promoting maritime security. Uy described the escalating cyber threats as part of a global arms race, where nations and criminal organizations exploit digital vulnerabilities for financial or strategic gain. 'World War III is happening and it is cyber,' Uy said. 'These weapons are non-kinetic. They are cyber, digital, virtual, but it's happening. The attacks and defenses are happening as we speak, without any physical manifestation.' Beyond cyberattacks, Uy has also flagged a surge in deepfakes and what he referred to as 'fake news media outlets' aiming to manipulate public opinion ahead of the Philippines' mid-term elections in May, and the ministry has deployed tools to combat them. 'Misinformation and disinformation are riskier with respect to democracies like ours, because we rely on elections, and elections are based on personal opinion,' Uy said.	https://www.voanews.com/a/philippines-reports-intrusions-targeting-intelligence-data/7978813.html	2025-02-18T02:13:49-08:00	
Israel keeping troops in 5 southern Lebanon locations	Israeli troops remained in some areas of southern Lebanon on Tuesday, despite a deadline for their withdrawal as part of a ceasefire with the militant group Hezbollah. Israel withdrew from some villages in the region, but said it was leaving forces in place in five positions that it said were necessary to protect parts of northern Israel. The Lebanese government, which moved its own troops into areas Israel left, has called on Israel to fully implement the ceasefire deal and leave the country. The agreement called for Israel to withdraw by late January, with Hezbollah also moving away from the border and U.N. peacekeepers deploying in the vacated buffer zone along with the Lebanese troops. An extension pushed the deadline to Tuesday. Israeli Defense Minister Israel Katz said the military 'will remain in a buffer zone in Lebanon with five control positions, and will continue to act forcefully and uncompromisingly against any Hezbollah violation.' The ceasefire reached in late November halted more than a year of fighting in Lebanon, which had intensified in the months ahead of the ceasefire with Israeli troops conducting ground operations inside of Lebanon and repeated airstrikes targeting Hezbollah. The militants launched a cross-border rocket campaign in October 2023, attacking northern Israel a day after Hamas militants from the Gaza Strip killed about 1,200 people and took 250 hostages in their own attack on southern Israel. Israel’s counteroffensive against Hamas has killed more than 48,200 Palestinians, according to Gaza’s health ministry, which does not distinguish between combatants and civilians. Israel said it has killed more than 17,000 militants. The first phase of a Gaza ceasefire is due to end at the beginning of March. So far, the ceasefire has included Hamas releasing 24 hostages and Israel freeing more than 1,000 Palestinian prisoners. The tentative second phase of the ceasefire plan calls for Hamas to release dozens of remaining hostages in exchange for more Palestinian prisoners, the drafting of a permanent truce and the withdrawal of Israeli forces. But the detailed terms of the deal have yet to be negotiated. Hamas and Hezbollah have been designated by the United States and others as terrorist organizations.

Turkish police detain 282 suspects in raids targeting PKK militants	ISTANBUL — Turkish police detained 282 suspected members of the Kurdistan Workers Party, or PKK, militant group in raids over the last five days, Interior Minister Ali Yerlikaya said on Tuesday. The raids came as Turkey continues to remove elected pro-Kurdish mayors from their posts over militant ties in a crackdown coinciding with hopes for an end to a 40-year conflict between the PKK and authorities. Jailed PKK leader Abdullah Ocalan is expected to make a statement on such efforts, four months after an ally of President Tayyip Erdogan urged him to call on the militants to lay down their arms. Police carried out this week's counter-terror raids in 51 provinces, as well as in the capital, Ankara, and the largest city of Istanbul, the minister said on X. The suspects were accused of conducting PKK propaganda, providing financing for the group, recruiting members and joining in street protests, he said. The police seized two AK 47 rifles among other weapons. On Saturday, Turkey removed a pro-Kurdish DEM Party mayor from his post in the eastern province of Van over terrorism-related convictions, taking to eight the number of DEM mayors replaced by state-appointed officials since 2024 elections. The PKK, designated as a terrorist group by Turkey and its Western allies, launched its insurgency against the state in 1984. More than 40,000 people have been killed in the conflict.	https://www.voanews.com/a/turkish-police-detain-282-suspects-in-raids-targeting-pkk-militants/7978791.html	2025-02-18T00:30:27-08:00	
Russian drone attack hits central Ukraine apartment building	A Russian drone hit an apartment building in the central Ukrainian city of Dolynska, officials said Tuesday, injuring at least three people. Andriy Raikovych, governor of the Kirovohrad region where the attack took place, said on Telegram that authorities evacuated dozens of people from the building and that those injured included a mother and two children. The attack was part of a widespread Russian aerial assault overnight, which the Ukrainian military said included 176 drones. Ukrainian air defenses shot down 103 of the drones, with intercepts taking place over the Cherkasy, Chernihiv, Dnipropetrovsk, Kharkiv, Kherson, Kirovohrad, Kyiv, Mykolaiv, Poltava, Sumy, Vinnytsia and Zhytomyr regions, the military said Tuesday. Cherkasy Governor Ihor Taburets said on Telegram that debris from a destroyed drone damaged four houses in his region. Russia’s Defense Ministry said Tuesday it destroyed five Ukrainian drones, including four over the Voronezh region and one over Belgorod. Both regions are located along the Russia-Ukraine border and are frequent targets of Ukrainian drone attacks. Voronezh Governor Alexander Gusev said on Telegram there were no reports of casualties or damage.

US, Russian officials to discuss Ukraine war, bilateral relations	Top U.S. and Russian diplomats are set to meet Tuesday in Saudi Arabia for discussions about relations between their countries and a potential end to Russia’s war in Ukraine. Both sides have tempered expectations, describing the talks as an initial step that could lay the framework for direct talks between U.S. President Donald Trump and Russian leader Vladimir Putin. Secretary of State Marco Rubio is leading the U.S. delegation, which also includes national security adviser Mike Waltz and Middle East envoy Steve Wikoff. Russia’s side includes Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov and senior Putin aide Yuri Ushakov. Ukrainian leaders said they were not invited to participate. Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy is due to host U.S. envoy for Ukraine Keith Kellogg for talks on Wednesday. The U.S.-Russia engagement sparked concern among European leaders who in recent days have highlighted the need for Ukraine to be involved in discussions about its own future, and for European nations to play a role in what they also see as a key development in their own security. French President Emmanuel Macron convened a group of European leaders for a Monday session in Paris where they discussed boosting defense spending and potential security guarantees for Ukraine. There was division on the idea of deploying peacekeepers to Ukraine as part of a potential end to the war, with governments such as Britain and Sweden expressing openness to the idea while German Chancellor Olaf Scholz said that discussion was premature. 'We seek a strong and lasting peace in Ukraine. To achieve this, Russia must end its aggression, and this must be accompanied by strong and credible security guarantees for the Ukrainians,' Macron said on X. The French leader said he had spoken with Trump and Zelenskyy after the Paris talks, and that it is important for Europeans, Americans and Ukrainians to work together. Zelenskyy expressed a need for 'robust and reliable' security guarantees, saying that otherwise Russia will just start another war with Ukraine or other nations in Europe.	https://www.voanews.com/a/us-russian-officials-to-discuss-ukraine-war-bilateral-relations/7978750.html	2025-02-17T21:59:55-08:00	
Japan approves new climate, energy and industry policies through 2040	TOKYO — Japan's government approved on Tuesday new targets to cut the country's greenhouse gas emissions through 2040, alongside a revised energy plan and an updated industrial policy for the same period. The measures, which seek to bolster long-term policy stability for businesses, focus on promoting decarbonization, ensuring a stable energy supply and strengthening industrial capacity to drive economic growth. Under the new climate policy, Japan aims to reduce greenhouse gas emissions by 60% from 2013 levels by 2035 and by 73% by 2040, extending its 2030 goal of a 46% cut. The emissions-cutting target sparked calls for deeper reductions from experts and ruling coalition members when it was first proposed, as the world's fifth-biggest carbon emitter struggles to reduce its dependence on fossil fuels. Despite more than 80% of 3,000 public comments supporting a more ambitious target, the environment and industry ministries finalized the goal without changes, citing prior deliberations by climate experts. As part of global efforts to combat climate change, Japan plans to submit its new target, known as a Nationally Determined Contribution under the Paris Agreement, to the United Nations this month. The revised energy policy aims for renewables to account for up to 50% of Japan's electricity mix by fiscal year 2040, with nuclear power contributing another 20% as the country pushes for clean energy while meeting rising power demand. Japanese utilities have struggled to restart nuclear reactors since the 2011 Fukushima disaster, limiting nuclear power to just 8.5% of Japan's electricity supply in 2023. The new energy plan removes the previous goal of minimizing reliance on nuclear and calls for building next-generation reactors. A new national strategy integrating decarbonization and industrial policy through 2040, aligned with the emission target and energy plan, was also approved by the cabinet. It aims to develop industrial clusters in areas rich in renewable energy, nuclear power, and other low-carbon power sources. However, uncertainties are emerging around Japan's policies, as the domestic offshore wind market, a key driver of renewable energy growth, faces headwinds from inflation and high costs, recently prompting Mitsubishi Corp to review three domestic projects.	https://www.voanews.com/a/japan-approves-new-climate-energy-and-industry-policies-through-2040/7978736.html	2025-02-17T20:36:01-08:00	
At AU summit, Tigray demands full implementation of peace deal	Addis Ababa, Ethiopia — The leaders of Ethiopia’s Tigray region have called for the full implementation of the Pretoria agreement that ended the conflict between Ethiopia's federal government and the Tigray rebels in 2022. The bloc released a report about the agreement during the African Union Summit over the weekend in Ethiopia's capital, Addis Ababa. The two main leaders of Tigray, who also are political rivals, urged the AU to pay attention to the implementation of the agreement. The AU-brokered agreement, reached in November 2022, required the cessation of hostilities, return of internally displaced people, disarmament, expedition of humanitarian access, and restoration of services in the region. The agreement ended the two-year conflict and prompted the return of some social services. Just over two months ago, the first phase of the Pretoria agreement's disarmament, demobilization and reintegration program, known as DDR, was launched in Tigray. DDR aims to demobilize 371,971 combatants overall in Ethiopia, including 75,000 combatants from Tigray region in its first phase. But the Tigray region’s leaders say there are outstanding issues. Some territories have not yet been returned by the federal government, and internally displaced people have not returned to disputed areas in Western Tigray. The president of the Tigray interim regional administration, Getachew Reda, who signed the agreement on behalf of the Tigray People's Liberation Front, or TPLF, told AU leaders that 'many contents of the agreement have not been implemented.' 'Most of the focus of the international community on DDR is on the first ‘D,’ the disarmament process, but the most important aspect for us is, where we disarm, should not be the end,' he said. 'Whether we demobilize and reinstate the people who have been the former combatants is something that should be taken into account. The international community, the AU, should take this process seriously, and it should continue to press all of us to focus on this part of the Pretoria agreement.' TPLF leader Debretsion Gebremichael, who was president of the region at the time of the conflict, said that while the cessation of hostilities has been a 'significant milestone' there have been shortcomings. 'We must acknowledge that critical components such as the constitutional restoration of occupied territories, the withdrawal of non-ENDF forces, and the resettlement of the displaced persons, as well as TPLF legal reinstatement, require accelerated action,' he said. The 'non-ENDF forces' that Debretsion refers to are Eritrean and Amhara region forces that have been allies of the federal Ethiopian National Defense force, or ENDF, during the conflict. Eritrea denies having forces in Ethiopian territory. Regarding the resettlement of disputed Western Tigray, the Ethiopian government's position is that it will be resolved through a referendum. Ethiopian Minister of Foreign Affairs Gedion Timothewos said the way ahead must be conducted through 'constructive engagement' and in 'strict adherence' to the rule of law. He told the AU that the Ethiopian government is taking steps to implement the agreement and it 'must be fulfilled in the manner specified.' Gedion added: 'With good faith implementation, as provided in the peace agreement, we are convinced that the remaining and outstanding important measures are within our reach and could be fulfilled.' AU chief negotiator and former president of Nigeria, Olusegun Obasanjo, said that the issues of the DDR program and contested areas should continue to be addressed in a phased manner until they are resolved, and that they should not 'hold back the implementation of the agreement.' He said the Pretoria peace agreement reflected the principle of 'African solutions to African problems.' 'It underscores the capability of African statesmen and institutions to resolve conflicts and foster peace within our continent,’’ Obasanjo said. Rift between Tigray's leaders The two main leaders of Tigray, Getachew and Debretsion, shook hands at Sunday’s AU event, but the duo have been involved in a bitter political dispute that crippled the region’s administration and functions for months. The dispute is rooted in differences over the implementation of the Pretoria agreement. Debretsion accuses his former TPLF deputy chairman of not representing the region's interests, a charge Getachew denies. The two also clashed over the convening of the TPLF party congress and the appointment of local administration. TPLF held a congress in August during which it expelled 15 members including Getachew from the central committee, a move Getachew described as 'null and void.' Getachew accuses the TPLF leadership of orchestrating 'a coup d'état' against his administration and alleges the TPLF leaders are working to dismantle the regional government. The TPLF has made the same accusation against Getachew. Last month, over 200 Tigray security force commanders sided with Debretsion after staying neutral for many months, accusing Getachew of betraying Tigray’s interests. Getachew hit back, saying the use of security forces for the benefit of a particular political faction is unacceptable. On Thursday, the National Election Board of Ethiopia (NEBE) suspended TPLF from conducting any political activities for three months because it has yet to convene a general assembly. TPLF rejected the suspension, accusing NEBE of meddling. 'Whilst TPLF leadership is dealing and negotiating with relevant stakeholders to amend relations, the National Board of Elections is going out of its way to intervene and taint the party negatively,' TPLF said in a statement on Friday. 'As a signatory of the Pretoria agreement, we make clear our stand that the board is meddling. … We appeal to the federal government that if anything goes wrong, the responsibility lies on the board.' In a statement on his Facebook page Ethiopia’s prime minister recently called on Tigray elites to solve their internal differences in dialogue, and he added that any other differences, be it with other forces or federal government, should be addressed based on the national constitution.

M23 rebels tighten their grip on second major city in eastern DRC	BUKAVU, Democratic Reupblic of Congo — Rwanda-backed rebels tightened their grip on Bukavu on Monday, a day after seizing the second major city in eastern Democratic Republic of Congo whose residents appeared resigned to their fate under the new rulers. On Sunday, M23 rebels captured the city of 1.3 million people after it was abandoned by Congolese forces. Bukavu lies 101 kilometers south of Goma, which was captured by the rebels in late January. The M23 is the most prominent of more than 100 armed groups vying for control of eastern Congo's trillions of dollars in mineral wealth that's critical for much of the world's technology. The rebels are supported by about 4,000 troops from neighboring Rwanda, according to U.N. experts. The decades-long fighting has displaced more than 6 million people in the region, creating the world's largest humanitarian crisis. As the rebels made their way into Bukavu, its streets were flooded by residents attempting to leave and looters filling flour sacks with what they could find. A pall of silence set in later as residents and business owners braced for M23's entrance into the city center. On Monday morning, people gradually started coming out again while the rebels patrolled major intersections in the city. 'People are still scared to go out because of the insecurity so it's not business as usual yet,' David Balezi, a shopkeeper in Bukavu, told The Associated Press. Bukavu's border crossing to Rwanda was closed on Monday morning, as were most shops and stores while traffic gradually picked up again. 'Now we thank God that the situation is OK, even if we don't know what's coming. Whatever happens, we will live with it,' David Munyaga, a resident of Bukavu, said. On Monday, Erasto Bahati Musanga, the rebel-appointed governor of North-Kivu province announced that Goma and Bukavu's ports will reopen Tuesday. Navigation on Lake Kivu, one of the largest lakes in Africa, had been banned since late January, during the rebels’ offensive on Goma. In rebel-controlled Goma, hundreds of protesters gathered to call for the departure of the U.N. peacekeeping force in Democratic Republic of Congo, known as MONUSCO, and the withdrawal of troops from the Southern African Development Community (SADC), which includes countries ranging from Congo to South Africa. The protestors organized a sit-in in front of the MONUSCO headquarters in Goma, with some brandishing signs and chanting slogans calling for the resignation of Congo's President Felix Tshisekedi. 'The war does not end in Congo, why? They have nothing to do here, they should leave,' Bauma Sukali, a protester, said. Another protester, Fiston Nsabimana, said: 'Tshisekedi is not able to ensure peace. Let him leave power.'	https://www.voanews.com/a/m23-rebels-tighten-their-grip-on-second-major-city-in-eastern-drc/7978719.html	2025-02-17T19:06:52-08:00	
Costa Rica will receive deported migrants from US	San Jose, Costa Rica — Costa Rica announced Monday it would receive migrants from other countries who were deported by the United States, following in the footsteps of Panama and Guatemala. 'The Government of Costa Rica agreed to collaborate with the United States in the repatriation of 200 illegal immigrants to their country,' the Costa Rican president's office said in a statement, adding that 'these are people originating from ... Central Asia and India.' Costa Rica is the third country in Central America to collaborate on repatriating deported migrants from the United States since President Donald Trump assumed office in Washington on Jan. 20. The first set of deportees will arrive in Costa Rica on Wednesday aboard a commercial flight, according to the statement, whereupon they will be transported to a Temporary Migrant Care Center near the border with Panama. The statement specified that 'the process will be completely financed' by the U.S. government under the supervision of the International Organization for Migration. Panama and Guatemala had previously agreed to a similar arrangement when U.S. Secretary of State Marco Rubio visited on a recent tour of Latin America. Panama received its first repatriation flight with 119 migrants aboard last week, originating from China, Pakistan, Afghanistan and elsewhere, according to Panamanian officials. None have arrived yet in Guatemala. Latin America is the original home of most of the United States' estimated 11 million undocumented migrants. Many had made dangerous journeys, braving treacherous terrain, wild animals and criminal gangs for a chance at a better life. Trump, however, took a hard line against undocumented migrants during last year's U.S. election campaign, describing some as 'monsters' and 'animals.' On his first day in office last month, Trump declared a national emergency at the southern U.S. border and vowed to deport 'millions and millions' of migrants.	https://www.voanews.com/a/costa-rica-will-receive-deported-migrants-from-us/7978707.html	2025-02-17T18:15:07-08:00	
Argentine judge investigates fraud case against President Milei over crypto promotion	BUENOS AIRES, Argentina — A judge in Argentina was selected Monday to investigate allegations of fraud against President Javier Milei for his brief promotion of a cryptocurrency whose value collapsed within hours of its launch last week. Milei distanced himself from the scandal and said he acted in good faith. Milei and his office denied involvement with creators of the $LIBRA cryptocurrency, saying he initially drew attention to it Friday as an entrepreneurial project that might benefit Argentina but learned more about it later and then withdrew his support. Lawyers in Argentina filed fraud complaints against the libertarian president on Sunday. The case was assigned Monday to Judge María Servini, head of Federal Court No. 1 in Buenos Aires. She doesn't have a deadline to finish investigating the allegations. In a tweet Friday evening that coincided with the launch of the $LIBRA crypto coin, Milei said that it was aimed at 'encouraging economic growth by funding small businesses and startups.' It enjoyed a brief spike in value above $4 billion in market capitalization, although its value began to decline amid comments of critics that it could be a scam. Milei deleted the post a few hours later as the value of the cryptocurrency was collapsing in a downturn that caused millions of dollars in losses to many of its new investors. The coin, developed by KIP Protocol and Hayden Davis, could be obtained by accessing a link that directed users to a website called vivalalibertadproject.com, referring to the well-known phrase 'Viva la libertad!' that Milei uses to close speeches and messages on his social media. The president's office said in a statement that Milei was not involved in any stage of the cryptocurrency's development and decided to remove his post to avoid speculation and limit further exposure, following the public reaction to the project's launch. 'The president shared a post on his personal accounts announcing the launch of KIP Protocol's project, as he does daily with many entrepreneurs who wish to launch projects in Argentina to create jobs and attract investments,' the president's office said. After deleting the post, Milei said on X he was unaware of the details of the cryptocurrency and accused his political opponents of trying to exploit the episode. 'I have nothing to hide and I have no problem coming forward and showing my face,' Milei said Monday in an interview with the Todo Noticias channel. 'Those who entered there voluntarily knew what they were getting into,' he added. 'As volatility traders, they understood the risks involved.' His office said in the statement that the country's Anti-Corruption Office, which operates under the executive branch, would investigate the case. Jonatan Baldiviezo, a lawyer and one of the plaintiffs, said Sunday that the plaintiffs allege that Milei's actions were part of an illicit association to commit 'an indeterminate number of frauds' in the episode. 'Within this illicit association, the crime of fraud was committed, in which the president's actions were essential,' he said.	https://www.voanews.com/a/argentine-judge-investigates-fraud-case-against-president-milei-over-crypto-promotion/7978683.html	2025-02-17T17:22:09-08:00	
Sources: Wagner mercenaries, Mali army accused of killing civilians	DAKAR, Senegal — Around 20 people were killed in northern Mali on Monday when the vehicles they were traveling in came under attack, with local sources telling Agence France-Presse that Wagner mercenaries and Mali's army were responsible. A relative of the driver of one of the vehicles told AFP from the northern city of Gao that the group was bound for Algeria when the deadly attack occurred. 'The driver of the first vehicle is my cousin,' they said on the condition of anonymity. 'They encountered a group of Wagner mercenaries and some Malian soldiers who shot at them. In the first car, everyone died. My cousin too,' they said, specifying that the passengers included illegal migrants and nomads. Mali's army did not provide an official comment on the accusations when approached by AFP on Monday. However, a military source refuted the claims, saying an investigation was underway but 'the army killed no one.' 'What happened is serious. These were civilians who were killed in the two vehicles in the Tilemsi region,' a representative from the Gao region told AFP. 'In total, in the two vehicles, there are at least 20 dead,' he said. The separatist rebel group Front for the Liberation of Azawad (FLA) condemned the continuation of 'ethnic cleansing carried out by the Bamako junta against the Azawad population.' The FLA statement claimed two vehicles 'were intercepted by the terrorist coalition FAMA (Malian Armed Forces)/Wagner.' 'Among the passengers, at least 24 people, including women and children, were coldly executed by the Malian army and Wagner's Russian mercenaries,' the statement continued. Mali, run by a military junta following coups in 2020 and 2021, has spent the past dozen years mired in a security crisis due to violence by groups affiliated with Al-Qaida and Islamic State. The military junta has been supported by Wagner mercenaries since breaking ties with former colonial ruler France. The nongovernmental organization Human Rights Watch in December denounced the 'atrocities' committed against civilians by the Malian army and its Russian ally Wagner, as well as by Islamist armed groups.	https://www.voanews.com/a/sources-wagner-mercenaries-mali-army-accused-of-killing-civilians/7978672.html	2025-02-17T17:04:38-08:00	
European leaders gather for emergency summit on defense, Ukraine	PARIS — European leaders called for beefing up their defense spending Monday after a Paris summit on Ukraine and the region's security — amid concerns about an aggressive Russia and declining support from Washington. The emergency meeting comes ahead of U.S.-Russian talks on ending the war in Ukraine — which it appears could leave out the Europeans. The summit, called by French President Emmanuel Macron, came as Europeans confront a shift in transatlantic relations under the new administration U.S. President Donald Trump. European Commission chief Ursula von der Leyen said European security was at a 'turning point.' Ahead of the Paris talks — gathering European Union, NATO and British leaders — Polish Prime Minister Donald Tusk described efforts to introduce competition between the European Union and the United States as senseless and potentially dangerous. Ian Lesser, who heads the Brussels office of the German Marshall Fund policy institute, said there are two big issues on the agenda for European leaders in the near term. 'It’s all about what can be done for and with Ukraine, in anticipation of the United States doing less, and possibly in anticipation of having to guarantee a settlement or at least a ceasefire,' Lesser said. 'The other long-term question, which is some ways more serious, is how to secure Europe’s defense with the United States potentially absent in the years to come And there, I think, there’s very little consensus, and it’s a very big and expensive and long-term project for Europe.' Top U.S. and Russian officials were to hold talks Tuesday in Saudi Arabia to discuss Ukraine and a possible summit between President Donald Trump and his Russian counterpart, Vladimir Putin. Neither Ukraine nor the Europeans have been invited. British Prime Minister Keir Starmer said his country is willing to send troops to Ukraine as part of any peace deal. Other European leaders say that’s premature. Meanwhile, the foreign minister of Hungary, which is close to both Russia and the Trump administration, said the Paris talks undermine peace. Leaders in Paris also discussed ways to rapidly increase Europe’s own defense capabilities and support for Ukraine. 'Increased spending at home, increased defense production, increased sizes of armies, increased intelligence cooperation, increased training — all of this is to happen, in addition to supplying Ukraine so its front line doesn’t collapse,' said Orysia Lutsevych, head of the Ukraine Forum at the Chatham House think tank in London. She described a key security conference in Munich last week, which left Europe concerned about Washington’s new priorities, as a wake-up call. 'It’s a different White House and a different team,' she said. 'And Europe was slow to realize that and to find the right words and the right package for this transactional world of America.' The U.S. has long pushed Europe to do more for its own defense. Now — with Russia gaining the advantage on the ground in Ukraine, and Washington calling for NATO members to increase military budgets — Europeans are sensing an urgency to do so.	https://www.voanews.com/a/european-leaders-gather-for-emergency-summit-on-defense-ukraine-/7978663.html	2025-02-17T16:54:17-08:00	
European leaders hold crisis security talks as US signals transatlantic reset	London — European leaders held a crisis security meeting Monday in Paris after a blizzard of diplomatic interventions by Washington in recent days that have raised doubts over the U.S. commitment to the transatlantic alliance, the bedrock of European security. British Prime Minister Keir Starmer, German Chancellor Olaf Scholz, NATO Secretary-General Mark Rutte, European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen and other European leaders were among those attending the emergency summit at the Elysee Palace. Starmer spoke to reporters after the meeting. 'At stake is not just the future of Ukraine. It is an existential question for Europe as a whole and therefore vital for Britain's national interest,' he said. 'It's clear the U.S. is not going to leave NATO. But we Europeans will have to do more. The issue of burden-sharing is not new, but it is now pressing. And Europeans will have to step up, both in terms of spending and the capabilities that we provide.' 'Europe must play its role, and I'm prepared to consider committing British forces on the ground alongside others, if there is a lasting peace agreement. ... But there must be a U.S. backstop, because a U.S. security guarantee is the only way to effectively deter Russia from attacking Ukraine again,' Starmer told reporters in Paris. Scholz, who faces elections at the end of this week, echoed calls for Europe and Ukraine to be part of the peace talks. 'It is now very clear to us that we must continue to support Ukraine. And it must and can rely on us that this will be the case. We welcome the fact that there are talks on peace development, but it must be and is clear to us — this does not mean that there can be a dictated peace and that Ukraine must accept what is presented to it,' Scholz said. Ukraine aid A series of policy shifts by Washington over the past week have transformed Europe’s geopolitical calculations. U.S. Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth told NATO allies last week that Europe must provide the overwhelming share of aid for Ukraine as it fights Russian invaders. 'Now is the time to invest, because you can't make an assumption that America's presence will last forever,' Hegseth said in a Friday speech in Warsaw. 'The reality that returning to 2014 borders as part of a negotiated settlement is unlikely. The reality of U.S. troops in Ukraine is unlikely. The reality of Ukraine membership in NATO as a part of a negotiated settlement, unlikely,' Hegseth said. Peace talks Earlier in the week, U.S. President Donald Trump held a 45-minute phone call with his Russian counterpart, Vladimir Putin, effectively ending Moscow’s isolation since his February 2022 full-scale invasion of Ukraine. Both leaders agreed to begin Ukraine peace talks in Riyadh beginning Tuesday — with Kyiv and Europe excluded from the table. 'That may grate a little bit. But I'm telling you something that's really quite honest … when you looked at Minsk II [peace agreements], there was a lot of people at the table that really had no ability to execute some type of peace process, and it failed miserably. So, we're not going to go down that path,' Keith Kellogg, the U.S. special envoy for Ukraine and Russia, told delegates Saturday at the Munich Security Conference. That approach is unsustainable, said analyst Armida van Rij, who leads the Europe program at London’s Chatham House. 'Given the U.S. has taken itself out of the equation when it comes to … providing security guarantees for Ukraine or monitoring any kind of potential ceasefire that may happen, it’s really up to the Europeans to implement any kind of ceasefire or peace deal. So, you need the Europeans at the table to be able to discuss that, because otherwise, why would they sign up to something that's been discussed over their heads that commits their troops in a potential risk of direct conflict with Russia?' van Rij told VOA. ‘Tectonic shifts’ The diplomatic flurry will have profound consequences for European security, according to Daniela Schwarzer, a political analyst at the Bertelsmann Stiftung Foundation in Germany. 'We are witnessing tectonic shifts of the order structures and also of the positioning of major powers. We see that the United States wants to retreat from international organizations, so it is weakening structures of international order,' Schwarzer told Reuters. European leaders should have been prepared, said van Rij. 'We could have seen this coming for a long time, but it hasn't been said that starkly and in such clear terms before, and that was really the wake-up call for many, many Europeans. 'Now it’s crunch time to get this going — particularly in the short term, of course, in terms of not just maintaining but upping support for Ukraine, given it's very clear that the U.S. is not going to play a major role anymore in the way that it has under [former President Joe] Biden. But also for European defense and security in the medium to longer term, what that's going to look like? So, there are huge questions hanging over Europeans,' van Rij told VOA. Only 23 of NATO’s 32 members met the alliance target of spending at least 2% of gross national income on defense in 2024, let alone the 5% recently demanded by Trump. 'That's going to be a really difficult thing for many Europeans who are operating in a fiscally very constrained space,' van Rij said. Democratic values U.S. criticism went beyond questions of defense. At the Munich Security Conference, U.S. Vice president JD Vance questioned Europe’s democratic values, criticizing mass migration and a perceived attack on freedom of speech in Europe, including the exclusion of far-right parties from power. 'The threat that I worry the most about vis-a-vis Europe is not Russia, it's not China, it's not any other external actor. And what I worry about is the threat from within. The retreat of Europe from some of its most fundamental values,' Vance told delegates in Munich on Friday. His comments were described as 'unacceptable' by German officials. Europe is reeling from the new tone in transatlantic relations, said van Rij. 'What has come as a surprise is the style in which this has been done. And that's been really breaking all the norms in terms of how diplomacy is conducted, essentially. Reality has hit very, very clearly,' she told VOA.	https://www.voanews.com/a/european-leaders-hold-crisis-security-talks-as-us-signals-transatlantic-reset/7978667.html	2025-02-17T16:51:53-08:00	
Four top New York City officials resign as turmoil ripples over mayor's corruption case	NEW YORK — Four top deputies to New York City Mayor Eric Adams are resigning in the latest fallout from the Justice Department's push to end a corruption case against Adams and ensure his cooperation in President Donald Trump’s immigration crackdown — a bargain that has raised questions about the mayor’s political independence and ability to lead the city. In a statement Monday, Adams confirmed the departures of First Deputy Mayor Maria Torres-Springer, Deputy Mayor for Operations Meera Joshi, Deputy Mayor for Health and Human Services Anne Williams-Isom and Deputy Mayor for Public Safety Chauncey Parker. 'I am disappointed to see them go, but given the current challenges, I understand their decision and wish them nothing but success in the future,' said Adams, who faces several challengers in June's Democratic primary. 'But let me be crystal clear: New York City will keep moving forward, just as it does every day.' City Council Speaker Adrienne Adams became the latest Democrat to call on the mayor to resign, saying that with the deputy mayor resignations it's clear he 'has now lost the confidence and trust of his own staff, his colleagues in government and New Yorkers.' Speaker Adams is not related to the mayor. Torres-Springer, Joshi and Williams-Isom told agency heads and staff in a memo that they were exiting because of 'the extraordinary events of the last few weeks.' They did not give a date for their departures, but Adams said they and Parker will remain 'for the time being to ensure a seamless transition.' Adams has faced increasing scrutiny since the Justice Department's second-in-command ordered federal prosecutors in Manhattan last week to drop the mayor's corruption case. Acting Deputy Attorney General Emil Bove wrote that the case had 'unduly restricted Mayor Adams’ ability to devote full attention and resources to the illegal immigration and violent crime.' That directive touched off firestorms within the Justice Department and New York political circles, with seven federal prosecutors quitting in protest — including the interim U.S. attorney for Manhattan — and fellow Democrats calling on Adams to resign. On Friday, after a week of recriminations and resignations, Bove and a pair of Justice Department officials from Washington stepped in and filed paperwork asking Manhattan federal Judge Dale E. Ho to dismiss the case. Ho has yet to take action on the request. Adams, a former police captain, pleaded not guilty last September to charges that he accepted more than $100,000 in illegal campaign contributions and lavish travel perks from foreign nationals looking to buy his influence while he was Brooklyn borough president campaigning to be mayor. The Justice Department said in its filing Friday that it was seeking to dismiss Adams’ charges with the option of refiling them later, which critics see as a carrot to ensure his compliance on the Republican president's objectives. In his memo ordering prosecutors to ditch the case, Bove said the new, permanent U.S. attorney would review the matter after the November election. 'It certainly sounds like President Trump is holding the mayor hostage,' Reverend Al Sharpton, an Adams ally, said Tuesday. 'I have supported the mayor, but he has been put in an unfair position — even for him — of essentially political blackmail.' Political leaders, including Democratic Representatives Alexandria Ocasio Cortez and Nydia Velázquez, and Lieutenant Governor Antonio Delgado have called on Adams to step down. But Democratic Governor Kathy Hochul has said she's taking a more deliberative approach. 'The allegations are extremely concerning and serious, but I cannot as the governor of this state have a knee-jerk, politically motivated reaction like a lot of other people are saying right now,' she told MSNBC on Thursday. 'I’ve got to do it smart, what’s right, and I’m consulting with other leaders in government right now.' The drama over Adams' legal case played out as the mayor met with Trump’s border czar in New York on Thursday and announced increased cooperation on the Trump administration's efforts to remove immigrants, including reestablishing an office for immigration authorities at the city's notorious Rikers Island jail. In their memo to staff announcing their exits, Torres-Springer, Joshi and Williams-Isom wrote, 'Due to the extraordinary events of the last few weeks and to stay faithful to the oaths we swore to New Yorkers and our families, we have come to the difficult decision to step down from our roles.'	https://www.voanews.com/a/four-top-new-york-city-officials-resign-as-turmoil-ripples-over-mayor-s-corruption-case-/7978647.html	2025-02-17T16:26:54-08:00	
Experts push to restore Syria's war-torn heritage sites, including Roman ruins at Palmyra	PALMYRA, SYRIA — Experts are returning to Syria's war-ravaged heritage sites, hoping to lay the groundwork for restoring them and reviving tourism, which they say could provide a much-needed boost to the country's decimated economy after nearly 14 years of war. Once-thriving landmarks like the ancient city of Palmyra and the medieval Crusader castle of Crac des Chevaliers remain scarred by years of conflict, but local tourists are returning to the sites, and conservationists hope their historical and cultural significance will eventually draw international visitors back. Palmyra One of Syria's six UNESCO World Heritage sites, Palmyra, was once a key hub to the ancient Silk Road network linking the Roman and Parthian empires to Asia. Located in the Syrian desert, it is renowned for its 2,000-year-old Roman-era ruins. It is now marked by shattered columns and damaged temples. Before the Syrian uprising that began in 2011 and soon escalated into a brutal civil war, Palmyra was Syria's main tourist destination, attracting around 150,000 visitors monthly, Ayman Nabu, a researcher and expert in ruins told The Associated Press. Dubbed the 'Bride of the Desert,' he said 'Palmyra revitalized the steppe and used to be a global tourist magnet.' The ancient city was the capital of an Arab client state of the Roman Empire that briefly rebelled and carved out its own kingdom in the third century, led by Queen Zenobia. In more recent times, the area had darker associations. It was home to Tadmur prison, where thousands of opponents of the Assad family's rule in Syria were reportedly tortured. The Islamic State group demolished the prison after capturing the town. IS militants later destroyed Palmyra's historic temples of Bel and Baalshamin and the Arch of Triumph, viewing them as monuments to idolatry, and beheaded an elderly antiquities scholar who had dedicated his life to overseeing the ruins. Between 2015 and 2017, control of Palmyra shifted between IS and the Syrian army before Assad's forces, backed by Russia and Iran-aligned militias, recaptured it. Fakhr al-Din al-Ma'ani Castle, a 16th-century fortress overlooking the city, was repurposed by Russian troops as a military barracks. Nabu, the researcher, visited Palmyra five days after the fall of the former government. 'We saw extensive excavation within the tombs,' he said, noting significant destruction by both IS and Assad government forces. 'The (Palmyra) museum was in a deplorable state, with missing documents and artifacts — we have no idea what happened to them.' Inside the city's underground tombs, Islamic verses are scrawled on the walls, while plaster covers wall paintings, some depicting mythological themes that highlight Palmyra's deep cultural ties to the Greco-Roman world. Crac des Chevaliers Beyond Palmyra, other historical sites bear the scars of war. Perched on a hill near the town of Al-Husn, with sweeping views, Crac des Chevaliers, a medieval castle originally built by the Romans and later expanded by the Crusaders, was heavily bombarded during the Syrian civil war. On a recent day, armed fighters in military uniform roamed the castle grounds alongside local tourists, taking selfies among the ruins. Hazem Hanna, an architect and head of the antiquities department of Crac des Chevaliers, pointed to the collapsed columns and an entrance staircase obliterated by airstrikes. Damage from government airstrikes in 2014 destroyed much of the central courtyard and the arabesque-adorned columns, Hanna said. The Dead Cities In northwest Syria, more than 700 abandoned Byzantine settlements called Dead Cities, stretch across rocky hills and plains, their weathered limestone ruins featuring remnants of stone houses, basilicas, tombs and colonnaded streets. Despite partial collapse, arched doorways, intricate carvings and towering church facades endure, surrounded by olive trees that root deep into history. Dating back to the first century, these villages once thrived on trade and agriculture. Today, some sites now shelter displaced Syrians, with stone houses repurposed as homes and barns, their walls blackened by fire and smoke. Crumbling structures suffer from poor maintenance and careless repurposing. Looters have ravaged the ancient sites, Nabu said, leaving gaping holes in search of artifacts. Local visitors carve names and messages into centuries-old walls. Sheep enclosures dot the ruins, plastic debris blending with ancient stone. Moustafa Al-Kaddour, a local resident, returned after eight years. Touring the ruins with family members he brought from Quneitra. He said the Assad forces had established a military position in the village, subjecting the ruins to heavy shelling and gunfire. The area was then controlled by rebels, who made the area off-limits to most Syrians and international tourists, unlike Palmyra, which still saw some visitors during the war. The Dead Cities were added to UNESCO's World Heritage List in 2011 as an open-air museum, said Nabu.	https://www.voanews.com/a/experts-push-to-restore-syria-s-war-torn-heritage-sites-including-roman-ruins-at-palmyra/7978643.html	2025-02-17T16:23:40-08:00

Taiwan considers multibillion-dollar arms purchase from US, sources say	WASHINGTON/TAIPEI — Taiwan is exploring buying arms worth billions of dollars from the United States, sources briefed on the matter said, hoping to win support from the new Trump administration as China continues to apply military pressure on the island. Three sources familiar with the situation, speaking to Reuters on the condition of anonymity given the sensitivity of the situation, told Reuters that Taiwan is in talks with Washington. The package is meant to demonstrate to the United States that Taiwan is committed to its defense, one of the sources said. A second source said the package would include coastal defense cruise missiles and HIMARS rockets. 'I would be very surprised if it was less than $8 billion. Somewhere between $7 billion to $10 billion,' the source added. The White House did not immediately respond to a request for comment. However, U.S. national security adviser Mike Waltz has said he wants to speed delivery of weapons to Taiwan. Taiwan's defense ministry declined to comment on specific purchases but said it is focused on building its defenses. 'Any weaponry and equipment that can achieve those goals for building the military are listed as targets for tender,' it said. China claims democratically governed Taiwan as its own territory and has never renounced the use of force to bring the island under its control. Taiwan strongly objects to China’s sovereignty claims and says only the island’s people can decide their future. Trump-Taiwan relations U.S. President Donald Trump unnerved chip powerhouse Taiwan on the election campaign trail by saying the island stole American semiconductor business. This month, he threatened tariffs on chip imports. But his administration maintained diplomatic support for the Chinese-claimed island. Trump and Japanese Prime Minister Shigeru Ishiba issued a joint statement on Feb. 7 opposing any attempt to change the current situation in the Taiwan Strait through force or coercion. The U.S. State Department also removed language on its website that it does not support Taiwan independence, a move praised by the island's government. China has urged the U.S. to 'correct its mistakes.' Taiwan plans to propose a special defense budget that prioritizes precision ammunition, air-defense upgrades, command and control systems, equipment for the reserve forces and anti-drone technology, a third source familiar with the matter said. During his 2017-2021 term, Trump established regular arms sales to Taiwan, including multibillion-dollar deals for F-16 fighter jets. The Biden administration continued these sales, though often with smaller price tags. Taiwanese officials see encouraging signs from Trump's administration even as tariff threats weigh on that optimism. Taiwan does not believe Trump is looking to make a 'grand bargain' with Chinese President Xi Jinping to sell out Taiwan's interests, one of the sources said. Trump is more concerned with putting tariffs on semiconductors, the source said. In another sign of U.S. commitment to Taiwan, the top U.S. diplomat in Taiwan, Raymond Greene, will retain his post, three sources told Reuters, even as other U.S. diplomatic postings undergo major reshuffles. A spokesperson for the U.S. State Department said Greene remains director of the American Institute in Taiwan, the unofficial U.S. Embassy in Taipei.	https://www.voanews.com/a/taiwan-considers-multibillion-dollar-arms-purchase-from-us-sources-say-/7978401.html	2025-02-17T16:00:17-08:00

Weekend clashes claim 14 lives in drug violence-torn Ecuador	GUAYAQUIL, ECUADOR — Clashes between rival criminal groups claimed the lives of 14 people over the weekend in Ecuador's port city of Guayaquil, the epicenter of a bloody power struggle between narco gangs, police said Monday. In one incident, gunmen on motorcycles fired into a crowd gathered outside a grocery store, killing a minor and six adults, police chief Santiago Tuston said, warning of possible 'reprisals' to follow. Social media videos of the aftermath of the attack showed shocking images of bodies lying on the street in northern Guayaquil. Tuston said the massacre — the exact motive of which was not divulged — brought to 14 the number of people killed in Guayaquil over the weekend. He did not provide details of the other killings. Guayaquil is the capital of the southwestern Guayas province, where a state of emergency has been in place since January as authorities battle to curtail spiraling violence in the once-peaceful South American country. Ecuador is home to an estimated 20 criminal gangs involved in trafficking, kidnapping and extortion, wreaking havoc in a country of 18 million that is squeezed between the world's biggest cocaine producers, Peru and Colombia. In recent years, the nation has been plunged into violence by the rapid spread of transnational cartels that use its ports — particularly in Guayaquil — to ship drugs to the United States and Europe. Homicides have risen from six per 100,000 inhabitants in 2018 to a record 47 in 2023. Under a state of emergency and military crackdown launched by President Daniel Noboa, in office since November 2023, that figure dropped to 38 per 100,000 last year, according to official data. Last Friday, hitmen gunned down a colonel who had been in charge of anti-drug operations in a different part of the port city. Noboa is seeking a new term in elections that will go to a runoff in April after an inconclusive first round last Sunday saw him narrowly pip challenger Luisa Gonzalez. Over the weekend, the president replaced his interior minister with retired police general Fausto Buenano, who has years of experience fighting narco gangs.	https://www.voanews.com/a/weekend-clashes-claim-14-lives-in-drug-violence-torn-ecuador/7978377.html	2025-02-17T14:59:57-08:00

Bus crash in Bolivia kills over 30 people	LA PAZ, BOLIVIA — A bus crash in Bolivia on Monday killed at least 31 people and wounded over a dozen more, according to local police. The driver of the bus likely lost control of the vehicle, causing it to drop nearly 800 meters (2,625 feet) off a precipice in the southwestern municipality of Yocalla, said a police officer speaking from the local hospital. 'There are at least 30' deceased who have been counted already and are being transferred from the crash site to the morgue, Colonel Victor Benavides told AFP. Of those injured in the crash, 10 adults and four children had been hospitalized, with several in intensive care, an official from the hospital said in a video. The mountainous route is full of twists and turns, the police officer said, adding that the speed the bus was traveling at could have been a factor in the crash. Some information in this story came from Agence France-Presse.	https://www.voanews.com/a/bus-crash-in-bolivia-kills-over-30-people/7978338.html	2025-02-17T13:57:18-08:00	
Trump begins firings of FAA air traffic control staff just weeks after fatal DC plane crash	Washington — The Trump administration has begun firing several hundred Federal Aviation Administration employees, upending staff on a busy air travel weekend and just weeks after a January fatal mid-air collision at Ronald Reagan Washington National Airport. Probationary workers were targeted in late night emails Friday notifying them they had been fired, David Spero, president of the Professional Aviation Safety Specialists union, said in a statement. The affected workers include personnel hired for FAA radar, landing and navigational aid maintenance, one air traffic controller told the Associated Press. The air traffic controller was not authorized to talk to the media and spoke on condition of anonymity. The National Air Traffic Controllers Association said in a brief statement Monday it was 'analyzing the effect of the reported federal employee terminations on aviation safety, the national airspace system and our members.' Other FAA employees who were fired were working on an urgent and classified early warning radar system the Air Force had announced in 2023 for Hawaii to detect incoming cruise missiles, through a program that was in part funded by the Department of Defense. It's one of several programs that the FAA's National Defense Program manages that involve radars providing longer-range detection around the country's borders. Due to the nature of their work, staff in that office typically provide an extensive knowledge transfer before retiring to make sure no institutional knowledge is lost, said Charles Spitzer-Stadtlander, one of the employees in that branch who was terminated. The Hawaii radar and the FAA National Defense Program office working on it 'is about protecting national security,' Spitzer-Stadtlander said. 'I don't think they even knew what NDP does, they just thought, ‘oh no big deal, he just works for the FAA.’' Spero said messages began arriving after 7 p.m. on Friday and continued late into the night. More might be notified over the long weekend or barred from entering FAA buildings on Tuesday, he said. The firings hit the FAA when it faces a shortfall in controllers. Federal officials have been raising concerns about an overtaxed and understaffed air traffic control system for years, especially after a series of close calls between planes at U.S. airports. Among the reasons they have cited for staffing shortages are uncompetitive pay, long shifts, intensive training and mandatory retirements. In the Jan. 29 fatal crash between a U.S. Army Black Hawk helicopter and American Airlines passenger jet, which is still under investigation, one controller was handing both commercial airline and helicopter traffic at the busy airport. Just days before the collision, President Donald Trump had already fired all the members of the Aviation Security Advisory Committee, a panel mandated by Congress after the 1988 PanAm 103 bombing over Lockerbie, Scotland. The committee is charged with examining safety issues at airlines and airports. Spitzer-Stadtlander said he was supposed to be exempted from the probationary firings because the FAA office he worked in focused on national security threats such as attacks on the national airspace by drones. The Musk-led Department of Government Efficiency did not immediately respond to a request for comment.

Delta plane flips on landing at Toronto airport, injuring 8	A plane crashed at Toronto Pearson International Airport on Monday, officials said, with CBC television reporting the plane flipped on landing. CBC and CP24 television both reported eight people were injured. Toronto's Pearson Airport said it was aware of an incident involving a Delta Air Lines’ regional flight arriving from Minneapolis and that emergency teams were responding. All passengers and crew were accounted for, the airport said in a statement on social media platform X, formerly Twitter. 'Emergency teams are responding,' the post added. Other social media posts appeared to show the jet upside down on the tarmac in Toronto, Ontario. Representatives for Delta did not immediately respond to a request for comment. 'There is a plane crash. However, we don't know the circumstances surrounding it at this point,' said Constable Sarah Patten of the Peel Regional Police in Ontario. 'It is my understanding that most of the passengers are out and unharmed but we're still trying to make sure so we're still on scene investigating,' Patten said. Airport staff told local media, CTV News, that the airport shut down arrivals and departures for the time being. Reuters was unable to confirm this with Pearson Airport officials, but the airport’s website shows multiple delays impacting arrivals and departures. Peel police say paramedics on the scene have set up a staging area off the runway.	https://www.voanews.com/a/delta-plane-flips-on-landing-at-toronto-airport-injuring-8/7978293.html	2025-02-17T13:11:08-08:00	
Syria arrests 3 men suspected of links to 2013 Tadamon massacre	TADAMON, SYRIA — Security forces in Syria said Monday that they arrested three people involved in the execution of hundreds of civilians by government forces in Damascus in 2013, two years after the country’s 13-year civil war began. Dozens of police and security trucks lined the streets of Tadamon, a Damascus suburb near the Yarmouk Palestinian refugee camp, where they carried out the arrests in the same streets that once bore witness to mass executions. Masked, rifle-wielding men moved through hollowed-out buildings, remnants of a war that turned the district into a front line between government forces and opposition fighters. In 2022, a leaked video dated April 16, 2013, appeared to contain harrowing footage of the executions. The near seven-minute clip showed members of Syria’s notorious Military Intelligence Branch 227 leading a line of about 40 blindfolded prisoners, their hands tied behind their backs, into an abandoned building in Tadamon. One by one, the gunmen pushed or kicked the prisoners into a trench filled with old tires, shooting them as they fell. One of the three men arrested was Monzer Al-Jazairi, a resident of the Zahira neighborhood and a former operative with the military security that operated before the fall of Bashar al-Assad in December 2024. 'We used to bring detainees arrested at checkpoints, put them under the buildings here and execute them, and then after we’re done, explode the buildings over them,' Al-Jazairi told The Associated Press. It was unclear whether Al-Jazairi, flanked by security men as he spoke, was speaking under duress or voluntarily. 'Every batch constituted around 25 [people],' he said, adding that 'around one week' passed between one batch and the next. He estimated that he and his colleagues killed 'around 500' people. Damascus Security Chief Lt. Col. Abdul Rahman Al-Dabbagh corroborated the number, citing additional confessions from those arrested. 'Many of those killed used to be collected at checkpoints and security (detention) centers, brought to Tadamon neighborhood, where they were executed,' Al-Dabbagh told the AP. The two other arrested suspects were identified as Somer Mohammed Al-Mahmoud and Imad Mohammed Al-Mahmoud. Years after the Syrian war’s worst massacres and mass disappearances, most alleged crimes have not been investigated and remain unpunished. Since Assad's ouster, Syrian security forces, under the new leadership led by the Islamist group Hayat Tahrir al-Sham, have been tracking down and arresting remnants of the former government and military across the country. 'The operation is ongoing to apprehend all those involved in violations and massacres against Syrians,' Al-Dabbagh said.	https://www.voanews.com/a/syria-arrests-3-men-suspected-of-links-to-2013-tadamon-massacre/7978208.html	2025-02-17T11:46:22-08:00	
Getting Cyprus natural gas to market via Egypt hailed as milestone	NICOSIA, CYPRUS — A pair of agreements outlining how sizable natural gas deposits inside Cypriot waters will get to market via processing facilities in Egypt are a milestone for energy cooperation, Cyprus' president said Monday. President Nikos Christodoulides said the cooperation between Cyprus and Egypt is helping to define the regional energy map, calling the agreements 'game-changers' that are 'pivotal for our strategic partnership.' The first agreement between Egypt, Cyprus and a consortium made up of energy companies Total of France and Italy’s Eni foresees piping natural gas from a deposit known as Cronos to Egyptian facilities where it will be liquefied and processed for export to markets including Europe. The Eni-Total consortium, which holds exploratory licenses for four of the 13 areas or blocks inside Cyprus’ offshore economic zone, will make a final decision on how it will extract and convey the gas before the summer this year. Eni Chief Executive Officer Claudio Descalzi called the agreement a decisive step toward creating an energy hub in the eastern Mediterranean. Officials haven't disclosed how large the Cronos deposit is, but it's believed to hold more than the Aphrodite deposit — the first gas field discovered inside Cyprus' exclusive economic zone in 2011 — that's estimated to contain 4.5 trillion cubic feet of gas. The second agreement between Egypt, Cyprus and a consortium composed of Chevron, NewMed Energy and Shell sets out the framework under which the Aphrodite deposit will be developed and monetized. The Aphrodite deal comes three days after the Cypriot government and the Chevron-led consortium approved a revised development and production plan for the deposit that includes a floating platform that processes extracted natural gas as well as a pipeline link to Egypt. Cypriot Energy Minister George Papanastasiou said last month the options of whether to use Aphrodite gas for Egypt’s domestic energy needs or to process it for export are still being weighed. Christodoulides also held talks with his Egyptian counterpart Abdel-Fattah el-Sissi on the two countries' next energy cooperation goals as well as regional developments. Christodoulides also met on the sidelines of Egypt’s energy exhibition EGYPES 2025 with ExxonMobil’s Vice President for Global Exploration John Ardill. ExxonMobil and partners Qatar Petroleum — which hold exploration licenses for two Cypriot blocks — are currently drilling a new well near the existing Glaucus deposit, which is estimated to contain 5 to 8 trillion cubic feet of gas. Papanastasiou has said there are 'positive' indications of natural gas quantities at the new Elektra well, also in Cypriot waters, with preliminary results expected in early April.	https://www.voanews.com/a/getting-cyprus-natural-gas-to-market-via-egypt-hailed-as-milestone/7978170.html	2025-02-17T11:17:00-08:00	
World Bank: Afghanistan's economic recovery precarious	ISLAMABAD — The World Bank reported Monday that the economic recovery in Taliban-controlled Afghanistan remains precarious, beset by persistent challenges, including policy uncertainty, financial isolation, reduced foreign aid and fragile trade relations with neighboring Pakistan. The bank assessed in its latest report that persistent high poverty levels, unemployment, limited resources, and weak purchasing power continue to leave millions of Afghans vulnerable in a country reeling from years of conflict and natural disasters. The World Bank report revealed that Afghanistan’s trade deficit surged by 54% in 2024, reaching $9 billion, which represents 45% of the country’s gross domestic product (GDP). The report attributes this decline to a 5% drop in exports, totaling $1.8 billion, primarily due to a reduction in coal and textile exports. In August 2021, the Islamist Taliban regained control of Afghanistan following the withdrawal of all U.S.-led Western forces from the country, marking the end of nearly two decades of foreign presence. The Taliban takeover led to the suspension of international aid and the imposition of sanctions on the financial and banking sectors. These measures were implemented in response to terrorism concerns, as key Taliban leaders were designated as global terrorists by the United Nations for directing years of insurgent attacks on U.S.-led foreign troops. 'Coal exports saw the steepest decline, plunging 64 percent to USD 92 million as Pakistan shifted to its traditional suppliers,' stated the World Bank. The report highlighted an 11.5% increase in Afghan revenue collection, primarily driven by non-tax revenue and taxes levied at the country’s borders. 'Revenue collection remained strong in the first ten months of FY2024-25 (March 22, 2024 – January 21, 2025), totaling AFN 190.5 billion ($2.5 billion), or 12 percent of annual GDP,' stated the report. The local currency, the Afghani (AFN), continued its depreciation trajectory for the third consecutive month, falling 12% from November 2024 to January 2025. The report explained that the central Afghan bank suspended U.S. dollar auctions from Sept. 4 to Dec. 9, contributing to the depreciation of the local currency. The auctions resumed in January 2025, with the bank injecting more than $100 million. The World Bank noted that Afghanistan, a landlocked nation, is compelled to diversify its export markets due to its precarious trade relations with Pakistan. Consequently, Iran, Kazakhstan and Uzbekistan each account for approximately 3% of the overall volume of Afghan exports. 'However, Pakistan remains the largest export destination, accounting for 45%, followed by India at 34%,' the report stated. Afghanistan relies on Pakistani overland routes and seaports for bilateral and international trade. Allegations that militants on Afghan soil are responsible for the rise in terrorist attacks in Pakistan since the Taliban regained control of Afghanistan have strained ties, affecting economic cooperation between the countries. Pakistani officials have also complained that the Taliban have imposed high taxes and duties on bilateral trade, demanding significantly higher coal prices than international rates, resulting in a decline in mutual trade. Furthermore, Islamabad asserts that de facto Afghan authorities are delaying the signing of trade-related agreements, thereby hindering the advancement of bilateral economic cooperation. No countries have recognized the Taliban as a legitimate government of Afghanistan, primarily due to restrictions on freedom of speech and female rights to education and employment. The Taliban attribute the difficulties in achieving economic recovery in the country to Western financial sanctions and the freezing of more than $9 billion in Afghan central bank assets held in the United States and other Western nations.	https://www.voanews.com/a/world-bank-afghanistan-s-economic-recovery-precarious/7978106.html	2025-02-17T11:08:59-08:00	
Chinese official tours Thai-Myanmar border, highlights crackdown on scam centers	Bangkok — Efforts to shut down online scam centers in Myanmar appeared to gain momentum Monday as a top Chinese security official visited both sides of the Thai-Myanmar border ahead of expected large-scale repatriations of workers in the illicit industry. The visit by Liu Zhongyi, China’s vice minister of public security and commissioner of the Criminal Investigation Bureau, was part of a stepped-up effort by the three countries to address the online scam problem, Thailand’s Deputy Prime Minister Phumtham Wechayachai told reporters. Areas of Myanmar bordering Thailand have been serving as havens for criminal syndicates employing an estimated hundreds of thousands of people from Southeast Asia and elsewhere who help carry out online scams including false romantic ploys, bogus investment pitches and illegal gambling schemes. Such scams have cost victims around the world tens of billions of dollars, while the people recruited to carry them out have often been tricked into taking the jobs under false pretenses and find themselves trapped in virtual slavery. Last week, some 260 people from 20 nations, including many from Africa, crossed from Myanmar into Thailand after they were reportedly rescued from scam centers. Thailand and China coordinate crackdown on scam centers On a visit to China in early February, Thai Prime Minister Paetongtarn Shinawatra vowed along with China’s leader Xi Jinping to crack down on the scam networks. Just ahead of her visit, Thailand cut off electricity, internet and gas supplies to several areas in Myanmar along the border, citing national security and severe damage that Thailand has suffered from scam operations. The repatriations of foreign workers from Myanmar have been organized by the Border Guard Force in Myawaddy, a militia of the Karen ethnic minority that exercises control over the area. However, critics have accused it of being involved in the criminal activities, at least to the extent of providing protection to the scam centers. The group's leader, Saw Chit Thu, denied in a news conference Monday that his group was involved in scam activities, but acknowledged business links to some properties hosting the centers, which he said initially operated simply as resorts. Thai media reported last week that Thailand's Department of Special Investigation was considering seeking arrest warrants for Chit Thu and others for alleged human trafficking. Thousands of workers employed by scam networks Thai officials have said as many as 7,000-10,000 more people may be repatriated, but Phumtham cautioned that Thailand would only receive those that are ready to be taken back right away by their home countries. The Bangkok Post newspaper reported that an initial batch of about 600 Chinese nationals from scam centers are expected to be flown back to China on chartered flights when Liu concludes his visit. Liu visited the border areas in Thailand’s Tak province Monday and appeared in Myawaddy in Myanmar, apparently at a location where hundreds of people believed to have been rounded up from several scam centers are being held awaiting repatriation. The video of Liu’s visit showed hundreds of people there sitting on the ground with their belongings in a large open-walled hall. 'China is actively conducting bilateral and multilateral cooperation with Thailand, Myanmar, and other countries, taking comprehensive measures to address both the symptoms and root causes, and working together to block criminals from committing crimes in relevant countries,' Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesperson Guo Jiakun said in Beijing. 'This is part of our joint efforts to eradicate the scourge of online gambling and telecom fraud, and to maintain the safety of people’s lives and property and the order of exchanges and cooperation among regional countries.' Stories of Chinese trapped in Myanmar hurt Thailand's reputation Dramatic stories of Chinese people being lured to work in Thailand only to be trafficked into a scam compound in Myanmar spread widely on social media in China, causing alarm and denting Thailand's reputation as a safe destination for Chinese visitors. Among those trapped was Chinese actor Wang Xing, who arrived in Thailand on a promise of getting a job and was abducted to Myanmar. He was quickly rescued after the incident circulated on social media. An earlier crackdown on scam centers in Myanmar was initiated in late 2023, after China expressed embarrassment and concern over illegal casinos and scam operations along its border in Myanmar’s northern Shan state. Ethnic guerrilla groups with close ties to Beijing shut down many operations, and an estimated 45,000 Chinese nationals suspected of involvement were repatriated.	https://www.voanews.com/a/chinese-official-tours-thai-myanmar-border-highlights-crackdown-on-scam-centers/7978011.html	2025-02-17T09:43:40-08:00	
Top Greek scientist: Santorini earthquake outlook remains uncertain	ATHENS — The Greek government’s chief seismologist says the frequency of earthquakes affecting Santorini and nearby islands has eased in recent days, but that the outlook for continued tremors in the coming weeks remains uncertain. 'Unfortunately, for now, we must wait. These seismic sequences do not end quickly. They follow their own timeline,' seismologist Costas Papazachos told state-run ERT radio Monday. 'Hopefully, this particular sequence will surprise us in a positive way and resolve itself sooner rather than later,' he said. A state of emergency has been declared on Santorini and the nearby islands of Ios, Amorgos, and Anafi after a swarm of undersea earthquakes this month – sometimes felt every few minutes – prompted thousands of residents and workers to move to the Greek mainland. Schools on the islands remain closed for a third week, while security services have set up rescue teams and backup power generators as part of precautionary measures. The government announced Monday that an emergency port facility was being established on Santorini in case of a wide-scale evacuation. Papazachos, a professor of geophysics at the University of Thessaloniki, currently serves as the representative of two emergency committees that include scientists and officials from government, the military, and emergency services. He said Santorini, a volcanic island shaped by catastrophic eruptions, did not face danger from its dormant volcano, but noted that magma was affecting the tremors. 'The root cause of the activity is the interaction of tectonic and magmatic processes,' he said. 'That does not mean that the molten material – the magma – will manage to break through 8 kilometers [5 miles] of crust and reach the surface, causing a new volcanic eruption.' Scientists were developing a clearer picture after gathering data from multiple sensors, he said. 'We are monitoring not only seismographs but also numerous other systems that track ground deformation, gas emissions, and satellite data,' he said. 'At this moment, I can honestly say we do not have a definitive forecast, as it is too early to assess the current slight de-escalation of seismic activity. We have encountered many surprises.' Earthquakes of up to magnitude 5.1 were recorded Monday in the undersea area bordered by the four islands which remain under a state of emergency.	https://www.voanews.com/a/top-greek-scientist-santorini-earthquake-outlook-remains-uncertain-/7977959.html	2025-02-17T09:02:02-08:00	
American arrested in Moscow on drug smuggling charges freed	Russia has freed a U.S. citizen arrested earlier this month on drug smuggling charges, according to Russian media reports and a U.S. official. The move appears to be an effort to ease tensions between Moscow and Washington ahead of talks in Saudi Arabia on Tuesday. Kalob Byers, 28, was detained on Feb. 7 at Moscow's Vnukovo airport after customs officials allegedly found cannabis-laced marmalade in his baggage. According to media reports, Byers had traveled from Istanbul with his Russian fiancee, who was also detained. The authorities said he had attempted to smuggle a 'significant amount' of drugs into the country and put him in custody on the charges of drug smuggling, punishable by a prison term of up to 10 years. Byers has been released from custody and is in the U.S. Embassy in Moscow where he is awaiting a flight home, Russian independent news outlet Meduza reported Monday, citing a Facebook post by his parents. A U.S. official confirmed to The Associated Press that Byers was released to the embassy late Sunday evening. The official spoke on the condition of anonymity because they were not authorized to discuss sensitive matters. Kremlin spokesperson Dmitry Peskov told reporters Monday in response to a question about Byers that Moscow expects 'to discuss restoring the entire complex of Russian-American relations' at the talks in Saudi Arabia on Tuesday, 'so certain events can be viewed in this context.' It wasn't immediately clear whether Byers' fiancee was also released. Russian media reports identified her as Naida Mambetova and said she was placed in pre-trial detention on the same charges. Arrests of American nationals in Russia have become increasingly common in recent years, with relations between Moscow and Washington sinking to Cold War lows over the war in Ukraine. Some have been released in prisoner exchanges. The most recent one included Marc Fogel, a teacher from Pennsylvania imprisoned in Russia on charges similar to those Byers had faced. Fogel was detained in 2021 when traveling to Russia to work at a school and handed a 14-year sentence for having what his family and supporters said was medically prescribed marijuana. He was released and brought back to the U.S. earlier this month in a swap that saw Alexander Vinnik, a Russian cryptocurrency expert who faced Bitcoin fraud charges in the U.S., returned to Russia. The release of Fogel and Byers come as tensions between Russia and the U.S. appear to ease. President Donald Trump on Wednesday upended three years of U.S. policy toward Ukraine and Russia, saying he and Russia's President Vladimir Putin had agreed to begin negotiations on ending the conflict following a lengthy direct phone call.	https://www.voanews.com/a/american-arrested-in-moscow-on-drug-smuggling-charges-freed/7977934.html	2025-02-17T08:41:08-08:00	
Somali officials: US airstrike against Islamic State kills 16 militants	Washington — U.S. airstrikes killed 16 militants affiliated with the Islamic State terrorist group in northern Somalia, officials there said Monday. A spokesperson for security operations in the Puntland region, Brigadier General Mohamud Mohamed Ahmed, disclosed the death toll in an interview VOA’s Somali Service. 'The strike carried out by our international security partners killed at least 16 militants including two senior members identified as the group’s bomb-makers, and a bomb factory was destroyed,' Ahmed said. He said local officials are working to verify the names and nationalities of the bomb-makers. Ahmed said that the United Arab Emirates played a role Sunday’s attack. 'The United States government and the United Arab Emirates, both our partners supporting us in the fight against terrorists, were involved [in] the strikes on Sunday night,' he added. Ahmed said the strikes targeted Godka Kunle and Xankookin, two villages in the Cal Miskaad mountain range in Puntland’s Bari region. Ahmed said during the airstrikes, the militants launched drone attacks on the bases of the Puntland security forces in the area. 'Trying to hit back the bases of our security forces, the militants used seven drones. Puntland forces shot down five of them and two others, apparently with explosives, went off,' Ahmed claimed. Somali and U.S. authorities have been working to root out Islamic State groups that established hideouts in mountainous parts of Puntland, a semi-autonomous region in northern Somalia. The U.S. Africa Command (AFRICOM) said in a statement Monday that it conducted an airstrike against ISIS-Somalia in the country’s northeast Sunday, killing two terrorists, according to an initial assessment. AFRICOM said no civilians were harmed in the operation and said it would continue to evaluate the results and provide updates as necessary. Speaking in Mogadishu, Somali President Hassan Sheikh Mohamud commended the U.S. airstrikes. 'The latest U.S. precision strikes against terrorist elements in Puntland reaffirms the strong partnership between Somalia and the United States in the fight against terrorism,' Mohamud said in a statement posted by the Somali National News Agency (SONNA). Sunday’s airstrike is the second the U.S. military carried out in Somalia this month. A similar operation on Feb. 1, which targeted senior ISIS-Somalia leadership in a network of cave complexes in Puntland’s Golis Mountains, killed approximately 14 ISIS operatives, including Ahmed Maeleninine, who the U.S. identified as a key recruiter and financier responsible for coordinating jihadi movements into the U.S. and Europe. Puntland authorities recently launched a military offensive against extremist groups in the region following months of preparations. Puntland claims to have since killed more than 200 Islamic State fighters, dozens of them foreign fighters, and captured villages and bases in the mountainous area controlled by IS.	https://www.voanews.com/a/somali-officials-us-airstrike-against-islamic-state-kills-16-militants/7977846.html	2025-02-17T07:36:02-08:00	
1st openly gay Muslim imam killed in South Africa; ‘hate crime’ suspected	CAPE TOWN, South Africa — A man regarded as the first openly gay Muslim imam has been fatally shot while sitting in a car in South Africa in what many are calling an assassination because of his teachings. Muhsin Hendricks was killed Saturday in the southern city of Gqeberha after being ambushed by two men in a pick-up truck. Police said the men involved in the killing had their faces covered. A security video of the shooting shows one of them jumping out of their vehicle, running up to the car Hendricks was in and firing a pistol multiple times through a side window. Police have not established a motive for the killing, but political parties and LGBTQ+ organizations say Hendricks was targeted because he started a mosque in Cape Town for gay people and called for members of the LGBTQ+ community to be welcomed into Islam. Homosexuality is forbidden in the Islamic religion. South Africa's Justice Ministry said it was investigating claims that Hendricks was the target of an assassination. Hendricks was known internationally and spoke at the International Lesbian, Gay, Bisexual, Trans and Intersex Association's conference in South Africa last year. The ILGA family 'is in deep shock at the news of the murder of Muhsin Hendricks and calls on authorities to thoroughly investigate what we fear may be a hate crime,' said Julia Ehrt, executive director of ILGA. 'He supported and mentored so many people in South Africa and around the world in their journey to reconcile with their faith.' The ILGA said Hendricks had spoken of how some people were calling for the closing of his mosque and had branded it the 'gay temple.' The Democratic Alliance, South Africa's second biggest political party, said 'the nature of the killing strongly suggests a professional hit.' Hendricks came out publicly as a gay imam in the mid-1990s and started a support network and later a mosque for gay Muslims. He advocated for their inclusion through his Al-Ghurbaab Foundation and referred to himself as 'the world's first openly queer imam.' 'When I was looking at the way queer Muslims were negotiating this dilemma between Islam and their sexual orientation and identity, I felt compelled to do something about it,' he said, explaining his beliefs. 'And I thought, for me to help would probably be for me to be authentic with myself and come out. I think it's possible to be queer and Muslim or queer and Christian.' In a message on its official Facebook page, the Al-Ghurbaab Foundation said Hendricks was 'a great father and a guardian of many. Continue resting with angels.' The Muslim Judicial Council of South Africa said that while it had consistently stated that Hendricks' position was incompatible with Islamic teachings, 'we unequivocally condemn his murder and any acts of violence targeting members of the LGBTQ community or any other community.'	https://www.voanews.com/a/st-openly-gay-muslim-imam-killed-in-south-africa-hate-crime-suspected-/7977802.html	2025-02-17T06:40:30-08:00	
Doctors change pope's treatment to tackle 'complex' situation, Vatican says	Vatican City — Doctors have changed treatment for Pope Francis' respiratory tract infection to tackle a 'complex clinical situation' and he will remain in hospital for as long as necessary, the Vatican said on Monday. 'The results of the tests carried out in recent days and today have demonstrated a polymicrobial infection of the respiratory tract, which has led to a further modification of the therapy,' said a brief statement. 'All tests conducted up to today are indicative of a complex clinical picture that will require an appropriate hospital stay,' it said. The 88-year-old pontiff has been suffering from a respiratory infection for more than a week and was admitted to Rome's Gemelli hospital on Friday. Vatican spokesman Matteo Bruni said the pontiff was 'in good spirits.' He did not specify whether the pope was suffering from a bacterial or viral infection, but said a further update on the pope's condition would be issued later on Monday. While a bacterial infection can be treated with antibiotics, viral infections cannot. Viruses usually have to run their course, but the patient can be assisted with other medicines to bring down their fever or help their body fight the infection. A polymicrobial infection is one caused by two or more micro-organisms, and can be caused by bacteria, viruses, or fungi. The Vatican said on Monday that the pope's planned weekly audience in St. Peter's Square, set for Wednesday, had been cancelled 'due to the continued hospitalization of the Holy Father.' The pope's doctors had earlier ordered complete rest, and Francis was unable to deliver his regular weekly prayer on Sunday to pilgrims in St Peter's Square or lead a special Mass for artists to mark the Catholic Church's Jubilee Year. 'Quite worried’ by pope’s absence Pilgrims visiting the Vatican on Monday offered their hopes that Francis would recover soon. 'We certainly wish for him to get better very quickly,' said Rev. Tyler Carter, a Catholic priest from the United States. 'He is our father and our shepherd, and so we want his continued health and blessing.' Manuel Rossi, a tourist from Milan, Italy, said he was 'quite worried' when the pope cancelled his appearance on Sunday. 'I am 18 years old so I have seen few popes in my life, and am very close to him,' said Rossi. 'I hope he recovers as soon as possible.' While in hospital over the weekend, the pope continued his recent practice of making phone calls to speak with members of a Catholic parish in Gaza, Italian broadcaster Mediaset reported on Monday. One of the parish members said Francis had called on both Friday and Saturday and was in 'good spirits' but sounded 'a bit tired.' 'Thank you for the affection, prayer and closeness with which you accompany me in these days,' a post on the pope's X account said on Sunday.	https://www.voanews.com/a/doctors-change-pope-s-treatment-to-tackle-complex-situation-vatican-says/7977788.html	2025-02-17T06:32:47-08:00	
Global benchmarks trade mixed as investors continue to eye Trump	Tokyo — Global shares traded mixed on Monday as investors continued to watch economic data and policy moves from U.S. President Donald Trump, as both are likely to impact upcoming central bank moves. France's CAC 40 dipped nearly 0.1% in early trading to 8,171.59, while Germany's DAX added 0.4% to 22,560.00. Britain's FTSE 100 edged up 0.1% to 8,742.97. U.S. markets are closed on Monday for a holiday. In Asia, Japan's benchmark Nikkei 225 rose in early trading after the Cabinet Office reported that the economy grew at a better-than-expected annual rate of 2.8% in October-December, underlined by steady exports and moderate consumption. But the benchmark quickly fell back and then recovered to be little changed, finishing up less than 0.1% at 39,174.25. On a quarter-to-quarter basis, the world’s fourth-largest economy grew 0.7% for its third straight quarter of growth. Japan marked its fourth straight year of expansion, eking out 0.1% growth last year in seasonally adjusted real gross domestic product, which measures the value of a nation’s products and services. In other regional markets, Australia's S&P/ASX 200 slipped 0.2% to 8,537.10. South Korea's Kospi surged 0.8% to 2,610.42. Hong Kong's Hang Seng reversed course, to slip less than 0.1% to 22,616.23, while the Shanghai Composite added 0.3% to 3,355.83. Markets around the world are nervously watching what upward pressure may come from tariffs that Trump has announced recently. But analysts now think Trump may ultimately avoid triggering a punishing global trade war. His most recent tariff announcement, for example, won’t take full effect for at least several weeks. That leaves time for Washington and other countries to negotiate. The Federal Reserve's goal, as well as that of the Bank of Japan, is to keep inflation at 2%. In energy trading, benchmark U.S. crude added 28 cents to $71.02 a barrel. Brent crude, the international standard, rose 34 cents to $75.08 a barrel. In currency trading, the U.S. dollar declined to 151.90 Japanese yen from 152.25 yen. The euro cost $1.0472, down from $1.0495.	https://www.voanews.com/a/global-benchmarks-trade-mixed-as-investors-continue-to-eye-trump/7977753.html	2025-02-17T06:05:53-08:00	
Life-threatening cold' expected in some parts of US after deadly weekend flooding	Louisville, Kentucky — Harsh weather moved west on Monday as a polar vortex was expected to grip the Rockies and the northern Plains after winter storms pummeled the eastern United States over the weekend, killing at least 10 people, including nine victims in Kentucky who died during flooding from heavy rains. The National Weather Service warned of 'life-threatening cold' into Tuesday, with temperatures in northeastern Montana predicted to dip as low as -42.7 degrees Celsius (45 degrees below zero) with wind chills down to -51 degrees Celsius (60 below). Meteorologists said several states would experience the 10th and coldest polar vortex event this season. Weather forces in the Arctic are combining to push the chilly air that usually stays near the North Pole into the U.S. and Europe. In Kentucky, Gov. Andy Beshear said Sunday that the death toll rose to nine. 'I am sad to share some more tough news tonight, Kentucky. We just confirmed another weather-related death out of Pike County, bringing our total loss to 9 people.' Beshear had said earlier Sunday that at least 1,000 people stranded by floods had to be rescued. President Donald Trump approved Kentucky's request for a disaster declaration, authorizing the Federal Emergency Management Agency to coordinate relief efforts throughout the state. Beshear said most of the deaths, including a mother and 7-year-old child, were caused by cars getting stuck in high water. 'So folks, stay off the roads right now and stay alive,' he said. Parts of Kentucky and Tennessee received up to 15 centimeters (6 inches) of rain, said Bob Oravec, a senior forecaster with the National Weather Service. 'The effects will continue for a while, a lot of swollen streams and a lot of flooding going on,' Oravec said Sunday. In Alabama, the weather service in Birmingham said it had confirmed an EF-1 tornado touched down in Hale County. Storms there and elsewhere in the state destroyed or damaged a handful of mobile homes, downed trees and toppled power lines, but no injuries were immediately reported. A state of emergency was declared for parts of Obion County, Tennessee, after a levee failed on Saturday, flooding the small community of Rives, home to around 300 people in the western part of the state. 'There will be mandatory evacuations in effect for the residents in Rives due to the rising water, no electricity, and freezing temperatures creating a life-threatening situation,' Mayor Steve Carr said in a statement Sunday. In Atlanta, a person was killed when a large tree fell on a home early Sunday, according to Atlanta Fire Rescue Capt. Scott Powell. Dangerously cold wind chill temperatures as low as minus 45.6 (50 degrees below zero) were expected in most of North Dakota, which remained under an 'extreme cold warning' along with large swaths of South Dakota and Minnesota, according to the weather service. Severe flooding Water submerged cars and buildings in Kentucky and mudslides blocked roads in Virginia over the weekend. Flood warnings extended throughout Tennessee and Arkansas. The mother and child were swept away Saturday night in Kentucky’s Bonnieville community, Hart County Coroner Tony Roberts said. In southeastern Kentucky, a 73-year-old man was found dead in floodwaters in Clay County, county Emergency Management Deputy Director Revelle Berry said. There was a total of four deaths in Hart County, Beshear said. The Kentucky River Medical Center in the city of Jackson said it had closed its emergency department and transferred all patients to two other hospitals in the region due to a nearby river flooding. High winds brought down trees and power poles across Albemarle County, Virginia. The Charlottesville Police Department said Sunday on social media that officers’ response times could be delayed due to 'an overwhelming number of weather-related calls for service.' Police urged residents to stay off the roads. Power outages were reported along much of the eastern seaboard, from New York south to Georgia. In West Virginia, 13 southern counties were under a state of emergency for flooding and some areas were cut off to vehicle traffic Sunday. Several volunteer fire departments dealt with flooding in their own buildings while answering rescue and evacuation calls. Parts of US hit with snowstorms, polar vortex on the way Ice and snow made road travel treacherous in large swaths of Michigan, which remained under a winter weather advisory until Monday afternoon. Michigan State Police reported 114 crashes Sunday around the Detroit area since snow started falling Saturday. 'Fortunately, most were one-car spin outs and there were no serious injuries,' Michigan State Police said on X. Authorities in Colorado reported eight people were killed in fatal vehicle crashes since Valentine’s Day and warned drivers to be cautious as the weather made driving more difficult. The causes of the fatal crashes weren’t immediately known. Also in Colorado, three state patrol cruisers that had pulled over along roadsides were struck by other vehicles, including one on Sunday where a trooper had stopped as officials prepared to close a road because of ice. In each case the troopers were out of their cruisers at the time and were uninjured. Avalanche warnings were issued for numerous areas of the Rocky Mountains stretching from Colorado to Washington state, with the danger rated highest in Utah.	https://www.voanews.com/a/life-threatening-cold-expected-in-some-parts-of-us-after-deadly-weekend-flooding/7977727.html	2025-02-17T05:57:11-08:00	
China aims to improve ties with EU amid transatlantic tension	Taipei, Taiwan — China has launched a new round of diplomatic outreach to European countries amid rising tension between the United States and its European allies. While top U.S. officials and European leaders clashed over issues such as values, democracy and Ukraine at the Munich Security Conference over the weekend, Chinese foreign minister Wang Yi held bilateral meetings with several top European officials, including EU foreign policy chief Kaja Kallas, German Chancellor Olaf Scholz, and NATO Secretary General Mark Rutte. 'There is no fundamental conflict of interest or geopolitical conflicts between China and the EU,' Wang said during his meeting with Kallas on Saturday, adding that Beijing 'supports all endeavors conducive to peace and backs Europe in playing a significant role' in the peace negotiation process regarding the war in Ukraine. The EU response was somewhat more reserved, with Kallas saying the EU was ready to 'continue with dialogue and cooperate in selected areas, such as trade, economic affairs, and climate change.' He urged Beijing to halt exports of dual-use goods to Russia, which she said fuels Moscow’s ongoing war against Ukraine. Wang’s remarks were in stark contrast to U.S. Vice President JD Vance’s criticism of European countries. Instead of highlighting the threats posed by Russia and China, Vance accused European government of censoring right-wing parties and failing to control migration. 'What I worry about is the threat from within, the retreat of Europe from some of its most fundamental values, values shared with the United States of America,' he said in a defiant speech that stunned European officials in Munich. Several European leaders quickly rejected Vance’s remarks, with German Defense Minister Boris Pistorius saying the U.S. vice president’s characterization of European policies was 'unacceptable.' The rare open clash between the U.S. and European countries came as top U.S. officials including Secretary of State Marco Rubio, national security adviser Mike Waltz, and Trump’s Middle East envoy Steve Witkoff flew to Saudi Arabia on Sunday for talks about the Ukraine-Russia war with Russian diplomats. To the surprise of many European leaders, U.S. Special Envoy for Ukraine and Russia Keith Kellogg said in Munich that European countries wouldn’t be part of any peace talks between Russia and Ukraine, which would be mediated by the U.S. Analysts say China’s effort to strengthen engagement with Europe is part of Beijing’s plan to take advantage of divisions between Washington and its European allies. 'China’s posture is about exploiting the perceived mistakes of any U.S. administration,' said Mathieu Duchatel, director of international studies at the French policy group Institut Montaigne. He told VOA by phone that the current tension between the U.S. and European countries has created an opportunity for Beijing to 'weaken the transatlantic alliance on China policy.' Given that U.S. President Donald Trump has threatened to impose tariffs on European countries, other experts say the growing tension in transatlantic relations could force the EU to moderate its policies towards China. 'Since Europe can't afford to wage two trade wars at the same time, it will be difficult for the EU and EU member states to maintain critical policies toward China,' Matej Simalcik, executive director of the Central European Institute of Asian Studies, told VOA in an interview in Taipei. In recent weeks, European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen, who has pushed the EU to adopt more assertive policies against China, has repeatedly said the bloc is open to improving relations with China. Europe 'must engage constructively with China – to find solutions in our mutual interest,' she said during a keynote speech at the World Economic Forum in Davos last month. US-European ties expected to hold While European countries may consider adjusting their China policies, some European analysts say it’s unlikely for these attempts to turn into a fundamental shift of European policies towards China and the U.S. 'The U.S. and Europe are each other’s most important trading partners, so I don’t think there will be a [complete] transatlantic break,' said Sari Arho Havren, an associate fellow at the Royal United Services Institute. European countries 'are testing the grounds and seeing what can be done, but at the same time, European officials have said whatever happens with China, it must be fair,' she told VOA by phone, adding that these factors will prevent the EU from 'walking back' their earlier positions on China entirely. Additionally, Duchatel at Institut Montaigne said Beijing’s decision to appoint former Chinese ambassador to France Lu Shaye, a prominent 'wolf warrior diplomat,' as its special representative for European affairs means China is unlikely to make major concessions in its relations with the EU. 'Lu’s appointment represents inflexibility on everything that matters,' he told VOA, adding that some European diplomats said the new Chinese special envoy would 'turn any diplomatic meeting into some sort of ideological confrontation that leads to no common position' between Beijing and European countries. While China and the EU’s fundamental differences over issues such as Beijing’s partnership with Russia and the trade imbalances remain unresolved, some Chinese academics say the growing tension between the U.S. and European countries still offers an opportunity for Beijing and Europe to 'increase mutual trust.' 'The growing tension in transatlantic relations has created a new environment for China to moderate relations with the EU, but it doesn’t mean European countries will reduce their criticism over Beijing’s partnership with Russia or China’s human rights record,' Shen Ding-li, a Shanghai-based international relations scholar, told VOA by phone.	https://www.voanews.com/a/china-aims-to-improve-ties-with-eu-amid-transatlantic-tension/7977635.html	2025-02-17T05:25:00-08:00	
Rubio visits Saudi Arabia as Israel, Hamas move closer to end of first phase of ceasefire	U.S. Secretary of State Marco Rubio was in Saudi Arabia on Monday as part of a tour of the region that includes a focus on the ceasefire between Israel and Hamas. Rubio was expected to meet with Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman amid objections from Saudi Arabia and other Arab nations about U.S. President Donald Trump’s proposal to move Palestinians out of Gaza. Trump has suggested the Palestinians would go to neighboring countries, with the United States taking over Gaza and redeveloping the territory. Such a plan would seemingly eliminate Trump’s hopes of getting Saudi Arabia to normalize ties with Israel, a move Saudi officials have said will not happen unless there is a pathway for a Palestinian state. The United States fully endorsed Israel’s war aims in Gaza on Sunday, with Rubio saying that Hamas 'must be eradicated' and 'cannot continue as a military or government force.' With the first phase of the ceasefire set to expire in two weeks, Rubio told Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu during a stop in Jerusalem that 'as long as [Hamas] stands as a force that can govern or as a force that can administer or as a force that can threaten by use of violence, peace becomes impossible.' Echoing Trump, the Israeli leader said 'the gates of hell would be open' if Hamas does not release dozens of remaining hostages abducted in its Oct. 7, 2023, attack that triggered the war. Hamas, a U.S.-designated terrorist group, freed three hostages Saturday in exchange for nearly 400 Palestinians who had been jailed in Israel. But the militants continue to hold dozens of hostages they captured in the terror attack that killed 1,200 people. Israel’s counteroffensive during 15 months of fighting in Gaza has killed more than 48,200 Palestinians, according to the territory's health ministry, which does not distinguish between combatants and civilians. Israel says it has killed over 17,000 militants. The tentative second phase of the ceasefire plan calls for Hamas to release dozens of remaining hostages in exchange for more Palestinian prisoners, drafting of a permanent truce and the withdrawal of Israeli forces. But the detailed terms of the deal have yet to be negotiated. During his tour of the region, Rubio was not scheduled to meet with any Palestinian officials. Egypt says it is hosting an Arab summit on February 27, and is working with other countries on a counterproposal that would allow for Gaza to be rebuilt without removing its population. Human rights groups say the expulsion of Palestinians would likely violate international law. Arab nations have long called for creation of an independent Palestinian state to exist alongside Israel, which the U.S. has also supported. But Netanyahu opposes a two-state solution and U.S. ownership of Gaza also would likely end the possibility of a Palestinian state encompassing Gaza and the Israeli-occupied West Bank. Egypt has warned that any mass influx of Palestinians from Gaza would undermine its nearly half-century-old peace treaty with Israel, a cornerstone of American influence in the region. Some material in this report came from The Associated Press and Reuters.	https://www.voanews.com/a/rubio-visits-saudi-arabia-as-israel-hamas-move-closer-to-end-of-first-phase-of-ceasefire-/7977580.html	2025-02-17T03:54:08-08:00	
Deportations bring uncertainty for California farm workers and local growers	In central California, it is harvesting season for strawberries and citrus fruits.

Militant attack kills 6 Benin soldiers, army spokesperson says	COTONOU, Benin — A militant attack on an army position has killed six soldiers in northern Benin, where government troops are trying to curb cross-border assaults by armed Islamist groups, an army spokesperson said. The encounter on Saturday also left 17 militants dead, spokesperson Ebenezer Honfoga told Reuters late on Sunday, without giving further details. The attack follows the killing of dozens of soldiers in a January assault in the northern department of Alibori, which shares a border with insurgency-plagued Niger and Burkina Faso. Benin and coastal neighbor Togo have both suffered attacks in recent years as groups linked to Islamic State and al Qaeda expanded their presence beyond West Africa's central Sahel region to the north.	https://www.voanews.com/a/militant-attack-kills-6-benin-soldiers-army-spokesperson-says/7977503.html	2025-02-17T01:18:37-08:00	
State media: Cairo building collapse kills 10	Cairo, Egypt — A building collapse in the Egyptian capital killed 10 people and injured eight more on Monday, with several others believed to be missing under the rubble, state media reported. Ambulances were dispatched to the scene in the working-class neighborhood of Kerdasa, where civil defense teams searched for people thought to be missing under the rubble, according to the Al-Akhbar Al-Youm newspaper. Eyewitnesses told the state-owned outlet that 'a gas cylinder explosion' caused the collapse, and a police investigation was underway. Building regulations are unevenly enforced in the sprawling metropolis of Cairo, home to over 26 million people. The city has seen a number of deadly building collapses in recent years, both due to the dilapidated state of some and, at times, failure to comply with building regulations.	https://www.voanews.com/a/state-media-cairo-building-collapse-kills-10-/7977495.html	2025-02-17T00:55:46-08:00

China urges US to 'correct its mistakes' after State Department removes Taiwan web reference	BEIJING/TAIPEI — China on Monday urged the United States to 'correct its mistakes' after the U.S. State Department removed previous wording on its website about not supporting Taiwan independence, which it said was part of a routine update. The fact sheet on Taiwan, updated last week, retains Washington's opposition to unilateral change from either Taiwan or from China, which claims the democratically governed island as its own. But as well as dropping the phrase 'we do not support Taiwan independence,' the page added a reference to Taiwan's cooperation with a Pentagon technology and semiconductor development project and says the U.S. will support Taiwan's membership in international organizations 'where applicable.' Beijing regularly denounces any international recognition of Taiwan or contact between Taiwanese and foreign officials, viewing it as encouraging Taiwan's separate status from China. The update to the website came roughly three weeks after U.S. President Donald Trump was sworn in to his second term in the White House. Speaking in Beijing, Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesperson Guo Jiakun said the revisions for Taiwan on the U.S. State Department's website were a big step backwards and 'sends a seriously wrong message to Taiwan independence separatist forces.' 'This is yet another example of the United States' stubborn adherence to the erroneous policy of 'using Taiwan to suppress China'. We urge the United States side to immediately rectify its mistakes,' Guo said. The United States, like most countries, has no formal diplomatic ties with Taiwan but is its strongest international backer, bound by law to provide the island with the means to defend itself. 'As is routine, the fact sheet was updated to inform the general public about our unofficial relationship with Taiwan,' a State Department spokesperson said in an email sent late Sunday Taiwan time responding to questions on the updated website wording. 'The United States remains committed to its one China policy,' the spokesperson said, referring to Washington officially taking no position on Taiwan's sovereignty and only acknowledging China's position on the subject. 'The United States is committed to preserving peace and stability in the Taiwan Strait,' the spokesperson said. 'We oppose any unilateral changes to the status quo from either side. We support cross-Strait dialog, and we expect cross-Strait differences to be resolved by peaceful means, free from coercion, in a manner acceptable to people on both sides of the Strait.' On Sunday, Taiwan Foreign Minister Lin Chia-lung expressed his appreciation for what he called the 'support and positive stance on U.S.-Taiwan relations.' Taiwan's government rejects Beijing's sovereignty claims, saying that only the island's people can decide their future. Taiwan says it is already an independent country called the Republic of China, its official name. The Republican government fled to Taiwan in 1949 after losing a civil war with Mao Zedong's communists, who set up the People's Republic of China.	https://www.voanews.com/a/china-urges-us-to-correct-its-mistakes-after-state-department-removes-taiwan-web-reference/7977487.html	2025-02-17T00:17:14-08:00	
China's Xi holds rare meeting with business leaders amid slowing economy, US tensions	BEIJING — Chinese President Xi Jinping on Monday spoke at a symposium attended by business leaders including Alibaba co-founder Jack Ma, state media reported, as Beijing grapples with a slowing economy and growing tensions with the U.S. Other private business leaders who attended the symposium included Huawei founder Ren Zhengfei, Xiaomi's Lei Jun, BYD's Wang Chuanfu, Unitree's Wang Xingxing, and CATL's Robin Zeng, a video published by CCTV showed. Meituan's Wang Xing, China Feihe's Leng Youbin and Will Semiconductor founder Yu Renrong also attended, the video showed. Tencent's Pony Ma was also there, a source familiar with the matter said, declining to be named as the meeting details were not public. Tencent did not immediately respond to a request for comment. Xi delivered a speech after listening to representatives of private companies, official news agency Xinhua said. The report did not provide any details about the symposium, held in the Great Hall of the People in Beijing. Reuters reported on Friday, citing sources, Xi planned to chair a symposium to boost private sector sentiment on Monday that would be attended by the country's business leaders, including Alibaba’s Jack Ma. The symposium would be aimed at boosting private-sector sentiment, and Xi was expected to encourage company chiefs to expand their businesses domestically and internationally amid an intensifying China-U.S. technology war, the sources had said. The symposium also comes as DeepSeek's AI platform has triggered investor speculation about its potential to buoy China's broader tech sector, leading to calls for an upward repricing of Chinese assets. Xi has long stressed the need for China to achieve self-sufficiency in semiconductors and wants the country to use AI to drive economic development. But China's efforts have been hampered by export control measures on chips imposed by Washington which is worried Beijing could use advanced semiconductors to boost its military capabilities. 'It's a tacit acknowledgement that the Chinese government needs private-sector firms for its tech rivalry with the U.S.,' said Christopher Beddor, deputy China research director at Gavekal Dragonomics in Hong Kong. 'The government has no choice but to support them if it wants to compete with the U.S.' Xi first chaired a high-profile symposium for the private sector in 2018, six years after he came to power. At the time, he pledged tax cuts and a level playing field while reaffirming that private firms would have access to financial backing. 'Despite the rising opportunities in the case of DeepSeek, it is also about guiding the private sector in the government-led direction and containing the potential risks to compete with the U.S.,' said Gary Ng, senior economist at Natixis. 'Still, the regulatory environment is the black box. As most AI development happens in the private sector, we cannot entirely rule out the outcome of a tighter-than-market-expected regulatory environment than we see now.'	https://www.voanews.com/a/china-s-xi-holds-rare-meeting-with-business-leaders-amid-slowing-economy-us-tensions/7977476.html	2025-02-16T23:33:34-08:00	
France hosting European talks on Ukraine	French President Emmanuel Macron is set to host a group of European leaders for talks Monday focused on the situation in Ukraine amid a shift in the U.S. approach to the conflict and suggestions by U.S. officials that Europe would not have a role in peace talks. Among those expected to attend were leaders from Britain, Germany, Italy, Poland, Spain, the Netherlands and Denmark. NATO chief Mark Rutte, European Council President Antonio Costa and European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen were also due to participate. European leaders have in recent days pledged continued support for Ukraine, including British Prime Minister Keir Starmer saying his government was ready to send troops to Ukraine as part of any postwar peacekeeping force. 'I do not say that lightly,' he wrote Sunday in the Daily Telegraph. 'I feel very deeply the responsibility that comes with potentially putting British servicemen and women in harm's way.' Starmer said securing a lasting peace in Ukraine was essential to deter Russian President Vladimir Putin from further aggression. Costa said last week’s Munich Security Conference showed the clear message that the security of Ukraine and the European Union 'cannot be separated.' 'There will be no credible and successful negotiations, no lasting peace, without Ukraine and without the European Union.' U.S. officials said Sunday they were heading to Saudi Arabia for talks in the coming days with Russian diplomats about ending the war, which began in February 2022 with Russia’s full-scale invasion of Ukraine. U.S. President Donald Trump and Russian leader Vladimir Putin agreed during an hour-long call last week to the immediate start of peace negotiations, but U.S. Secretary of State Marco Rubio told CBS’s 'Face the Nation' in an interview that aired Sunday, 'A process towards peace is not a one-meeting thing.' 'We'll see in the coming days and weeks if Vladimir Putin is interested in negotiating an end to the war in Ukraine, in a way that is sustainable and fair,' Rubio said. Trump’s Middle East envoy, Steve Witkoff, and U.S. national security adviser Mike Waltz said they were headed to Riyadh for the talks, while a Ukrainian minister says that an official delegation has arrived there in preparation for a possible visit by Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy. The shape of the talks remained uncertain. Rubio said he wasn't even sure who Moscow was sending. 'Nothing's been finalized yet,' he said, adding that the hope was for an opening for a broad conversation that 'would include Ukraine and would involve the end of the war.' Trump’s call with Putin blindsided NATO allies as well as Kyiv, with Zelenskyy later saying that there should be 'no decisions about Ukraine without Ukraine.' Whatever occurs this week in Saudi Arabia, Rubio said that once 'real negotiations' begin, then Ukraine 'will have to be involved.' In an interview with NBC’s 'Meet the Press' that aired Sunday, Zelenskyy said, 'I will never accept any decisions between the United States and Russia about Ukraine. Never. The war in Ukraine is against us, and it is our human losses.' Zelenskyy said he told Trump in a call they had last week that Putin is only pretending to want peace. 'I said that he is a liar. And [Trump] said, ‘I think my feeling is that he's ready for these negotiations.’ And I said to him, ‘No, he's a liar. He doesn't want any peace.'' The United States has been Ukraine’s biggest arms supplier during the conflict, but Trump has wavered on continued support and declined during a political debate last year to say that he wants Ukraine to win. Zelenskyy said that without continued U.S. military support, 'Probably it will be very, very, very difficult' to defeat Russia. 'And of course, in all the difficult situations, you have a chance. But we will have low chance -- low chance to survive without support of the United States.' Russia now controls about 20% of Ukraine’s internationally recognized territory, including the Crimean Peninsula it unilaterally annexed in 2014, the eastern portion of Ukraine pro-Moscow separatists captured after that, and areas Russian forces have taken since February 2022.

US says strike in Syria killed Al-Qaeda affiliate official	WASHINGTON — The U.S. military said Sunday it killed a member of an Al-Qaeda affiliate organization in a precision airstrike in Syria. U.S. Central Command (CENTCOM) said it conducted the strike Saturday 'in Northwest Syria targeting and killing a senior finance and logistics official in the terrorist organization Hurras al-Din (HaD), an al-Qaida affiliate,' according to a statement on X. CENTCOM did not identify its target. The strike was conducted 'to disrupt and degrade efforts by terrorists to plan, organize, and conduct attacks against civilians and military personnel' from the United States and allies, the statement continued. On Jan. 30, CENTCOM killed another senior operative in Hurras al-Din, Muhammad Salah al-Zabir, in an airstrike. The U.S.-based SITE Intelligence Group said Hurras al-Din was founded in February 2018. It did not publicly confirm its allegiance to al-Qaida until its dissolution announcement last month. The United States designated Hurras al-Din as a terrorist organization in 2019 and has offered financial rewards for information on several of its members. 'We will continue to relentlessly pursue terrorists in order to defend our homeland, and U.S., allied, and partner personnel in the region,' CENTCOM General Michael Erik Kurilla said in a statement.	https://www.voanews.com/a/us-says-strike-in-syria-killed-al-qaeda-affiliate-official-/7977430.html	2025-02-16T19:37:48-08:00	
New downloads of DeepSeek suspended in South Korea, data protection agency says	SEOUL, SOUTH KOREA — South Korea's data protection authority on Monday said new downloads of the Chinese AI app DeepSeek had been suspended in the country after DeepSeek acknowledged failing to take into account some of the agency's rules on protecting personal data. The service of the app will be resumed once improvements are made in accordance with the country's privacy law, the Personal Information Protection Commission (PIPC) said in a media briefing. The measure that came into force on Saturday aims to block new downloads of the app, the agency said, though DeepSeek's web service remains accessible in the country. The Chinese startup appointed legal representatives last week in South Korea and had acknowledged partially neglecting considerations of the country's data protection law, the PIPC said. Italy's data protection authority, the Garante, said last month it had ordered DeepSeek to block its chatbot in the country after failing to address the regulator's concerns over its privacy policy. DeepSeek did not immediately respond to a request for comment. When asked about earlier moves by South Korean government departments to block DeepSeek, a Chinese foreign ministry spokesperson told a briefing on February 6 that the Chinese government attached great importance to data privacy and security and protected it in accordance with the law. The spokesperson also said Beijing would never ask any company or individual to collect or store data in breach of laws.	https://www.voanews.com/a/new-downloads-of-deepseek-suspended-in-south-korea-data-protection-agency-says/7977429.html	2025-02-16T19:31:16-08:00	
Paul Simon and Sabrina Carpenter open the 'Saturday Night Live' 50th anniversary celebration	NEW YORK — Paul Simon and Sabrina Carpenter opened the 50th anniversary special celebrating 'Saturday Night Live' with a duet of his song 'Homeward Bound.' The 83-year-old Simon has been a constant on 'SNL' since its earliest episodes in 1975 and performed on the first show after the 9/11 attack. He was joined by the 25-year-old pop sensation of the moment, Carpenter. 'I sang this song with George Harrison on 'Saturday Night Live' in 1976,' Simon said. 'I was not born then,' Carpenter said, getting a laugh. 'And neither were my parents,' she added, getting a bigger laugh. Fifty seasons of 'Saturday Night Live' sketches, songs and special guests are being celebrated for the special's landmark anniversary in a Sunday night special. The pop culture juggernaut has launched the careers of generations of comedians, from Bill Murray to Eddie Murphy and Tina Fey to Kristen Wiig. Many of those stars were on hand for 'SNL50: The Anniversary Celebration,' airing live from New York, of course. 'I grew up with the show, you know, and I was born in 1971, and it's lived with me my whole life,' Amy Poehler, who was a cast member from 2001 to 2008,' said on Sunday ahead of the show's start. 'We have a show to do in just under two hours, and being back is an amazing privilege.' The three-hour extravaganza comes after months of celebrations of 'Saturday Night Live,' which premiered Oct. 11, 1975, with an original cast that included John Belushi, Chevy Chase and Gilda Radner. 'After the original cast, we were just going, Those guys just did it all for us,' Adam Sandler, a cast member from 1990-1995, said before the show. 'They crushed it. We watched them at home. They made their movies. We worshiped their movies. And that's all. What we wanted to do is just kind of continue that sort of stuff.' It's become appointment television over the years as the show has skewered presidents, politics and pop culture and been a platform for the biggest musical stars of the moment. As streaming has altered television viewing, 'SNL' sketches, host monologues and short comedy films remain popular on social media and routinely rack up millions of views on YouTube. While NBC has revealed some of the stars expected to appear, many of the special's moments, cameos and music performances remain a surprise. On Sunday, NBC announced more guest appearances including Julia Louis-Dreyfus, Leslie Jones, Billy Crystal, Cher, Mike Myers and Alec Baldwin, who holds the title of the person who's hosted 'SNL' the most times.	https://www.voanews.com/a/paul-simon-and-sabrina-carpenter-open-the-saturday-night-live-50th-anniversary-celebration/7977425.html	2025-02-16T18:46:39-08:00	
North Korea's Kim makes rare visit to father's tomb	SEOUL, South Korea — North Korean leader Kim Jong Un has paid his respects at a family mausoleum to mark the birthday of his late father and former leader Kim Jong Il, state media KCNA said on Monday. Kim Jong Il's birthday, which falls on Feb. 16, is widely celebrated as a major holiday in North Korea, called the Day of the Shining Star. But it was the first time in four years that the young Kim visited the Kumsusan Palace of Sun in the capital Pyongyang, which houses the embalmed bodies of his father and grandfather, for the anniversary. Accompanied by Kim Yo Jong, his sister and a senior ruling Workers' Party official, among other aides, Kim Jong Un paid homage 'in the humblest reverence,' KCNA said. 'He expressed his solemn will to devote himself to the sacred struggle for the eternal prosperity of the country, the security of the people and the promotion of their well-being,' it said. The Kim dynasty that has ruled North Korea since its founding after World War II and has sought to strengthen their grip on power by building cults of personality around them, though Kim Jong Un has shown signs of increasingly trying to stand more on his own feet without relying on his predecessors. In another dispatch, KCNA said Kim attended a groundbreaking ceremony on Sunday for the final phase of his pet project to build 50,000 new homes in Pyongyang. The ambitious initiative was launched in 2021 as part of Kim's five-year plan to boost the economy and designed to distribute at least 10,000 new apartments in Pyongyang each year, though some analysts have questioned its feasibility amid international sanctions and economic woes. During the ceremony, Kim lauded construction workers and officials for achieving nearly 400% progress last year compared to 2020 and pledged another plan to continue expanding the city. The project would 'usher in a new era of prosperity of Pyongyang in which the ideal streets of the people to be proud of in the world are built every year,' KCNA said.	https://www.voanews.com/a/north-korea-s-kim-makes-rare-visit-to-father-s-tomb/7977418.html	2025-02-16T18:32:49-08:00	
Trump administration turns to US Supreme Court in bid to fire agency head	President Donald Trump's administration has asked the U.S. Supreme Court to intervene in its bid to fire the head of an independent U.S. agency that protects government whistleblowers, bringing its first legal battle involving Trump's actions to the nation's highest judicial body since he took office in January. The Justice Department asked the court to immediately lift a federal judge's Feb. 12 order that temporarily blocked Trump's removal of Hampton Dellinger as the head of the Office of Special Counsel while litigation continues in the dispute, according to a copy of the filing reviewed by Reuters. The case has not yet been docketed by the court. The federal judge's action blocking the termination is an 'unprecedented assault on the separation of powers,' Acting Solicitor General Sarah Harris said in the filing. 'This court should not allow lower courts to seize executive power by dictating to the President how long he must continue employing an agency head against his will,' Harris wrote. Appointed by former President Joe Biden, Dellinger's five-year term was set to expire in 2029. He sued after receiving an email on Feb. 7 informing him that Trump had fired him from the watchdog role, 'effective immediately.' Dellinger's lawsuit said Trump exceeded his power in purporting to fire him, given that federal law permits removal only for 'inefficiency, neglect of duty, or malfeasance in office.' The Special Counsel's 'ability to protect the civil service and investigate alleged misconduct is needed now more than ever,' Dellinger's lawsuit said. 'Over the preceding three weeks, an unprecedented number of federal employees with civil service protections have been terminated without cause.' U.S. District Judge Amy Berman Jackson in Washington, D.C. issued a temporary restraining order on Feb. 12, restoring Dellinger to his position pending a further, preliminary order. Jackson said Dellinger was likely to prevail in the suit given that the effort to fire him without identifying any cause 'plainly contravenes' the Special Counsel's job protections under federal law. 'This language expresses Congress's clear intent to ensure the independence of the Special Counsel and insulate his work from being buffeted by the winds of political change,' Jackson wrote in the order. The District of Columbia U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals threw out the administration's appeal in a 2-1 decision on Saturday, saying it was premature, given that Jackson's order was only temporary. The Special Counsel Office allows whistleblowers to make disclosures about alleged misconduct within federal agencies and investigates complaints of retaliation. It also enforces a U.S. law known as the Hatch Act that limits political participation by federal employees. The move to fire Dellinger was the latest by the Trump administration to expel officials who investigate wrongdoing within the federal government. Trump last month fired 17 inspectors general who serve as independent watchdogs within their agencies, without providing a reason.	https://www.voanews.com/a/trump-administration-turns-to-us-supreme-court-in-bid-to-fire-agency-head/7977407.html	2025-02-16T18:13:40-08:00	
Two Kenyans allegedly abducted in broad daylight, held for 32 days	Nairobi — Since June 2024 — when a series of mass protests took place in Kenya — 82 cases of alleged forced disappearances were recorded by the Kenyan National Human Rights Commission. Rights groups say some of those alleged victims have been lucky to reunite with their loved ones, but 29 are still missing. While many accuse the police of perpetrating such acts, it's yet to be confirmed who’s behind the abductions. VOA requests for comments from the National Police Service were not answered. Aslam Longton and his brother, Jamil, told VOA they were abducted near their home in the Kitengela Town neighborhood, about an hour from central Nairobi. Earlier that day in August, Aslam said, he felt uneasy and noticed unfamiliar people watching his every move. The brothers were riding together by car when things unraveled. 'At the first corner, there was a Toyota Vitz parked there and opened all the doors, so I couldn't pass there. I reversed the car and came to this place [where VOA was conducting the interview]. When I entered this place, there was a Subaru that came and blocked me here and a Toyota Axio blocked me behind there,' Aslam recalled. The brothers alleged they were approached by heavily armed men they described as appearing to be police officers and told to switch off their car. Aslam then said 'they opened the car, removed me at the steering [wheel], took me very fast in the Subaru. So, my brother started asking them, who are you? Why are you taking my brother?' Jamil Longton said he was not meant to be taken away that day, but when he pressed the officers, even suggesting to call the neighborhood police station, they refused to identify themselves. 'I kept on asking them who are you, why are you taking my brother? I must go with my brother wherever you are taking him. I told them I’ll call the OCS [Officer Commanding Station] at the Kitengela police station to ask him if he’s aware of what you are doing. ... When I attempted to call the OCS, my phone was confiscated by them. I was slapped, my phone switched off and I was also bangled [bundled] into the Subaru,' he also recalled. The brothers say they were handcuffed, blindfolded, taken to a location, and held there for 32 days. Amnesty International and the Kenya National Commission on Human Rights confirm the accounts by the two men and say it’s similar to the treatment of other abductees. 'They were telling us they were denied food. They were kept in handcuffs for days. They were stripped naked and were made to lie on concrete floors for days,' KNHRC’s Ernest Cornel told VOA. Aslam said he was abducted because of to his participation in the nationwide, youth-led, GenZ protests last year against a proposed bill that would have increased taxes. The protests expanded into a call for an end to corruption and for the president to resign. The bill was eventually withdrawn. Aslam’s brother did not take part in the protests, but they said they were both repeatedly questioned about its funding source during their captivity. Rights groups accused the Kenyan police of using excessive force against protesters, in some cases abducting government critics. Police deny the allegations. The police also said they had credible evidence criminal gangs had infiltrated the protests and planned to take advantage. About 60 people died and hundreds were arrested. Since last June, 82 people have gone missing and about 29 are still not accounted for, the rights organization said. In December, following more protests in Nairobi to demand the police produce the missing people, President William Ruto condemned the spike in disappearances, saying 'any criminality must be investigated. Whether undertaken by citizens, criminals or undertaken by the police, it must be investigated, and we must get to the bottom of any criminal activity in Kenya.' Meanwhile, at a recent press conference convened by KNHRC, some of the victims, including Aslam and Jamil, said that after their release, they still are being intimidated and called for international investigations. 'They are saying that when they go to [for a] run in the morning, they can see the car following them. They can see cars parked outside of their homes with their engines running and with their lights on and when they confront the occupants of the car, they sped off,' Cornel says.	https://www.voanews.com/a/two-kenyans-allegedly-abducted-in-broad-daylight-held-for-32-days-/7974876.html	2025-02-16T17:12:56-08:00

China condemns sailing of Canadian warship in Taiwan Strait	Beijing — China's military on Monday condemned the sailing of a Canadian warship in the Taiwan Strait, saying its air and naval forces had monitored and warned the ship, a mission that came just a few days after U.S. Navy ships made a similar mission. The U.S. Navy, and occasionally ships from allied countries like Canada, Britain and France, transits the strait around once a month. China, which claims Taiwan as its own territory, also says the strategic waterway belongs to it. Canada's actions 'deliberately stirred up trouble' and undermined peace and stability in the strait, the People's Liberation Army's Eastern Theater Command said in a statement. 'Theater forces maintain a high level of alert at all times and resolutely counter all threats and provocations,' it added. The Canadian military declined immediate comment. Both the Chinese and Taiwanese governments identified the ship as the Ottawa. Taiwan's defense ministry said on Sunday that the ship had sailed in a northerly direction, adding that Taiwanese forces also kept watch. Taiwan's foreign ministry welcomed the sailing. 'Canada has once again taken concrete actions to defend the freedom, peace and openness of the Taiwan Strait and has demonstrated its firm position that the Taiwan Strait is international waters,' it said on Sunday. Last October, a U.S. and a Canadian warship sailed together through the strait, less than a week after China conducted a new round of war games around the island. Taiwan's democratically elected government rejects Beijing's sovereignty claims, saying only the island's people can decide their future.	https://www.voanews.com/a/china-condemns-sailing-of-canadian-warship-in-taiwan-strait/7977389.html	2025-02-16T16:41:00-08:00	
Argentine lawyers charge President Milei with fraud over cryptocurrency promotion	Montevideo, Uruguay — Argentine lawyers filed fraud charges against President Javier Milei in criminal court Sunday for promoting a cryptocurrency on his social media, one of the lawyers told The Associated Press. On Friday, Milei posted on X about $LIBRA, a coin that he said was aimed at 'encouraging economic growth by funding small businesses and startups.' He deleted the post a few hours later and the value of the currency collapsed, causing millions of dollars in losses to its brief investors, according to financial site Dexscreener. The coin, developed by KIP Protocol and Hayden Davis, could be obtained by accessing a link that directed users to a website called vivalalibertadproject.com, referring to the well-known phrase with which Milei closes speeches and messages on his social media. The President's Office said in a Saturday statement that Milei was not involved in any stage of the cryptocurrency’s development and decided to remove the post to avoid speculation and limit further exposure, following the public reaction to the project’s launch. Jonatan Baldiviezo, a lawyer and one of the plaintiffs, told the AP that they saw an illicit association to commit 'an indeterminate number of frauds' in the episode. 'Within this illicit association, the crime of fraud was committed, in which the president’s actions were essential,' he said. Baldiviezo signed the petition with Marcos Zelaya, another lawyer; the engineer Maria Eva Koutsovitis; and the economist Claudio Lozano, who presided over the Argentine Central Bank during former president Alberto Fernandez’s administration. Criminal justice is expected to assign a judge to the case or refer it to a prosecutor for further investigation Monday. The plaintiffs saw in Milei’s action an operation known in the crypto world as 'rug pull.' This occurs when a developer launches an attractive token to lure investors but later abandons it after funds become overpriced, making the tokens worthless. Baldiviezo also added that Milei violated the Public Ethics Law. 'The President shared a post on his personal accounts announcing the launch of KIP Protocol’s project, as he does daily with many entrepreneurs who wish to launch projects in Argentina to create jobs and attract investments,' the President's Office said. After deleting the post, Milei said on X he was unaware of the currency's development and blamed his political opponents for trying to exploit the episode. 'I was not aware of the details of the project, and after getting informed, I decided not to continue promoting it (which is why I deleted the tweet),' he said. The President's Office said the country's Anti-Corruption Office, which operates under the Executive Branch, would act immediately. The administration also acknowledged that Milei and members of his administration recently met with representatives of KIP Protocol at the presidential office. 'All the information gathered in the investigation will be handed over to the judiciary to determine if any of the companies or individuals linked to the KIP Protocol project committed a crime,' the Milei administration said in the Saturday statement. Hayden Mark Davis, one of KIP Protocol's representatives who met with Milei, blamed the president for the crypto currency's collapse in a video posted on his social media Saturday. 'Despite prior commitments, Milei and his team unexpectedly changed their position, withdrawing their support and deleting all previous posts on social media,' Davis said.	https://www.voanews.com/a/argentine-lawyers-charge-president-milei-with-fraud-over-cryptocurrency-promotion/7977382.html	2025-02-16T16:20:18-08:00	
Scientists race to discover depth of ocean damage from Los Angeles wildfires	Los Angeles — On a recent Sunday, Tracy Quinn drove down the Pacific Coast Highway to assess damage wrought upon the coastline by the Palisades Fire. The water line was darkened by ash. Burnt remnants of washing machines and dryers and metal appliances were strewn about the shoreline. Sludge carpeted the water's edge. Waves during high tide lapped onto charred homes, pulling debris and potentially toxic ash into the ocean as they receded. 'It was just heartbreaking,' said Quinn, president and CEO of the environmental group Heal the Bay, whose team has reported ash and debris some 25 miles (40 kilometers) south of the Palisades burn area west of Los Angeles. As crews work to remove potentially hundreds of thousands of tons of hazardous materials from the Los Angeles wildfires, researchers and officials are trying to understand how the fires on land have impacted the sea. The Palisades and Eaton fires scorched thousands of homes, businesses, cars and electronics, turning everyday items into hazardous ash made of pesticides, asbestos, plastics, lead, heavy metals and more. Since much of it could end up in the Pacific Ocean, there are concerns and many unknowns about how the fires could affect life under the sea. 'We haven't seen a concentration of homes and buildings burned so close to the water,' Quinn said. Fire debris and potentially toxic ash could make the water unsafe for surfers and swimmers, especially after rainfall that can transport chemicals, trash and other hazards into the sea. Longer term, scientists worry if and how charred urban contaminants will affect the food supply. The atmospheric river and mudslides that pummeled the Los Angeles region last week exacerbated some of those fears. When the fires broke out in January, one of Mara Dias' first concerns was ocean water contamination. Strong winds were carrying smoke and ash far beyond the blazes before settling at sea, said the water quality manager for the Surfrider Foundation, an environmental nonprofit. Scientists on board a research vessel during the fires detected ash and waste on the water as far as 100 miles (161 kilometers) offshore, said marine ecologist Julie Dinasquet with the University of California, San Diego’s Scripps Institution of Oceanography. Things like twigs and shard. They described the smell as electronics burning, she recalled, 'not like a nice campfire.' Runoff from rain also is a huge and immediate concern. Rainfall picks up contaminants and trash while flushing toward the sea through a network of drains and rivers. That runoff could contain 'a lot of nutrients, nitrogen and phosphate that end up in the ash of the burn material that can get into the water,' said Dias, as well as 'heavy metals, something called PAHs, which are given off when you burn different types of fuel.' Mudslides and debris flows in the Palisades Fire burn zone also can dump more hazardous waste into the ocean. After fires, the soil in burn scars is less able to absorb rainfall and can develop a layer that repels water from the remains of seared organic material. When there is less organic material to hold the soil in place, the risks of mudslides and debris flows increase. Los Angeles County officials, with help from other agencies, have set thousands of feet of concrete barriers, sandbags, silt socks and more to prevent debris from reaching beaches. The LA County Board of Supervisors also recently passed a motion seeking state and federal help to expand beach clean ups, prepare for storm runoff and test ocean water for potential toxins and chemicals, among other things. Beyond the usual samples, state water officials and others are testing for total and dissolved metals such as arsenic, lead and aluminum and volatile organic compounds. They also are sampling for microplastics, polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons, or PAHs, that are harmful to human and aquatic life, and polychlorinated biphenyls, or PCBs, a group of man-made chemicals shown to cause cancer in animals and other serious health effects. Now banned from being manufactured, they were used in products like pigments, paints and electrical equipment. County public health officials said chemical tests of water samples last month did not raise health concerns, so they downgraded one beach closure to an ocean water advisory. Beachgoers were still advised to stay out of the water. Dinasquet and colleagues are working to understand how far potentially toxic ash and debris dispersed across the ocean, how deep and how fast they sunk and, over time, where it ends up. Forest fires can deposit important nutrients like iron and nitrogen into the ocean ecosystem, boosting the growth of phytoplankton, which can create a positive, cascading effect across the ecosystem. But the potentially toxic ash from urban coastal fires could have dire consequences, Dinasquet said. 'Reports are already showing that there was a lot of lead and asbestos in the ash,' she added. 'This is really bad for people so it's probably also very bad for the marine organisms.'	https://www.voanews.com/a/scientists-race-to-discover-depth-of-ocean-damage-from-los-angeles-wildfires/7977145.html	2025-02-16T14:55:56-08:00	
Turkish delegation meets with Kurdish leader in Iraq amid peace efforts	Baghdad — A Turkish opposition party delegation arrived in Iraq’s semiautonomous Kurdish region Sunday against the backdrop of peace efforts between Ankara and a banned Kurdish separatist movement in Turkey. The delegation led by Sirri Sureyya Onder and Pervin Buldan, two senior officials with the pro-Kurdish People’s Equality and Democracy Party, or DEM, in Turkey, met with Masoud Barzani, the head of the Kurdistan Democratic Party — the dominant Kurdish party in Iraq — in Irbil Sunday. Barzani’s office said in a statement that they discussed 'the peace process in Turkey' and that the Turkish delegation conveyed a message from Abdullah Ocalan, the imprisoned leader of Turkey’s banned Kurdistan Workers’ Party, or PKK. Barzani 'stressed the need for all parties to intensify their efforts and endeavors to enable the peace process to achieve the desired results' and reiterated 'his full readiness to provide assistance and support to the peace process in Turkey and make it a success,' the statement said. The DEM party has long pressed for greater democracy in Turkey and rights for the country’s Kurdish population, and to improve conditions for the imprisoned Ocalan. Ocalan, 75, founded the PKK, in 1978, which began an armed insurrection for an autonomous Kurdish state in Turkey’s southeast in 1984, costing tens of thousands of lives. The group is considered a terrorist organization by Turkey and its Western allies. The central Iraqi government in Baghdad announced a ban on the group, which maintains bases in northern Iraq, last year. Captured in 1999 and convicted of treason, Ocalan has been serving a life sentence on Imrali Island in the Marmara Sea. The government of Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan has traditionally had an antagonistic relationship with the left-wing DEM party, frequently ousting its elected officials on charges of ties to the PKK and replacing them with state appointed officials. However, this icy relationship began thawing last October, when Erdogan’s coalition partner, far-right nationalist politician Devlet Bahceli suggested that Ocalan could be granted parole, if his group renounces violence and disbands. The peace effort comes at a time when Erdogan may need support from the DEM party in parliament to enact a new constitution that could allow him to stay in power for unlimited terms. The Turkish Constitution doesn't allow Erdogan, who has been in power since 2003 as prime minister and later as president, to run for office again unless an early election is called — something that would also require the support of the pro-Kurdish party. Even as the latest peace efforts are underway, Erdogan’s government has widened a crackdown on the opposition, arresting journalists and politicians. Several elected Kurdish mayors have been ousted from office and replaced with state appointed officials, the latest this Saturday, when the mayor of Van municipality in eastern Turkey was removed from his post and replaced with the state-appointed governor. Meanwhile, conflict is ongoing between Turkish-backed armed groups and Kurdish forces in northeastern Syria. Turkey views the Syrian Democratic Forces, a U.S.-backed military Kurdish alliance in Syria, as an extension of the PKK. The SDF is in negotiations with the new government in Damascus following the ouster of then Syrian President Bashar Assad in a rebel offensive. While most former insurgent groups have agreed to dissolve and integrate into the new Syrian army, the SDF has refused so far. Turkish Foreign Minister Hakan Fidan said Saturday that the government would reconsider its military presence in northeastern Syria if that country’s new leaders eliminate the presence of the PKK in the area. Also Saturday, Kurds in northeastern Syria staged a mass protest to demand Ocalan's release.	https://www.voanews.com/a/turkish-delegation-meets-with-kurdish-leader-in-iraq-amid-peace-efforts/7977143.html	2025-02-16T14:46:58-08:00	
US Presidents Day: How did it evolve from reverence to retail	Norfolk, Virginia — Like the other Founding Fathers, George Washington was uneasy about the idea of publicly celebrating his life. He was the first leader of a new republic, not a king. And yet the United States will once again commemorate its first president Monday, 293 years after he was born. The meaning of Presidents Day has changed dramatically, from being mostly unremarkable and filled with work for Washington in the 1700s to the bonanza of consumerism it has become today. For some historians, the holiday has lost all discernible meaning. Historian Alexis Coe, author of 'You Never Forget Your First: A Biography of George Washington,' has said she thinks about Presidents Day in much the same way as the towering monument in D.C. bearing his name. 'It’s supposed to be about Washington, but can you really point to anything that looks or sounds like him?' she remarked in an interview with The Associated Press in 2024. 'Jefferson and Lincoln are presented as people with limbs and noses and words associated with their memorials. And he’s just a giant, granite point. He has been sanded down to have absolutely no identifiable features.' Here is a look at how things have evolved: Washington's birthdays were celebrated, sometimes Washington was born Feb. 22, 1732, on Popes Creek Plantation near the Potomac River in Virginia. Technically, though, he was born Feb. 11 under the ancient Julian calendar, which was still in use for the first 20 years of his life. The Gregorian calendar, intended to more accurately mark the solar year, was adopted in 1752, adding 11 days. Either way, Washington paid little attention to his birthday, according to Mountvernon.org, the website of the organization that manages his estate. Surviving records make no mention of observances at Mount Vernon, while his diary shows he was often hard at work. 'If he had it his way, he would be at home with his family,' Coe said. 'Maybe some beloved nieces and nephews (and friend) Marquis de Lafayette would be ideal. And Martha’s recipe for an indulgent cake. But that’s about it.' Washington’s birthday was celebrated by his peers in government when he was president, mostly. Congress voted during his first two terms to take a short commemorative break each year, with one exception, his last birthday in office, Coe said. By then, Washington was less popular, partisanship was rampant, and many members of his original Cabinet were gone, including Thomas Jefferson. 'One way to show their disdain for his Federalist policies was to keep working through his birthday,' Coe said. The Library of Congress does note a French military officer, the Comte de Rochambeau, threw a ball celebrating Washington’s 50th birthday in 1782. After his death, a market for memorabilia is born Washington was very aware of his inaugural role as president and its distinction from the British crown. He didn’t want to be honored like a king, Seth Bruggeman, a history professor at Temple University in Philadelphia, told the AP last year. Still, he said, a market for Washington memorabilia sprang up almost immediately after his death in 1799 at age 67, with people snapping up pottery and reproductions of etchings portraying him as a divine figure going off into heaven. 'Even in that early moment, Americans kind of conflated consumerism with patriotic memory,' said Bruggeman, whose books include 'Here, George Washington Was Born: Memory, Material Culture, and the Public History of a National Monument.' Making it official with parades and festivals It wasn’t until 1832, the centennial of his birth, that Congress established a committee to arrange national 'parades, orations and festivals,' according to the Congressional Research Service. Only in 1879 was his birthday formally made into a legal holiday for federal employees in the District of Columbia. The official designation for the holiday is Washington’s Birthday, although it has come to be known informally as Presidents Day. Arguments have been made to honor President Lincoln as well because his birth date falls nearby, on Feb. 12. A small number of states, including Illinois, observe Lincoln’s birthday as a public holiday, according to the Library of Congress. And some commemorate both Lincoln and Washington on Presidents Day. But on the federal level, the day is still officially Washington’s Birthday. A shift to consumerism By the late 1960s, Washington’s Birthday was one of nine federal holidays that fell on specific dates on different days of the week, according to a 2004 article in the National Archives’ Prologue magazine. Congress voted to move some of those to Mondays, following concerns that were in part about absenteeism among government workers when a holiday fell midweek. But lawmakers also noted clear benefits to the economy, including boosts in retail sales and travel on three-day weekends. The Uniform Monday Holiday Act took effect in 1971, moving Presidents Day to the third Monday in February. Sales campaigns soared, historian C. L. Arbelbide wrote in Prologue. Bruggeman said Washington and the other Founding Fathers 'would have been deeply worried' by how the holiday became taken over by commercial and private interests. 'They were very nervous about corporations,' Bruggeman said. 'It wasn’t that they forbade them. But they saw corporations as like little republics that potentially threatened the power of The Republic.' Coe, who is also a fellow at the Washington think tank New America, said by now the day is devoid of recognizable traditions. 'There’s no moment of reflection,' Coe said. Given today’s widespread cynicism toward the office, she added, that sort of reflection 'would probably be a good idea.'	https://www.voanews.com/a/us-presidents-day-how-did-it-evolve-from-reverence-to-retail/7977137.html	2025-02-16T14:32:22-08:00	
Uganda government offers to drop military trial of hunger-striking opponent	Kampala, Uganda — Uganda's government said Sunday it would drop a military trial against opposition figurehead Kizza Besigye, urging him to give up his hunger strike in jail, a minister said. The pledge was promptly rejected as 'suspicious' by Besigye's wife, UNAIDS executive director Winnie Byanyima. Besigye, a former ally turned rival of longtime President Yoweri Museveni, went on a hunger strike on February 10 in protest at his detention. Charging him with treason for allegedly threatening national security, the government has vowed to try him in a military court, despite a Supreme Court ruling that such a move against a civilian is unconstitutional. Now, however, 'the government is fast-tracking the transfer of Besigye's case from the court martial to the civil court,' Cabinet spokesperson and information minister Chris Baryomunsi told AFP. 'As a government, we are complying with the ruling of the Supreme Court.' The minister said in an earlier message on X that he had visited Besigye in prison Sunday 'in the presence of his personal doctors' and 'asked him to resume taking food' pending the transfer. The army, which has not yet commented on the announcement, had previously dismissed the Supreme Court ruling and insisted the military trial would go ahead. Besigye appeared in court for a hearing in a separate case Friday looking frail, prompting outrage from his supporters. Baryomunsi declined to say whether Sunday's pledge was prompted by the outcry. Byanyima told AFP on Sunday that she was 'very worried' about her husband's condition.	https://www.voanews.com/a/uganda-government-offers-to-drop-military-trial-of-hunger-striking-opponent/7977116.html	2025-02-16T13:19:53-08:00	
Colombian superstar Shakira cancels concert in Lima after being hospitalized	Lima, Peru — Colombian superstar Shakira canceled her Sunday concert in Lima after being hospitalized with an abdominal condition, the singer said. Shakira shared a statement on her Instagram and X accounts Sunday afternoon, saying she is currently hospitalized and that doctors informed her she was not in condition to perform. 'I am very sad that I will not be able to take the stage today. I have been deeply emotional and excited about reuniting with my beloved Peruvian audience,' she said. The singer arrived in Peru Friday evening, where she was scheduled to perform Sunday and Monday. The country is the second stop on her Latin America tour, Las Mujeres Ya No Lloran, following two nights in Brazil last week. Latin fans have given Shakira a warm welcome, with crowds gathering at airports to greet her. 'Thank you for such an emotional welcome, Lima!' she posted Saturday on Instagram. In her statement, Shakira said she hopes to recover soon. 'My plan is to perform this show as soon as possible. My team and the promoter are already working on a new date,' she said. The singer is touring in support of her latest album, Las Mujeres Ya No Lloran, in which she channels her highly publicized divorce into music. The record includes the global hit 'Shakira: Bzrp Music Sessions, Vol. 53' and won Best Latin Pop Album at the 2024 Grammy Awards earlier this month. Shakira’s tour continues across Latin America before heading to Canada and the U.S. in May for a series of concerts through June.	https://www.voanews.com/a/colombian-superstar-shakira-cancels-concert-in-lima-after-being-hospitalized/7977108.html	2025-02-16T13:09:50-08:00	
Mauritius ex-PM freed on bail in money-laundering probe	Port Louis, Mauritius — A court in Mauritius on Monday released on bail the island's former Prime Minister Pravind Jugnauth in a money-laundering probe after seizing suitcases of cash in raids on his alleged accomplices' homes. Police detained the 63-year-old along with his wife Kobita Jugnauth on Saturday and questioned them for several hours, police sources told AFP. Kobita Jugnauth was later released and Pravind Jugnauth was placed under formal arrest in the early hours of Sunday. In court in the capital Port Louis, the ex-premier denied the accusations. The judge released him pending a bail payment of 150,000 rupees ($16,000), in a written ruling seen by AFP. Police and court documents detailed searches at the homes of two other suspects who run a local leisure company. They said officers seized documents bearing the names of the Jugnauths, as well as luxury watches and suitcases of cash. Chagos Islands talks Prime minister from 2017 to 2024, Pravind Jugnauth is a member of one of the dynasties that have dominated the leadership of Mauritius, a stable and relatively prosperous Indian Ocean island nation, since it became independent from Britain in 1968. He oversaw a historic deal with Britain for Mauritius to regain sovereignty over the Chagos Islands following a long-running dispute. He and his Militant Socialist Movement suffered a crushing defeat in tense elections in November. He ceded office to center-left rival Navin Ramgoolam, who became prime minister for the third time. Ramgoolam's government reopened the Chagos negotiations, reportedly seeking greater financial compensation and to renegotiate the length of the proposed lease for a joint U.K.-U.S. military base. Under the Chagos deal, Britain will retain a lease for the base on the island of Diego Garcia. Both Mauritius and Britain have said that U.S. President Donald Trump's administration will have a say on the final terms of the agreement. The base is currently leased by Britain to the United States and has become one of its key military facilities in the Asia-Pacific. During the election campaign, both camps promised to improve the lives of ordinary Mauritians who face cost-of-living difficulties despite strong economic growth.	https://www.voanews.com/a/mauritius-ex-pm-freed-on-bail-in-money-laundering-probe/7977107.html	2025-02-16T13:03:36-08:00	
US, Ukrainian officials head to Saudi Arabia as talks loom on ending Russia's war	Kyiv, Ukraine — A Ukrainian delegation has arrived in Saudi Arabia for meetings in preparation for a possible visit by President Volodymyr Zelenskyy, a Ukrainian minister said Sunday, at a time of intense speculation over planned U.S.-Russia talks in the kingdom to end Moscow's war on its neighbor. It also comes as a top U.S. envoy revealed that he and a fellow negotiator appointed by U.S. President Donald Trump were heading to Saudi Arabia. Ukrainian Economy Minister Yulia Svyrydenko, who also serves as first deputy prime minister, didn't clarify whether there is a link between Zelenskyy's possible trip and the previously announced U.S.-Russia talks. In a Facebook post, she said that the Ukrainian delegation's focus is on strengthening economic ties, as Kyiv 'prepares to sign important economic agreements with countries in the region.' Svyrydenko didn't say anything about when Zelenskyy might go to Saudi Arabia and who he might meet with. No further details were immediately available. Andriy Yermak, a top adviser to Zelenskyy, said earlier Sunday that there was no possibility of Ukrainian and Russian representatives meeting directly in the immediate future. In a Telegram post, Yermak said the Ukrainians weren't planning to do so 'until we develop a plan' to end the war and bring about a 'just peace.' Mykhailo Podolyak, another Zelenskyy adviser, on Saturday denied that Ukraine will participate in any planned U.S.-Russia meetings in Saudi Arabia. 'There is nothing on the negotiating table that would be worth discussing,' Podolyak said on Ukrainian television. But Svyrydenko's remarks came within hours of an announcement by Steve Witkoff, Trump's close ally and special envoy to the Middle East, that high-level meetings were imminent in Saudi Arabia to discuss a negotiated settlement to the war in Ukraine. Speaking to Fox News Channel's 'Sunday Morning Futures' program, Witkoff said that he and national security adviser Mike Waltz will be 'having meetings at the direction of the president,' and hope to make 'some really good progress with regard to Russia-Ukraine.' Witkoff didn't specify who they would be meeting and what they would discuss, but he said that he was leaving for Saudi Arabia on Sunday evening. Following a lengthy phone call with Russian President Vladimir Putin on Wednesday, Trump noted that they 'agreed to have our respective teams start negotiations immediately' on ending the fighting. The president appointed Witkoff and Waltz to lead those talks, alongside U.S. Secretary of State Marco Rubio and CIA Director John Ratcliffe. Earlier this week, Russian officials and state media took a triumphant tone after Trump jettisoned three years of U.S. policy and announced that he would likely meet soon with Putin to negotiate a peace deal in the almost three-year war in Ukraine. Trump's announcement created a major diplomatic upheaval that could herald a watershed moment for Ukraine and Europe. Zelenskyy said that he wouldn't accept any negotiations about Ukraine that don't include his country. European governments have also demanded a seat at the table. Putin has been ostracized by the West since Russia's full-scale invasion of Ukraine on Feb. 24, 2022. In 2023, the International Criminal Court issued an arrest warrant for the Russian leader. Witkoff, the U.S. special envoy, didn't directly respond to the question about whether Ukraine would have to give up a 'significant portion' of its territory as part of any negotiated settlement. 'Those are details, and I'm not dismissive of the details, they're important. But I think the beginning here is trust-building. It's getting everybody to understand that this war does not belong continuing, that it should end. That's what the president has directed us to do,' he said.	https://www.voanews.com/a/us-ukrainian-officials-head-to-saudi-arabia-as-talks-loom-on-ending-russia-s-war/7977072.html	2025-02-16T11:50:07-08:00

Conclave' leads the pack, 'Emilia Perez' faces test at Britain's BAFTA film awards	London — Stars including Cynthia Erivo, Hugh Grant, Ariana Grande, Lupita Nyong’o, Timothee Chalamet and Saoirse Ronan walked the red carpet at London’s Royal Festival Hall for the awards, known as BAFTAs. The prizes are closely watched for clues about who will triumph at Hollywood’s Academy Awards on March 3, in an unusually hard-to-call awards season. They also have a distinctly British accent. The ceremony kicked off with its kilt-wearing host, Scottish actor David Tennant, leading the audience in a rousing singalong of The Proclaimers’ anthem 'I’m Gonna be (500 Miles).' The best film contenders are 'Conclave,' 'Emilia Perez,' Brady Corbet’s 215-minute architecture epic ' The Brutalist,' the James Mangold-directed Bob Dylan biopic 'A Complete Unknown' and Sean Baker’s Brighton Beach tragicomedy 'Anora.' 'Anora,' about an exotic dancer entangled with a Russian oligarch's son, is emerging as a best picture favorite after winning the top prizes last week at the Producers Guild Awards and the Directors Guild Awards. 'The Brutalist' has nine BAFTA nominations, while 'Anora,' the sci-fi epic 'Dune: Part Two' and musical 'Wicked' have seven each. 'A Complete Unknown' and Irish-language hip-hop drama 'Kneecap' received six nominations apiece. Nominees in the category of outstanding British film include Andrea Arnold’s 'Bird,' Steve McQueen’s 'Blitz,' Ridley Scott’s 'Gladiator II' and animated adventure 'Wallace and Gromit: Vengeance Most Fowl,' which won the award for best family and children's film. The leading actor favorite is 'The Brutalist' star Adrien Brody, who faces stiff competition from Fiennes and Chalamet, who plays the young Dylan in 'A Complete Unknown.' The other male actors nominated are Grant for his creepy role in the horror film ' Heretic,' Colman Domingo in real-life prison drama ' Sing Sing ' and Sebastian Stan for his portrayal of a young Donald Trump in 'The Apprentice.' Stan, who is also Oscar nominated, said it was 'incredibly validating' to get recognition for the film, which initially struggled to find an American distributor. It's an origins story that focuses on Trump's relationship with ruthless power broker Roy Cohn, played by Jeremy Strong. 'We were told this was going to be a thankless job that was never going to lead to anything,' Stan said, describing the movie as a 'fair' depiction of the president. Whoever takes the best actress award will be a first-time BAFTA winner. Nominees are Gascon, Demi Moore for body-horror film ' The Substance,' Mikey Madison for 'Anora,' Ronan for 'The Outrun,' Erivo for 'Wicked' and Marianne Jean-Baptiste for the Mike Leigh drama 'Hard Truths.' Erivo or Jean-Baptiste would be the first non-white performer to win the leading actress BAFTA. British stars on the red carpet had high praise for Jean-Baptiste's blistering performance as a woman beset by depression, and for Moore, already a Golden Globe winner for 'The Substance.' 'I’m very excited for Demi Moore tonight,' said 'Game of Thrones' and 'Severance' star Gwendoline Christie. She said Moore's 'visceral' performance 'transcends so many different boundaries.' What's new and where to watch Britain’s film academy introduced changes to increase the awards’ diversity in 2020, when no women were nominated as best director for the seventh year running and all 20 nominees in the lead and supporting performer categories were white. Most winners are chosen by members of the 8,000-strong U.K. academy of industry professionals, with one — the Rising Star Award —- selected by public vote from a short list of nominees. This year's contenders are performers Mikey Madison, Marisa Abela, Jharrel Jerome, David Jonsson and Nabhaan Rizwan. 'Willow' and 'Return of the Jedi' actor Warwick Davis will receive the academy’s top honor, the BAFTA Fellowship, for his screen career and work to create a more inclusive film industry. BAFTA chairwoman Sara Putt sent a message of strength to everyone hit by last month’s devastating Los Angeles wildfires. Jamie Lee Curtis, a supporting actress nominee for 'The Last Showgirl,' was absent because the fires delayed filming on her current work. Co-star Pamela Anderson will accept the prize for Curtis if she wins. The event was without a dash of royal glamour this year. Neither Prince William, who is honorary president of the British film academy, nor his wife Kate, is attending. The awards coincide with school holidays for their three children. The show will include a performance by grown-up boyband Take That, whose 2008 hit 'Greatest Day' features on the 'Anora' soundtrack. 'Wicked' wizard Jeff Goldblum will play piano during the ceremony’s tribute to people who have died in the past year. The ceremony airs on BBC in the United Kingdom and BritBox in North America and started at 1900 GMT (2 p.m. EST).	https://www.voanews.com/a/conclave-leads-the-pack-emilia-perez-faces-test-at-britain-s-bafta-film-awards/7977060.html	2025-02-16T11:30:01-08:00	
‘Captain America: Brave New World’ soars toward $100 million holiday weekend	Captain America: Brave New World' infused some blockbuster cash into the North American box office, bringing in $88.5 million in ticket sales over the weekend, according to studio estimates Sunday. The Walt Disney Co. release is by far the biggest opener of 2025 and the company predicts it will hit $100 million domestically and $192.4 globally by the end of Monday's Presidents' Day holiday. It’s Marvel's first major release since 'Deadpool & Wolverine' broke records last summer and re-energized a Marvel fanbase that some worried was weakening after the poor showing for 'The Marvels.' Playing in 4,105 locations in the U.S. and Canada, 'Brave New World' is also a major transition for the 'Captain America' brand: Anointing Anthony Mackie’s Sam Wilson as the new Cap, officially taking over from Chris Evans, who played the character for almost a decade. Harrison Ford co-stars as the U.S. president who transforms into the Red Hulk. But 'Brave New World,' directed by Julius Onah, had a bit of a handicap going into the weekend: Poor reviews, though superhero movies can soar without the stamp of approval from critics. The film is currently sitting at 51% 'rotten' on Rotten Tomatoes. It's not the worst in the Marvel Cinematic Universe — 'Eternals' has a 47% rating and 'Ant-Man and The Wasp: Quantumania' has a 46% — but the latest film is on the very low end of the spectrum. In his review for The Associated Press, Mark Kennedy wrote that it is, 'a highly processed, empty calorie, regret-later candy of a movie.' Audiences were more generous in their opinions. The 'verified audience score' from Rotten Tomatoes was 80% and its CinemaScore was a B-. Exit polls showed that men made up 63% of the opening weekend audience. The bar for biggest opening of the year wasn’t terribly high: 'Dog Man' held the title for two weeks with its $36 million launch. And 'Brave New World's' showing is the middle range for an MCU film. Not accounting for inflation, it sits between 'Guardians of the Galaxy' and 'Thor: The Dark World.' It also cost significantly less than many of the big budget Marvel movies, with a reported production price tag of $180 million, excluding the millions spent on marketing and promotion. After only one Marvel movie in 2024, 'Brave New World' is the first of three major theatrical releases set for 2025. It is to be followed by 'Thunderbolts(asterisk)' in May and 'The Fantastic Four: First Steps' in July. 'The superhero genre has taken a hit over the past few years, but audiences still have a huge interest in seeing them on the big screen,' said Paul Dergarabedian, the senior media analyst for Comscore. Second place at this week's box office went to 'Paddington in Peru,' the third installment in the beloved franchise, which finally opened in North America this weekend. Released by Sony, it earned an estimated $13 million and should hit $16 million by Monday. The StudioCanal film opened in the United Kingdom in early November 2024 and went into the weekend with $104 million from its international run. Dougal Wilson took over directing duties for Paul King for this film, which also recast Emily Mortimer as Mrs. Brown, originally played by Sally Hawkins. The other main cast, including Ben Whishaw as Paddinton's voice, remained intact. Sony and Screen Gems' slasher 'Heart Eyes' landed in third place with $10 million, up 20% from its opening last weekend. Fourth place went to 'Dog Man' with $9.7 million. The Chinese blockbuster 'Ne Zha 2' rounded out the top five. It opened on 660 screens in North America and made $7.2 million. Overall, the box office is up 20% from last year. This weekend also saw the release of a new 'Bridget Jones' movie, subtitled 'Mad About the Boy,' which went straight to Universal’s streaming service Peacock, forgoing theaters in the U.S. In the U.K. and Ireland, it made an estimated $14.9 million, outgrossing 'Captain America: Brave New World.' Universal Pictures International reported $32.3 million in grosses from all 70 territories. The final domestic figures will be released Tuesday. Estimated ticket sales for Friday through Sunday at U.S. and Canadian theaters, according to Comscore: 1. 'Captain America: Brave New World,' $88.5 million. 2. 'Paddington in Peru,' $13 million. 3. 'Heart Eyes,' $10 million. 4. 'Dog Man,' $9.7 million. 5. 'Ne Zha 2,' $7.2 million. 6. 'Love Hurts,' $4.4 million. 7. 'Mufasa: The Lion King,' $4.2 million. 8. 'One of Them Days,' $3 million. 9. 'Companion,' $1.9 million. 10. 'Becoming Led Zeppelin,' $1.8 million.	https://www.voanews.com/a/captain-america-brave-new-world-soars-toward-100-million-holiday-weekend/7977044.html	2025-02-16T10:49:32-08:00	
Lebanon says woman killed as Israeli forces fire on returnees to southern Lebanon ahead of ceasefire deadline	BEIRUT — A woman was killed and several other people wounded Sunday when Israeli forces opened fire on a group of residents attempting to return to the village of Houla in southern Lebanon, the Lebanese state-run news agency reported. There was no immediate comment from the Israeli military on the incident, which comes two days before the deadline for implementation of a ceasefire agreement that ended the latest war between Israel and the Lebanese militant group Hezbollah in late November. It includes a full withdrawal of Israeli forces from southern Lebanon. The original deadline was in late January but Israel and Lebanon agreed to extend it to Feb. 18. Hours before they agreed to the extension on Jan. 27, hundreds of protesters attempted to enter villages still occupied by the Israeli army to demand its withdrawal, and Israeli forces opened fire in several locations, killing more than 20 people. Israel blamed Hezbollah for sending 'rioters.' It remained unclear whether Israel will fully withdraw from Lebanese territory on Tuesday. Hezbollah leader Naim Kassem said in a televised speech Sunday that Israel 'must withdraw from all of the Lebanese territory that it has occupied' on Feb. 18. 'There can be no excuses, no five points or other details under any pretext or any title. This is the agreement,' he said. Kassem was referring to a proposal put forward by Israel that its forces would remain in five border points after the deadline. Lebanese officials have so far rejected this. Kassem said it was 'the primary and exclusive responsibility of the Lebanese state at this stage to apply all political pressure' to ensure that Israel withdraws fully. Internal tensions have risen in Lebanon in recent days ahead of the deadline and after Lebanese authorities revoked permission for an Iranian plane that had been set to travel from Tehran to Beirut, leaving dozens of Lebanese passengers stranded. The decision came after Israel had alleged that Iran was sending cash to Hezbollah via civilian flights and said it would 'use all available means' to stop it. The outgoing deputy commander of the U.N. peacekeeping force in Lebanon, known as UNIFIL, was injured Friday when protesters attacked a convoy taking peacekeepers to the Beirut airport. Kassem said Hezbollah was 'against the attack on UNIFIL' but also criticized the Lebanese army for tear gassing protesters who gathered 'peacefully' on Saturday. Kassem criticized the Lebanese government for banning Iranian flights, a decision that he said came after Israel threatened to strike the runway if the Iranian plane landed at Beirut airport. 'The problem is not that [Lebanese authorities] are ensuring the safety of civilians at a difficult time,' Kassem said. 'The problem is that this is the implementation of Israel's command. We are facing a real problem. Where is the national sovereignty? Are we employees of Israel, implementing the demands of the occupation?' Also on Sunday, Lebanon's National News Agency reported that an Israeli airstrike hit a bulldozer that was attempting to open roads that had been blocked by the Israeli military near the village of Marwahin. No casualties were reported. The Israeli army said in a statement that it had conducted 'precision, intelligence-based strikes on a number of military sites in Lebanese territory containing rocket launchers and weapons, where Hezbollah activity had been identified.' The Lebanese army, which has taken control of areas that the Israeli forces have withdrawn from, in a statement warned citizens not to try to enter areas where Lebanese troops have not yet deployed.	https://www.voanews.com/a/lebanon-says-woman-killed-as-israeli-forces-fire-on-returnees-to-southern-lebanon-ahead-of-ceasefire-deadline/7977040.html	2025-02-16T10:48:31-08:00	
US ‘border czar’ unhappy with pace of migrant arrests	U.S. President Donald Trump’s 'border czar' said Sunday he is 'not happy' with the number of undocumented migrants being arrested by immigration agents and deported to their home countries. Tom Homan told CNN’s 'State of the Union' show that 14,000 migrants had been arrested since Trump was inaugurated January 20, but said, 'We’ve got to do a lot more.' Many of those arrested have been flown back to their native lands or sent to the prison on the U.S. naval base at Guantanamo Bay in Cuba, while some have been released to live in the United States pending court proceedings. The U.S. estimates that 11 million undocumented migrants are living in the U.S., with Trump pledging during his 2024 run for the presidency to find and deport 'millions' of them. Officials say that the first arrests have targeted migrants convicted of crimes in the U.S. but that anyone living in the country without proper immigration documentation could be targeted. Homan said the number being deported is 'a lot higher' than under the former administration of President Joe Biden, but added, 'We’ve got to get the targeting and production up. It’s hard work.' The Trump administration has tapped law enforcement personnel from several U.S. agencies to augment those at the U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement agency, which normally controls migration issues. In the first days of the Trump administration, there were hundreds of migrant arrests daily and there still are, but just not as many. The Department of Homeland Security reported about 800 arrests a day in late January, topping out at 1,179 on Jan. 26. The figure was fewer than 600 a day in the first two weeks of February. The Trump administration had set a goal of 1,200 to 1,500 arrests a day.	https://www.voanews.com/a/us-border-czar-unhappy-with-pace-of-migrant-arrests/7977021.html	2025-02-16T10:16:46-08:00	
UK's Starmer to press Egypt for release of hunger-striking mum’s son	London — British Prime Minister Keir Starmer has told a mother who has been on hunger strike for 140 days that he will press the Egyptian government to release her son. In a statement Sunday, Starmer confirmed that he met Laila Soueif and said he will do 'all that I can' to secure the release of Alaa Abd el-Fattah, a British-Egyptian dual national who has spent more than five years in an Egyptian prison, accused of 'spreading false news' on social media. 'We will continue to raise his case at the highest levels of the Egyptian government and press for his release,' Starmer said. A representative of the family said the meeting took place Friday morning inside the prime minister's offices at 10 Downing Street and that it was the first time the pair had met. Soueif, 68, has been on a hunger strike since Sep. 29, the day her son was supposed to be released, consuming nothing but herbal tea, black coffee and rehydration salts. After more than four months, Soueif has lost around 25 kilograms (55 pounds). She took her campaign directly to the Foreign Office in December, camping out in front of it every weekday to make sure officials notice her. When that yielded no results, she switched in mid-January to the gates of Starmer’s office — the famous black door of 10 Downing Street. 'The great majority of mothers are prepared to die for their children; it just takes different forms,' she said earlier this month. 'Most mothers, if their children are in actual danger, you’re prepared to die.’’ One of Egypt’s most prominent pro-democracy activists, the 43-year-old Abd el-Fattah has spent most of the past 14 years behind bars since taking part in the 2011 uprising that toppled former President Hosni Mubarak. His most recent crime was 'liking' a Facebook post describing torture in Egyptian prisons. Abd el-Fattah has been in custody since September 2019 and was sentenced to five years in prison after a trial before an emergency security court. But when his release date came up last September, Egyptian authorities refused to count the more than two years he had spent in pre-trial detention and ordered him held until Jan. 3, 2027. Thousands of critics of Egyptian President Abdel Fattah el-Sissi have been locked up under dire conditions after unjust trials, human rights groups say.	https://www.voanews.com/a/uk-s-starmer-to-press-egypt-for-release-of-hunger-striking-mum-s-son/7977019.html	2025-02-16T10:13:19-08:00	
Pope is stable as he recovers from respiratory infection, Vatican says	Rome — Pope Francis had breakfast, read the newspapers and followed Mass on television Sunday after a second night sleeping well at the hospital where the 88-year-old pontiff is being treated for a respiratory tract infection, the Vatican said. Francis' condition was stable, as he continues his unspecified drug therapy, alternating in the afternoon between reading and resting, Vatican spokesman Matteo Bruni said. The Argentine pope, a known workaholic who keeps up a grueling pace despite his many ailments, was admitted to Rome's Gemelli hospital on Friday after a weeklong bout of bronchitis worsened. It was his fourth hospitalization since his 2013 election and raised questions about his increasingly precarious health. Doctors confirmed that the pope had a respiratory tract infection and prescribed 'absolute rest' alongside unspecified drug therapies. Francis skipped his traditional Sunday noon blessing, declining to even come to his hospital window to wave to a small crowd below that had gathered in hopes of cheering him on. The @Pontifex social media account, which isn't written by the pope himself, thanked people for their prayers on Sunday. 'Thank you for the affection, prayer and closeness with which you are accompanying me in these days,' the post read. Francis had part of one lung removed after a lung infection when he was a young man and is prone to respiratory infections. In 2023, he spent three days at Gemelli to be treated for what he later revealed was an acute case of pneumonia. Despite his Feb. 6 bronchitis diagnosis, Francis had kept up a frenetic pace of late, packing his days with private and public audiences, while taking on the added obligations of steering the Catholic Church through its Holy Year. The Vatican has canceled his events through Monday at least. On Sunday, a Holy Year Mass he was supposed to preside over for visiting artists was instead celebrated by the Vatican culture minister. The Vatican hasn't specified what type of respiratory tract infection the pope has. Sometimes bronchitis can lead to pneumonia, a deeper and far more serious infection of the lungs' air sacs. Treatment varies by severity but can include providing oxygen through a nasal tube or mask, intravenous fluids — and treatment of the underlying cause of the infection.	https://www.voanews.com/a/pope-is-stable-as-he-recovers-from-respiratory-infection-vatican-says-/7977015.html	2025-02-16T10:03:37-08:00	
VOA immigration weekly recap, Feb. 9-15	Editor's note: Here is a look at immigration-related news around the U.S. this week. Questions? Tips? Comments? Email the VOA immigration team: ImmigrationUnit@voanews.com. Trump administration moves quickly with mass deportation plans Since taking office, U.S. President Donald Trump has declared illegal immigration a national emergency. The Trump administration ramped up its mass deportation efforts, expanding the use of expedited removal and using Guantanamo Bay as a detention site for certain migrants. The moves have raised concerns among immigration advocates, who argue that the policies lack transparency and could violate due process rights. VOA’s immigration reporter, Aline Barros, reports. US fires 20 immigration judges from backlogged courts The administration of President Donald Trump has fired 20 immigration judges without explanation, a union official said Saturday amid sweeping moves to shrink the size of the federal government. On Friday, 13 judges who had yet to be sworn in and five assistant chief immigration judges were dismissed without notice, said Matthew Biggs, president of the International Federation of Professional & Technical Engineers, which represents federal workers. Two other judges were fired under similar circumstances last week. The Associated Press reports. With doors closed to US, asylum-seekers turn to a new life in Mexico When Angelica Delgado took a one-way flight to Mexico as she fled Cuba in December, she was set on seeking asylum in the United States. But after President Donald Trump effectively slammed the door on asylum-seekers crossing the U.S. border when he took office last month, the 23-year-old recalibrated her plans. She decided she would seek protection in Mexico. The Associated Press reports. US deports 119 migrants from several nations to Panama Panama has received the first U.S. flight carrying deportees from other nations as the administration of President Donald Trump takes Panama up on its offer to act as a stopover for expelled migrants, the Central American nation's president said Thursday. 'Yesterday, a flight from the United States Air Force arrived with 119 people from diverse nationalities of the world,' President Jose Raul Mulino said Thursday in his weekly news briefing. He said migrants from China, Uzbekistan, Pakistan, Afghanistan, and other countries were on board. The Associated Press reports. Chicago nonprofit helps undocumented migrants afraid to leave home Amid nationwide immigration raids, a community organization in Chicago is helping undocumented migrants who say they are afraid to leave their homes for fear of being detained. Veronica Villafane narrates this report by Enrique Garcia Fuentes. Arrests for illegal border crossings fall in Texas An idled Border Patrol bus sat empty this past week, on standby for any migrants surrendering near the southern tip of Texas. Agents in two speedboats zipped by pockets of sandy shores, known landing spots for people entering the U.S. illegally from Mexico on inner tubes, but saw nothing suspicious. Once-busy river landings near the Texas border city of Mission were barren of the migrants who previously crossed there, although the riverbank was littered with clothes, plastic bracelets issued by smugglers and a teddy bear on an unusually cold Thursday morning. The Associated Press reports. New York City mayor to allow ICE agents at Rikers jail New York City Mayor Eric Adams says he will allow federal immigration officials to operate at the city's Rikers Island jail following a meeting Thursday with President Donald Trump's border czar. Adams said he will issue an executive order reestablishing the U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement presence at the complex — one of the nation's largest and most notorious lockups — as had been the case under prior administrations.

US: Hamas ‘must be eradicated’	The U.S. fully endorsed Israel’s war aims in Gaza on Sunday, with Secretary of State Marco Rubio saying that Hamas 'must be eradicated' and 'cannot continue as a military or government force.' Rubio met with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu in Jerusalem at the start of a regional tour as the first phase of a tenuous Israel-Hamas ceasefire expires in two weeks, with the second segment yet to be negotiated. Rubio, on his first trip to the Middle East as the new top U.S. diplomat, told Netanyahu that 'as long as [Hamas] stands as a force that can govern or as a force that can administer or as a force that can threaten by use of violence, peace becomes impossible.' Rubio is likely to face continued opposition from Arab nations about U.S. President Donald Trump’s plan to move Palestinians out of Gaza into neighboring countries and then for Israel to hand over the narrow territory along the shores of the Mediterranean Sea to the U.S. to own and redevelop. While U.S. allies and adversaries alike have assailed Trump’s Gaza plan, Netanyahu has welcomed it, saying that he and Trump have a 'common strategy' for Gaza's future. Echoing Trump, the Israeli leader said 'the gates of hell would be open' if Hamas does not release dozens of remaining hostages abducted in its Oct. 7, 2023, attack that triggered the war. Hamas, a U.S.-designated terrorist group, freed three hostages Saturday in exchange for nearly 400 Palestinians who had been jailed in Israel. But the militants continue to hold dozens of hostages they captured in the terror attack that killed 1,200 people. Israel’s counteroffensive during 15 months of fighting in Gaza has killed more than 48,000 Palestinians, according to the territory's health ministry, which does not distinguish between combatants and civilians. Israel, without proving evidence, says it has killed over 17,000 militants. Rubio and Netanyahu met as the first phase of the ceasefire nears its end. In the second phase, the tentative plan calls for Hamas to release dozens of remaining hostages in exchange for more Palestinian prisoners, drafting of a permanent truce and the withdrawal of Israeli forces. But the detailed terms of the deal have yet to be negotiated. The tough U.S. stance aligning with Netanyahu’s position could complicate efforts to continue talks with Hamas, which, despite suffering heavy losses in the war, remains intact and in control of Gaza. Some of Netanyahu’s supporters in the Israeli government want to continue the war when the first phase of the ceasefire ends but resuming it could endanger the lives of the remaining hostages. Netanyahu has offered Hamas a chance to surrender and send its top leaders into exile, but Hamas has rejected such a scenario. Meanwhile, despite the ceasefire largely holding, the Israeli military said it carried out an airstrike early Sunday on people who approached its forces in southern Gaza. The Hamas-run Interior Ministry said the strike killed three of its policemen while they were securing the entry of aid trucks near Rafah, on the Egyptian border. Hamas described the attack as a 'serious violation' of the ceasefire and accused Netanyahu of trying to sabotage the deal. During his tour of the region, Rubio was not scheduled to meet with any Palestinian officials. Egypt says it is hosting an Arab summit on Feb. 27, and is working with other countries on a counterproposal that would allow for Gaza to be rebuilt without removing its population. Human rights groups say the expulsion of Palestinians would likely violate international law. Arab nations have long called for creation of an independent Palestinian state to exist alongside Israel, which the U.S. has also supported. But Netanyahu opposes a two-state solution and U.S. ownership of Gaza also would likely end the possibility of a Palestinian state encompassing Gaza and the Israeli-occupied West Bank. Egypt has warned that any mass influx of Palestinians from Gaza would undermine its nearly half-century-old peace treaty with Israel, a cornerstone of American influence in the region. Rubio is also set to visit the United Arab Emirates and Saudi Arabia. The United Arab Emirates was the leading force behind the 2020 Abraham Accords in which four Arab states normalized relations with Israel during Trump's first White House term. Trump hopes to expand the accords to include Saudi Arabia, potentially offering closer U.S. defense ties, but the kingdom has said it will not normalize relations with Israel without a pathway to a Palestinian state.

Flooding in US Southeast leaves 2 dead while snow, ice and wind cause winter misery elsewhere	LOUISVILLE, Ky. — Much of the United States faced another round of biting winter weather on Sunday, with torrential rains causing intense flooding in Kentucky and resulting in at least two deaths. The northern Plains faced life-threatening cold, and tornado watches were issued for parts of Georgia and Florida. In Kentucky, a 73-year-old man was found dead in floodwaters in Clay County, WKYT-TV reported. Clay County Emergency Management Deputy Director Revelle Berry confirmed the fatality but did not provide additional details. Severe storms also swept through parts of Florida and Georgia, where tornado watches were in effect early Sunday, the National Weather Service said. Elsewhere, bone-chilling cold is expected for the Northern Plains with low temperatures into the minus 30s F near the Canadian border. Dangerously cold wind chill temperatures in the Dakotas and Minnesota of minus 40 Celsius (minus 40 Fahrenheit) to minus 45.6 C (minus 50 F) are expected. Heavy snowfall amounts were expected in parts of New England and northern New York. In some areas, wind gusts could reach about 97 kph (60 mph) and create 'hazardous whiteout conditions,' the NWS said. Kentucky faces severe flooding The Kentucky Department of Fish and Wildlife said there was an investigation into a death and a rescue operation was under way in Hart County, WNKY-TV reported. The station reported a youth died and a second victim was missing in flooding Saturday evening. The Fish and Wildlife department and the Hart County Sheriff’s Office did not immediately respond to a request for more information from The Associated Press. Water submerged cars and buildings in Kentucky and mudslides blocked roads in Virginia. Both of the states were under flood warnings, along with Tennessee and Arkansas. The National Weather Service warned residents to stay off the roads. Kentucky Gov. Andy Beshear preemptively declared a state of emergency in Kentucky, where flash flooding was expected into Sunday. Flash flooding hit some roads in Bowling Green and parts of western Kentucky could face up to 20.3 centimeters (8 inches) of rain. 'We want to specifically put assets in places that flood and have flooded in the past,' Beshear said on social media. Beshear later used social media to update residents on areas in danger of flooding, including Jackson County, and said Kentucky State Police officers were performing wellness checks while shelters were opening in Pike County and Jenny Wiley State Resort Park in Prestonsburg. Beshear said in a post late Saturday that he had written to the White House requesting an emergency disaster declaration and federal funds for impacted areas. The Kentucky River Medical Center in the city of Jackson said it closed its emergency department and was transferring all patients to two other hospitals in the region. The hospital said it would re-evaluate conditions Sunday morning to determine when it can safely reopen. The north fork of the Kentucky River was forecast to crest nearly 4.3 meters (14 feet) above flood stage that afternoon, the weather service said. Photos posted by authorities and residents on social media showed cars and buildings underwater in south-central and eastern Kentucky. In Buchanan County, Virginia, the sheriff’s office said multiple roads were blocked by mudslides. The Simpson County Office of Emergency Management in Kentucky said authorities performed several rescues from stalled-out vehicles in floodwaters. 'Stay home if you can,' the office said on Facebook. New England faces snow, then sleet Meanwhile heavy snow was expected to blanket much of New England and then transition to sleet, making travel nearly impossible. The heaviest accumulations, possibly 30.5 centimeters (a foot) or more, were expected in upstate New York and portions of northern New England. 'Ice accumulations up to a quarter inch are forecast for some areas, making driving conditions dangerous. Heavy icing in some locations may result in downed trees and power outages,' the weather service warned. Snow and arctic temperatures swept much of the Midwest and Upper Plains, covering roads in eastern Nebraska, northern Iowa and much of Wisconsin. Winter weather advisories were issued for parts of those states and Michigan, with up to 10.6 centimeters (4 inches) of snow predicted throughout Iowa, southern Wisconsin and most of Michigan by Sunday evening. Frigid polar vortex Meteorologists said the U.S. was about to get its 10th and coldest polar vortex stretching event this season, with the northern Rockies and northern Plains first in line. Weather forces in the Arctic are combining to push the chilly air that usually stays near the North Pole into the U.S. and Europe. In Denver, where temperatures were expected to dip as low as minus 10 degrees C (14 degrees F) over the weekend, the city opened shelters for those living on the streets. California struggles with mudslides Dry weather returned to southern California after the strongest storm of the year. But the risk of rock and mudslides on wildfire-scarred hillsides continued because dangerous slides can strike even after rain stops, particularly in areas where vegetation that helps keep soil anchored has burned away. Water, debris and boulders rushed down the mountain in the city of Sierra Madre on Thursday night, trapping at least one car in the mud and damaging several home garages with mud and debris. Bulldozers cleaned up mud-covered streets in the city of 10,000 people. A storm in the Sierra Nevada dumped 1.8 meters (6 feet) of snow over 36 hours. Two Mammoth Mountain ski patrol workers were caught in an avalanche during avalanche mitigation work Friday morning, the resort said in a Facebook post. One was extracted and was responsive, while the other was taken to a hospital with serious injuries.	https://www.voanews.com/a/flooding-in-us-southeast-leaves-2-dead-while-snow-ice-and-wind-cause-winter-misery-elsewhere/7976927.html	2025-02-16T07:55:08-08:00	
Russian troops intensify attacks on Ukrainian forces in east, military says	KYIV — Russian troops have sharply stepped up their attacks in eastern Ukraine, Kyiv's military said on Sunday, as a NATO official predicted Moscow would increase the pace and intensity of its assaults with talks to end the war approaching. The main attacks were concentrated near the imperiled logistics hub of Pokrovsk, Kyiv said, with U.S. and Russian officials expected to hold talks in the coming days in Saudi Arabia and U.S President Donald Trump pushing for peace. Kyiv's military reported 261 combat engagements with Russia over a 24-hour period on Saturday, easily the largest number recorded this year and more than double the roughly 100 per day it reported in previous days. 'Today was the hardest day of 2025 at the front,' the Ukrainian DeepState military blog wrote late on Saturday. Moscow's troops advanced steadily in the east for much of the second half 2024, announcing the capture of village after village, though the intensity of the fighting dropped in January this year, according to Ukrainian military data. Russian forces have seized a swathe of territory to the south of Pokrovsk and are now pushing upwards to its southwest, threatening a main supply route into the outpost, the capture of which could open up more lines of attack for Russia. Despite being on the backfoot, President Volodymyr Zelenskiy reported a 'good result' in the east on Thursday and a military spokesman said Kyiv's forces had recaptured the village of Pishchane, about 5 km to Pokrovsk's south. 'It isn't so much the result of something collapsing for the Russians or some kind of magical weapon being delivered to Ukraine, no. Certain organizational actions were taken to help Ukrainians act more effectively,' Viktor Trehubov, a military spokesman, told Reuters. Ukraine has been using drones for deep strikes on Russia in an effort to inflict pain and strengthen its overall position. Russia has continued to conduct regular drone and missile strikes, while making advances on the ground in the east. 'I would expect a much stronger push. I would expect that we would see ... a lot of Russian efforts to advance,' a NATO official who requested anonymity told Reuters. Though Ukrainian officials are careful to praise Trump, his push to engage directly with the Russians without first consulting with Kyiv and to leave out the Europeans entirely is a cause for alarm in Ukraine and Europe. Kyiv has said it was not invited to take part in the talks in Saudi Arabia and that in any case it wants to devise a joint strategy with its U.S. and European allies before meeting Russian officials. France said on Sunday it would host a summit of European leaders on Monday to discuss the Ukraine war and European security as the continent scrambles to respond concretely to Trump's unilateral approach to the conflict. Zelenskiy gave figures for Russian strikes with aerial bombs and missiles that appeared to suggest they had increased in size in the last week. He said Russia had fired about 1,220 aerial bombs, more than 850 drones and 40 missiles at Ukraine, compared with 1,206, bombs, 750 drones and 10 missiles the week before.	https://www.voanews.com/a/russian-troops-intensify-attacks-on-ukrainian-forces-in-east-military-says-/7976838.html	2025-02-16T06:05:33-08:00	
Rwanda-backed rebels reach center of east Congo's 2nd major city	BUKAVU, CONGO — Rwanda-backed rebels reached the center of east Congo's second largest city, Bukavu, on Sunday morning and took control of the South Kivu province administrative office after little resistance from government forces, many of whom fled the rebels' advance. Associated Press journalists witnessed scores of residents cheering on the M23 rebels in central Bukavu on Sunday morning as they walked and drove around the city center after a dayslong march from the region's major city of Goma 101 kilometers away, which they captured late last month. Several parts of the city, however, remained deserted with residents indoors. The M23 rebels are the most prominent of more than 100 armed groups vying for control of Congo's mineral-rich east, and are supported by some 4,000 troops from neighboring Rwanda, according to the U.N. It was not clear if the rebels had taken decisive control of the city of about 1.3 million people. Their presence in central Bukavu is an unprecedented expansion of the rebels' reach in their yearslong fighting with Congolese forces. Unlike in 2012 when they only seized Goma in the fighting connected to ethnic tension, analysts have said the rebels this time are eyeing political power. Many Congolese soldiers were seen on Saturday fleeing the rebels' advance into Bukavu alongside thousands of civilians amid widespread looting and panic. Congo's President Felix Tshisekedi held a security meeting in the faraway capital of Kinshasa, where officials noted that Bukavu was 'briefly' invaded by M23 but remains under the control of the Congolese army and allies from local militia, the presidency said on X. There were no signs of fighting or of Congolese forces in most parts of Bukavu on Sunday. Tshisekedi has warned of the risk of a regional expansion of the conflict. Congo's forces are being supported in Bukavu by troops from Burundi and in Goma by troops from South Africa. Burundi's president, Evariste Ndayishimiye, appeared to suggest his country will not retaliate in the fighting. In a post on X he said that 'those people who were ready to get profit of the armed attack of Rwanda to Burundi will not see this.' The Congo River Alliance, a coalition of rebel groups that includes M23, said it was committed to 'defending the people of Bukavu' in a Saturday statement that did not acknowledge their presence in the city. 'We call on the population to remain in control of their city and not give in to panic,' Lawrence Kanyuka, the alliance's spokesperson, said in a statement. The fighting in Congo has connections with a decadeslong ethnic conflict. M23 says it is defending ethnic Tutsis in Congo. Rwanda has claimed the Tutsis are being persecuted by Hutus and former militias responsible for the 1994 genocide of 800,000 Tutsis and others in Rwanda. Many Hutus fled to Congo after the genocide and founded the Democratic Forces for the Liberation of Rwanda militia group. Rwanda says the group is 'fully integrated' into the Congolese military, which denies the charges.	https://www.voanews.com/a/rwanda-backed-rebels-reach-center-of-east-congo-s-2nd-major-city/7976749.html	2025-02-16T02:50:22-08:00	
Austrian city in shock after a deadly knife attack as migration comes in spotlight	VIENNA — The city of Villach in southern Austria is in shock after a man stabbed six passersby in broad daylight, killing a 14-year-old boy and wounding five others, as police tried to establish a motive that put migration in the spotlight. Residents began placing candles at the site of the attack in the city of about 60,000 inhabitants. A group of young people, who knew the boy who died in Saturday's attack, gathered at the crime scene on Sunday morning to mourn and tearfully light candles, local media reported. The 23-year-old suspect, who was detained shortly after the stabbing, is a Syrian with a residence permit in Austria. A 42-year-old man, also a Syrian working for a food delivery company, witnessed the attack from his car. He drove toward the suspect and helped to prevent the situation from escalating, police spokesperson Rainer Dionisio told Austria's public broadcaster ORF. Austria's President Alexander Van der Bellen called the attack 'horrific.' 'No words can undo the suffering, the horror, the fear. My thoughts are with the family of the deceased victim and the injured,' he posted on X. The Free Syrian Community of Austria issued a statement on Facebook distancing itself from the attack and expressing its deepest condolences to the victims' families. 'We all had to flee Syria, our home country, because we were no longer safe there — no one left their country voluntarily. We are grateful to have found asylum and protection in Austria,' the association said. 'Finally, we would like to emphasize: Anyone who causes strife and disturbs the peace of society does not represent the Syrians who have sought and received protection here,' the statement concluded. Dionisio said that a motive for the attack was not immediately known and police were investigating the suspect's background. Carnival procession canceled as police gather evidence Villach, a popular tourist destination near the borders of Italy and Slovenia, is known for its laid-back atmosphere, which blends Mediterranean and Alpine traditions. The city hosts annual carnival processions in March and an event on Saturday was canceled in the wake of the attack. The Austrian Ministry of Interior activated a platform for witnesses to upload videos or photos related to the attack. Interior Minister Gerhard Karner is expected in Villach on Sunday for a press conference. Local authorities said a crisis response team will be available to support pupils when schools open on Monday. The victims were all men, with two seriously wounded and two sustaining minor injuries, police said. Later Saturday, police said a fifth person was also injured. Peter Kaiser, the governor of the province of Carinthia, expressed his condolences to the family of the 14-year-old. 'This outrageous atrocity must be met with harsh consequences. I have always said with clarity and unambiguously: Those who live in Carinthia, in Austria, have to respect the law and adjust to our rules and values,' he said. Calls to strengthen migration rules Far-right leader Herbert Kickl wrote on X that he is 'appalled by the horrific act in Villach' and called for a rigorous crackdown on asylum. 'At the same time, I am angry — angry at those politicians who have allowed stabbings, rapes, gang wars and other capital crimes to become the order of the day in Austria. This is a first-class failure of the system, for which a young man in Villach has now had to pay with his life,' Kickl said. 'From Austria to the EU — the wrong rules are in force everywhere. Nobody is allowed to challenge them, everything is declared sacrosanct,' he said, adding that his party had outlined what he viewed as necessary changes to immigration laws in its election platform. Conservative party leader Christian Stocker said on X that the attacker 'must be brought to justice and be punished with the full force of the law.' 'We all want to live in a safe Austria, adding that this means political measures need to be taken to avoid such acts of horror in the future,' he said. The leader of the Social Democrats, Andreas Babler, said, 'Crimes like this one simply should not happen in our society.'	https://www.voanews.com/a/austrian-city-in-shock-after-a-deadly-knife-attack-as-migration-comes-in-spotlight/7976746.html	2025-02-16T02:40:56-08:00	
White South Africans gather in support of Trump and his claims that they are victims of racism	PRETORIA, SOUTH AFRICA — Some white South Africans showed support for President Donald Trump on Saturday and gathered at the U.S. Embassy in Pretoria to claim they are victims of racism by their own government. Hundreds of protesters held placards that read 'Thank God for President Trump' and displayed other messages criticizing what they see as racist laws instituted by the South African government that discriminate against the white minority. Many were from the Afrikaner community that Trump focused on in an executive order a week ago that cut aid and assistance to the Black-led South African government. In the order, Trump said South Africa's Afrikaners, who are descendants of mainly Dutch colonial settlers, were being targeted by a new law that allows the government to expropriate private land. The South African government has denied its new law is tied to race and says Trump's claims over the country and the law have been full of misinformation and distortions. Trump said land was being expropriated from Afrikaners — which the order referred to as 'racially disfavored landowners' — when no land has been taken under the law. Trump also announced a plan to offer Afrikaners refugee status in the U.S. They are only one part of South Africa's white minority. In a speech to Parliament this week, South African President Cyril Ramaphosa said the forced removal of any people from their land will never be allowed in South Africa again after millions of Blacks were dispossessed of property under the apartheid system of white minority rule and hundreds of years of colonialism before that. 'The people of this country know the pain of forced removals,' Ramaphosa said. He said the land law does not allow any arbitrary taking of land and only refers to land that can be redistributed for the public good. The Trump administration's criticism and punishment of South Africa has elevated a long-standing dilemma in the country over moves to address the wrongs of centuries of white minority rule that oppressed the Black majority. According to the government, the land law aims to fairly address the inequality that the majority of farmland in South Africa is owned by whites, even though they make up just 7% of the country's population. White protesters on Saturday held banners referencing the expropriation law but also other affirmative action policies put in place by the government since the end of apartheid in 1994 to advance opportunities for Blacks. Those laws, known as Black Economic Empowerment, have been a source of frustration for some white people. Influential Trump adviser Elon Musk — who was raised in South Africa — has also criticized South Africa’s government and claimed it is anti-white for years, although some have questioned his motivations. He has recently failed to get a license for his Starlink satellite internet service in South Africa because it doesn’t meet the country’s affirmative action criteria. While race has long framed South African politics, the country has been largely successful in reconciling its racially diverse people in the years after apartheid. The current government is made up of a coalition of 10 Black-led and white-led political parties that are working together.	https://www.voanews.com/a/white-south-africans-gather-in-support-of-trump-and-his-claims-that-they-are-victims-of-racism/7976735.html	2025-02-16T01:27:56-08:00	
Iran's early recordings revive forgotten sound heritage	TEHRAN, IRAN — In a century-old building in Tehran, Saeed Anvarinejad turned the dial of a vintage radio to tune into some of Iran's earliest recorded sounds, some serving as reminders of the seismic changes that shaped the country's history. Along with a team of fellow enthusiasts, he spent months tracking down the earliest recordings of Iranian music, speeches, interviews, theatrical plays, radio broadcasts and even the hum of daily life from more than a century ago up to the present day. 'Sound is a phenomenon we pay little attention to ... although it's very important,' said Anvarinejad, one of the organizers of the 'SoundScape' exhibition. And 'the era of early sound recording in Iran is a very important time in the socio-political history of the country.' He highlighted the emotional power of early voice recordings, saying they captured 'in a very raw and pure way ... the feeling that people have at that moment,' unlike written records. According to Anvarinejad, the oldest surviving sound recordings from Iran date back to 1898 and 1899, during the reign of Mozaffar al-Din Shah of the Qajar dynasty, which reigned over the country from the late 18th to the early 20th century. His rule saw the unfolding of the Constitutional Revolution, a pivotal moment in Iran's political transformation that established a parliament and constitutional monarchy. 'It was a time when ... a new order was taking shape in the Iranian mind and very important things were happening politically, socially and culturally,' he added. 'We thought it would be good to have a new approach to the sound (from that time) and engage audiences with it.' Upon tuning the wooden-framed antique radio, a chilling broadcast announced the overthrow of prime minister Mohammad Mosaddegh in 1953, who had pushed for the nationalization of Iran's oil industry sparking a coup d'etat orchestrated by the United States and Britain. 'This is Tehran! Good news! Good news! People of the cities of Iran, be awake and alert, the traitor Mosaddegh has fled!' crackled the voice of a radio anchor. 'Mysterious void' Other audio included Iran's first recorded call to prayer in either 1912 or 1913, and the 1959 report on the death of Qamar, the first woman singer to perform in public in the country. One striking installation at the exhibition involved a mechanical device mounted on a concrete wall with gears, chains, wheels and a lever which played old recordings of the stringed tar instrument through retro telephone handsets. Another, Mowj Negar, featured printed sound waves arranged in three rows on one wall, with a metal device which moved along the waves. When moved, the device activates melodies from the Qajar and early Pahlavi (1925-79) eras that once echoed through Iran's grand palaces and bustling city streets. Nearby stood a wooden cabinet named 'The Silent Closet,' displaying a series of photos from the World War I -— but without a single accompanying sound. 'There are no sound recordings from Iran during this period, not because technology was unavailable, but likely because the country was in such turmoil that recording sound was not a priority,' said Atabak Axon, another exhibition organizer. 'There was a 12-year silence that remains a mysterious void in Iran's auditory history.' For centuries, sound has played a central role in Persian culture, connecting belief with poetry and identity. For 21-year-old Sarvin Faizian, visiting the exhibition with friends was a deeply moving experience 'as if I was experiencing my parents' past.' Similarly, Fatemeh Sadeghi described feeling overwhelmed by nostalgia, while 63-year-old Kamran Asadi found the exhibition unexpectedly personal. 'It is a very good and intimate atmosphere for me,' he said, lingering on an old song playing in the background. 'It is good for the younger generation to learn where Iran's heritage of music and art came from.'	https://www.voanews.com/a/iran-s-early-recordings-revive-forgotten-sound-heritage/7975972.html	2025-02-15T23:26:52-08:00	
Breakfast is booming at US restaurants. Is it also contributing to high egg prices?	It's a chicken-and-egg problem: Restaurants are struggling with record-high U.S. egg prices, but their omelets, scrambles and huevos rancheros may be part of the problem. Breakfast is booming at U.S. eateries. First Watch, a restaurant chain that serves breakfast, brunch and lunch, nearly quadrupled its locations over the past decade to 570. Eggs Up Grill has 90 restaurants in nine southern states, up from 26 in 2018. Florida-based Another Broken Egg Café celebrated its 100th restaurant last year. Fast-food chains are also adding more breakfast items. Starbucks, which launched egg bites in 2017, now has a breakfast menu with 12 separate items containing eggs. Wendy's reintroduced breakfast in 2020 and offers 10 items with eggs. Reviews website Yelp said 6,421 breakfast and brunch businesses opened in the United States last year, 23% more than in 2019. In normal times, producers could meet the demand for all those eggs. But an ongoing bird flu outbreak, which so far has forced farms to slaughter nearly 159 million chickens, turkeys and other birds — including nearly 47 million since the start of December — is making supplies scarcer and pushing up prices. In January, the average price of eggs in the U.S. hit a record $4.95 per dozen. The percentage of eggs that go to U.S. restaurants versus other places, like grocery stores or food manufacturers, is not publicly available. U.S. Foods, a restaurant supplier, and Cal-Maine Foods, the largest U.S. producer of shell eggs, did not respond to The Associated Press' requests for comment. But demand from restaurants is almost certainly growing. Foot traffic at U.S. restaurants has grown the most since 2019 for morning meals, 2019, according to market research firm Circana. Pre-lunchtime hours accounted for 21% of total restaurant visits in 2024. Breakfast sandwiches are the most popular order during morning visits, Circana said, and 70% of the breakfast sandwiches on U.S. menus include eggs. Eggs Up Grill CEO Ricky Richardson said breakfast restaurants took off after the COVID pandemic because people longed for comfort and connection. As inflation made food more expensive, customers saw breakfast and lunch as more affordable options for eating out, he said. The growth in restaurant demand reverses a pattern that emerged during the pandemic, when consumers tried to stock up on eggs for home use but restaurants needed fewer of them because many of them had to close for a time, according to Brian Earnest, a lead economist for animal proteins at CoBank. U.S. egg consumption declined for more than five decades before reaching a low of 247 per person in 2008, according to data from the U.S. Department of Agriculture. As nutritional research and marketing established eggs as an inexpensive protein source instead of heart-clogging cholesterol bombs, per capita consumption of egg products grew to the equivalent of 292 fresh eggs in 2019, the data shows. 'Consumers think eggs are really fresh, so if you're making something with eggs, you know it's fresh,' Earnest said. Before the pandemic reduced demand and bird flu outbreaks impacted supplies, the USDA had forecast that Americans would continue eating more eggs. By 2023, the most recent year for which annual data is available, they were down to 249 eggs per person. Other trends have impacted the economics of eggs. To address animal rights concerns, McDonald's and some other companies have switched to 100% cage-free eggs, which limits the sources they will buy from. Ten states, including California and Colorado, have passed laws restricting egg sales to products from cage-free environments. 'It makes the market much more complicated than it was 20 years ago,' Earnest said. The higher prices are hitting restaurants hard. Wholesale egg prices hit a national average of $7.34 per dozen last week, according to the U.S. Department of Agriculture. That was 51% higher than at the beginning of the year. Wholesale costs may be higher than retail prices since grocers use eggs as a loss leader to get customers in the door. Some chains, like Waffle House, have added a surcharge to help offset the cost of eggs. Others may turn to egg substitutes like tapioca starch for some recipes or cut egg dishes from the menu, said Phil Kafarakis, the president and CEO of the International Foodservice Manufacturers Association. First Watch President and CEO Chris Tomasso said eggs are critical for the chain's brand and are found in the majority of its offerings, whether at the center of the plate or as an ingredient in batters. So far, he said, the company has been able to obtain the eggs it needs and isn't charging extra for them. First Watch is also increasing portion sizes for non-egg items like meat and potatoes, Tomasso said. Richardson, of Eggs Up Grill, said he recently met with franchisees to discuss adding a surcharge but they decided against it. 'Eggs have always been and will continue to be an important part of American diets,' Richardson said.	https://www.voanews.com/a/breakfast-is-booming-at-us-restaurants-is-it-also-contributing-to-high-egg-prices-/7975967.html	2025-02-15T23:26:12-08:00	
US man sues travel company after hippo kills wife on Zambia trip	A New Jersey man whose wife was killed in a horrific hippopotamus attack last year during a safari in Africa is suing the U.S. company that arranged the trip, alleging it failed to ensure their safety and did not adequately screen and supervise the tour guides. Craig and Lisa Manders were on a guided walk in Zambia in June when a hippo charged out of the water, grabbed Lisa Manders by its mouth and crushed her head and body with its bite, according to the lawsuit filed against African Portfolio, a safari tour company based in Greenwich, Connecticut. The company denies the lawsuit's allegations. The lawsuit, filed Feb. 5 in Stamford, Connecticut, alleges that as a horrified Craig Manders watched the attack, the tour guides — including at least one armed with a rifle — walked away without helping the couple. Lisa Manders, 70, suffered catastrophic injuries and died shortly after, the lawsuit says. 'We're doing this because this should never have happened,' said Paul Slager, an attorney who is representing Craig Manders with his law partner, Nicole Coates. 'There are basic safety standards that businesses are expected to follow, and that includes people in the safari tour industry. And those were not followed, and the consequences here were absolutely devastating.' Slager said the lawsuit seeks monetary damages that have not yet been determined, as well as accountability for Lisa Manders' death and keeping others safe in the future. He said Craig Manders was not giving interviews. The Manderses, of Cranford, New Jersey, were on a special anniversary trip and it was their first time in Africa, Slager said. Lisa Manders had worked in the financial industry for over 40 years and loved cooking, traveling and visiting New York City, where she was born in Queens in 1953, according to her obituary. The couple had three children and a granddaughter. The company's lawyer, Rodney Gould, said it was not negligent or reckless in connection with Lisa Manders' death. He said African Portfolio only arranged the couple's lodging and the owners of the lodging, Chiawa Safaris in Zambia, provided the tour guides. 'It's a horrible tragedy when somebody goes on one of these trips and is injured or killed. It's awful,' Gould said. 'I think it's important to understand what African Portfolio's role in this is. It's a tour operator. It arranges trips. It puts together the pieces.' He added, 'My client didn't conduct the safari. It arranged it. It booked all the components.' Gould also said the company was not negligent in vetting Chiawa, because it has an excellent reputation. He said African Portfolio will either ask a judge to dismiss the lawsuit or request that the matter go to arbitration, which was a condition of an agreement the Manderses signed for the trip. In a statement, African Portfolio did not directly address the lawsuit. It said Chiawa arranged the walking safari and guests were accompanied by an experienced and highly trained guide, a ranger and an armed National Park scout. It said Chiawa told authorities that safety measures were implemented before the attack and 'repeated warnings' were issued to guests to return to the safety of the vehicle 'during the incident.' Asked whether the guests were warned about the hippo before the attack, African Portfolio said in an email only that 'the statement is an accurate reflection of the events as we understand them.' Gould declined to comment. The company also said its founder flew to Zambia immediately after the attack and joined Chiawa's owner in ensuring that 'everything possible was being done to support the family and all those involved. Our thoughts and prayers continue to be with the family, and everyone else involved in this tragic incident.' The lawsuit, which does not mention Chiawa, says African safaris are 'inherently dangerous activities' because of the unpredictability and sometime aggressive nature of wild animals, and they require careful planning and execution to be completed safely. It says African Portfolio vetted and oversaw the tour guides and vouched that they were competent, qualified and trained to keep people safe. The suit alleges that African Portfolio 'encouraged and/or permitted' the Manderses to be exposed to an 'avoidable and highly dangerous encounter with a dangerous hippopotamus in the Zambian wilderness.' It also accuses the company of failing to provide safe conditions during the wilderness walk and failing to ensure that the tour guides were adequately selected, screened, supervised and trained to provide a safe experience. African Portfolio also failed to take adequate steps to protect the Manderses before and during the attack, the suit alleges. Hippos are the world's second-largest land mammals after elephants, measuring about 3.5 meters long and about 1.5 meters tall, according to International Fund for Animal Welfare. The average male hippo weighs about 3,200 kilograms. Hippos are known to be territorial and aggressive at times. A year before Lisa Manders died, seven people were killed in the southern African nation of Malawi when a hippo charged into a canoe and capsized it on a river. Estimates of how many people are killed by hippos each year vary, with lower figures beginning at around 500. Lisa Manders suffered 'significant premorbid fear and emotional pain, suffering and mental anguish' before her death, the suit says. Craig Manders suffered severe and debilitating emotional and psychological injuries that have made it difficult for him to cope with daily routines, it says. The lawsuit is seeking damages on allegations of negligence and recklessness. 'He's suing both for the loss of his wife and the impact that has on him and his life,' Slager said. 'And he also has a claim for having witnessed what happened to her, having seen the attack, which is unthinkable. It's unimaginable.'	https://www.voanews.com/a/us-man-sues-travel-company-after-hippo-kills-wife-on-zambia-trip-/7974670.html	2025-02-15T23:25:22-08:00	
With metal detectors, treasure hunters unearth pieces of British history	LONDON — When Malcolm Weale saw the tiny, dirt-covered object he'd unearthed in an English field, he knew it was something special. In his hand was a silver penny minted during the reign of Guthrum, a Viking commander who converted to Christianity and ruled eastern England in the ninth century as Athelstan II. For Weale, finding the first silver coin minted by a Viking ruler in Britain was the pinnacle of decades of hunting with his metal detector in the fields and forests near his home in eastern England. 'I was shaking,' Weale said at the British Museum, where the coin was displayed Tuesday alongside other items unearthed by amateur history hunters in 2023 and 2024. 'I knew that it was a life-changing, incredible, historical find. 'I'd watched the series 'Vikings' on Netflix, and about a week later I've got the Guthrum penny in my hand,' he said. The thrill of finding fragments of history beneath our feet drives detectorists like 54-year-old Weale, who was introduced to the pastime at the age of 7 and 'was hooked.' His find was on show as the museum released its annual report on the Portable Antiquities Scheme, a government-funded project that records thousands of archaeological discoveries made by the public each year. The coin sat alongside a set of 3,000-year-old bronze metalworkers' tools, a seventh-century gold and garnet necklace, and a gold signet ring with an intriguing link to Queen Elizabeth I. They have been officially classed as 'treasure' by a coroner, meaning they will be independently valued and offered to local museums. Discoveries by detectorists, as well as beachcombers and mudlarkers — who search for items on riverbanks — shine new light into corners of British history. The necklace of glittering gold and garnet pendants found in Lincolnshire, central England, reveals the sophistication of Anglo-Saxon craftsmanship, and is surprisingly global. Archaeologist Helen Geake, who serves as a 'finds liaison officer' for the antiquities program, said that it was likely made in England — 'English craftsmen were by far the best in Europe' — with garnets from Sri Lanka. Andy Akroyd, 49, also struck gold when he was out metal detecting near his home in Bedfordshire, central England. 'When I first saw it, I thought 'Oh it's a coin.' Then I saw it's a ring, I was thinking 1980s, cheap sovereign ring,' Akroyd said. It turned out to be a 16th-century signet ring engraved with a phoenix, a mythical bird symbolizing rebirth that was associated with Elizabeth I. Found in an area used as a royal hunting ground in Elizabethan times, it was likely worn, and lost, by one of the queen's supporters. 'When you find it, your journey is just beginning,' Akroyd said. Then come the questions: 'What is this, how is it here?' When items are declared treasure, their value is split between the finder and the owner of the land where it was found. Detectorists occasionally strike it rich — last year, a hoard of 1,000-year-old coins found in southwest England sold for 4.3 million pounds ($5.3 million). But the vast majority are in it for the thrill of discovery, not the money, Weale said. 'You could be a multi-multi-millionaire, but you could never buy that feeling that you feel when you find something,' he said. Both he and Akroyd say that they will soon be back out tramping the fields, in the mud and — this is England, after all — the rain. 'You always find the best stuff when the weather's terrible,' Weale said. Both men extol the mental health benefits of the methodical, slow-paced hobby, popularized to a wider audience by the gentle BBC sitcom 'Detectorists.' 'All I'm thinking about when I'm out metal detectoring is history,' Weale said. 'Kings, queens — I'm totally in the zone. I'm not worried about bills, or even keeping warm. Sometimes I forget to eat.' Akroyd said that some days he just sits, watching hares leap and birds of prey soar in the sky. 'I lost my dad last year. I'll have a chat to my dad when I'm out in the field. 'Come on, Dad — what way now?'' Akroyd said. 'He never finds me anything.'	https://www.voanews.com/a/with-metal-detectors-treasure-hunters-unearth-pieces-of-british-history-/7974646.html	2025-02-15T23:24:36-08:00	
Photos lost in US disasters find way home with help from people who care	LOS ANGELES — Hollowed-out homes. Cars entombed by mud. Unpeopled roads. Belongings reduced to dirt and debris. It all took a toll on Taylor Schenker. After Hurricane Helene last September, Schenker was upset by the deluge of images of Asheville, North Carolina. 'This storm has taken so much,' she said, 'and it's so jarring to see the photos of the horrible devastation.' So less than a week after the storm, she set out to do something about the wide-scale loss. While helping a friend search for belongings cast downriver, she stumbled on a handful of photos of strangers — mud-caked, curled up in tree branches and stuck under river rocks. The images captured family reunions, newborn babies, weddings, birthday parties, beloved pets and school portraits. 'These tiny photos had been through so much and miraculously had washed up and were in decent enough condition that you could see what they were,' said Schenker, 27. 'It stuck with me.' To reclaim the search phrase 'photos from Helene,' she created an Instagram for 'something positive, which is reuniting people with their memories.' She set up a post-office box, linked up with a volunteer search and rescue crew, and ultimately uncovered more than 500 photos — or what she calls 'little needles in a haystack.' When Schenker made her first match, she got chills. Then, sitting in her car, she cried. Photos found amid muck We hold onto photos to keep memories alive — of people, places and moments that might otherwise fade. Or sometimes are ripped away abruptly. Schenker has since returned more than 70 such images. A stack of them were hand-delivered to Mary Moss, whose car was destroyed by an uprooted tree as she and her husband evacuated the Asheville home where they had lived for almost 40 years. 'It was really kind of overwhelming at first when she handed me those pictures. I just couldn't even speak,' Moss said. 'You don't expect something as fragile as photos to be retrieved.' Months later, they've received some FEMA assistance and found a temporary home, which they're gradually furnishing with church donations. But some things are irreplaceable. 'This is not really about losing the home and all the material stuff in there. But what's been devastating is that that was everything we had of Tommy,' she said of their son who died at age 12 from a genetic disorder. 'It's those memories and the little things, the photos, that you can't replace.' As Schenker later understood it, 'When they lost their home, they lost virtually all proof that this child existed.' 'It is such a privilege to look into the intimate moments of people's lives,' she said. 'They've literally lost everything and they can't ever recreate those childhood photos.' In photos Schenker found nearly 3 miles (5 kilometers) from the Moss family home, Tommy is seen as a 2-year-old dressed like an angel for a Christmas pageant. In another, he is wearing a toddler-sized suit; in yet another, he's playing at daycare alongside his younger brother Dallas. 'It is just breathtaking,' Moss said. 'This is one thing that the river didn't get to take — or didn't get to keep.' Smoke, water, ash, soot More than 2,000 miles (3,200 kilometers) away, in the Altadena foothills of Los Angeles, Claire Schwartz, 31, began to collect photos with a similar idea: Find images, post them online, try to unite them with their owners. After the Eaton fire, but before the first rain, she panicked. When rain and ash mix, it makes lye, which destroys photos. 'Someone has to do this ASAP,' she remembers thinking to herself. 'And I realized it had to be me — because nobody else was doing it.' Luca Ackerman, a New York-based photo conservator, cautions that mold can start to develop 48 hours after water exposure. To slow the deterioration process, he freezes such prints — and advised to not wipe off any surfaces, which can drag toxic oils across the print, 'driving particles deeper into the material.' Some photos are so brittle, too, that when touched they may disintegrate. In the wake of disasters, conservators like Ackerman are deployed in volunteer rotations with the National Heritage Responders. Rapidly, he trains art handlers and museum staff how to treat sensitive materials, whether they are damaged by smoke, water, ash or soot. Wearing a respirator, nitrile gloves and booties, Schwartz swiftly set out to salvage photos — finding them alongside pages from yearbooks, sheet music, and children's art in nearby parks, neighbors' front yards and a golf course. 'The wind has scattered everything, everywhere. And trash is mixed in with precious mementos everywhere you look,' she said. 'It's just absolutely bizarre how stuff clumps together and travels as a unit.' Finding the photographed people Normally, a local library would take in found items, but the Altadena Public Library, along with more than 9,000 homes, burned to the ground. Librarians are redirecting residents who have found photos to Schwartz. She adopted parts of her process from what she learned as an archival intern at the Corita Art Center — protecting photos in acid-free, glassine envelopes and storing them in a waterproof box in a temperature-controlled room with good air circulation. Last week, she made her first match: disposable camera photos of teenagers, smiling, in prom dresses and glittering tiaras. The image is flecked with damage, but all four corners are intact. 'It's funny — you formulate these ideas of who the person is,' Schwartz said. 'She was kind of exactly what I pictured, just really friendly and bubbly and lovely — you could tell that just from her photos.' Schwartz's house survived because her neighbors stayed behind to fight the fire themselves, but the landscape around it — full of burned-out lots, ghostly palm trees and blackened telephone poles — is otherworldly and changed. 'It looks like the moon. It looks like another planet. It doesn't look like home.' Nearby is Joshua Simpson, a photographer who lost his Altadena home and studio, along with decades of film negatives, silver gelatin prints and camera equipment. But something meaningful survived. 'The very first thing we found was this beautiful vintage print of my mother-in-law holding my wife when she was a newborn baby,' said Simpson. The black-and-white photo carries an extra layer of poignancy, as his mother-in-law died just few months ago. 'We were both pretty overjoyed in that moment. It felt a little magical finding that one.' Above all, Ackerman said, personal safety comes first. 'When you're picking up people's heirlooms or family photographs, that can be traumatic — even if they're not yours,' he said. When people survive catastrophic events such as wildfires or hurricanes, and are left to cope with loss, they may express a wide range of emotions — from overwhelmed to outraged to numb sometimes all at once. Tragedies, though, can also strengthen the ties in communities, and people like Schenker and Schwartz are Exhibits A and B. 'Disasters like this really bring out the best in people,' Moss said. 'You know, I can laugh or I can cry about it — and I choose to laugh about it. Fortunately, we didn't lose the most important thing. That's lives.'	https://www.voanews.com/a/how-photos-lost-in-american-disasters-find-their-way-home-with-a-little-help-from-people-who-care-/7974676.html	2025-02-15T23:23:55-08:00	
Navalny supporters risk reprisals with memorial events a year after death	MOSCOW — A year after Russian opposition leader Alexey Navalny died behind bars, his supporters were set to hold memorial events on Sunday, with some risking reprisals by visiting his grave in Moscow. Remembrance events will take place as Russia's opposition movement -- driven into exile by unprecedented repression -- has been plagued by infighting and badly weakened since the loss of its figurehead. Exiled in various countries, its leading members have tried to revive the fight against Vladimir Putin's long reign, including in Russia where criticism of authorities is severely punished. Navalny -- Putin's main opponent -- was declared an 'extremist' by Russian authorities, a ruling that remains in force despite his death in an Arctic penal colony on Feb. 16, 2024. In Russia, anybody who mentions Navalny or his Anti-Corruption Foundation without stating that they have been declared 'extremist' is subject to fines, or up to four years in prison for repeated offenses. Navalny's former top aide Leonid Volkov wrote on Telegram that 'Alexei's supporters will hold memorial events all around the world.' 'In some places there will be rallies or marches, in others showings of the documentary Navalny, in others, memorial services,' he added. Navalny's widow, Yulia Navalnaya, is set to share memories of her husband at an event in Berlin, where many Russian opposition supporters have settled. 'Wherever you are, in Russia or abroad, we hope very much that you will meet like-minded people on February 16,' Volkov wrote, giving opening hours of Moscow's Borisovskoye cemetery where Navalny is buried. But Russian pro-Kremlin Telegram channels warned supporters against going to the cemetery. 'Big Brother' warning 'We give brief advice to those who plan to go there but are not yet sure -- don't go!' said a post shared by pro-Kremlin journalist Dmitry Smirnov and other channels. The message warns of 'Big Brother and his ever-watchful eye,' with a photo of a security camera sign at the cemetery gates. Russia has not fully explained Navalny's death, which came less than a month before a presidential election that extended Putin's more than two-decade rule, saying that it had happened as he was walking in the prison yard. Until his death, the 47-year-old continued to call for Russians to oppose the Kremlin and denounced Moscow's Ukraine offensive, even from behind bars. 'I took the decision not to be afraid,' he wrote in his autobiography, published after his death in several languages. Russia has branded Navalny's Anti-Corruption Foundation and the regional offices Navalny set up as 'extremist organizations.' Participation in an extremist group is punishable by up to six years in prison and many who campaigned in support of Navalny have been jailed or fled the country. Supporters also risk fines or stints in police cells for publicly displaying 'symbols' of an extremist organization, which has been applied to photos of Navalny or just his name. Four independent journalists are currently on trial for 'participating in an extremist group,' accused of preparing photos and video materials for Navalny's social media channels. Last month, Russia sentenced to several years in prison three lawyers who defended Navalny on an extremism charge for passing on his messages from prison, prompting international condemnation. Call for death probe Yulia Navalnaya has blamed the Kremlin for her husband's death -- which Moscow has denied. Amnesty International has called for an 'investigation conducted by independent and impartial international experts' into his death. Navalny was arrested in 2021 after returning to Russia following medical treatment in Germany for poisoning with Novichok nerve agent. In December 2023 he was transferred to a remote penal colony above the Arctic Circle. After Navalny's death, it emerged that talks on his inclusion in a prisoner exchange had been underway. Putin said in March 2024 that 'a few days' before Navalny's death, he was told of an 'idea to exchange' the prisoner. A White House official later confirmed such talks. Navalny made his name with rousing speeches at huge opposition rallies in Moscow in 2011-13. While Russia's opposition has never had an overall leader, he became its most prominent figure. Navalny faced an avalanche of legal action and received multiple sentences after establishing a network of regional offices and the Anti-Corruption Foundation, which made widely watched video exposes about officials.	https://www.voanews.com/a/navalny-supporters-risk-reprisals-with-memorial-events-a-year-after-death/7976720.html	2025-02-15T23:22:17-08:00	
Fistfights, anthem boos in stormy US-Canada ice hockey clash	MONTREAL — Three fights in the first nine seconds and a chorus of deafening boos for the US national anthem marked a stormy ice hockey clash between the United States and Canada in Montreal on Saturday. An emotionally charged showdown between the star-studded lineups of the North American rivals -- which comes against a backdrop of political tension between the two neighboring countries -- erupted into violence from the opening puck drop at Montreal's Bell Centre. The U.S. squad clinched a spot in the 4 Nations Face-Off final Thursday at Boston with a 3-1 victory, but the result was almost a footnote to the mayhem that marked the start of a game played before a fiercely partisan Canadian crowd. With Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau in the crowd, home fans booed The Star-Spangled Banner before the game, catcalls that have become a regular feature at NHL and NBA games in Canada since U.S. President Donald Trump threatened to impose tariffs on Canadian goods crossing U.S. borders. Then came three fights in nine seconds. 'I just think it's very indicative of what this means to the players,' U.S. coach Mike Sullivan said. 'There's two teams out there that are very competitive, that have a ton of pride for their respective teams and their countries. 'For me, when you have an investment in trying to win like the way that it occurred -- I think that's an indication of it. What an incredible hockey game.' Canada coach Jon Cooper, the two-time Stanley Cup champion coach for Tampa Bay who will guide the Canadian 2026 Olympic team, said the melee in the first moments was not prearranged. 'It wasn't planned,' Cooper said. 'That wasn't two coaches throwing guys over and saying 'This is happening' -- none of that happened. That was as organic as it gets.' At the opening puck drop, the gloves came off for real on the ice as Canada's Brandon Hagel and Matthew Tkachuk of the United States began swinging punches as the crowd went wild and teammates skated back to give the brawlers a clear stage at center ice. Referees restored order, sent the combatants to the penalty box and tried to restart the game, only for Canada's Sam Bennett and Brady Tkachuk of the Americans to drop their gloves and trade punches until officials could break them apart, Tkachuk following his brother into the penalty box. The game was restarted but only got to nine seconds before American J.T. Miller and Canada's Colton Parayko began the third and final fight. 'Jacked up' Asked about U.S. players having agreed on the fight-filled start beforehand on a group chat, Sullivan said he was unaware of such a move. 'These guys care very much about winning,' he said. 'Brady and Matthew, they play the game with so much emotion -- and they're leaders in so many ways. 'It's just an indication of how much these guys care and how bad they want to win. I was not aware of it. Obviously, there's a lot of energy around this game. I knew we were going to be jacked up to play.' Top NHL players from the United States and Canada had not faced off against each other for their home nations since the 2016 World Cup of Hockey, the league's best traditionally skipping the world championships and the NHL having chosen not to send its players to the 2018 PyeongChang or 2022 Beijing Winter Olympics. 'It was probably I guess 10 years of no international hockey exhaled in a minute and a half,' Cooper said. The intense drama continued once the game began in earnest with Canada going ahead on Connor McDavid's goal 5:31 into the first period. But the Americans equalized on Jake Guentzel's goal at 10:15 of the first period and the U.S. went ahead to stay on Dylan Larkin's tally at 13:33 of the second period. The Americans sealed the triumph on Guentzel's empty-net goal with 1:19 remaining in the third period.	https://www.voanews.com/a/fistfights-anthem-boos-in-stormy-us-canada-ice-hockey-clash/7976716.html	2025-02-15T22:34:09-08:00	
18 dead in India stampede to catch trains to Hindu mega-festival	NEW DELHI — At least 18 people died during a stampede at a railway station in India's capital late Saturday when surging crowds scrambled to catch trains to the world's largest religious gathering, officials and reports said. The Kumbh Mela attracts tens of millions of Hindu faithful every 12 years to the northern city of Prayagraj and has a history of crowd-related disasters -- including one last month, when at least 30 people died in another stampede at the holy confluence of the Ganges, Yamuna and the mythical Saraswati rivers. The rush at the train station in New Delhi appeared to break out Saturday as crowds struggled to board trains for the ongoing event, which will end Feb. 26. 'I can confirm 15 deaths at the hospital. They don't have any open injury. Most [likely died from] hypoxia or maybe some blunt injury but that would only be confirmed after an autopsy,' Dr. Ritu Saxena, deputy medical superintendent of Lok Nayak Hospital in New Delhi told AFP. 'There are also 11 others who are injured. Most of them are stable and have orthopedic injuries,' she said. Broadcaster NDTV reported three more dead from the stampede quoting an official of another hospital in the city. Those dead were mostly women and children. 'I have been working as a coolie since 1981, but I never saw a crowd like this before,' the Times of India newspaper quoted a porter at the railway station as saying. 'People started colliding and fell on the escalator and stairs' when platform for a special train departing for Prayagraj was suddenly shifted, the porter said. Railways minister Ashwini Vaishnaw said a 'high-level inquiry' had been ordered into the causes of the accident. Vaishnaw said additional special trains were being run from New Delhi to clear the rush of devotees. Prime Minister Narendra Modi said he was 'distressed' by the stampede. 'My thoughts are with all those who have lost their loved ones. I pray that the injured have a speedy recovery,' he wrote on X. The governor of the capital territory Delhi, Vinai Kumar Saxena said disaster management personnel had been told to deploy and 'all hospitals are in readiness to address related exigencies.' The six-week Kumbh Mela is the single biggest milestone on the Hindu religious calendar, and officials said around 500 million devotees have already visited the festival since it began last month. More than 400 people died after they were trampled or drowned on a single day of the festival in 1954, one of the largest tolls in a crowd-related disaster globally. Another 36 people were crushed to death in 2013, the last time the festival was staged in Prayagraj.	https://www.voanews.com/a/dead-in-india-stampede-to-catch-trains-to-hindu-mega-festival/7976713.html	2025-02-15T21:39:44-08:00	
US, South Korea, Japan reaffirm pledge to seek denuclearization of North Korea	MUNICH — The United States, Japan and South Korea renewed their 'resolute' pledge to seek the 'complete denuclearization' of North Korea, according to a joint statement from the three allies released Saturday. The statement came after new U.S. Secretary of State Marco Rubio held his first meetings with South Korean Foreign Minister Cho Tae-yul and Japan's top diplomat Takeshi Iwaya on the sidelines of the Munich Security Conference on Saturday. 'The Secretary and Foreign Ministers reaffirmed their resolute commitment to the complete denuclearization of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea (DPRK) in accordance with the United Nations Security Council Resolutions (UNSCRs),' it said. 'They expressed their serious concerns over and the need to address together the DPRK's nuclear and missile programs, malicious cyber activities including cryptocurrency thefts, and increasing military cooperation with Russia,' it added. The three sent a 'strong warning' that they 'will not tolerate any provocations or threats to their homelands,' and vowed to maintain and strengthen international sanctions against Pyongyang. They also said they were committed to 'the immediate resolution of the issues of abductees, detainees, and unrepatriated prisoners of war as well as the issue of separated families.' Largely cut off from the world diplomatically and economically, and under a bevy of sanctions, North Korea with its ongoing nuclear weapons program has been a major thorn in the side of the United States for years. President Donald Trump, who had a rare series of meetings with Kim Jong Un during his first term in office, has said he will reach out again to the North Korean leader, calling Kim a 'smart guy.' Despite Trump's diplomatic overtures, North Korea said in January that its nuclear program would continue 'indefinitely.' Pyongyang also said earlier this month it would not tolerate any 'provocation' by the United States after Rubio called it a 'rogue state' in a radio interview. It has also slammed a visit by a U.S. nuclear submarine to a naval base in South Korea this month as a 'hostile military act.' A summit between Trump and Kim in Hanoi collapsed in 2019 over talks on sanctions relief and what Pyongyang would be willing to give up in return.	https://www.voanews.com/a/us-south-korea-japan-reaffirm-pledge-to-seek-denuclearization-of-north-korea/7976702.html	2025-02-15T19:18:02-08:00	
US fires 20 immigration judges from backlogged courts	SAN DIEGO, CALIFORNIA — The administration of U.S. President Donald Trump has fired 20 immigration judges without explanation, a union official said Saturday amid sweeping moves to shrink the size of the federal government. On Friday, 13 judges who had yet to be sworn in and five assistant chief immigration judges were dismissed without notice, said Matthew Biggs, president of the International Federation of Professional & Technical Engineers, which represents federal workers. Two other judges were fired under similar circumstances in the last week. It was unclear if they would be replaced. The U.S. Justice Department's Executive Office for Immigration Review, which runs the courts and oversees its roughly 700 judges, did not immediately respond to a request for comment Saturday. Immigration courts are backlogged with more than 3.7 million cases, according to Syracuse University's Transactional Records Access Clearinghouse. Applicants can wait years for their asylum case to be decided. There is support across the political spectrum for more judges and support staff, though the first Trump administration also pressured some judges to decide cases more quickly. The Trump administration earlier replaced five top court officials, including Mary Cheng, the agency's acting director. Sirce Owen, the current leader and previously an appellate immigration judge, has issued a slew of new instructions, many reversing policies of the Biden administration. Last month, the Justice Department halted financial support for nongovernmental organizations to provide information and guidance to people facing deportation but restored funding after a coalition of nonprofit groups filed a federal lawsuit. The firings touch on two top Trump priorities: mass deportations and shrinking the size of the federal government. On Thursday, it ordered agencies to lay off nearly all probationary employees who had not yet gained civil service protection, potentially affecting hundreds of thousands of workers. Probationary workers generally have less than a year on the job.	https://www.voanews.com/a/us-fires-20-immigration-judges-from-backlogged-courts-/7976698.html	2025-02-15T18:31:22-08:00	
US East faces flooding as snow forecast for Northeast, cold in Midwest	LOUISVILLE, KENTUCKY — Much of the Eastern U.S. endured a renewed round of harsh, soggy weather Saturday, with snowstorms predicted in the Northeast and heavy winds bringing the threat of tornadoes to the Mississippi Valley. The states of Kentucky, Tennessee, West Virginia and Arkansas were under flood warnings, and people were warned by the National Weather Service to stay off the roads. Parts of western Kentucky could face up to 20.3 centimeters of rain. Governor Andy Beshear preemptively declared a state of emergency in Kentucky, where flash flooding was expected into Sunday. 'We want to specifically put assets in places that flood and have flooded in the past,' Beshear said on social media. Photos posted by authorities and users on social media showed cars and buildings underwater in Warren County, Kentucky, and in Buchanan County, Virginia, where the sheriff's office said multiple roads were blocked by mudslides. The Simpson County Office of Emergency Management in Kentucky said authorities performed several rescues from stalled-out vehicles in floodwaters. 'Stay home if you can,' the office said on Facebook. Flash flooding was possible in the Mississippi, Tennessee and Ohio valleys, the weather service said. In Tennessee, flash flood warnings were issued for much of the middle of the state through the evening. The National Weather Service called the expected rain a 'major, potentially historic, flash flood event.' Meanwhile heavy snow was expected to blanket much of New England and then transition to sleet, making travel nearly impossible. The heaviest accumulations — possibly 30.5 centimeters or more — were expected in upstate New York and portions of northern New England. 'Ice accumulations up to a quarter inch (half a centimeter) are forecast for some areas, making driving conditions dangerous. Heavy icing in some locations may result in downed trees and power outages,' the weather service warned. Snow and arctic temperatures swept much of the Midwest and Upper Plains, covering roads in eastern Nebraska, northern Iowa and much of Wisconsin. Winter weather advisories were issued for parts of those states and Michigan, with up to 10.6 centimeters of snow predicted throughout Iowa, southern Wisconsin and most of Michigan by Sunday evening. Frigid polar vortex Meteorologists said the U.S. was about to get its 10th and coldest polar vortex stretching event this season, with the northern Rockies and northern Plains first in line. Weather forces in the Arctic are combining to push the chilly air that usually stays near the North Pole into the U.S. and Europe. In Denver, where temperatures were expected to dip as low as minus 10 degrees Celsius over the weekend, the city opened shelters for those living on the streets. Forecasters reported 2.5 centimeters of snow falling every hour just north of Denver. The weather service also warned of extreme cold in the Upper Plains over the coming days, with wind chills ranging from minus 34 degree Celsius to as low as minus 51 degrees Celsius in parts of western Montana, North Dakota, northern South Dakota and western Minnesota. People in those areas were urged to stay indoors and make provisions to shelter livestock and other animals. California struggles with mudslides Dry weather returned to Southern California after the strongest storm of the year. But the risk of rockslides and mudslides on wildfire-scarred hillsides continued because dangerous slides can strike even after rain stops, particularly in areas where vegetation that helps keep soil anchored has burned away. Water, debris and boulders rushed down the mountain in the city of Sierra Madre on Thursday night, trapping at least one car in the mud and damaging several homes with mud and debris. Bulldozers cleaned up mud-covered streets in the city of 10,000 people. A storm in the Sierra Nevada dumped 1.8 meters of snow over 36 hours. Two Mammoth Mountain ski patrol workers were caught in an avalanche during avalanche mitigation work Friday morning, the resort said in a Facebook post.

Mali gold mine accident kills at least 48, officials say	BAMAKO, MALI — At least 48 people were killed in the collapse of an illegally operated gold mine in western Mali on Saturday, authorities and local sources told Agence France-Presse. Mali is one of Africa's leading gold producers, and mining sites are regularly the scene of deadly landslides and accidents. Authorities have struggled to control unregulated mining of the precious metal in the country, which is among the world's poorest. 'The death toll is 48 following the landslide,' a local police source said. The victims are mainly young women, including one who was carrying her child on her back. Boubacar Keita, from the Kenieba gold prospectors' association, also counts at least 48 deaths. 'It is an illegal site. There is a lot of complicity in the exploitation of this type of site in the region,' the head of a local environmental organization told AFP, adding that the search for victims was ongoing. Saturday's accident took place at an abandoned site formerly operated by a Chinese company, sources told AFP. In January, a landslide at a gold mine in southern Mali killed at least 10 people and left many others missing, most of them women. Just over a year ago, a tunnel collapsed at a gold mining site in the same region as Saturday's landslide, killing more than 70 people.	https://www.voanews.com/a/mali-gold-mine-accident-kills-at-least-48-officials-say-/7976692.html	2025-02-15T17:51:56-08:00	
Chad officials seal schools as measles epidemic hits poor district	YAOUNDE, CAMEROON — Chad health officials have sealed several dozen schools, sent thousands of children and their teachers home, and restricted movements to and from the Bologo district — 400 kilometers south of the capital, N'djamena — to contain a measles epidemic. Officials blame vaccine hesitancy for the rapid measles spread within the past two weeks. State TV reports that thousands of children in Chad's Bologo district have been ordered to stay home for a week as their schools remain closed to prevent measles from spreading. Many churches and mosques in the district are closed too. About 50 cases of measles were confirmed within the past two weeks, said Oumar Mahamat Traore, chief health official in Bologo, appointed by Chad's central government in N'djamena. He said the situation is very concerning because all seven of the hospitals in Bologo district have at least five children receiving treatment for measles. He said parents should make sure all children having high fever, runny nose, red and watery eyes and rashes on their faces and bodies accompanied by small white spots inside the mouth are immediately rushed to the nearest hospital, where they will receive free treatment. Traore spoke to VOA on Saturday by telephone. He said it is difficult to know the number of children affected by the measles epidemic because more than 80% of civilians in Bologo prefer African traditional medicine and go to conventional hospitals only in critical circumstances. Hospitals have not reported any deaths, but some affected children are in critical condition, according to government officials. Chad's government said health workers have been dispatched to Bologo and surrounding towns and villages to educate civilians against popular beliefs that the viral disease is divine punishment for wrongdoing and can be treated only by offering traditional sacrifices to the gods. Health workers are raising awareness that measles can be treated with conventional medicine. The United Nations reports that measles is one of the main causes of death among children in Chad. Outbreaks occur often because vaccination coverage remains low throughout the central African state. Chad’s Health Ministry says vaccine hesitancy is to blame for millions of children not being inoculated against childhood diseases including measles. In 2023, Doctors Without Borders reported that more than 1.3 million children between the ages of 6 months and 10 years old were inoculated against measles. Chad said there were plans with its international partners to inoculate at least 4 million children in the country of close to 18 million people. But armed conflicts and tensions triggered by elections to end a three-year transition that followed the death of President Idriss Deby Itno in 2021 made it impossible for humanitarian agencies to continue vaccination drives. Officials hope that with peace returning and constitutional order reestablished — with the election of Mahamat Idriss Deby as president and the new parliament — more vaccine campaigns will be organized. Measles is a highly contagious infection of the respiratory system that can lead to severe complications and death. The U.N. says it is one of the most contagious diseases in the world. In the absence of specific treatment, vaccination is the most effective medical tool against measles, the World Health Organization said. The vaccine is safe, effective and inexpensive, according to the U.N.	https://www.voanews.com/a/chad-officials-seal-schools-as-measles-epidemic-hits-poor-district/7976693.html	2025-02-15T17:45:11-08:00	
Nun takes top Vatican job running city state administration	ROME — An Italian nun is taking over a top management job in the Vatican: Sister Raffaella Petrini was named Saturday as president of the Vatican City State, making her essentially the governor of the 44-hectare (108-acre) territory in Rome that is home to the Catholic Church. Petrini, 56, had previously been the secretary general of the Vatican administration, which among other things is responsible for the city state's infrastructure and the Vatican Museums, a major source of revenue for the Holy See. She moves into the top job on March 1, following the retirement of Cardinal Fernando Vergez Alzaga, who turns 80 that day. Pope Francis had previously announced Petrini's promotion, part of his effort to place women in decision-making roles in the Vatican to serve as models for the rest of the church. The Vatican officially published the appointment Saturday while the pope was hospitalized with a respiratory tract infection. Last month, Francis named the first woman to head a major Holy See office, appointing another Italian nun, Sister Simona Brambilla, to become prefect of the department responsible for all the Catholic Church's religious orders. While women have been named to No. 2 spots in some Vatican offices, never before have women been named to the top jobs of the Holy See Curia or Vatican City State administration. Catholic women have long complained of second-class status in an institution that reserves the priesthood for men. Francis has upheld the ban on female priests and tamped down hopes that women could be ordained as deacons. But there has been a marked increase in the percentage of women working in the Vatican during his papacy, including in leadership positions, from 19.3% in 2013 to 23.4% today, according to statistics reported by Vatican News. In the Curia alone, the percentage of women is 26%. Critics complain that making women managers of the church doesn't compensate for the continued ban on ordaining them as ministers. In addition to her job running the Vatican City State administration, Petrini also serves as one of three women who are members of the Vatican office that vets bishop nominations. When they were named in 2022 it marked the first time women had had a formal role in the Vatican process of selecting bishops. A member of the Meriden, Connecticut-based Franciscan Sisters of the Eucharist religious order, Petrini otherwise keeps a relatively low public profile. But during a 2023 Women's Day speech at Rome's Pontifical Holy Cross university, she acknowledged that her nomination as secretary general of the Vatican City State had raised eyebrows, 'more than I expected in my ingenuity.' 'Even in non-ecclesial organizations, resistance is part of the process of change,' said Petrini, who has also been a professor of welfare economics at Rome's Pontifical Angelicum University.	https://www.voanews.com/a/nun-takes-top-vatican-job-running-city-state-administration-/7976682.html	2025-02-15T17:38:45-08:00	
IRS to lay off thousands of probationary workers in tax season	WASHINGTON — The U.S. Internal Revenue Service (IRS) will lay off thousands of probationary workers in the middle of tax season, according to two sources familiar with the agency's plans, and the cuts could happen as soon as next week. The Trump administration intensified sweeping efforts to shrink the size of the federal workforce. It is doing it by ordering agencies to lay off nearly all probationary employees who had not yet gained civil service protection. It's unclear how many IRS workers will be affected. Previously, the administration announced a plan to offer buyouts to almost all federal employees through a 'deferred resignation program' to quickly reduce the government workforce. The program deadline was Feb. 6, and administration officials said employees who accept will be able to stop working while still collecting a paycheck until Sept. 30. However, IRS employees involved in the 2025 tax season were told they will not be allowed to accept a buyout offer from the Trump administration until after the taxpayer filing deadline, according to a letter sent recently to IRS employees. It is unclear how many workers will be impacted by the layoff announcement plan. Representatives from the U.S. Treasury and IRS did not respond to Associated Press requests for comment. Jan. 27 was the official start date of the 2025 tax season, and the IRS expects more than 140 million tax returns to be filed by the April 15 deadline. The Biden administration invested heavily in the IRS through an $80 billion infusion of funds in Democrats' Inflation Reduction Act, which included plans to hire tens of thousands of new employees to help with customer service and enforcement as well as new technology to update the tax collection agency. Republicans have been successful at clawing back that money, and billionaire Elon Musk and his Department of Government Efficiency have called for the U.S. to 'delete entire agencies' from the federal government as part of his plan to radically cut spending and restructure its priorities. Elected officials are trying to fight against DOGE plans. Attorneys general from 14 states challenged the authority of DOGE to access sensitive government data and exercise 'virtually unchecked power' in a lawsuit filed Thursday. The lawsuit, filed in federal court in Washington, says the actions taken by Musk at the helm of DOGE can only be taken by a nominated and Senate-confirmed official. It cites constitutional provisions that delineate the powers of Congress and the president.	https://www.voanews.com/a/irs-to-lay-off-thousands-of-probationary-workers-in-tax-season/7976685.html	2025-02-15T17:13:15-08:00	
US, Russia officials to meet in Saudi Arabia to start talks on Ukraine	MUNICH/WASHINGTON — U.S. and Russian officials will meet in Saudi Arabia in coming days to start talks aimed at ending Moscow's nearly three-year war in Ukraine, a U.S. lawmaker and a source familiar with the planning said on Saturday. Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy, who met with U.S. Vice President JD Vance in Germany on Friday, said Ukraine was not invited to the talks in Saudi Arabia and Kyiv would not engage with Russia before consulting with strategic partners. U.S. Secretary of State Marco Rubio, national security adviser Mike Waltz and White House Middle East envoy Steve Witkoff will travel to Saudi Arabia, U.S. Representative Michael McCaul told Reuters. It was not immediately clear who they would meet from Russia. Rubio spoke by phone on Saturday with Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov and agreed on regular contacts to prepare for a meeting between Russian President Vladimir Putin and U.S. President Donald Trump, Russia's Foreign Ministry said. The phone call was held at the initiative of the U.S. side, it added. 'The two sides expressed their mutual willingness to interact on pressing international issues, including the settlement around Ukraine, the situation around Palestine and in general in the Middle East and other regional directions,' the ministry said in a statement. On the sidelines of the Munich Security Conference, McCaul said the aim of the talks was to arrange a meeting that included Zelenskyy, Trump and Putin 'to finally bring peace and end this conflict.' A source with knowledge of the plans confirmed the talks in Saudi Arabia between U.S. and Russian officials. The U.S. State Department did not immediately respond to a request for comment. Zelenskyy said on Saturday Ukraine would never accept any peace deals reached behind its back or without Kyiv's involvement. Ukraine has repeatedly said it wants to come together with the United States and Europe to devise a joint strategy before any Trump-Putin meeting. Trump, who took office on January 20, has repeatedly vowed to swiftly end the Ukraine war. He made separate phone calls to Putin and Zelenskyy on Wednesday, leaving Washington's European allies alarmed that they will be cut out of any peace process. Those fears were largely confirmed on Saturday when Trump's Ukraine envoy said Europe won't have a seat at the table, after Washington sent a questionnaire to European capitals to ask what they could contribute to security guarantees for Kyiv. Keith Kellogg, special envoy for Ukraine-Russia talks, told the Munich conference that the U.S. would act as an intermediary in the talks, with Ukraine and Russia as the two protagonists. Asked about the prospects of the Europeans being at the table, Kellogg said: 'I'm (from) a school of realism. I think that's not gonna happen.' At a later event at the conference, Kellogg sought to reassure Europeans by declaring this did not mean 'their interests are not considered, used or developed.' But European leaders said they would not accept being shut out of the talks. Zelenskyy said on Friday he would visit the United Arab Emirates, Saudi Arabia and Turkey, but did not say when. However, the Ukrainian leader said he had no plans to meet with U.S. or Russian officials during those visits. Moscow controls a fifth of Ukraine and has been slowly advancing in the east for months, while Kyiv's smaller army grapples with manpower shortages and tries to hold a chunk of territory in western Russia. Russia has demanded Kyiv cede territory and become permanently neutral under any peace deal. Ukraine demands Russia withdraw from captured land and wants NATO membership or equivalent security guarantees to prevent attack by Moscow. The United States and Europe have given Ukraine tens of billions of dollars in military aid since the war started. Trump has said he backs Ukraine but is seeking security for U.S. funding for Kyiv. The U.S. and Ukraine are negotiating a deal that could open up Ukraine's vast natural wealth to U.S. investment. Three sources said the U.S. proposed taking ownership of 50% of Ukraine's critical minerals. Zelenskyy said on Saturday that the draft deal did not contain the security provisions Kyiv needed. Also on Saturday, France discussed with its allies holding an informal summit of European leaders to discuss Ukraine, a French presidency official said on Saturday, and four European diplomats said the meeting was likely to go ahead on Monday. Speaking on a panel at the Munich conference on Saturday, Polish Foreign Minister Radoslaw Sikorski also said that French President Emmanuel Macron had called for a summit of European leaders in Paris. 'President Trump has a method of operating, which the Russians call reconnaissance through battle. You push and you see what happens, and then you change your position, legitimate tactics. And we need to respond,' Sikorski said. The Dutch news agency reported that Prime Minister Dick Schoof would go to Paris on Monday for the summit. It was unclear whether Zelenskyy would be invited.	https://www.voanews.com/a/us-russia-officials-to-meet-in-saudi-arabia-to-start-talks-on-ukraine-/7976665.html	2025-02-15T16:48:42-08:00	
Europe will not be part of Ukraine peace talks, US envoy says	MUNICH — Europe won't have a seat at the table for Ukraine peace talks, Donald Trump's Ukraine envoy said on Saturday, after Washington sent a questionnaire to European capitals to ask what they could contribute to security guarantees for Kyiv. Trump shocked European allies this week by calling Russian President Vladimir Putin without consulting them or Kyiv beforehand and declaring an immediate start to peace talks. Trump administration officials have also made clear in recent days that they expect European allies in NATO to take primary responsibility for the region as the United States now has other priorities, such as border security and countering China. The U.S. moves have stoked fears that Europeans may be cut out of a peace deal that would also impact their own security, particularly if it is seen as too favorable to Russia. U.S. Special Envoy for Ukraine and Russia Keith Kellogg told a global security conference in Munich that the U.S. would act as an intermediary in the talks, with Ukraine and Russia as the two protagonists. Asked about the prospects of the Europeans being at the table, Kellogg said: 'I'm (from) a school of realism. I think that's not gonna happen.' Kellogg said that talks aimed at ending the war between Russia and Ukraine could focus on territorial concessions from Russia and targeting Putin's oil revenues. 'Russia is really a petrostate,' he said, adding that Western powers needed to do more regarding effectively enforcing sanctions on Russia. At a later event at the conference, Kellogg sought to reassure Europeans by declaring this did not mean 'their interests are not considered, used or developed.' But European leaders said they would not accept being shut out of the talks. 'There's no way in which we can have discussions or negotiations about Ukraine, Ukraine's future or European security structure, without Europeans,' Finland's President Alexander Stubb told reporters in Munich. 'But this means that Europe needs to get its act together. Europe needs to talk less and do more.' Stubb said the questionnaire the U.S. sent to Europeans 'will force Europeans to think.' A European diplomat said the U.S. document included six questions with one specifically for European Union member states. 'The Americans are approaching European capitals and asking how many soldiers they are ready to deploy,' one diplomat said. France is discussing with its allies the possibility of holding an informal meeting among European leaders on Ukraine to discuss these matters, although nothing has been decided at this stage, a French presidency official said on Saturday. Polish Foreign Minister Radoslaw Sikorski said it would take place on Monday. NATO Secretary General Mark Rutte also urged Europeans to get their act together. 'And to my European friends, I would say, get into the debate, not by complaining that you might, yes or no, be at the table, but by coming up with concrete proposals, ideas, ramp up (defense) spending,' he said in Munich. In a sign that there is still some degree of international cooperation in the new Trump era, G7 foreign ministers, including the U.S., agreed on Saturday on a statement in which they pledged to continue working together to get a durable peace deal for Ukraine with robust security guarantees.	https://www.voanews.com/a/europe-will-not-be-part-of-ukraine-peace-talks-us-envoy-says-/7976497.html	2025-02-15T16:23:15-08:00	
Lebanon says 25 arrested after attack on UN peacekeepers	BEIRUT — Lebanese authorities said Saturday that more than 25 people have been arrested following an attack on a United Nations convoy that wounded two peacekeepers, including the force's outgoing deputy commander. U.N. and Lebanese officials have condemned Friday's attack, which came as Hezbollah supporters blocked the road to the country's only international airport for a second night over a decision by Lebanon to bar two Iranian flights from landing. On Saturday, an AFP correspondent said tear gas was fired to disperse a crowd that again blocked the road to the airport after the Iran-backed group called for a sit-in. Interior Minister Ahmad al-Hajjar told reporters that 'more than 25 people have been arrested by Lebanese army intelligence,' with another person detained by the security services. 'This does not mean these detainees carried out the attack ... but the investigations will show who is responsible,' he said, adding that violations would be treated 'with all seriousness.' The U.N. Interim Force in Lebanon has demanded a 'full and immediate investigation' after one of its vehicles was set on fire in the attack, which wounded outgoing deputy force commander Chok Bahadur Dhakal, who was heading home to Nepal after completing his mission. UNIFIL deputy spokesperson Kandice Ardiel told AFP a second Nepalese peacekeeper was also wounded. U.N. Secretary-General Antonio Guterres has condemned the attack. President Joseph Aoun vowed 'the attackers will receive their punishment,' and said 'security forces will not be lenient with any party that tries to upset stability and civil peace.' It remains unclear who was responsible for the attack. Senior Hezbollah official Wafiq Safa said 'what happened with UNIFIL ... is unacceptable.' 'Hezbollah has nothing to do with this matter,' he told Beirut-based pro-Iran broadcaster Al-Mayadeen. Transport Minister Fayez Rasamny said that the government was trying to bring home citizens stranded in Iran on Lebanese flag carrier Middle East Airlines, but Tehran had not provided the necessary permissions. Iran said it was ready for 'constructive talks' with Lebanon on restoring flights, during a telephone call between the two countries' foreign ministers, an Iranian foreign ministry statement said. Israel has repeatedly accused Hezbollah of using Beirut airport to transfer weapons from Iran, claims Hezbollah and Lebanese officials have denied. Lebanon's Directorate General of Civil Aviation said Thursday it had 'temporarily rescheduled' some flights, including from Iran, until February 18. The date coincides with the deadline for Israel to complete its withdrawal from south Lebanon and for Hezbollah to vacate its military positions in the region under a ceasefire deal that began in November and was later extended. On Saturday, the Israeli military carried out an airstrike on south Lebanon that it said targeted a senior militant from Hezbollah's aerial unit. 'The terrorist was targeted after repeatedly violating the understandings between Israel and Lebanon over the past few weeks, including his role in leading the launch of UAVs (drones) towards Israeli territory,' the military said. Lebanon's state-run National News Agency said two people were killed and four wounded in the strike on a vehicle in the Iqlim al-Tuffah area. Both sides have accused each other of repeated ceasefire violations since the truce went into effect late last year.	https://www.voanews.com/a/lebanon-says-25-arrested-after-attack-on-un-peacekeepers-/7976488.html	2025-02-15T15:17:58-08:00	
1 dead, 4 injured in stabbing spree by Syrian suspect in Austria	VIENNA — A 23-year-old man stabbed five passersby in southern Austria on Saturday in what police said was a random attack that left a 14-year-old dead, and four others injured. The suspect was detained in the city of Villach, where the attack took place, police said. He is a Syrian national with legal residence in Austria, they said. Two victims were seriously injured and two victims sustained minor injuries, police said. Police spokesperson Rainer Dionisio said a motive was not immediately known. He added that police were investigating the attacker's personal background. 'We have to wait until we get secure information,' he said. A 42-year-old man who works for a food delivery company witnessed the incident from his car, police said. He drove toward the suspect and helped to prevent things from getting worse, Dionisio told Austria's public broadcaster ORF. Peter Kaiser, the governor of the Austrian province of Carinthia, expressed his condolences to the family of the 14-year-old victim. 'This outrageous atrocity must be met with harsh consequences. I have always said with clarity and unambiguously: Those who live in Carinthia, in Austria, have to respect the law and adjust to our rules and values.' Erwin Angerer, a lawmaker for the far-right Freedom Party, said his party had been warning about the situation in Austria as a result of the country's 'disastrous asylum policy.' Austria's Interior Minister Gerhard Karner was expected in Villach on Sunday morning. Police said it wasn't clear whether the suspect acted on his own and continued to search for potential additional suspects.	https://www.voanews.com/a/dead-4-injured-in-stabbing-spree-by-syrian-suspect-in-austria/7976471.html	2025-02-15T14:31:44-08:00	
15 dead in India stampede to catch trains to Hindu festival	NEW DELHI, INDIA — At least 15 people died during a stampede at a railway station in India's capital late Saturday when surging crowds scrambled to catch trains to the world's largest religious gathering, a medical official told AFP. The Kumbh Mela attracts tens of millions of Hindu faithful every 12 years to the northern city of Prayagraj and has a history of crowd-related disasters — including one last month, when at least 30 people died in another stampede at the holy confluence of the Ganges, Yamuna and the mythical Saraswati rivers. The rush at the train station in New Delhi appeared to break out Saturday as crowds struggled to board trains for the ongoing event, which will end on February 26. 'I can confirm 15 deaths at the hospital. They don't have any open injury. Most (likely died from) hypoxia or maybe some blunt injury but that would only be confirmed after an autopsy,' Dr. Ritu Saxena, deputy medical superintendent of Lok Nayak Hospital in New Delhi to AFP. 'There are also 11 others who are injured. Most of them are stable and have orthopedic injuries,' she said. Defense minister Rajnath Singh said he was 'extremely pained by the loss of lives due to stampede' at the New Delhi railway station. 'In this hour of grief, my thoughts are with the bereaved families. Praying for the speedy [recovery] of the injured,' Singh said in a social media post. The governor of the capital, Vinai Kumar Saxena said disaster management personnel had been told to deploy and 'all hospitals are in readiness to address related exigencies.' Railways minister Ashwini Vaishnaw said additional special trains were being run from New Delhi to clear the rush of devotees. The six-week Kumbh Mela is the single biggest milestone on the Hindu religious calendar, and officials said around 500 million devotees have already visited the festival since it began last month. More than 400 people died after they were trampled or drowned on a single day of the festival in 1954, one of the largest death tolls in a crowd-related disaster globally. Another 36 people were crushed to death in 2013, the last time the festival was staged in Prayagraj.	https://www.voanews.com/a/dead-in-india-stampede-to-catch-trains-to-hindu-festival-/7976466.html	2025-02-15T14:08:23-08:00	
Central African Republic soldiers kidnapped by mercenaries, advocates allege	BANGUI, CENTRAL AFRICAN REPUBLIC — Human rights advocates and politicians in Central African Republic claim soldiers who disappeared after being detained last month were kidnapped by mercenaries backed by Russia. The Kremlin has in recent years deepened ties with the gold- and diamond-rich country's military and government. Celestin Bakoyo and Elie Ngouengue — two soldiers who led a Wagner Group-aligned militia fighting rebels in the country's southeast — were reportedly detained on January 24 at a police station in the country's capital. Ernest Mizedio, a politician from the region, told The Associated Press that the two soldiers were among a group arrested earlier by Russian mercenaries tasked with training militia members and incorporating them into the army. 'We searched without success for where they took them,' he said, noting that supporters had inquired with both law enforcement and Russian security contractors about their whereabouts. 'They said they had nothing to offer us and knew nothing of their situation.' Mizedio, a member of one of Central African Republic's opposition parties, said there had been marches and protests decrying the arrests in the country's southeast. Neither Wagner nor the military responded to AP's requests for comment on the disappearance. However, a police officer, speaking on the condition of anonymity, said mercenaries were gradually vying for position and replacing officers on the ground in conflict zones. Before going missing, the two had come to the capital to open new bank accounts to access their earnings after being integrated into the army. The backlash against their disappearance comes as Russia expands its military and economic presence throughout Africa, using mercenaries to quell rebellion and fight extremists. Joseph Bindoumi, president of Central African Republic's League for Human Rights, denounced the disappearances, called them kidnappings and said even if the soldiers were accused of crimes, their whereabouts should be known. 'We have the right to know if standard procedures are being followed. We have the right to see people to ensure their well-being and to ensure their parents, advocates and lawyers can visit them,' he said. Central African Republic was one of the first places the mercenaries became active. Amid years of conflict between government forces and predominantly Muslim rebels, citizens and officials credited the Russian mercenaries with fighting back armed groups who tried to overtake Bangui in 2021. Yet they've been dogged by reports of recklessly disregarding human rights and civilian welfare. A 2023 investigation from the U.S.-based watchdog group The Sentry found that mercenaries train the army on torture tactics and as part of the fight against armed groups opposed to the government had carried out killings, torture and rape.	https://www.voanews.com/a/central-african-republic-soldiers-kidnapped-by-mercenaries-advocates-allege-/7976454.html	2025-02-15T13:55:16-08:00	
US braces for flooding; parts of California face mudslides	SIERRA MADRE, CALIFORNIA — Much of the Eastern United States braced for a renewed round of harsh, soggy weather Saturday, with thunderstorms and melting snow combining to pound the Ohio and Tennessee valleys. The lower Mississippi valley was facing the threat of strong tornadoes. Kentucky, Tennessee, West Virginia and Arkansas were under flood warnings, and residents were warned by the National Weather Service to stay off roads. Parts of western Kentucky could face up to eight inches of rain. 'This may be a major, potentially historic, flash flood event,' the NWS said. Heavy snow, meanwhile, was expected to blanket much of New England and then transition to sleet, making travel nearly impossible, the NWS said. In northern New York, heavy mixed precipitation is expected throughout the weekend. Weather forecasters said residents should expect snow, sleet and ice accumulations of six to 13 inches and wind gusts as high as 72 kilometers per hour (45 miles per hour) late Saturday and Sunday. 'Power outages and tree damage are likely due to the ice and strong winds. Travel could be very difficult to nearly impossible, the NWS said. California struggles with mudslides In Southern California on Friday, a mountain community near the Eaton Fire burn scar dug out of roads submerged in sludge after the strongest storm of the year swept through the area, unleashing debris flows and muddy messes in several neighborhoods recently torched by wildfires. Dry weather returned to the region but the risk of rock and mudslides on wildfire-scarred hillsides continued Friday since dangerous slides can strike even after rain stops, particularly in scorched areas where vegetation that helps keep soil anchored has burned away. Water, debris and boulders rushed down the mountain in the city of Sierra Madre on Thursday night, trapping at least one car in the mud and damaging several home garages with mud and debris. Bulldozers on Friday were cleaning up the mud-covered streets in the city of 10,000 people. Sierra Madre officials issued evacuation orders for areas affected by the Eaton Fire, warning that fire, police and public works personnel would not enter areas experiencing active mud and debris flows and anyone who remained in a home under evacuation orders would need to shelter in place until areas are deemed safe for city personnel to enter. Residents of the city also had to evacuate during the Eaton Fire, which destroyed 15 homes in the community. In Pacific Palisades on Friday, some residents washed their mud-covered driveways and bulldozers worked to clear mud-coated roads not far from where, just weeks ago, officials moved abandoned cars after people fleeing last month's wildfires got stuck in traffic and fled on foot. Southern California reported 2.5 to 7 centimeters (1 to 3 inches) of rain in coastal areas and valleys and 7.6 to 15.2 centimeters (3 to 6 inches) across the coastal slopes Thursday, said Mike Wofford, a meteorologist with the weather service. The precipitation was badly needed, as much of Southern California remains in extreme or severe drought, according to the U.S. Drought Monitor. In neighboring Nevada, the weather service said it recorded a measurable amount of rain in Las Vegas, ending a streak of 214 days without precipitation. A storm in the Sierra Nevada mountains dumped 1.8 meters (6 feet) of snow over 36 hours. Two ski patrol staff from Mammoth Mountain were caught in an avalanche during avalanche mitigation work Friday morning, the resort said in a Facebook post. One was extracted and was responsive, while the other was taken to a hospital with serious injuries. More winter weather descending Meteorologists warn that the U.S. is about to get its 10th and coldest polar vortex stretching event this season. Weather forces in the Arctic are combining to push the chilly air that usually stays near the North Pole into the U.S. and Europe. The latest projected cold outbreak should first hit the northern Rockies and northern Plains on Saturday and then stick around all next week. In Denver, Colorado, where temperatures are expected to dip as low as minus 10 degrees Celsius (14 degrees Fahrenheit) over the weekend, the city has extended its cold weather shelters for those living on the streets. The Denver Coliseum — an arena with some 10,000 seats — will be opened Saturday for additional space, while a free bus will loop between the shelters across the city.	https://www.voanews.com/a/us-braces-for-flooding-parts-of-california-face-mudslides-/7976445.html	2025-02-15T12:57:47-08:00	
Carafano: 'A free, independent Ukraine is in America's best interest'	WASHINGTON — James Carafano, senior counselor to the president and national security expert at The Heritage Foundation, responsible for its defense and foreign policy team, spoke with VOA's Ukraine Service about the Trump administration's goals and considerations in the negotiation process to achieve peace in Ukraine. He explained that while not a vital interest, a free and independent Ukraine that can defend itself is in America's best interests, and he outlined how to achieve this goal. Voice of America: How do you and The Heritage Foundation see ending the war in Ukraine, and what is the strategy behind it? James Carafano, The Heritage Foundation: It is in America's best interest that there be a free and independent Ukraine that can defend itself. And the reason for that is the United States. The United States is a global power with global interests and global responsibilities. A peaceful Europe, whole, free and at peace, that is a vital American interest. The transit Atlantic community is important to us. And the number one threat, physical threat to that is the destabilizing actions of Russia. And the most concerning and destabilizing action is the security of the Eastern front of NATO and Ukraine, that is free and independent, that can defend itself is an obstacle to the Russians, whether it's in NATO or not. Now, to be honest, it's not a vital interest in the United States. For the practical matter is, the United Europe can defend itself and the United States can defend Europe if Ukraine's occupied by Russia. Now having said that, are we way better off? I mean, way, way better off with the Russians on the other side of Ukraine? And the answer is 'absolutely.' At this point, what is in America's interest is that the war stops and that there is a ceasefire that is both from a strategic perspective to preserve Ukraine, and that we have to be realistic about Ukraine's capacity to recover territory that's been occupied. But also from a humanitarian perspective, and I think this is very deeply reflected in our president. More Ukrainians dying is never going to reconquer all of Ukrainian territory. A war of attrition is never going to create a stronger Ukraine. I think everybody is focused on what the deal looks like. I think the deals are relevant. Stopping the war is the objective. The real question is, what do we do the day after the war to ensure there's a free and independent Ukraine in the future? VOA: The defense secretary said we don't want Minsk 3.0. Are we falling into the trap of Munich 2.0, where we appease the dictator, give away territories, embolden the aggressor, and end up in a world war? Carafano: I don't think that's the peace that the U.S. envisions. So, I'll tell you what appeasement would be. Appeasement would be giving the Russians something at the negotiating table that they didn't win on the battlefield. That's appeasement. Recognizing that the Russians have territory they have and the inability of the Ukraine [forces] to retake that territory — maybe they trade territory, I don't know — that's called being realistic. VOA: If Russia is allowed to keep its spoils of war, what message would it send to other would-be aggressors? Carafano: That Russia has failed. Russia's goal was to conquer and destroy Ukraine. It failed. Russia's goal was to have NATO fall apart. It failed. If Russia is stopped in Ukraine, and look what they have achieved, they've achieved some marginal territorial gains at the cost of destroying the Russian army, crippling the Russian economy, and making themselves a global pariah. If that's a victory, it's a kind of really weird Pyrrhic victory. VOA: Then, why would [Defense Secretary] Pete Hegseth articulate these concessions? Carafano: They're not concessions. They are statements of reality. We all know it's true. If you give Putin something at the negotiation table that he wasn't able to take on the battlefield, that is a concession. So, if for example you said, Ukraine has to give up the sovereignty of its territory even its occupied territory, I would say that's a really bad deal. That's a concession. We have never ever forced any country to actually give up the sovereignty of its territory.' VOA: What about [Ukraine`s membership] in NATO? Here is a counterargument: Why Russia should have a veto power over NATO? Carafano: First of all, Hegseth has never said Russia should have a veto power over the entry of Ukraine into NATO. Hegseth has said, 'This is not going to be part of the negotiation and Ukraine is not going to get into NATO now.' That's no different from the Biden policy and that's actually just a reflection of reality. NATO is a consensus organization. Every member has to agree. Every member does not agree. So, we all know, the Russians know, we know, everybody in NATO knows, Ukraine is not going to get NATO membership now.' VOA: What about the future? Carafano: He didn't say that Ukraine shouldn't join NATO in the future. He just said that NATO membership is not going to be part of the negotiation. VOA: So, the main issue here is security guarantees. Carafano: That's also wrong. Somehow that we're going to say something that's going deter Putin in the future. That's nonsense and ridiculous. What's going to deter Putin in the future is, does Ukraine have the capacity to defend itself? VOA: So how do we deter the Russians? Carafano: We have a Ukraine as a country that can defend itself and that is free, and its economy grows, and it builds a defense industrial base. And we strengthen NATO because that will equally deter the Russians. And we do the other things, which by the way Donald Trump is going to do already, whether there's a peace deal or not. Donald Trump is going to put a lot of pressure on the Russians. He's going to lower the price of oil. He's going to increase sanctions. He's going to [do] a lot of things that are going to hamstring the Russian economy. Russia is going to be weaker. He's going to do a lot of things to go after the Iranians. So, the Iranians are going to have a lot less capacity to support the Russians. He's going to do a lot of things to put a lot of pressure on the Chinese. The Chinese are going to be less able to support the Russians. Donald Trump can do a lot to North Korea. Regardless of what happens in the actual peace deal in Ukraine, Trump is going to do a lot to the Russians, the Chinese, the North Koreans and the Iranians that really diminishes their capacity to sustain this war.	https://www.voanews.com/a/carafano-a-free-independent-ukraine-is-in-america-s-best-interest-/7976425.html	2025-02-15T12:39:11-08:00	
US citizen detained in Russia, accused of drug smuggling	MOSCOW — A Moscow court has ordered a U.S. citizen suspected of drug smuggling held in pre-trial detention for 30 days, the Moscow courts press service said Saturday, days after a Moscow-Washington prisoner swap that the White House called a diplomatic thaw and a step toward ending the fighting in Ukraine. The U.S. citizen, whom Saturday's statement named as Kalob Wayne Byers, was detained after airport customs officials found cannabis-laced marmalade in his baggage. Russian police said the 28-year-old American had attempted to smuggle a 'significant amount' of drugs into the country, the Interfax agency reported, citing Russia's Federal Customs Service. The agency said the American was detained at Moscow's Vnukovo airport after flying in from Istanbul on February 7. Mash, a Russian Telegram channel with links to the security services, said the U.S. citizen faces up to seven years in prison if convicted. There was no immediate comment from the U.S. State Department. The Washington-Moscow prisoner exchange this month saw Alexander Vinnik, a Russian cryptocurrency expert who faced Bitcoin fraud charges in the United States, returned to Russia in exchange for American Marc Fogel, a teacher from Pennsylvania who was detained in 2021 when traveling to Russia to work at a school. Fogel had been serving a 14-year sentence for having what his family and supporters said was medically prescribed marijuana. President Joe Biden's administration designated Fogel as wrongfully detained in December. President Donald Trump on Wednesday upended three years of U.S. policy toward Ukraine, saying he and Russian leader Vladimir Putin had agreed to begin negotiations on ending the conflict following a lengthy direct phone call.	https://www.voanews.com/a/us-citizen-detained-in-russia-accused-of-drug-smuggling-/7976409.html	2025-02-15T11:44:02-08:00	
US counterterror official warns of growing global threat	WASHINGTON — A senior U.S. counterterrorism official is cautioning that the threat from global jihadists has expanded significantly, although the resources to counter them have declined. Sebastian Gorka, deputy assistant to President Donald Trump and senior director for counterterrorism, on Feb. 11 told a Washington conference organized by the American Foreign Policy Council that he based the current threat assessment on several factors. 'Number one, jihadist groups are more geographically dispersed than ever before, with networks extending across the Sahel, Central and East Africa, the Middle East and Central Asia,' he said. 'To cite just one example, West African countries like Benin and Togo, that once had little exposure to jihadi threats, are now seeing jihadi Sunni actors in their territory and elsewhere, affecting their national sovereignty.' Benin and Togo have reported attacks by al-Qaida, an expansion of the violence the terror group is carrying out in Niger, Mali and Burkina Faso. Gorka said militant groups are increasingly capable and using new forms of technology to execute their deadly missions. Gorka said that militants 'remain highly adaptive entities.' 'If you look at their use of social media, especially encrypted apps to communicate, these individuals have acclimatized to the new technological environment,' he said. One of Trump’s main campaign promises in last year’s election was to tighten security along the U.S. border and deport migrants without legal status. He signed an executive order declaring a national emergency at the border. Gorka argued that border vulnerabilities give militants an advantage. 'The global jihadi actors are poised to capitalize on global security vulnerabilities, especially the fact that, for four years, we have had no southern border,' Gorka said. Former President Joe Biden defended his immigration policies during the 2024 presidential election campaign and blamed the Republicans for walking back on a bipartisan immigration bill. Biden said Trump was involved in sinking the bill. The Middle East Gorka said militant groups in the Middle East, including Hezbollah and Hamas, which the United States, Britain and other Western nations have designated as terrorist groups, have been severely marginalized. 'Let's just be blunt — since the heinous, tragic massacre of more Jews than have ever been killed since the end of the Shoah [Holocaust] in 1945, since Oct. 7, our friends in Israel have literally redrawn the map of the region,' he said. The war in Gaza was triggered by the October 2023 Hamas terror attack on Israel that killed 1,200 people and led to the capture of 250 hostages. Israel’s counteroffensive has killed more than 48,200 Palestinians, more than half of them women and children, according to Gaza health authorities. Israel says the death toll includes 17,000 militants it has killed. 'As a result, groups like Hezbollah and Hamas have been radically degraded,' Gorka said. This has paved the way for what? The collapse of the [Bashar al-] Assad regime in Syria, which together represent devastating blows to the greatest global sponsor of terrorism as a nation-state — Iran's capability to hurt our interests and the interests of our friends and partners.' US airstrikes in Somalia Gorka also gave more details about the airstrikes on Feb. 1 that targeted Islamic State group militants in Somalia’s northeastern region of Puntland. The strikes were carried out by the U.S. Africa Command and authorized by Trump and coordinated with Somalia. 'We told the president, ‘There is a cave complex in northern Somalia full of ISIS,' he said, using an acronym for the Islamic State group. 'We have been surveilling it for years, but the last administration refused to take action.' According to the Africa Command, 14 militants were killed, including Ahmed Maeleninine, who was described as a 'recruiter, financier and external operations leader responsible for the deployment of jihadists into the United States and across Europe.' Somali officials said he is from Oman, although the U.S. has not commented on his nationality. 'The person you saw in the footage is not just a foot soldier,' Gorka said as video of the airstrike was played. 'He is a recruiter, trainer and financier for ISIS, one of the guys who is hard to replace. We had been surveilling him for months.' The strikes were carried out by fighter jets launched from the USS Harry S. Truman, which was in the Red Sea at the time. Trump confirmed ordering a precision military airstrikes on the same day. Somali forces in Puntland this week reported success against the militants. Scores were killed after Puntland forces repelled a complex attack from the militants in the early hours of Feb. 11. The U.S. has been training elite Somali forces known as Danab, which means 'lightning.' So far, there has been no publicly known change of US security support to Somalia.

Stars galore celebrate 'Saturday Night Live' in concert	NEW YORK — By the time Cher sang 'If I Could Turn Back Time,' it seemed as if time had indeed been turned back and every single 'Saturday Night Live' musical guest of 50 years had magically found their way to Radio City Music Hall. Of course, it was only a smattering. But 'SNL50: The Homecoming Concert' boasted an epic lineup. It was an evening of memorable solo performances and often fascinating, one-time-only collaborations. The concert, hosted by Jimmy Fallon, was only one element of what has become an enormous celebration of the show’s 50 years in existence, leading up to Sunday’s 'SNL50: The Anniversary Special,' live from Studio 8H. But Friday night was all about music. Return of the 1990s If a decade can win the night, let’s hear it for the 1990s. A classic performance from that decade was most likely to get the Radio City audience on its feet, singing along and pulling out their phones to record. The Backstreet Boys proved irresistible when they broke into 'I Want it That Way.' Snoop Dogg may have sung 'Gin and Juice,' but he was trailed by enough smoke to give nearby audience members a contact high. Wearing a gigantic coat befitting a winter night, Lauryn Hill commanded the stage with Wyclef Jean, and the crowd melted at the first notes of 'Killing Me Softly.' Some comics can do music Naturally, some former 'SNL' cast members reprised old characters, with varying levels of success. The Culps, the stuffy music teachers played by Will Ferrell and Ana Gasteyer, hit harder and funnier than they ever did on the show. Their attempts at being current were hilarious and they even worked in a few verses of 'Not Like Us,' with a plea for harmony between Kendrick Lamar and Drake. Andy Samberg and Chris Parnell’s 'Lazy Sunday' was welcome, but too short. Lady Gaga was a good sport, replacing Justin Timberlake to sing about a Christmas gift whose title can't be repeated here. But Bill Murray’s lounge singer 'foursome' routine with Gasteyer, Maya Rudolph and Cecily Strong fell a bit flat. They love Michaels 'SNL' creator Lorne Michaels didn’t perform, but he was referred to all night long. 'I love you, Lorne Michaels,' declared Miley Cyrus, dedicating her hit song 'Flowers' to the show's founder. Raitt, finishing 'I Can’t Make You Love Me,' thanked Michaels for having her on the show so many times. 'Let’s give it up for Lorne,' said former cast member Adam Sandler, introducing a collaboration between Post Malone and Nirvana. 'We love you buddy.' And Marcus Mumford, lead singer of the British folk band Mumford & Sons, said he was there to represent Michaels' admirers from across the pond. Creative collaborations The night featured fascinating collaborations that brought together musicians of all kinds. Cyrus teamed with Brittany Howard to sing Queen’s 'Crazy Little Thing Called Love.' Arcade Fire joined with David Byrne, St. Vincent and the Preservation Hall Jazz Band to perform David Bowie’s 'Heroes.' Byrne later also collaborated with Robyn, in matching khaki suits, for 'Dancing on My Own' and 'This Must Be the Place (Naive Melody).' And for Raitt's second song, she sat down with Chris Martin, the Coldplay frontman becoming her pianist for 'I Can’t Make You Love Me.' In another collab of sorts, the B-52s were joined on 'Love Shack' by former and current SNL cast members Fred Armisen, Bowen Yang and Sarah Sherman, singing the 'bang bang' lyrics. Lady Gaga collaborated with herself, singing both parts of 'Shallow' and bringing down the house. Most valuable player Questlove is more associated with the 'Tonight' show, but he is proving to be the MVP of these 'Saturday Night Live' anniversary festivities. Not only did the drummer produce the splendid documentary on the 'SNL' musical legacy, but he effortlessly kept the beat with The Roots, his legendary hip-hop group and 'Tonight' show house band, as they covered every style imaginable, from Snoop to Eddie Vedder to Brandi Carlile. Byrne bowed in appreciation. A second Nirvana reunion For the second time in as many weeks, the surviving members of Nirvana reunited. Rather than the quartet of women who fronted the band for the Fire Aid concert, Malone took Kurt Cobain’s place Friday. Their version of 'Smells Like Teen Spirit' was fierce, a reminder of why the song packed such a wallop when it was first heard.	https://www.voanews.com/a/stars-galore-celebrate-saturday-night-live-in-concert/7976367.html	2025-02-15T10:42:28-08:00	
G7 ministers link future Russia sanctions to good-faith talks	MUNICH — G7 foreign ministers agreed Saturday to continuing working together to get a strong peace deal for Ukraine with robust security guarantees and linked future sanctions on Russia to good-faith negotiations by Moscow. 'Any new, additional sanctions after February should be linked to whether the Russian Federation enters into real, good-faith efforts to bring an enduring end to the war against Ukraine that provides Ukraine with long-term security and stability as a sovereign, independent country,' the statement, which includes U.S. Secretary of State Marco Rubio, said after a meeting on the sidelines of the Munich Security Conference. The G7, which also includes France, Germany, Italy, Canada, Japan, Britain and the EU, underscored its commitment to help achieve a durable peace and 'the need to develop robust security guarantees to ensure the war will not begin again.' Possible informal Ukraine summit Meanwhile, France is discussing with its allies the possibility of holding an informal meeting among European leaders on Ukraine, although nothing has been decided at this stage, a French presidency official said Saturday. Speaking on a panel at the Munich Security Conference on Saturday, Polish Foreign Minister Radoslaw Sikorski said that French President Emmanuel Macron had called for a summit of European leaders in Paris. 'President [Donald] Trump has a method of operating, which the Russians call ‘reconnaissance through battle.’ You push and you see what happens, and then you change your position, legitimate tactics. And we need to respond,' Sikorski said. 'And I'm very glad that President Macron has called our leaders to Paris tomorrow, and I expect them to relate to this in a very serious fashion.' The French presidency official said that if there were to be any such summit, it would not be held Sunday. 'I am glad that the Prime Minister @donaldtusk will go on Monday at the invitation of the President @EmmanuelMacron to a meeting of European leaders. We need to show our strength and unity,' Sikorski later said on X, referring to Polish leader Donald Tusk. It was not clear whether the invite would be sent only to European Union member states or more broadly and whether Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy would be invited.	https://www.voanews.com/a/g7-ministers-link-future-russia-sanctions-to-good-faith-talks/7976347.html	2025-02-15T10:16:53-08:00	
New African Union leader elected as two major crises rage	The leaders of Africa Union countries on Saturday chose a new chief for the branch that runs the organization’s daily operations, as conflicts persist in two of the largest three countries on the continent. At their annual summit in Addis Ababa, Ethiopia, the organization’s members elected Djibouti Foreign Minister Mahmoud Ali Youssouf as the next chair of the African Union Commission in a secret ballot. Youssouf, who celebrated his 60th birthday a week ago, defeated Kenya’s former Prime Minister Raila Odinga and former Foreign Minister of Madagascar Richard Randriamandrato. The selection took several rounds of voting. Youssouf was a close second in the first and second rounds behind Raila. In the following four rounds, Youssouf took the lead until he became the sole candidate in the seventh round, with an unassailable 33 votes needed for victory in the final. He replaces Moussa Faki Mahamat of Chad, who served two terms as AU commissioner. Youssouf, who has been minister of foreign affairs of the Republic of Djibouti since 2005, is the longest-serving foreign minister on the continent. All 55 member states, with the exception of six countries that were suspended from membership, are taking part in the summit. An Ethiopian Foreign Ministry source speaking on condition of anonymity because they were not authorized to speak on the matter told VOA’s Horn of Africa Service that 29 presidents, three vice presidents, four prime ministers and a king are in attendance. New chief inherits crises The election of the new chief comes as the conflict in Africa’s second-largest country, the Democratic Republic of Congo, escalates following recent territorial gains by M23 rebels. The M23 forces approached the second-biggest city in eastern DRC, Bukavu, two weeks after seizing the main city of Goma. The DRC accuses Rwanda of backing the rebels, although Rwanda denies supporting M23. The continent’s leaders called for an immediate and unconditional ceasefire, cessation of hostilities and the reopening of main supply routes and Goma airport. Sudan is another major focal point of conflict that leaders are discussing. United Nations Secretary-General Antonio Guterres, who is at the summit, called on warring parties in Sudan to cease hostilities and protect civilians, including humanitarian workers. Guterres appealed for $6 billion to address the needs of about 26 million Sudanese who need emergency assistance. In an interview with VOA Horn of Africa last year, Youssouf vowed to work on 'silencing the guns' on the continent. 'Silencing the gun, you know, preventing conflicts, resolving those wars and internal crises ... that we are faced with already is one of the priorities,' he said. 'Of course, this is something that we need to work on, and I'll make sure that the commission will concentrate on that particular program.' Youssouf also said he will work to reform the organization, recruit the most qualified and skilled Africans, and make excellence, merit and competence the key principle. 'If you have a good staff at the commission, it will be much easier for all of us to implement the reforms that have already been enacted by our leaders,' he said. Meanwhile, Angolan President Joao Manuel Goncalves Lourenco took the rotating African Union chairmanship, replacing Mauritanian President Mohamed Ould Cheikh Ghazouani.	https://www.voanews.com/a/new-african-union-leader-elected-as-two-major-crises-rage/7976339.html	2025-02-15T09:57:51-08:00	
Vatican: Pope spent quiet night in hospital, continues drug therapy	ROME — Pope Francis slept well during a quiet first night in the hospital after being admitted with a respiratory tract infection and was up eating and reading Saturday, the Vatican said. Francis, 88, ate breakfast Saturday morning and read the newspapers while continuing his drug therapy, spokesperson Matteo Bruni said. The Argentine pope was admitted to Rome’s Gemelli Hospital Friday after a weeklong bout of bronchitis worsened. It was his fourth hospitalization since his 2013 election and raised questions about his increasingly precarious health. Preliminary tests showed he had a respiratory tract infection and a slight fever. The Vatican canceled his audiences through Monday at least. Francis, who is prone to respiratory infections in winter, was diagnosed with bronchitis Feb. 6 but had continued to hold daily audiences in his Vatican hotel suite. He had presided at an outdoor Mass last weekend and attended his general audience Wednesday. But he has been handing off his speeches for an aide to read aloud, saying he was having trouble breathing. Francis had part of one lung removed as a young man and has battled other health problems. He had 33 centimeters of his large intestine removed in 2021 because of a narrowing of the colon. He had further abdominal surgery in 2023 to remove intestinal scar tissue and repair a hernia. He uses a wheelchair, walker or cane when moving around his apartment and recently fell twice, hurting his arm and chin. Francis is being treated at Rome’s Gemelli Hospital, where popes have a private suite on the 10th floor. He revealed that during a 2023 hospitalization, he was diagnosed with 'an acute and strong pneumonia, in the lower part of the lungs.' Sometimes bronchitis can lead to pneumonia, a deeper and far more serious infection of the lungs’ air sacs.	https://www.voanews.com/a/vatican-pope-spent-quiet-night-in-hospital-continues-drug-therapy/7976297.html	2025-02-15T09:09:14-08:00	
Iran orders probe into killing of university student during robbery	DUBAI, UNITED ARAB EMIRATES — Iran’s vice president ordered a probe Saturday into the killing of a university student after a protest at Tehran University, state media reported. A report by the official IRNA news agency said First Vice President Mohammad Reza Aref ordered security officials to probe the case 'immediately.' The move came a day after angry students gathered in protest at a Tehran University dormitory seeking more safety measures. The protest briefly turned violent, and police deployed forces to the gate of the dorm, according to videos on social media. The Associated Press could not independently verify the footage. Protesters, chanting 'Shame on you,' demanded more safety measures at the dorm and its neighborhood, complaining about occasional robberies. On Wednesday, 19-year-old business administration student Amir Mohammad Khaleghi was stabbed by two unknown robbers who stole his backpack in front of the dorm. Khaleghi died in the hospital. Peace returned to the dorm late Friday after authorities vowed to pursue the case with a 'special' order. Although the protest was not politically motivated, such events can ignite unrest as Iranian people under U.S. economic sanctions are dealing with the high price of meeting their daily needs, as well as widespread mismanagement. Iranian universities have a history of protest over the past decades. Most recently, in 2022, universities were major sites of protest over the death of a 22-year-old woman, Mahsa Amini, who died in police custody after she was detained by the morality police for allegedly not wearing the Muslim headscarf correctly. The protests that followed Amini’s death started first with the chant 'Woman, Life, Freedom.' However, the protesters’ cries soon grew into open calls of revolt against the incumbent theocracy. The monthslong nationwide protests, which shook the establishment, ended in early 2023 after a security crackdown during which more than 500 people were killed and over 22,000 detained. In 1999, student protests in Tehran over the government’s closing of a reformist newspaper and a subsequent security force crackdown saw several people killed, hundreds wounded and more arrested.	https://www.voanews.com/a/iran-orders-probe-into-killing-of-university-student-during-robbery/7976244.html	2025-02-15T08:06:19-08:00	
Chaos, looting break out as rebels push toward major DRC city	GOMA, DEMOCRATIC REPUBLIC OF CONGO — Panic swept through eastern Congo’s second-largest city on Saturday as residents fled by the thousands, scrambling to escape the looming advance of Rwanda-backed rebels. Amid chaos and looting, Bukavu braced for what comes next. A day after M23 fighters entered the outskirts of Bukavu — a city of about 1.3 million people that lies 101 kilometers south of rebel-held Goma — some streets were flooded by residents attempting to leave and looters filling flour sacks with what they could find. Most people waited in their home, shocked by what filled the vacuum left by Congolese soldiers who abandoned their posts. 'They set fire to the ammunition they were unable to take with them,' said Alain Iragi, among the residents who fled in search of safety on Saturday. Reports and social media videos showed the region's factories pillaged and prisons emptied while electricity remained on and communication lines open. 'It’s a disgrace. Some citizens have fallen victim to stray bullets. Even some soldiers still present in the city are involved en masse in these cases of looting,' a 25-year-old resident of a neighborhood being looted told The Associated Press. The Congo River Alliance, a coalition of rebel groups that includes M23, blamed Congolese troops and their allies from local militia and neighboring Burundi for the disorder in Bukavu. 'We call on the population to remain in control of their city and not give in to panic,' Lawrence Kanyuka, the alliance's spokesperson, said in a statement on Saturday. Rebels push south M23, a militia backed by about 4,000 troops from neighboring Rwanda, is the most prominent of more than 100 armed groups vying for control of Congo’s mineral-rich east. The DRC government has repeatedly accused Rwanda of supporting the M23 rebel group, a claim that Rwanda denies. Kigali, in turn, alleges that Kinshasa collaborates with the Democratic Forces for the Liberation of Rwanda, or the FDLR, a Hutu armed group with ties to the perpetrators of the 1994 Rwandan genocide, an allegation the DRC rejects. While the United Nations and United States consider M23 a rebel group, DRC considers it a terrorist organization. Military operations in the region remain fluid, with clashes leading to significant displacement and humanitarian concerns. Analysts warn that continued instability risks deepening the regional conflict, and several peacekeepers from the Southern African Development Community, or SADC, already have been killed since the recent rebel offensive. Congolese authorities and international observers have accused it of sexual violence, forced conscription and summary executions. M23's southward expansion encompasses more territory than rebels had previously seized and poses an unprecedented challenge to the central government in Kinshasa. The rebellion underway has killed at least 2,000 people in eastern Congo and stranded hundreds of thousands of displaced. At least 350,000 internally displaced people are without shelter, the U.N. and Congolese authorities have said. The rebels on Friday also claimed to have seized a second airport in the region, in the town of Kavumu outside Bukavu. The AP could not confirm who was in control of the strategically important airport, which Congolese forces have used to resupply troops and humanitarian groups to import aid. The Congo River Alliance claimed on Saturday that M23 had taken control of the airport to prevent Congolese forces from launch airstrikes against civilians. Government officials and local civil society leaders did not immediately comment, although Congo's Communications Ministry said the rebels had violated ceasefire agreements and attacked Congolese troops working to avoid urban warfare and violence in Bukavu. The reports of looting and disorder come a day after residents told AP that soldiers in Kavumu — the airport town north of Bukavu — had abandoned their positions to head toward the city. The chain of events mirror what transpired last month in the lead-up to the M23's capture of Goma. Congo’s military, despite its size and funding, has long been hindered by shortcomings in training and coordination and recurring reports of corruption. Fears of spreading conflict International leaders are expected to discuss the conflict at the African Union summit in Ethiopia this weekend as DRC President Felix Tshisekedi continues to plead with the international community to intervene to contain the rebels from advancing. However, little progress has been made since the government dismissed a ceasefire that M23 declared last week unilaterally as false. 'Regional escalation must be avoided at all costs,' U.N. Secretary-General Antonio Guterres said in Addis Ababa. 'The sovereignty and territorial integrity of [Congo] must be respected.'	https://www.voanews.com/a/chaos-looting-break-out-as-rebels-push-toward-major-drc-city/7976234.html	2025-02-15T07:49:52-08:00	
Serbia's striking students, president hold parallel rallies	KRAGUJEVAC, SERBIA — Serbia’s striking students and supporters of populist President Aleksandar Vucic were holding parallel rallies Saturday as both marked the country's Statehood Day with notably contrasting messages. The student-led protest is the latest in a nationwide anti-graft movement that reflects mounting calls for fundamental political changes in the Balkan state, triggered after a concrete canopy on a railway station in the northern city of Novi Sad collapsed on Nov. 1, killing 15 people. The rally in the central industrial city of Kragujevac drew tens of thousands of people demanding justice over the accident and respect for the rule of law. The movement has been seeking to root out rampant endemic corruption. Students chose Kragujevac for Saturday's rally because of its history. In 1835, Serbia was still part of the Ottoman Empire, and people in Kragujevac announced a new constitution that sought to limit the powers of the then-rulers. The date is now celebrated as Statehood Day. People from all over the country streamed into Kragujevac for Saturday’s gathering. 'I am here to support this student rebellion, which has grown into a civil rebellion, and to fight for the rule of law and justice in this society, so that Serbia becomes a country where life is dignified,' said a woman from Belgrade who identified herself only by the name Teodora. The students arrived Friday to cheers from the residents. Ahead of the protest, they organized marches in various parts of the country, encouraging people to converge in Kragujevac. Some walked; others ran or cycled. Along their journey, people greeted them with food and refreshments and offered accommodation, many crying and expressing hope for change. The president's rally Meanwhile, in Sremska Mitrovica, a small town northwest of Belgrade, Vucic is expected to recycle a traditional nationalist theme, warning that the West wants to unseat him by force and that this could lead to the breakup of the country. Serbian authorities were set to bus in thousands of supporters from throughout the country as well as neighboring Bosnia. Some opposition activists have said they will try to prevent their arrival. Vucic said on Instagram that his supporters wish to 'defend and save Serbia from those who want to destroy it.' The anti-graft movement is Vucic's biggest challenge in recent years. The president — who has ruled Serbia with a firm grip on power for more than a decade — and his right-wing Serbian Progressive Party have been previously accused of stifling democratic freedoms, publicly discrediting opponents and rigging elections, according to international vote observers. The canopy disaster, widely believed to have happened due to government corruption, has become a flashpoint for wider discontent with the authoritarian rule, with university students at the forefront of the anti-graft uprising. Their determination, youth and creativity have struck a chord among people widely disillusioned with politicians. Prosecutors have charged 13 people over the canopy fall, and protests have forced the resignation of Serbia’s prime minister. But students have said their protests will continue until their demands for full accountability are met. In the past three months, the president has shifted between accusing the students of working for foreign powers to offering concessions and claiming he has fulfilled each of their demands. But during a trip to the Serb-controlled part of neighboring Bosnia this week, Vucic has reiterated claims about an alleged plot from abroad to overthrow him and his government. The authorities, Vucic said, 'couldn’t believe how much money has been invested to bring down the government in Serbia.' He offered no proof for the claims. Vucic's trip to the Serb-controlled part of Bosnia was apparently designed to stress Serbian unity with the Serbs in Bosnia, where a bid to create a pan-Serb state in the 1990s’ was widely blamed for triggering a bloody war that killed more than 100,000 people killed and displaced millions.	https://www.voanews.com/a/serbia-s-striking-students-president-hold-parallel-rallies/7976209.html	2025-02-15T07:31:55-08:00	
US defense secretary's Europe debut irks allies, wins Trump's nod	WASHINGTON — U.S. Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth's attention-grabbing overseas debut may have irritated some key Republicans and alienated allies in Europe, where his statements on Ukraine and NATO went down like a lead balloon. But his forceful comments gained him a nod from one key listener: U.S. President Donald Trump. And Hegseth — who on Saturday wraps up a weeklong trip to Belgium, Germany and Poland — delivered a message at the heart of Trump's 'America First' agenda. Speaking at the NATO headquarters in Brussels on Wednesday, Hegseth said that a return to Ukraine's pre-2014 borders was unrealistic, and that the Trump administration does not see NATO membership for Kyiv as part of a solution to the war triggered by Russia's 2022 invasion. Trump broadly backed Hegseth's remarks on Thursday on NATO membership, saying, 'I think probably that's true,' because, he said, Putin would not allow Ukraine to join the military alliance. 'I thought his comments were good yesterday, and they're probably good today,' Trump said. Senator Roger Wicker, the Republican who leads the Pentagon's main oversight committee in the Senate, had championed Hegseth's nomination throughout a bruising confirmation review in which Democrats united against the nominee and three Republicans joined them, as questions were raised about Hegseth's qualifications, temperament and views about women in combat. Asked whether he spent a lot of political capital getting Hegseth, a military veteran and former Fox News personality, confirmed, Wicker said: 'I surely did, yes.' Republican Congressman Mike Turner said issues like the future of NATO membership for Ukraine should not be taken off the table. 'We don't need members of the Cabinet, President Trump's Cabinet, to be defining those in the public,' Turner said Friday on CNN. Republican Congressman Don Bacon responded to Hegseth's comments by saying that there should be moral clarity on who started the war. 'There are consequences of rewarding the invader even if its leader foolishly led over 700,000 of its citizens to slaughter,' Bacon said on social media platform X. Uncle Sam or Uncle Sucker? Trump has played down any tensions. On Friday, he said he had not seen Wicker's comments but would reach out to him and Hegseth. 'Roger's a very good friend of mine, and Pete is obviously, he's been doing a great job,' Trump said. Hegseth, in what some analysts saw as walking back his remarks, clarified on Thursday that Trump was the one who would ultimately decide what was on or off the table in the Ukraine talks. Calling Trump the world's best negotiator, Hegseth said it would not be appropriate for him to 'declare what President Trump will do or won't do, what will be in or what will be out.' He also delivered a message that resonates with Trump and his 'America First' agenda: Europe has been taking advantage of the United States. Hegseth spoke about Europe's reliance on costly U.S. military deployments for its defense. Trump has criticized Europe over what he sees as its unfair tariffs against American goods. The United States and European Union have the world's largest commercial relationship, trading $1.55 trillion of goods and services in 2023. Speaking to reporters at NATO headquarters, Hegseth said: 'Make no mistake: President Trump will not allow anyone to turn Uncle Sam into 'Uncle Sucker.'' In Trump's first term, NATO was seen as a red line for his Pentagon chiefs. Jim Mattis, his first defense secretary, resigned in part because of Trump's skepticism toward NATO. America's European allies were critical of Hegseth. 'I think that was clumsy. I think that was a mistake,' German Defense Minister Boris Pistorius said, also criticizing Trump. European foreign policy chief Kaja Kallas went further. 'It is appeasement. It has never worked,' she said.	https://www.voanews.com/a/us-defense-secretary-s-europe-debut-irks-allies-wins-trump-s-nod/7976197.html	2025-02-15T07:06:03-08:00	
Pakistan clashes result in 4 dead soldiers, 15 militants	ISLAMABAD — Pakistan said Saturday that counterterrorism operations in two volatile northwestern districts resulted in the deaths of four soldiers, including an officer, and 15 insurgents during the ensuing clashes. A military statement said the deadly violence erupted when its forces carried out 'intelligence-based' raids on militant locations in Dera Ismail Khan and North Waziristan, which borders Afghanistan. The statement identified the slain militants as 'khwarij,' a term employed by the government for individuals affiliated with the Tehrik-i-Taliban Pakistan, or TTP, a globally recognized terrorist organization. Local security sources reported that the soldier fatalities occurred during clashes in the Waziristan area. The official claims about militant casualties could not be verified by independent sources. The TTP did not comment on the reported clashes in the districts, where the militant group routinely attacks security forces and their installations. Pakistan maintains that TTP leaders and fighters use sanctuaries in Afghanistan to orchestrate cross-border terrorism with the help of the neighboring country’s Taliban government, which has not yet received official recognition from any country. The allegations have strained Islamabad's relationship with de facto Afghan leaders in Kabul, who consistently have denied the presence of the TTP or any other foreign terrorist organizations within their territory. 'One of the key issues bedeviling our relations remains the sanctuaries enjoyed by terrorists belonging to the TTP on Afghan territory,' Pakistani Foreign Ministry spokesperson Shafqat Ali Khan told a weekly news conference on Friday. 'We continue to remain engaged with Afghanistan and also make them realize that the long-term potential of the region, the bilateral cooperation and what it can bring for the benefit or welfare of the two countries will remain unmet unless this problem is resolved.' UN backing The latest report by the United Nations Analytical Support and Sanctions Monitoring Team, released earlier this week, highlights Islamabad’s concerns, stating that the TTP has 'significantly increased' its attacks in Pakistan and from Afghan territory. The report stated that Taliban authorities in Afghanistan 'continued to provide the TTP with logistical and operational space and financial support.' It added that the group 'established new training centers' in the Afghan provinces of Kunar, Nangarhar, Khost and Paktika 'while enhancing recruitment within TTP cadres, including from the Afghan Taliban.' The U.N. assessment also emphasized the growing terrorism threat from al-Qaida and the regional Islamic State affiliate operating in Afghanistan since the Taliban retook control of the country in 2021. 'The Taliban maintained a permissive environment allowing al-Qaida to consolidate, with the presence of safe houses and training camps scattered across Afghanistan,' the report said. It stated that Afghanistan 'remained the main hub' for the regional Islamic State affiliate, known as Islamic State-Khorasan (IS-K), primarily 'for its recruitment and facilitation.' The spokesperson for the Taliban government dismissed U.N. findings on Friday as 'inaccurate' and contrary to reality. 'The Islamic Emirate [Taliban government] does not allow any foreign, rogue group to operate in Afghanistan, and such groups are not present here,' Zabihullah Mujahid told the local TOLO news channel. 'Unfortunately, some countries and intelligence circles, through organizations like the United Nations and the Security Council, are tarnishing public opinion and waging propaganda and campaigns against Afghanistan,' Mujahid stated, without elaborating.	https://www.voanews.com/a/pakistan-clashes-result-in-4-dead-soldiers-15-militants/7976188.html	2025-02-15T06:47:55-08:00	
US Justice Department asks court to dismiss charges against NYC mayor	NEW YORK — The U.S. Justice Department asked a court Friday to dismiss corruption charges against New York City Mayor Eric Adams, with a top official from Washington intervening after federal prosecutors in Manhattan rebuffed his demands to drop the case and some quit in protest. Acting Deputy Attorney General Emil Bove, the department’s second-in-command, and lawyers from the public integrity section and criminal division filed paperwork asking to end the case. They contend that it was marred by appearances of impropriety and that letting it continue would interfere with the mayor’s reelection bid. A judge must still approve the request. The filing came hours after Bove convened a call with the prosecutors in the Justice Department’s public integrity section — which handles corruption cases — and gave them an hour to pick two people to sign onto the motion to dismiss, saying those who did so could be promoted, according to a person familiar with the matter. After prosecutors got off the call with Bove, the consensus among the group was that they would all resign. But a veteran prosecutor stepped up out of concern for the jobs of the younger people in the unit, said the person, who spoke on the condition of anonymity to discuss details of the private meeting. The three-page dismissal motion bore Bove's signature and the names of Edward Sullivan, the public integrity section’s senior litigation counsel, and Antoinette Bacon, a supervisory official in the department’s criminal division. No one from the federal prosecutor’s office in Manhattan, which brought the Adams case, signed the document. The move came five days into a showdown between Justice Department leadership in Washington and its Manhattan office, which has long prided itself on its independence as it has taken on Wall Street malfeasance, political corruption and international terrorism. At least seven prosecutors in Manhattan and Washington quit rather than carry out Bove’s directive to halt the case, including interim Manhattan U.S. Attorney Danielle Sassoon and the acting chief of the public integrity section in Washington. The Justice Department said in its motion to Judge Dale E. Ho that it was seeking to dismiss Adams’ charges with the option of refiling them later. Ho had yet to act on the request as of Friday evening. 'I imagine the judge is going to want to explore what his role is under the rules,' said Joshua Naftalis, a former Manhattan federal prosecutor who is not involved in Adams’ case. 'I would expect the court to either ask the parties to come in person to court or to file papers, or both.' Bove said earlier this week that U.S. President Donald Trump’s permanent, appointed Manhattan U.S. attorney, who has yet to be confirmed by the Senate, can decide whether to refile the charges after the November election. Adams faces a Democratic primary in June, with several challengers lined up. His trial had been on track to be held in the spring. Bove said that continuing the prosecution would interfere with Adams’ ability to govern, posing 'unacceptable threats to public safety, national security, and related federal immigration initiatives and policies,' the dismissal motion said. Among other things, it said, the case caused Adams to be denied access to sensitive information necessary to help protect the city. Adams pleaded not guilty in September to charges he accepted more than $100,000 in illegal campaign contributions and lavish travel perks from foreign nationals looking to buy his influence while he was Brooklyn borough president campaigning to be mayor. Although critical in the past, Adams has bonded at times with Trump recently and visited him at his Florida golf club last month. The president has criticized the case against Adams and said he was open to giving the mayor, who was a registered Republican in the 1990s, a pardon. Bove sent a memo Monday directing Sassoon, a Republican, to drop the case. He argued the mayor was needed in Trump’s immigration crackdown and echoed Adams’ claims that the case was retaliation for his criticism of Biden administration immigration policies. Instead of complying, Sassoon resigned Thursday, along with five high-ranking Justice Department officials in Washington. A day earlier, she sent a letter to Trump’s new attorney general, Pam Bondi, asking her to meet and reconsider the directive to drop the case. Sassoon suggested in her letter that Ho 'appears likely to conduct a searching inquiry' as to why the case should be dismissed. She noted that in at least one instance, a judge has rejected such a request as contrary to the public interest. 'A rigorous inquiry here would be consistent with precedent and practice in this and other districts,' she wrote. Seven former Manhattan U.S. attorneys, including James Comey, Geoffrey S. Berman and Mary Jo White, issued a statement lauding Sassoon’s 'commitment to integrity and the rule of law.' On Friday, Hagan Scotten, an assistant U.S. attorney in Manhattan who worked for Sassoon and had a leading role in Adams' case, became the seventh prosecutor to resign — and blasted Bove in the process. Scotten wrote in a resignation letter to Bove that it would take a 'fool' or a 'coward' to meet his demand to drop the charges, 'But it was never going to be me.' He told Bove he was 'entirely in agreement' with Sassoon’s decision. Scotten and other Adams case prosecutors were suspended with pay on Thursday by Bove, who launched a probe of the prosecutors that he said would determine whether they kept their jobs. Scotten is an Army veteran who earned two Bronze medals serving in Iraq as a Special Forces troop commander. He graduated from Harvard Law School at the top of his class in 2010 and clerked for Chief Justice John Roberts. In her letter to Bondi, Sassoon accused Adams’ lawyers of offering what amounted to a 'quid pro quo' — his help on immigration in exchange for dropping the case — when they met with Justice Department officials in Washington last month. Adams' lawyer Alex Spiro said Thursday that the allegation of a quid pro quo was a 'total lie.' 'We were asked if the case had any bearing on national security and immigration enforcement and we truthfully answered it did,' Spiro said in an email to reporters. On Friday, Adams added: 'I never offered — nor did anyone offer on my behalf — any trade of my authority as your mayor for an end to my case. Never.' Scotten seconded Sassoon’s objections in his letter, writing: 'No system of ordered liberty can allow the Government to use the carrot of dismissing charges, or the stick of threatening to bring them again, to induce an elected official to support its policy objectives.' The prosecutor, who appeared in court for various hearings in the case, said he was following 'a tradition in public service of resigning in a last-ditch effort to head off a serious mistake.' He said he could see how a president such as Trump, with a background in business and politics, 'might see the contemplated dismissal-with-leverage as a good, if distasteful, deal.' But he said any prosecutor 'would know that our laws and traditions do not allow using the prosecutorial power to influence other citizens, much less elected officials, in this way.'	https://www.voanews.com/a/us-justice-department-asks-court-to-dismiss-charges-against-nyc-mayor/7976083.html	2025-02-15T03:58:04-08:00	
Zelenskyy calls for creation of ‘Armed Forces of Europe’	Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy called for the creation of a unified European military force, saying the continent must be self-reliant amid a persistent threat from Russia and uncertainty about U.S. support -- a situation he described as 'this new reality.' 'We must build the Armed Forces of Europe so that Europe's future depends only on Europeans and decisions about Europe are made in Europe,' Zelenskyy said in a speech at the Munich Security Conference on Feb. 15. Amid concerns in Kyiv and Brussels that they could be sidelined in efforts to end Russia's full-scale invasion of Ukraine, resulting in a deal favoring Moscow, he repeated that Ukraine and Europe must be involved in any negotiations. 'Ukraine will never accept deals behind our backs without our involvement,' Zelenskyy said. 'The same rule should apply to all of Europe. No decisions about Ukraine without Ukraine -- no decisions about Europe without Europe.' 'We must act as Europe, not as some separate people,' Zelenskyy said. Speaking almost three years after Russia launched the full-scale invasion, he said he would 'not take NATO membership for Ukraine off the table' and said Kyiv would not agree to any ceasefire without real security guarantees. 'If not NATO membership, then conditions to build another NATO in Ukraine,' he said. He questioned the U.S. commitment to Europe, saying: 'Does America need Europe? As a market, yes, as an ally -- I don't know.' Zelenskyy's address came a day after meeting with top U.S. officials, including Vice President JD Vance, who stressed the need for a 'durable, lasting peace' in Ukraine in his speech to the conference on Feb. 14. Zelenskyy told Vance that Ukraine wants 'security guarantees' from Washington before any negotiations with Russia on ending almost three years of war. The United States has sent mixed signals on its strategy, sparking worry in Kyiv that Ukraine could be forced into a bad deal that leaves Putin emboldened. U.S. Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth told NATO defense ministers earlier this week that it's 'unrealistic' to expect Ukraine's borders to return to their pre-2014 positions and said NATO membership is not seen by the White House as part of the solution to the conflict. Ukraine demands Russia withdraw from captured territory and says it must receive NATO membership or equivalent security guarantees to prevent Moscow from attacking again. Speaking in Warsaw on Feb. 14, he again warned that America's European NATO partners would have to do far more for their own defense and to secure a future Ukraine peace. Hegseth also argued that you 'don't have to trust' President Vladimir Putin to negotiate with Russia. Two days earlier U.S. President Donald Trump said he had a 'lengthy and highly productive' phone call with Putin and said they agreed that their teams should begin negotiations immediately. Zelenskyy responded by saying he wouldn't accept any deals made without Ukraine's involvement. Asked in an interview with NBC on Feb. 14 if he believed that Ukraine would be vulnerable in another few years if a ceasefire were reached, Zelenskyy said: 'Yes, I think this can be.' He said Putin wanted to come to the negotiating table not to end the war but to get a cease-fire deal to lift some sanctions on Russia and allow Moscow's military to regroup. 'This is really what he wants. He wants pause, prepare, train, take off some sanctions, because of ceasefire,' Zelenskyy said. Vance, who is representing Trump at the high-profile gathering of world leaders and foreign policy experts, said the United States wants 'the kind of peace that's going to have Eastern Europe in conflict just a couple years down the road.' There have been a number of 'good conversations' with Ukraine, and more would follow 'in the days, weeks and months to come,' Vance said. Zelenskyy agreed, calling the meeting with Vance 'a good conversation' and said Kyiv wants to work toward ending Russia's war in Ukraine, but added that 'we need real security guarantees.' Some information for this report came from NBC News.	https://www.voanews.com/a/zelenskyy-calls-for-creation-of-armed-forces-of-europe-/7976068.html	2025-02-15T02:38:08-08:00	
No need for one country to control chip industry, Taiwan official says	TAIPEI, TAIWAN — There is no need for one country to control the semiconductor industry, which is complex and needs a division of labor, Taiwan's top technology official said on Saturday after U.S. President Donald Trump criticized the island's chip dominance. Trump repeated claims on Thursday that Taiwan had taken the industry and he wanted it back in the United States, saying he aimed to restore U.S. chip manufacturing. Wu Cheng-wen, head of Taiwan's National Science and Technology Council, did not name Trump in a Facebook post but referred to Taiwan President Lai Ching-te's comments on Friday that the island would be a reliable partner in the democratic supply chain of the global semiconductor industry. Wu wrote that Taiwan has in recent years often been asked how its semiconductor industry had become an internationally acclaimed benchmark. 'How did we achieve this? Obviously, we did not gain this for no reason from other countries,' he said, recounting how the government developed the sector from the 1970s, including helping found TSMC, now the world's largest contract chipmaker, in 1987. 'This shows that Taiwan has invested half a century of hard work to achieve today's success, and it certainly wasn't something taken easily from other countries.' Each country has its own specialty for chips, from Japan making chemicals and equipment to the United States, which is 'second to none' on the design and application of innovative systems, Wu said. 'The semiconductor industry is highly complex and requires precise specialization and division of labor. Given that each country has its own unique industrial strengths, there is no need for a single nation to fully control or monopolize all technologies globally.' Taiwan is willing to be used as a base to assist 'friendly democratic countries' in playing their appropriate roles in the semiconductor supply chain, Wu said.	https://www.voanews.com/a/no-need-for-one-country-to-control-chip-industry-taiwan-official-says/7976061.html	2025-02-15T02:11:13-08:00	
Lebanon president vows punishment for attackers of UN peacekeeper	BEIRUT — Lebanese President Joseph Aoun vowed to punish the perpetrators of an attack on a United Nations peacekeeping convoy, with authorities set to hold an emergency meeting Saturday. The U.N. and Lebanese authorities have condemned Friday's attack, which came as Hezbollah supporters for a second night blocked the road to the country's only international airport over a decision barring two Iranian planes from landing there. Aoun 'emphasized that the attackers will receive their punishment' and said 'security forces will not be lenient with any party that tries to upset stability and civil peace,' according to a statement from the presidency on X. The UN Interim Force in Lebanon (UNIFIL) has demanded an investigation after one of its vehicles was set on fire during the incident, which wounded Nepalese outgoing deputy force commander Chok Bahadur Dhakal as he was returning home. Lebanese Prime Minister Nawaf Salam strongly condemned the 'criminal attack' and promised to arrest the perpetrators during a conversation with UN Special Coordinator for Lebanon Jeanine Hennis-Plasschaert and UNIFIL Commander General Aroldo Lazaro. Interior Minister Ahmad al-Hajjar has called an emergency security meeting on Saturday at 11 a.m. (0900 GMT) and said he visited two injured UNIFIL officers in hospital, emphasizing 'the Lebanese government's rejection of this attack.' The presidency's statement said Aoun had also checked on the deputy commander's condition and emphasized that the incident 'cannot be allowed to be repeated.' Aoun also 'followed up on developments regarding roadblocks, setting fires and riots, and issued directives to the army and security forces to put a stop to these practices,' the statement said, adding that the judiciary 'has begun investigations on the ground.' There was no immediate official comment from Hezbollah. However, the group's ally the Amal movement, led by powerful parliament speaker Nabih Berri, said 'the attack on UNIFIL is an attack on south Lebanon' and that 'blocking roads anywhere is an assault on civil peace.' 'Absolutely unacceptable' The army said Friday that several areas around the airport had seen 'demonstrations marked by acts of vandalism and clashes, including assaults on members of the armed forces and attacks against vehicles.' Videos circulating on social media showed demonstrators, some hooded and carrying Hezbollah flags, attacking a man in military garb and another in civilian clothes near the torched UNIFIL vehicle. U.N. chief Antonio Guterres condemned the incident, a spokesperson said Friday. 'Such attacks are absolutely unacceptable ... The safety and security of UN personnel and property must be respected at all times,' the statement from spokesperson Stephane Dujarric said. 'Attacks against peacekeepers are in breach of international law ... and may constitute war crimes,' the statement said, adding that 'UNIFIL must be allowed unrestricted freedom of movement throughout Lebanon in the implementation of its mandated activities.' Israel has repeatedly accused Hezbollah of using Beirut airport to transfer weapons from Iran, claims Hezbollah and Lebanese officials have repeatedly denied. The Iran-backed group has a large popular base in Lebanon, though a year of hostilities with Israel and the ousting of the group's ally Bashar al-Assad in neighboring Syria have left it weakened. Lebanon's Directorate General of Civil Aviation said Thursday it had 'temporarily rescheduled' some flights, including from Iran, until Feb. 18 as it was implementing 'additional security measures.' The date coincides with the deadline for the withdrawal of Israeli forces from south Lebanon and for Hezbollah to vacate positions there, under a ceasefire deal that began on Nov. 27.	https://www.voanews.com/a/lebanon-president-vows-punishment-for-attackers-of-un-peacekeeper/7976054.html	2025-02-15T01:57:07-08:00	
Ukraine would have ‘low chance to survive’ without US support, Zelenskyy says	Ukraine would have a 'very, very difficult' time surviving without U.S. military support to fend off Russia’s invasion, President Volodymyr Zelenskyy said in a interview broadcast the night before he is scheduled to address the Munich Security Conference. 'Probably it will be very, very, very difficult. And of course, you know in all the difficult situations, you have a chance,' he told NBC News. 'But we will have low chance -- low chance to survive without support of the United States.' Zelenskyy also said that Ukraine has increased its war production but not enough to make up for what it would lose if it did not have U.S. backing. Zelenskyy on Feb. 14 took part in a day of meetings and news briefings at the Munich Security Conference as efforts to seek a resolution to the war ramp up. The Ukrainian president is scheduled to deliver a speech on diplomacy and prospects for Ukraine's future at the conference on Feb. 15. He will take the spotlight after meeting with top U.S. officials, including Vice President JD Vance, who stressed the need for a 'durable, lasting peace' in Ukraine in his speech to the conference on Feb. 14. Zelenskyy told Vance that Ukraine wants 'security guarantees' from Washington before any negotiations with Russia on ending almost three years of war. Zelenskyy said in the interview that he doesn’t want to think about Ukraine not being a strategic partner of the United States because it would damage Ukrainian morale, but added, 'We have to think about it.' The United States has sent mixed signals on its strategy, sparking worry in Kyiv that Ukraine could be forced into a bad deal that leaves Putin emboldened.

China, Cook Islands sign strategic partnership pact	TAIPEI, TAIWAN — China and the Cook Islands on Friday signed a comprehensive strategic partnership agreement, but the lack of transparency around the details has alarmed New Zealand, the South Pacific state’s closest democratic ally. While details of the agreement remain unclear, public statements from Cook Islands Prime Minister Mark Brown and the islands’ Seabed Minerals Authority signaled that the Cook Islands and China would look to deepen cooperation in areas such as deep-sea mining, infrastructure enhancement, climate resilience, and economic cooperation. The signing of the agreement is part of Brown’s seven-day diplomatic tour to China, during which he visited several Chinese research institutions and met with Chinese Premier Li Qiang in the northern city of Harbin. Li said Beijing is willing to 'deepen political mutual trust and expand practical cooperation with the Cook Islands,' while Brown said his country will 'strengthen multilateral coordination on climate change and in other areas, and push for the sustained, in-depth development of the bilateral comprehensive strategic partnership.' Analysts say the agreement is Beijing’s latest effort to increase its influence in the Pacific region amid growing tension between some Pacific countries, including the Cook Islands and Kiribati, and such democratic allies as New Zealand and Australia. 'China benefits from friction between longstanding partnerships in the Pacific as it seeks to position itself as an alternative partner,' said Anna Powles, an associate professor in security studies at Massey University in New Zealand. New Zealand has expressed serious concerns about the deal between the Cook Islands and China, criticizing the South Pacific country for lack of transparency and consultation with Wellington over the details. The Cook Islands has a free association agreement with New Zealand, which allows it to manage its foreign affairs while requiring it to consult Wellington on issues related to foreign policy. 'Under our constitutional arrangements, we expect, you know, matters of defense and security to be transparently discussed between partners. That’s all we’re asking for here,' New Zealand’s Prime Minister Christopher Luxon told a news conference Monday. Despite New Zealand’s concerns, Brown has characterized conversations around the deal as 'guided by what is best for the Cook Islands' and said 'there is no need' for Wellington to get involved in the negotiation of the agreement with China. Meanwhile, China said its relationship with the Cook Islands 'does not target any third party, and should not be disrupted or restrained by any third party.' In addition to the lack of transparency and consultation, some experts say the China-Cook Islands agreement could also contain 'dual civil-military use technology and infrastructure.' 'This directly affects New Zealand and Cook Islands’ security and defense,' Anne-Marie Brady, an expert on Chinese foreign policy at the University of Canterbury in New Zealand, told VOA in by email. Tensions between Kiribati and democratic allies Tension is also rising between New Zealand and Kiribati, another South Pacific state. After failing to secure a meeting with Kiribati President Taneti Maamau in January, New Zealand Foreign Minister Winston Peters said Wellington would review development funding to Kiribati following the diplomatic snub. 'The lack of political-level contact makes it very difficult for us to agree on joint priorities for our development program and to ensure that it is well targeted and delivers good value for money,' Peters’ office said in a statement issued late last month. In addition to Peters, Australian Deputy Prime Minister Richard Marles did not secure a meeting with Maamau during a trip to Kiribati last month, but he stuck with the original plan by delivering a patrol boat to the Pacific Island country. Powles in New Zealand said Maamau’s decision not to meet with Peters and Marles may reflect a shift in Kiribati’s diplomatic focus. 'Kiribati’s primary bilateral relationships appear to be Fiji, Nauru, and China, and the lack of engagement with partners such as New Zealand reflects this,' she told VOA by email. Other experts say that while Kiribati and the Cook Islands are not necessarily looking to abandon their partnership with New Zealand, China will be looking to 'capitalize' on recent events. 'China would seek to undermine those relationships and say ‘the West is paternalistic and colonialist and doesn’t genuinely have your interests at heart as China does,’' Blake Johnson, a senior analyst at the Australian Strategic Policy Institute, told VOA by phone. Beijing’s attempts to increase diplomatic efforts in the Pacific also come as the United States freezes funding for foreign aid and New Zealand threatens to review development funding for Kiribati. Since most Pacific Island countries rely heavily on foreign aid, Johnson said a potential lack of funding from democratic allies could force countries in the Pacific region to seek support from China. 'China can be responsive when it wants to fill those [funding] gaps,' he said. To counter China’s attempt to increase diplomatic presence in the Pacific region, Parker Novak, a nonresident fellow at the Indo-Pacific Security Initiative at the Atlantic Council, said democratic countries, including Australia and the United States, should continue to provide support to Pacific Island countries. Australia, the U.S., and other like-minded countries should continue 'to foster positive, consultative relationships that help Pacific Island countries meet their development needs and provide a credible alternative to PRC inducements,' he told VOA by email.	https://www.voanews.com/a/china-cook-islands-sign-strategic-partnership-pact/7976033.html	2025-02-14T23:51:09-08:00	
Research finds ancient Egyptian mummies smell nice	LONDON — At first whiff, it sounds repulsive: Sniff the essence of an ancient corpse. But researchers who indulged their curiosity in the name of science found that well-preserved Egyptian mummies actually smell pretty good. 'In films and books, terrible things happen to those who smell mummified bodies,' said Cecilia Bembibre, director of research at University College London's Institute for Sustainable Heritage. 'We were surprised at the pleasantness of them.' 'Woody,' 'spicy' and 'sweet' were the leading descriptions from what sounded more like a wine tasting than a mummy-sniffing exercise. Floral notes were also detected, which could be from pine and juniper resins used in embalming. The study published Thursday in the Journal of the American Chemical Society used both chemical analysis and a panel of human sniffers to evaluate the odors from nine mummies as old as 5,000 years that had been either in storage or on display at the Egyptian Museum in Cairo. The researchers wanted to systematically study the smell of mummies because it has long been a subject of fascination for the public and researchers alike, said Bembibre, one of the report's authors. Archaeologists, historians, conservators and even fiction writers have devoted pages of their work to the subject — for good reason. Scent was an important consideration in the mummification process that used oils, waxes and balms to preserve the body and its spirit for the afterlife. The practice was largely reserved for pharaohs and nobility, and pleasant smells were associated with purity and deities, while bad odors were signs of corruption and decay. Without sampling the mummies themselves, which would be invasive, researchers from UCL and the University of Ljubljana in Slovenia were able to measure whether aromas were coming from the archaeological item, pesticides or other products used to conserve the remains, or from deterioration due to mold, bacteria or microorganisms. 'We were quite worried that we might find notes or hints of decaying bodies, which wasn't the case,' said Matija Strlic, a chemistry professor at the University of Ljubljana. 'We were specifically worried that there might be indications of microbial degradation, but that was not the case, which means that the environment in this museum is actually quite good in terms of preservation.' Using technical instruments to measure and quantify air molecules emitted from sarcophagi to determine the state of preservation without touching the mummies 'tells us potentially what social class a mummy was from and and therefore reveals a lot of information about the mummified body that is relevant not just to conservators, but to curators and archeologists as well,' Strlic said. 'We believe that this approach is potentially of huge interest to other types of museum collections.' Barbara Huber, a postdoctoral researcher at the Max Planck Institute of Geoanthropology in Germany, who was not involved in the study, said the findings provide crucial data on compounds that could preserve or degrade mummified remains. The information could be used to better protect the ancient bodies for future generations. 'However, the research also underscores a key challenge: The smells detected today are not necessarily those from the time of mummification,' Huber said. 'Over thousands of years, evaporation, oxidation and even storage conditions have significantly altered the original scent profile.' Huber authored a study two years ago that analyzed residue from a jar that had contained mummified organs of a noblewoman to identify embalming ingredients, their origins and what they revealed about trade routes. She then worked with a perfumer to create an interpretation of the embalming scent, known as 'Scent of Eternity,' for an exhibition at the Moesgaard Museum in Denmark. Researchers of the current study hope to do something similar, using their findings to develop 'smellscapes' to artificially re-create the scents they detected and enhance the experience for future museumgoers. 'Museums have been called white cubes, where you are prompted to read, to see, to approach everything from a distance with your eyes,' Bembibre said. 'Observing the mummified bodies through a glass case reduces the experience because we don't get to smell them. We don't get to know about the mummification process in an experiential way, which is one of the ways that we understand and engage with the world.'	https://www.voanews.com/a/research-finds-ancient-egyptian-mummies-smell-nice/7975974.html	2025-02-14T22:54:04-08:00	
Why is Trump pausing US anti-bribery law?	washington — U.S. President Donald Trump signed an executive order this week pausing almost all enforcement of a decades-old U.S. anti-bribery law. The law, known as the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act, makes it illegal for both U.S. firms and foreign companies with a U.S. connection to bribe foreign officials. Transparency advocates have credited the U.S. Justice Department's vigorous enforcement of the law over the past two decades with curbing foreign corruption. Critics, including business leaders, however, have long complained that the law puts U.S. companies at a disadvantage in international markets where certain business practices are common. Trump, a longtime critic of the FCPA, voiced those concerns during the Oval Office signing ceremony on Monday. 'It sounds good on paper, but in practicality it's a disaster,' Trump said. 'It means that if an American goes to a foreign country and starts doing business there legally, legitimately or otherwise, it's almost a guaranteed investigation, indictment, and nobody wants to do business with the Americans because of it.' Here is a breakdown of the law and the implications of the executive order for foreign bribery and U.S. business. What is the FCPA? The FCPA is a U.S. law that prohibits companies from providing cash payments or valuable gifts to foreign officials for business advantages. While the law exempts certain 'facilitation payments,' it prohibits the use of third parties to make bribes. The FCPA was enacted in 1977 following post-Watergate investigations that revealed widespread foreign bribery by U.S.-based multinational corporations. Congress, concerned about the impact on U.S. foreign policy and international standing, responded by criminalizing such practices, imposing prison terms and substantial penalties on violators. Though initially focused on American companies, the law's jurisdiction has expanded substantially. It now extends to any foreign business or individual with connections to the U.S. This broad reach enables prosecutors to pursue cases against foreign firms — for example, a Dutch company with a subsidiary based in Ohio accused of paying off Chinese officials through another subsidiary in Thailand. The law has had a significant impact on the development of anti-corruption laws around the world. In 1997, the Paris-based Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development used the FCPA as a model for its Anti-Bribery Convention, which now has 46 member countries. While enforcement of FCPA was negligible in the decades following its enactment, the early 2000s marked a significant shift. The Justice Department and the Securities and Exchange Commission, the two agencies responsible for enforcing FCPA’s provisions, ramped up enforcement, driven in part by emerging business scandals and new congressional requirements for corporate governance and financial reporting. How has the law been used in recent years? In recent years, U.S. foreign bribery law enforcement has been robust, with the Justice Department and the SEC opening nearly 174 investigations between 2018 and 2021. Last year, the Justice Department alone filed 17 enforcement actions under the law. Latin America has emerged as a particular hot spot for U.S. investigators in recent years. In 2016, two Brazilian companies agreed to pay a combined $3.5 billion after pleading guilty in a sprawling international foreign bribery case. U.S. authorities investigated the case in part because the illicit payments were made through U.S. bank accounts. In 2020, Airbus SE, the European aircraft maker, agreed to pay nearly $4 billion to resolve foreign bribery charges brought in the U.S., Britain and France. Airbus admitted using intermediaries to bribe government officials and airline executives to win lucrative contracts in China and other countries. In January 2024, SAP SE, a German software company with offices in the U.S., agreed to pay $220 million to resolve investigations into bribery payments to South African and Indonesia officials. In December, AAR Corp., an Illinois-based aviation services company, agreed to pay more than $55 million to resolve investigations into bribery payments to government officials in Nepal and South Africa. Several cases have involved India. In November, prosecutors charged three former employees of a Canadian institutional investor in connection with a bribery scheme involving Indian billionaire Gautam Adani and two other executives. Why is Trump pausing FCPA enforcement? Trump, a real estate tycoon-turned-president, has been a vocal critic of the law since well before his first term. In 2012, he called it a 'horrible' and 'ridiculous' statute that impeded U.S. companies’ ability to do business abroad. Despite his criticism, FCPA enforcement actually surged during his first term in office, with 2000 marking a record-breaking year, according to the Morrison Foerster law firm. The executive order frames the pause in enforcement as part of the president's broader agenda to 'advance American economic and national security by eliminating excessive barriers to American commerce abroad.' The order says the FCPA's scope has been 'stretched beyond proper bounds and abused in a manner that harms the interests of the United States.' A White House fact sheet on the order released Monday says the 'overenforcement' of the law harms U.S. companies and 'infringes on the President's Article II authority to conduct foreign affairs.' This concern about aggressive enforcement isn't new, said Mike Koehler, a law professor and leading authority on the FCPA, who noted that both Republicans and Democrats have raised similar issues over the past two decades. 'There has been a focus on the quantity of enforcement actions compared to the quality of those enforcement actions,' Koehler told VOA. 'Enforcement has in many cases has gone so far off the rails that this law is being enforced in ways that do put companies at a competitive disadvantage.' Transparency advocates, however, warn that suspending enforcement could deal a significant blow to global anti-bribery efforts. 'This pause will work to the advantage of unscrupulous business actors around the world who until now feared U.S. criminal pursuits,' Transparency International said in a statement calling on other OECD Anti-Bribery Convention members to increase their enforcement following the U.S. shift in policy. What are the implications for investigating foreign bribery? The executive order imposes a six-month freeze on foreign bribery investigations by the Justice Department. Almost all FCPA cases will be suspended while Attorney General Pam Bondi conducts a review and revises enforcement guidelines. The executive order gives Bondi discretion to extend the pause for an additional six months. Bondi, however, has directed federal prosecutors to prioritize FCPA cases involving cartels and transnational criminal organizations. And corporate lawyers were quick to caution clients that the executive order doesn't give them free rein. 'Bribery is still illegal,' attorneys at the Arnold & Porter law firm wrote in an analysis of the executive order. 'The FCPA remains on the books; Congress has not repealed it. And many other state, federal and foreign laws still prohibit bribery.'	https://www.voanews.com/a/why-is-trump-pausing-us-anti-bribery-law-/7976000.html	2025-02-14T22:52:12-08:00	
Goodyear Blimp at 100: 'Floating piece of Americana' still thrives	DAYTONA BEACH, FLORIDA — Flying a few hundred feet above the streets and shores of Daytona Beach, the Goodyear Blimp draws a crowd. Onlookers stare and point. Drivers pull over for better looks, snapping pictures, recording videos and trying to line up the perfect selfie. For some, it's nostalgic. For others, it's a glimpse at a larger-than-life advertising icon. At 100 years old, the blimp is an ageless star in the sky. And the 246-foot-long airship will be in the background of the Daytona 500 on Sunday — roughly 1,500 feet above Daytona International Speedway, actually — to celebrate its latest and greatest anniversary tour. Even though remote camera technologies — drones, mostly — are improving regularly and changing the landscape of aerial footage, the blimp continues to carve out a niche. At Daytona, with the usual 40-car field racing around a 2½-mile super speedway, views from the blimp aptly provide the scope of the event. 'It's great to show the pack racing,' Fox Sports director Artie Kempner said, adding that he expected to use aerial shots from the blimp about 50 times during Sunday's race. The Goodyear Blimp has been a regular at major sporting events since flying above the 1955 Rose Bowl. A few years later, it became a service vehicle for television coverage while simultaneously functioning as a highly visible advertising platform. It's been at every Daytona 500 since 1962. During that streak, blimps have undergone wholesale changes and improved dramatically: steering technology, safety innovations, high-definition cameras, gyro-stabilized aerial views and much quieter rides thanks to relocated engines and propellers. Nowadays, riding on the blimp isn't much different than traveling on a small plane. The 12-seater comes with reclining seats, tray tables, seatbelts, a safety briefing and a bathroom with amazing views. A few windows serve as the only air conditioning onboard. The blimp offers a smooth ride even at top speed, creeping along at 73 mph — well below the cars pushing 200 mph on the track. 'It's an iconic symbol for our nation, a floating piece of Americana,' blimp pilot Jensen Kervern said. 'There's nothing like it in the world.' The blimp has covered more than 2,500 events and taken more than 500,000 passengers for rides, according to Goodyear. Former President Ronald Reagan might be the most famous passenger, and rapper Ice Cube raised the blimp's street cred when he included a line about it in his 1992 song titled 'It Was A Good Day.' But not just anyone can climb aboard. Rides are invitation only, even though phones at blimp headquarters — the three U.S.-based airships are housed in California, Florida and Ohio — ring off the hook with people inquiring about buying a ride. As part of the blimp's 100-year anniversary celebration, however, Goodyear is giving three U.S. residents a chance to join the exclusive club and win a ride. The sweepstakes will provide each winner a certificate for two to fly on the blimp. The prize also includes $3,000 for travel expenses to one of Goodyear's airship hangars. It would be a once-in-a-lifetime experience, no doubt. The blimp flies low enough to spot pods of dolphins or flotillas of sea turtles in the Atlantic Ocean. The view over Daytona International Speedway is equally stunning, with the ability to see every inch of the famed track while watching (and hearing) race cars turning laps. Already in 2025, the Goodyear fleet has flown over the Rose Bowl, the Orange Bowl, the Pro Bowl and Pebble Beach. Its upcoming schedule includes the Academy Awards, Coachella and WrestleMania. But will the blimp survive another 100 years? Drone imagery and resolution continue to improve along with maneuverability, stability and flight longevity. And where drones can be flown by one person, the Goodyear Blimp crew at Daytona tops 20 staffers. But given the blimp's longevity, adaptability and celebrity, no one should bet against it sticking around for generations to come. 'Despite changes in technology and our environment, people still get so excited to see the blimp,' Kervern said. 'It's just an iconic symbol for our nation.'	https://www.voanews.com/a/goodyear-blimp-at-100-floating-piece-of-americana-still-thrives-/7974664.html	2025-02-14T22:51:25-08:00	
With doors closed to the US, asylum-seekers turn a new life in Mexico	MEXICO CITY — When Angelica Delgado took a one-way flight to Mexico as she fled Cuba in December, she was set on seeking asylum in the United States. But after President Donald Trump effectively slammed the door on asylum-seekers crossing the U.S. border when he took office last month, the 23-year-old recalibrated her plans. She decided she would seek protection in Mexico. 'Like almost all Cubans, our objective was to go to the United States,' she said. 'It wasn't in our plans to stay, but now we have to face reality.' Amid a clampdown on asylum under Trump and tightening restrictions in recent years under the Biden administration, Delgado is among a growing number of migrants from across the world to ditch — or at least pause — their ambitions of reaching the U.S., and focus instead on building a life in Mexico. Migrants trying to apply for asylum in Mexico in January more than tripled compared to the monthly average from the previous year, according to an international official with knowledge of the numbers who was not authorized to discuss them publicly. Mexico's refugee agency has not yet published figures for January. 'All of these policies Trump is pushing are leading more people to seek international protection in Mexico,' said Andrés Ramírez, former director of the Mexican Commission for Refugee Aid, which processes asylum cases. Delgado was among hundreds of migrants from Cuba, Venezuela, Haiti, Afghanistan and other countries gathering outside the refugee agency in Mexico City after Trump unleashed executive orders last month meant to slash access to asylum and militarize the border. The Associated Press spoke to around a half-dozen people who had asylum appointments in the U.S. through the Biden-era app, CBP One, that Trump canceled on Inauguration Day. They were left stranded on the Mexican side of the border, their dreams of a legal pathway into the U.S. snuffed. Many more said they now intended to seek asylum in Mexico, citing increasingly harsh restrictions in recent years in the U.S. or what they said was anti-immigrant sentiment there. 'Now, it's the Mexican dream,' said a Mexican man helping Haitian friends try to get an appointment this month to apply for asylum in Mexico following the Trump executive orders. Delgado, her partner and many others had put their hopes on pathways opened by the Biden administration to legally seek asylum in the U.S. They said they had no intention of hiring a smuggler to enter the U.S. illegally. They said the risks of returning to Cuba were too great following a government clampdown on protests in recent years. 'Crossing illegally isn't an option for us. We'd rather stay here' in Mexico, Delgado said, adding that if they crossed illegally into the U.S. and were caught 'they'll deport us and they'll send us back to Cuba.' Delgado, who is an architect, and her partner, a doctor, aren't able to work in their fields in Mexico because their training in Cuba is not recognized there, she said. So for now she's washing dishes in a market. Mexico has long opened its doors to refugees and exiles, but asylum applications have soared in recent years, growing from 1,295 in 2013 to a record 140,982 in 2023. That number dipped to 78,975 in 2024, as the CBP One app allowed migrants in southern Mexico to apply for appointments for entry into the U.S. before heading to the northern border. The rise in petitions for asylum in Mexico may not result in an immediate uptick in refugees there as only a couple hundred applications can be processed each day, fueling criticism about Mexico's capacity to take on the burgeoning asylum demand. Amid criticisms over the backlog, President Claudia Sheinbaum has sharply boosted funding for Mexican agencies handling migration and asylum. Venezuelan asylum-seeker Harry Luzardo, 37, said life in Mexico is an improvement after scrambling for years to scrape by in Ecuador and Chile. Ecuador, Chile, Peru and Colombia were once the epicenter of the exodus of 8 million people from Venezuela, fleeing spiraling economic and political crises. But with little international aid and an array of their own economic and security crises, Chile was among countries that began closing their doors to migrants. 'In Chile, you don't receive any kind of support,' Luzardo said, waiting patiently in line earlier this month to make an asylum petition request in Mexico City. 'In Chile, there's nothing for migrants.' Luzardo left Venezuela four years ago, but unable to get legal status to stay and work in Chile, he decided he'd try his luck at reuniting with family in the U.S. Now, with that door closed, Mexico is his plan B. 'For now, I feel good here,' he said. Still, he conceded, he'd rather be in the U.S.	https://www.voanews.com/a/with-doors-closed-to-the-us-asylum-seekers-turn-a-new-life-in-mexico/7974697.html	2025-02-14T22:50:35-08:00

Southern California slammed with debris flows, mudslides	After days of heavy rain, the strongest storm of the year brought dangerous debris flows and rock- and mudslides across Southern California on Friday, including in several areas that last month were ablaze with devastating fires. Some areas in the region received as much as 12 centimeters of rain this week, the National Weather Service said. 'There are plenty of reports of debris flow,' meteorologist Scott Kleebauer of the weather service said Friday. The scorched earth left behind by the fires is now particularly vulnerable to the water-fueled rock- and mudslides, as the vegetation that once anchored the soil was burned away. While this week’s rain is beginning to ease, that does not mean the slides will stop. The drenched soil can continue to move even after the rain subsides. Parts of the iconic Pacific Coast Highway were shut down Thursday because of flooding and mudslides. In Pacific Palisades, a highway intersection was under a meter of sludge. Photographs posted on social media showed parked cars in Pacific Palisades covered in mud up to their windows. Bulldozers have been assigned to the area to clean up the muck. In one harrowing experience Thursday, a member of the Los Angeles Fire Department was driving along the Pacific Coast Highway when a debris flow swept his vehicle into the ocean. Erik Scott, a spokesperson for the fire department, said the driver was able to get out of his vehicle and reportedly suffered only minor injuries. In Sierra Madre, a city of 10,000 that was the site of last month’s Eaton Fire, a boulder-strewn mudslide damaged several homes. 'It happened very quickly but it was very loud, and you could even hear the ground or feel the ground shaking,' Bull Duvall, who has lived in Sierra Madre for 28 years, told The Associated Press. City officials issued an evacuation order warning residents that emergency responders would not enter locations with active mud and debris flows. The National Weather Service confirmed Friday that a weak tornado hit a mobile home community Thursday in Oxnard, California. There were no reports of deaths or injuries at Country Club Mobile Estates, but property damage included ripped roofs and downed power lines. The rain was badly needed in the region, much of which is still suffering from drought. In nearby Nevada, Las Vegas was glad to see rain Thursday, after enduring more than 200 days without precipitation. A National Weather Service Las Vegas post said, 'Las Vegas has officially measured 0.01 inch of rainfall this morning, effectively ending our dry streak of 214 days without measurable rain.'	https://www.voanews.com/a/southern-california-slammed-with-debris-flows-mudslides/7975988.html	2025-02-14T18:42:01-08:00	
US deports 119 migrants from several nations to Panama	PANAMA CITY, PANAMA — Panama has received the first U.S. flight carrying deportees from other nations as the Trump administration takes Panama up on its offer to act as a stopover for expelled migrants, the Central American nation's president said Thursday. 'Yesterday a flight from the United States Air Force arrived with 119 people from diverse nationalities of the world,' President Jose Raul Mulino said Thursday in his weekly press briefing. He said there were migrants from China, Uzbekistan, Pakistan, Afghanistan, and other countries, aboard. The president said it was the first of three planned flights that were expected to total about 360 people. 'It's not something massive,' he said. The migrants were expected to be moved to a shelter in Panama's Darien region before being returned to their countries, Mulino said. Asked later Thursday why Panama was acting as a stopover for these deportations, Deputy Foreign Minister Carlos Ruiz Hernandez said that it was something the U.S. government had requested. He also said the U.S. government was paying for the repatriations through U.N. immigration agencies. The migrants who arrived Wednesday had been detained after crossing the U.S. border and did not have criminal records, he said. Last week, U.S. Secretary of State Marco Rubio met with Mulino in Panama. While U.S. President Donald Trump's demands to retake control of the Panama Canal dominated the visit, Mulino also discussed Panama's efforts to slow migration through the Darien Gap and he offered Panama as a bridge to send U.S. deportees back to their countries. Rubio secured agreements on the trip with Guatemala and El Salvador as well, to accept migrants from other nations in what was seen as the laying groundwork for expanding U.S. capacity to speedily deport migrants. Migration through the Darien Gap connecting Panama and Colombia was down about 90% in January compared to the same month a year earlier. Since Mulino entered office last year, Panama has made dozens of deportation flights, most funded by the U.S. government. Ruiz said Thursday that Panama 'has been completely willing to participate and cooperate in this request they have made of us.'	https://www.voanews.com/a/us-deports-119-migrants-from-several-nations-to-panama-/7975954.html	2025-02-14T18:00:59-08:00

Helicopter crew might not have heard tower's instructions before crash, say investigators	WASHINGTON — The crew of the Army helicopter that collided in midair with an American Airlines jet near Washington's Ronald Reagan National Airport may have had inaccurate altitude readings in the moments before the crash, and also may not have heard key instructions from air traffic controllers to move behind the plane, investigators said Friday. National Transportation Safety Board Chairwoman Jennifer Homendy told reporters that the recording from the Black Hawk helicopter cockpit suggested an incomplete radio transmission may have left the crew without an understanding of how it should shift position just before the January 29 crash, in which all 67 aboard the two aircraft were killed. 'That transmission was interrupted — it was stepped on,' she said, leaving them unable to hear the words 'pass behind the' because the helicopter's microphone key was pressed at the same moment. The helicopter pilots also may have missed part of another communication, when the tower said the jet was shifting to a different runway, she said. Homendy said the helicopter was on a check flight that night where the pilot was undergoing an annual test and a test on using night vision goggles. Investigators believe the crew was wearing night vision goggles throughout the flight. It will take more than a year to get the final NTSB report on the collision, and Homendy warned reporters that many issues were still being investigated. 'We're only a couple weeks out' from the crash, she said. 'We have a lot of work to do.' The collision was the deadliest plane crash in the U.S. since 2001, when a jet slammed into a New York City neighborhood just after takeoff, killing all 260 people on board and five more on the ground. William Waldock, professor of safety science at Embry-Riddle Aeronautical University, said stepped-on transmissions — where a pressed microphone key blocks incoming communication — is a well-known problem in aviation. 'It's an old story and it's one of the problems oftentimes with radio communications,' he said. The collision likely occurred at an altitude of about 325 feet, investigators have said, which would put the Black Hawk above its 200-foot limit for that location. Cockpit conversations a few minutes before the crash indicated conflicting altitude data, Homendy said, with the helicopter's pilot calling out that they were then at 300 feet, but the instructor pilot saying it was 400 feet, Homendy said. 'We are looking at the possibility there may be bad data,' she said. That generation of Black Hawks typically has two types of altimeters – one relying on barometric pressure and the other on radio frequency signals bounced off the ground. Helicopter pilots typically rely on barometric readings while flying, but the helicopter's black box captures its radio altitude. The radio altitude at the time of the impact put the Black Hawk at 278 feet, Homendy said. 'But I want to caution, that does not mean that's what the Black Hawk crew was seeing on the barometric altimeters in the cockpit,' she said. Waldock said the helicopter pilots, with their night vision goggles interfering with their peripheral vision, may have wrongly focused on a plane that took off just before the collision. 'If they did indeed lock onto that departing airplane and assume that's the traffic they were supposed to be avoiding, they didn't see the other airplane coming,' he said.

Intelligence agencies close in on Islamic State caliph	WASHINGTON — A growing number of countries think they have unmasked the man running the Islamic State terror group’s global operations. A report issued this week by the United Nations Sanctions Monitoring Team, based on U.N. member state intelligence, said there is 'growing confidence' that the IS caliph is Abdul Qadir Mumin, who also heads the terror group’s branch in Somalia. The importance of Mumin to IS’s global operations has not been in doubt. Previous U.N. intelligence reports suggested he had been elevated to lead the Islamic State's general directorate of provinces, essentially giving him control over the group’s African affiliates. But by late last year, officials with U.S. Africa Command told VOA they assessed reports that Mumin was the group’s emir to be credible. That assessment seems to be gaining traction, with many U.N. member states agreeing that IS is trying to adapt to realities on the ground in Iraq and Syria that make moving key officials and functions elsewhere advantageous. 'It may signify a deliberate pivot toward a more decentralized operational structure, further from the core conflict zone,' the report said. Not all countries that contributed intelligence for the report are in agreement. Some remain unconvinced that the terror group, also known as ISIS or Daesh, would readily forsake its core territory in Iraq and Syria. Others question whether IS would allow itself to be led by someone who cannot credibly claim to be descended from the Prophet Muhammad, a criterion applied to past leaders. Survival, however, may be more important. Since the deaths of IS leader Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi in 2019 and his successor in 2022, the terror group has sought to protect its leaders by hiding their identity and by minimizing public appearances. The group has publicly referred to its current leader only by his nom de guerre, as Abu Hafs al-Hashimi al-Qurashi, which signifies he has the required lineage. 'Maybe they have now got so used to the fact that the emir, or the caliph, is never seen or heard,' said Edmund Fitton-Brown, a former U.N. counterterrorism official who is a senior adviser for the Counter Extremism Project. 'Maybe they say Abu Hafs al-Hashimi al-Qurashi is the name we are giving to the caliph,' Fitton-Brown told VOA. 'Nobody will ever know that he's Somali. Nobody will ever hear an African accent. Nobody will ever see an African person.' Already, Abu Hafs has outlasted his direct predecessor, who died after ruling for about six months. And if Abu Hafs is Somalia’s Mumin, he also has managed to survive at least one attempt on his life — a U.S. airstrike in May 2024. This week’s report from the U.N. said that since that strike, Mumin has 'taken measures to limit the group’s exposure to unnecessary external attention.' It also described Mumin’s base of operations, Buur Dhexaad, as a series of caves and defensive structures in the Cal Miskaad range of Somalia’s Golis Mountains, which are thought to provide protection from Western airstrikes. That assumption is being put to the test as Buur Dhexaad appears to be the same area targeted by a new round of U.S. airstrikes earlier this month. U.S. officials said those strikes successfully killed Ahmed Maeleninine, a key external operations leader, and 13 IS operatives. IS-Somalia The U.N. report warned that IS-Somalia, under Mumin’s leadership, has continued to gain influence while strengthening its finances. Intelligence shared from member states indicated IS-Somalia expanded its extortion activities in parts of Somalia under its control and has, in turn, invested the money in improving its military capabilities, including unmanned drones for surveillance and suicide attacks. But the affiliate, which saw its forces surge thanks to an influx of foreign fighters, has seen its growth slow of late. The report said IS-Somalia saw a spike in defections due to 'difficulties in integrating fighters into narrow clan-based structures, cultural barriers and the severity of conditions.' Efforts to intercept would-be foreign fighters before they can reach Somalia also have taken a toll. Syria and Iraq Key members of IS’s leadership may be seeking refuge in Somalia, but there are no indications the terror group has given up its designs on retaking territory in Syria and Iraq. The U.N. report said the terror group still maintains about 1,500 to 3,000 fighters across the two countries, with most operating out of Syria. There are also indications that IS has found ways to take advantage of the fall of Syrian President Bashar al-Assad this past December. Some U.N. member states’ intelligence agencies said some IS operatives leaped into action even as the lead Syrian insurgent group, Hayat Tahrir al-Sham (HTS), launched its assault on the Assad regime. One IS operative, they said, infiltrated the al-Hol displaced-persons camp in northeastern Syria and sneaked out experienced IS fighters by replacing them with teenage boys. The same operative is thought to have reactivated an IS brigade at al-Hol 'tasked with intelligence-gathering, training young people for operations, recruiting and managing funds.' Additionally, the report warned of IS launching increasingly sophisticated attacks against the U.S.-backed Syrian Democratic Forces. IS in Iraq has been weakened by Iraqi counterterrorism pressure, including an operation in August that killed the group’s deputy wali (governor) and 13 other leaders. But the U.N. report said IS 'maintained the ability to operate and replace field commanders.' Afghanistan presence U.N. member states continue to raise concerns about the IS affiliate in Afghanistan, known as IS-Khorasan or ISIS-K. The report called IS-Khorasan 'the most serious threat' to Afghanistan, noting the group’s ability to infiltrate the country’s Taliban rulers and exploit dissatisfaction, especially among poppy farmers and ethnic Tajiks, with the Taliban’s rule. U.N. member states assessed IS has about 4,000 to 6,000 operatives across Afghanistan, and that it is also building capabilities while seeking to bring in more fighters from Central Asia. To make the journey easier, IS-Khorasan set up smuggling routes into Afghanistan through Turkey and through Iran, according to the report. The report noted the ability of IS-Khorasan to reach into Europe and recruit minors. 'The increasing frequency of foiled plots underscored the group’s determination and capacity to conduct attacks of high lethality on European soil, primarily against soft targets and large crowds,' it said. Harun Maruf, Mohamed Olad Hassan and Carla Babb contributed to this report.	https://www.voanews.com/a/intelligence-agencies-close-in-on-islamic-state-caliph-/7975753.html	2025-02-14T16:03:38-08:00	
Whale swallows, then releases kayaker in Chilean Patagonia	PUNTA ARENAS, CHILE — A humpback whale briefly swallowed a kayaker off Chilean Patagonia before quickly releasing him unharmed. The incident, caught on camera, quickly went viral. Last Saturday, Adrian Simancas was kayaking with his father, Dell, in Bahia El Aguila near the San Isidro Lighthouse in the Strait of Magellan when a humpback whale surfaced, engulfing Adrian and his yellow kayak for a few seconds before letting him go. Dell, just meters away, captured the moment on video. 'Stay calm, stay calm,' he can be heard saying after his son was released from the whale's mouth. 'I thought I was dead,' Adrian told The Associated Press. 'I thought it had eaten me, that it had swallowed me.' He described the 'terror' of those few seconds and explained that his real fear set in only after resurfacing, fearing that the huge animal would hurt his father or that he would perish in the frigid waters. Despite the terrifying experience, Dell remained focused, filming and reassuring his son while grappling with his own worry. 'When I came up and started floating, I was scared that something might happen to my father, too, that we wouldn't reach the shore in time, or that I would get hypothermia,' Adrian said. After a few seconds in the water, Adrian managed to reach his father's kayak and was quickly assisted. Despite the scare, both returned to shore uninjured. Located about 3,000 kilometers (1,600 miles) south of Santiago, Chile's capital, the Strait of Magellan is a major tourist attraction in the Chilean Patagonia, known for adventure activities. Its frigid waters pose a challenge for sailors, swimmers and explorers who attempt to cross it in different ways. Although it's summer in the Southern Hemisphere, temperatures in the region remain cool, with minimums dropping to 4 degrees Celsius (39 degrees Fahrenheit) and highs rarely exceeding 20 degrees Celsius (68 degrees Fahrenheit). While whale attacks on humans are extremely rare in Chilean waters, whale deaths from collisions with cargo ships have increased in recent years, and strandings have become a recurring issue in the last decade.	https://www.voanews.com/a/whale-swallows-then-releases-kayaker-in-chilean-patagonia-/7975746.html	2025-02-14T15:48:35-08:00	
Argentina court issues international arrest warrant for Myanmar military leader	washington — A court in Argentina has issued an international arrest warrant for Senior General Min Aung Hlaing, the commander in chief of Myanmar’s military, for his role in the 2017 genocide against the Rohingya. The court’s decision, announced Thursday, also lists two civilian leaders, including Aung San Suu Kyi, and 22 other military officials. Min Aung Hlaing, who leads Myanmar's military junta after seizing power in a 2021 coup, is at the center of the warrants issued by the court in Buenos Aires. The charges against him include aggravated murder, torture and sexual violence linked to the military’s brutal crackdown on the Rohingya population in Rakhine State, located in western Myanmar bordering with Bangladesh. The Myanmar junta has yet to officially respond to the warrants from the Argentine court. However, in response to VOA's inquiry, junta spokesperson General Zaw Min Tun dismissed Argentina’s legal authority over Myanmar. 'Does Argentina even know Myanmar? The Myanmar government knows Argentina. If Argentina wants to legally criticize Myanmar, it must have judicial authority in the country. I suggest you focus on filling your own vacant judicial positions first,' the spokesperson said in response to a VOA inquiry on the junta’s Viber press group. Since the case was filed in 2019 under the principle of universal jurisdiction, the junta has consistently rejected Argentina’s involvement, maintaining that foreign courts have no authority to prosecute Myanmar’s leaders over the Rohingya issue. The principle of universal jurisdiction allows national courts to prosecute individuals for serious crimes that violate international law. Legal efforts, court decision The Burmese Rohingya Organisation U.K. (BROUK), which filed the initial complaint in 2019, praised the court's ruling as a victory for justice. 'This is a victory for the Rohingya and for international justice,' said Tun Khin, president of BROUK, according to a Friday press statement. 'It shows that no one is above the law, not even the military leaders who have committed genocide.' In 2017, Myanmar’s army launched a brutal offensive against the Muslim Rohingya population in Rakhine State, which is located on the country’s western coast off the Bay of Bengal. The offensive followed attacks on police outposts by insurgent groups. The military’s response involved mass killings, sexual violence and widespread destruction of villages, forcing more than 700,000 Rohingya to flee to neighboring Bangladesh. The United Nations and human rights organizations have described the military’s actions as a genocide. Late last year, the International Criminal Court also issued an arrest warrant for Min Aung Hlaing for crimes against humanity. While the warrant from Argentina for Min Aung Hlaing is a major development, the court's decision on other leaders has sparked debate. In December 2023, BROUK requested arrest warrants for military officials only, presenting evidence related to their roles in the genocide. No evidence was submitted for Aung San Suu Kyi, who served as state counselor and de facto leader of Myanmar during the 2017 military offensive against the Rohingya, or for former civilian President Htin Kyaw. However, in June 2024, the Argentine prosecutor included them in his request. BROUK then asked the court to reconsider issuing warrants for these civilians, given Burma's political context, but the court dismissed the request. Aung San Suu Kyi has been imprisoned since the military took power in the 2021 coup. Implications of warrant Tomas Quintana, an Argentinian human rights lawyer and former U.N. special rapporteur for human rights in Myanmar and a key figure in the case, explained the court's stance. 'We felt that at this stage in the investigation, it was not appropriate to seek arrest warrants for civilian leaders like Aung San Suu Kyi,' he told VOA’s Burmese Service in an exclusive interview. 'But the court sided with the prosecutor, deciding to include civilians in the warrants.' Quintana said the ruling was based on legal strategy and evidence available at the time. Aung San Suu Kyi’s role in the genocide is still under investigation by the Argentine court. While the court initially focused on the direct perpetrators of the violence — the military leaders, including Min Aung Hlaing — it later sided with prosecutors to explore the civilian leaders’ responsibility as well. 'This decision marks a shift in international accountability,' Quintana said. 'It is the first time Burma [Myanmar] has been held accountable in a court of law for crimes against the Rohingya.' The investigation, which has spanned four years, was supported by survivor testimonies and documentation from the United Nations Independent Investigative Mechanism for Myanmar. The Argentine court’s decision is expected to lead to an Interpol 'red notice,' which would request the detention of Min Aung Hlaing and other Myanmar military leaders worldwide. While the arrest warrant for Min Aung Hlaing is a significant step, Quintana said there are still challenges ahead. 'Myanmar’s military regime controls the country, so executing these warrants remains difficult,' he said. He called for international cooperation to ensure that officials were held accountable. 'The United Nations and the global community must work together to enforce these decisions.' Despite the setback in including Aung San Suu Kyi in the arrest warrant, the warrants are a powerful symbolic ruling for the Rohingya people, Quintana said, adding that it is also a crucial step in the long process of justice.	https://www.voanews.com/a/argentina-court-issues-international-arrest-warrant-for-myanmar-military-leader/7975748.html	2025-02-14T15:38:01-08:00	
M23 rebels advance into eastern DRC's 2nd major city of Bukavu, residents say	GOMA, CONGO — M23 rebels in eastern Democratic Republic of the Congo entered the region’s second-largest city of Bukavu on Friday, local and civil society leaders said, the latest ground gained since a major escalation of their yearslong fighting with government forces. The M23 rebels entered the city's Kazingu and Bagira zone and were advancing toward the center of the city of about 1.3 million people, according to Jean Samy, vice president of the civil society in South Kivu. He reported gunfire in parts of the city. Videos posted online appeared to show rebels marching toward the Bagira area. In one of the videos, a voice in the background shouted: 'They are there ... there are many of them.' Hours earlier, the rebels had claimed to have seized a second airport in the region following a dayslong advance, while the U.N. warned that the recent escalation of fighting with government forces has left 350,000 internally displaced people without shelter. Local sources said M23 rebels surrounded the area around Kavumu national airport. They also recounted seeing scores of soldiers fleeing the town as the fighting raged on. The Associated Press could not immediately confirm who was in control of the airport, which is located about 30 kilometers from the city of Bukavu, the capital of South Kivu province. Government officials and civil society leaders did not immediately comment. Kavumu airport became a target after the M23 rebels seized the region’s largest city of Goma, including the international airport there, in late January. Goma is a critical trade and humanitarian hub that hosted many of the close to 6.5 million people displaced in the conflict, the world’s largest humanitarian crisis. M23 spokesperson Lawrence Kanyuka said on social media platform X that the rebels took over Kavumu airport and its surroundings to 'eliminate the threat at the source.' 'The airport posed a danger to the civilian population,' he said. Congo's Communication Ministry issued a statement criticizing the rebels for violating a ceasefire that regional leaders have called for. The rebels were 'imposing an urban war by attacking the positions of the FARDC [Congolese military], who are keen to avoid bloodshed in Bukavu,' the ministry said. The crisis in the eastern Democratic Republic of the Congo, or the DRC, continues to escalate, with tensions involving the Congolese government and the M23 rebel group. The DRC government has officially designated the M23 rebel group as a terrorist organization, while the United Nations and the United States classify it as an armed rebel group. The DRC government has repeatedly accused Rwanda of supporting the M23 rebel group, a claim that Rwanda denies. Kigali, in turn, alleges that Kinshasa collaborates with the Democratic Forces for the Liberation of Rwanda, or the FDLR, a Hutu armed group with ties to the perpetrators of the 1994 Rwandan genocide, an allegation the DRC rejects. Military operations in the region remain fluid, with clashes leading to significant displacement and humanitarian concerns. Analysts warn that continued instability risks deepening the regional conflict. Several peacekeepers from the Southern African Development Community already have been killed since the recent rebel offensive.	https://www.voanews.com/a/m23-rebels-advance-into-eastern-drc-s-2nd-major-city-of-bukavu-residents-say-/7975711.html	2025-02-14T15:10:14-08:00

New York City mayor to allow ICE agents at Rikers jail	NEW YORK — New York City Mayor Eric Adams says he will allow federal immigration officials to operate at the city's Rikers Island jail following a meeting Thursday with President Donald Trump's border czar. Adams said he will issue an executive order reestablishing U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement presence at the complex — one of the nation's largest and most notorious lockups — as had been the case under prior administrations. The Democrat said ICE agents would be focused on assisting the corrections department's intelligence bureau in criminal investigations, particularly those focused on violent criminals and gangs. 'As I have always said, immigrants have been crucial in building our city and will continue to be key to our future success, but we must fix our long-broken immigration system,' Adams said in a statement. 'That is why I have been clear that I want to work with the new federal administration, not war with them, to find common ground and make better the lives of New Yorkers.' Opponents dismissed the move as a 'needless concession' and 'legally dubious.' 'ICE's presence on Rikers serves no legitimate purpose and opens the door to unlawful collusion between local law enforcement and federal immigration officials in violation of our city's well-established sanctuary protections,' Zach Ahmad, senior policy counsel at the New York Civil Liberties Union, said. Trump's border czar, Thomas Homan, argued that having an ICE presence at local jails is crucial to removing violent criminals who have entered the country illegally. 'For the naysayers, the city council who wants nothing to do with ICE, they need to understand: If we arrest the bad guy at Rikers Island, then the alien's safe, the officer's safe, the community's safe,' he said in an interview with NewsMax after the meeting. Troubled relationship Homan met with Adams at a federal office building in Manhattan as the Republican administration pushes for more help detaining and deporting people accused of crimes. ICE has long had a contentious relationship with New York, which has rules and laws limiting police cooperation with federal immigration enforcement. Immigration officials, for example, aren't able to request that city jails hold people wanted for civil immigration law violations past when they would ordinarily be released from custody, under city policy. New York City also has passed measures that curtail ICE's access to public schools and other city properties. Adams, who faces a Democratic primary in June, has said he favors loosening these so-called sanctuary policies, but he doesn't have the broad power to do so as mayor. Adams said he talked with Homan about ways to embed more New York police detectives into federal task forces focused on violent gangs and criminal activity, as well as allowing ICE agents to participate in regular meetings with law enforcement agencies in the city. 'We walked away with some real tangible things we can do together, and I'm looking forward to aligning with him and other federal partners to remove dangerous people from our streets,' he said in a radio show interview after the meeting. Mayor under pressure The Democrat is under unique pressure to cooperate with the Trump administration's immigration crackdown. On Monday, the U.S. Justice Department ordered federal prosecutors in Manhattan to dismiss corruption charges against Adams so he could focus on assisting the president's immigration agenda. As of Thursday, the criminal charges remained in place. If the case is ultimately dropped, the Justice Department says it will conduct a review after the November mayoral election to assess whether it should be reinstated. Immigration advocates worry Adams might feel pressure from the Trump administration to disregard or rescind some of the city's sanctuary protections, which come from a patchwork of state and city laws and mayoral executive orders, some stretching back decades. Adams has already ordered city officials to lawfully cooperate with Trump's agenda around immigration and other issues, though the administration's instructions have sparked confusion among some city workers and contractors. Adams confirmed later that he also discussed with Homan restoring more than $80 million meant to defray the city's costs for sheltering homeless migrants that the Federal Emergency Management Agency unexpectedly clawed back Wednesday. 'I'm not happy about losing $80 million, and we had a conversation on that,' he said during a local television interview. The Adams administration has leased several hotels and vacant buildings and repurposed them as migrant shelters as the city has tried to house an estimated 230,000 people who have arrived from the U.S. southern border in recent years. Adams reflects on challenges In a local radio interview after the meeting, Adams also reflected on the week's turn of events with a mix of relief and defiance. 'I did nothing wrong. No American should endure what I had to endure,' he said on WABC, referring to the 'humiliation and embarrassment' of the monthslong federal corruption probe. As he gears up for a bruising primary fight, Adams said he wants New Yorkers to see his resiliency. 'We've all gone through some hard times,' he said. 'No matter what you're going through, have faith in yourself, faith in God, faith in your family, faith in your country, and you will navigate through it.'	https://www.voanews.com/a/new-york-city-mayor-to-allow-ice-agents-at-rikers-jail-/7975704.html	2025-02-14T14:56:04-08:00	
HHS to lose thousands of workers under probationary job cuts	U.S. Department of Health and Human Services officials expect most of the agency's roughly 5,200 probationary employees to be fired Friday under the Trump administration’s move to get rid of nearly all probationary employees, according to an audio recording of a National Institutes of Health department meeting. In that meeting, an NIH office director told employees that some probationary staff with specialized skills might be spared. Probationary staff being terminated would receive an email Friday afternoon, according to audio shared with The Associated Press. Among those being cut are nearly 1,300 probationary employees at the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention — roughly one-tenth of the agency's workforce. The Atlanta-based agency's leadership was notified of the decision Friday morning. The verbal notice came from HHS officials in a meeting with CDC leaders, according to a federal official who was at the meeting. The official was not authorized to discuss it and spoke to the AP on condition of anonymity. Some portion of the affected employees are supposed to receive four weeks paid administrative leave, according to the federal official and the recording. HHS officials did not answer questions about the specifics of the layoffs. In an emailed statement, Andrew Nixon, the department's director of communications, wrote: 'HHS is following the Administration’s guidance and taking action to support the President’s broader efforts to restructure and streamline the federal government. This is to ensure that HHS better serves the American people at the highest and most efficient standard.' HHS employs more than 80,000 people and runs 13 supporting agencies. Besides the CDC, they include the NIH and the Food and Drug Administration. The department also provides health coverage for nearly half the country through Medicare and Medicaid. Its staff includes scientists, researchers, doctors and other officials. It oversees research of vaccines, diseases and cures. It regulates the medications found in medicine cabinets and inspects the foods that end up in cupboards. With a $9.2 billion core budget, the CDC is charged with protecting Americans from outbreaks and other public health threats. Before the cuts, the agency had about 13,000 employees, including more than 2,000 staffers working in other countries. Historically CDC has been seen as a global leader on disease control and a reliable source of health information, boasting some of the top experts in the world. The staff is heavy with scientists — 60% have master’s degrees or doctorates. Those being fired included all first-year officers — about 50 in total — in the CDC’s Epidemic Intelligence Service, according to two agency employees who communicated with some of the affected staffers. The two spoke to the AP on condition of anonymity for fear of retribution. The EIS, as it is known, was established in 1951 to recruit young doctors and researchers to join the agency for two-year stints as disease investigators. The laid-off first-year officers represent a little less than half the service's current staff. EIS officers often are sent to different states and countries to become primary investigators of outbreaks and emerging health dangers. Many EIS graduates have gone on to leadership jobs at the CDC and at other public health organizations. It’s not only new employees who are subject to probation. Probationary periods also are applied to veteran staffers who, for example, were recently promoted to a new job in management. The layoffs are part of a broad effort by President Donald Trump and billionaire Trump adviser Elon Musk to reduce the number of workers across the entire federal government. The job cuts also came one day after Robert F. Kennedy was sworn in to oversee HHS. Dr. Joshua Barocas, an infectious diseases expert at the University of Colorado School of Medicine, said many of the probationary-status CDC employees are filling vital roles. 'It’s essentially assuming that they are not in a job that is crucial for the success of keeping everyone safe — just because they’ve been there for less than a year or less than six months,' said Barocas, speaking Friday morning during an Infectious Diseases Society of America call with reporters. In a Thursday interview on Fox News, Kennedy was asked if half the HHS staff would be losing their jobs. 'I don’t know anything about 50% of people being cut,' Kennedy said. 'I would be surprised if there were 50% cuts.' He added: 'If you’ve been involved in good science, you have nothing to worry about. If you care about public health, you have nothing to worry about. If you’re in there working for the pharmaceutical industry, I’d say you should move out and work for the pharmaceutical industry.'	https://www.voanews.com/a/hhs-to-lose-thousands-of-workers-under-probationary-job-cuts/7975696.html	2025-02-14T14:23:01-08:00	
Up to 2,000 workers laid off at US Department of Energy, sources say	WASHINGTON — The administration of U.S. President Donald Trump has laid off about 1,200 to 2,000 workers at the Department of Energy, including employees at a power grid office, the nuclear security administration and the loans office, three sources familiar with the matter said on Friday. Democratic lawmakers also said the layoffs include workers at national labs, hydroelectric plants and Cold War legacy nuclear sites that pose safety risks. The DOE has about 14,000 federal employees and 95,000 contractors. The layoffs of probationary workers come after three people representing billionaire Elon Musk's Department of Government Efficiency arrived at the agency last week. Some 325 workers have been let go from the department's National Nuclear Security Administration, which manages the U.S. nuclear weapons fleet and works to secure radiological materials around the world, two of the sources said. But those layoffs at NNSA have been 'partly rescinded' to retain essential nuclear security workers, one of the sources said. It was unclear how many of the 325 firings were rescinded. The DOE did not immediately respond to a request for comment. 'It's been chaotic for the staff,' one source at NNSA said. 'We just want to focus on national security stuff, and this has distracted us from our work.' The losses at the NNSA occur at a time when nuclear power plants have been at risk in Russia's war on Ukraine, including Zaporizhzhia, the largest in Europe. The NNSA is still working to secure radiological materials in the region, one source said. 'Not … in the public interest' A copy of a letter seen by Reuters and sent to some DOE employees says: 'DOE finds that your further employment would not be in the public interest. For this reason, you are being removed from your position with DOE and the federal civil service effective today.' The department withdrew laid off workers' access to government-issued laptops and phones just after midnight Eastern Standard Time on Friday, which left many with no way to receive the notifications and no knowledge they had been fired, one source said. Some 45 workers were let go from the Loan Programs Office, which has hundreds of billions of dollars in loan authority for clean energy, nuclear and clean vehicle projects, one source said. Another seven laid off in the Office of General Counsel had been supporting work in clean energy demonstration projects. In addition, 18 of 148 people were let go at the Grid Deployment Office, which seeks to modernize the power grid, making it resilient to extreme weather and able to transmit power from clean energy and fossil fuel-fired power plants. In Washington state, at least a dozen workers at the Hanford nuclear site — a 1940s site for plutonium and uranium production for atomic bombs, now decommissioned but highly contaminated — were laid off, including safety engineers who clean up and monitor the site, according to Democratic Senator Patty Murray of Washington. 'These reckless firings will slow down critical cleanup work and make workers less safe. Trying to run Hanford with a skeleton crew is a recipe for disaster that could have irreversible impacts,' she said. 'These layoffs will hurt companies, workers and their families across Eastern Washington.' Murray said there were layoffs at other DOE-run facilities in the Pacific Northwest, including the Bonneville Power Administration hydroelectric facility and the Pacific Northwest National Laboratory, which carries out research on everything from nuclear energy to battery storage. Murray's office reported layoffs of more than 600 electricians, scientists and cybersecurity experts at BPA.	https://www.voanews.com/a/up-to-2-000-workers-laid-off-at-us-department-of-energy-sources-say-/7975631.html	2025-02-14T13:29:05-08:00

13 people arrested in Croatia for illegally disposing of hazardous waste	ZAGREB, CROATIA — Thirteen people suspected of illegally importing and disposing of hazardous waste have been arrested in Croatia, the European Union’s law enforcement agency said Friday. The main suspects, two Croatian nationals, are considered high-value targets by Europol, said an agency statement. They are believed to have orchestrated the illegal hazardous waste imports from Italy, Slovenia and Germany to Croatia. Rather than being properly treated, the waste was simply dumped and buried, Europol said. The statement added that at least 35,000 metric tons (38,580 U.S. tons) of waste were illegally disposed of resulting in a profit of at least $4.2 million. The waste was declared as recyclable plastic waste but was 'legally considered dangerous waste,' Europol said. Croatian authorities believe the criminal network also illegally buried and dumped medical waste from Croatian companies, it said. Croatian anti-corruption authorities said in a statement of their own Friday that they have launched an investigation into 10 people and four legal entities suspected of criminal conspiracy, crimes against the environment, tax evasion and money laundering. They said they will seek to keep seven people detained, the state-run HRT television said. The Croatian office tasked with fighting organized crime and corruption said illegal waste disposal has inflicted damage on the environment, including changes in the land configuration that affected plant and tree growth, release of toxic particles in the soil and air, and potential negative effect on people's health. Croatia has suffered 'considerable ecological damage' and still unspecified material damage, the Office for the Suppression of Corruption and Organized Crime said in a statement. Europol said the suspects abused the infrastructures of legal businesses. They would first offer lower prices for disposal and then falsify documentation to transport their cargo to Croatia, allegedly for recycling. Waste trafficking enables criminal networks to obtain huge profits while often causing irreparable damage to the environment, the agency said.	https://www.voanews.com/a/people-arrested-in-croatia-for-illegally-disposing-of-hazardous-waste/7975458.html	2025-02-14T11:22:43-08:00	
The danger zone: In Colombia’s Catatumbo region, reporting is risky business	WASHINGTON — In a vehicle with his two bodyguards, Cristian Herrera talks about the dangers he faces covering Colombia’s Catatumbo region as he heads to his latest assignment. An independent reporter, Herrera has always worked in this region, the Norte de Santander department. His beat includes coverage of robberies, extortions, kidnappings, corruption, drug trafficking, criminal gangs and illegal armed groups. Since 2014 those assignments have come with a security detail, a necessary addition after constant threats. 'They call me, they send me voice messages, they leave pamphlets or people tell me,' Herrera says. The latest — a voicemail on his phone — said: 'I’m looking for a reporter with a big tongue. We’ll have to cut his tongue.' Often, it is hard to tell who is making the threat. 'We cover so many stories that I don’t know who it is from,' Herrera says. Coverage of the region has always brought risks. As well as illegal armed groups, he tells VOA, 'There is drug trafficking; there are coca crops, coca leaf crops; there are cocaine labs.' Added to those dangers is a flare up in clashes between two rival armed groups: the National Liberation Army and a group known the Central General Staff (Estado Mayor Central-EMC), a group of dissidents from the guerilla Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia, or FARC. The fighting has left more than 56 people dead and more than 54,000 displaced, according to figures released this month by the Norte de Santander government. But just as residents in this region of more than 194,000 need access to news about the fighting, it is becoming harder for media to report safely. The regional media freedom group Fundacion para la Libertad de Prensa, or FLIP, warns that the Catatumbo region conflict silences local reporters. 'The situation in Catatumbo is critical, as it is in the entire department of northern Santander, which unfortunately is becoming the most dangerous place to practice journalism in the country,' Jonathan Bock Ruiz, executive director of FLIP, tells VOA. Few reporters inside the region are able to report about the violence, and for those who live near or in Catatumbo, coverage is extremely dangerous. 'I think as reporters, we are just receiving information of 20% of what is happening,' says Herrera. Journalists 'can't talk about anything' Colombia overall has been improving in media freedom rankings, with a 20-point improvement on the World Press Freedom Index. But it is also still considered one of the riskiest countries for journalists. And one of the most dangerous regions is Catatumbo. Two journalists were killed there last year. On the border with Venezuela, the Catatumbo region is just under 300 kilometers from Cucuta, the capital of Norte de Santander. With numerous national resources and a key coca leaf production region, it has long been a base for criminal groups, paramilitaries and guerrillas. Before FARC demobilized in a peace accord in 2016, militants controlled who gained access. Now things are different. 'You don’t know who’s in charge,' says Herrera. 'There are some organizations that are mixed with migrants who are used as instruments to commit crimes. 'Furthermore, it is an area that has been very abandoned by the state, and so those who exercise control in this region are these illegal armed groups,' he says. Often the safest option is to stay quiet. '[Journalists] can’t talk about the armed conflict, what happens there. They can’t talk about the deaths. They can't talk about drug trafficking. They can't talk about anything,' Herrera tells VOA. 'You have to publish it' Another problem comes from guerrillas or criminal groups that coerce media to serve as spokespersons — and saying 'no' is not an option. 'There is a very serious collective problem, information is used as a weapon of war, as a weapon to make propaganda, to better install the narratives of the different groups, as a way of citizen control,' says Ruiz. Herrera says the media strategy of illegal armed groups is to spread information through social media. 'It happens in El Catatumbo and in Cucuta, illegal armed groups have a digital strategy. They send their messages and start sharing them through social media; they send it to us, and sometimes with threats,' he says. 'They say, ‘You have to publish it,’ and if you say no, they declare you as a military target.' The combination of physical risk, self-censorship and control by armed groups leaves audiences with limited access to independent news. 'This has already happened in the Catatumbo at different times, where community journalists decide to turn off their radio stations. They decide to stop reporting ... where self-protection protocols are not enough to do their work safely with the number of threats and the lack of protection given by the state,' explains Ruiz. In his 20-year career, Herrera has come up against multiple threats, including three kidnap attempts. At times, he left Colombia to ensure his safety. So, security is a priority. 'If I’m going to the Catatumbo, I advise FLIP and my wife, I must check in every two hours, and if five hours pass and I haven’t texted her, something has happened,' he says. Despite the dangers, Herrera said he will not stop reporting. 'All the risks and threats give me more strength to keep going, because that shows that I am doing things right,' he says.	https://www.voanews.com/a/the-danger-zone-in-colombia-s-catatumbo-region-reporting-is-risky-business/7975256.html	2025-02-14T10:59:54-08:00	
Russian- and Soviet-born coaches still shaping US figure skating's future	The tragic deaths of Evgenia Shishkova and Vadim Naumov in a plane crash late last month in Washington have shone a spotlight on the role of Russian- or Soviet-born coaches in the world of competitive figure skating. Their influence has shaped a generation of American skaters, raising the question: Why have these coaches been so successful in the U.S.? Maxim Adams has the story.

IAEA confirms drone attack damaged outer wall of Chernobyl dome	The U.N.’s International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) confirmed Friday that a drone attack damaged an outer wall of the protective dome containing the remains of the damaged Chernobyl nuclear reactor in Ukraine, starting a fire. The 1986 Chernobyl nuclear accident is considered the worst in history. Ukraine blames Russia for the attack on the site located about 130 kilometers north of Kyiv, which Moscow denies. In a statement on the IAEA website, the agency’s team based at the site reported hearing an explosion at 1:50 a.m. local time. They said smoke and fire were visible from the team’s on-site dormitory. Ukrainian officials informed the team a drone struck the New Safe Confinement (NSC) structure built to prevent a radioactive release from Chernobyl’s damaged reactor and protect it from external hazards. The team reported that firefighters and vehicles arrived at the scene within minutes to begin extinguishing the blaze, which, they said, could be seen intermittently for several hours afterward. The team said it observed a breach in the outer layer of the containment structure caused when the drone exploded on impact. Ukraine’s nuclear regulatory officials Friday confirmed the outer covering of the protective dome sustained damage, and investigations are ongoing to determine the extent of the damage to the interior. The IAEA said radiation levels inside and outside the NSC building remain normal and no casualties were reported. But agency Director-General Rafael Grossi said the incident was 'deeply concerning,' and said it 'underlines the persistent risks to nuclear safety during the military conflict.' An explosion and fire in April 1986, at the Chernobyl nuclear power plant destroyed the reactor building and released large amounts of radiation into the atmosphere. A U.N. report said 31 people died immediately from the explosion, and while the exact number of people who died from subsequent radiation exposure is in dispute, the U.N. reports nearly 8.4 million people in Belarus, Russia and Ukraine were exposed to radiation due to the widespread radioactive fallout. Speaking to reporters Friday, Kremlin spokesperson Dmitry Peskov denied Russian involvement saying Russia does not conduct strikes on nuclear infrastructure. He called Ukraine’s claim’s 'a provocation.' Fighting around nuclear power plants, including the Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant, Europe’s largest, located near the battle zones in southeastern Ukraine, has repeatedly raised fears of a nuclear catastrophe during three years of war. Some information for this report came from The Associated Press, Reuters and Agence France-Presse.	https://www.voanews.com/a/iaea-confirms-drone-attack-damaged-outer-wall-of-chernobyl-dome/7975283.html	2025-02-14T09:51:03-08:00	
At Munich Conference, US VP Vance warns European allies of ‘threat from within’	Vice President JD Vance warned European allies attending the security conference in Munich, Germany, against 'the threat from within,' arguing that European governments are exercising extreme censorship and have failed to adequately get a handle on 'out-of-control migration.' 'The threat that I worry the most about vis a vis Europe is not Russia, it's not China, it's not any other external actor,' he said Friday. 'What I worry about is the threat from within, the retreat of Europe from some of its most fundamental values, values shared with the United States of America.' Vance denounced Romania, a NATO ally, for its recent cancellation of presidential election results over evidence of Russian disinformation. 'If your democracy can be destroyed with a few hundred thousand dollars of digital advertising from a foreign country, then it wasn’t very strong to begin with,' he said. 'I’d ask my European friends to have some perspective.' He also appeared to voice support for right-wing parties that have been banned from joining governments in Europe, saying, 'Democracy rests on the sacred principle that the voice of the people matters. There’s no room for firewalls.' Vance said of all the pressing challenges facing Europe and the U.S. 'there is nothing more pressing than migration.' He blamed the 'series of conscious decisions made by politicians all over the continent and others across the world,' and he highlighted the Thursday attack in Munich where an Afghan national drove a car into a crowd, injuring at least 30 people. The remarks came as a surprise to the audience of leaders and top officials who were expecting Vance to focus on Ukraine and Russia. The vice president only made a passing remark on the issue. The Trump administration is 'very concerned with European security and believes that we can come to a reasonable settlement between Russia and Ukraine,' Vance said. 'And we also believe that it's important in the coming years for Europe to step up in a big way to provide for its own defense.' Following Vance’s speech, Germany’s Defense Minister Boris Pistorius rejected Vance’s characterization of European policies. 'If I understand him correctly, he is comparing conditions in parts of Europe with those in authoritarian regions ... that is not acceptable.' Vance’s remarks are 'an effort to flip the script,' on Europe’s concerns about American democracy, said Kristine Berzina, managing director of GMF Geostrategy North. 'There was shockingly no mention of NATO, no discussion of Ukraine. Instead, it was the presentation of a right-wing vision of democracy days before the German election,' she told VOA. Vance and U.S. Secretary of State Marco Rubio are set to meet with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy on Friday, on the sidelines of the conference. De-isolating Russia President Donald Trump spoke this week with Russia’s President Vladimir Putin about ending the war in Ukraine, which will mark its three-year anniversary on Feb. 24. Trump said he and the Russian president have 'agreed to have our respective teams start negotiations immediately' to end the war. Speaking to reporters Thursday at the White House, Trump called Kyiv’s NATO membership bid 'impractical' and its desire to win back Russian-occupied territories 'illusionary.' His comments mirror remarks made by his Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth who said Wednesday at NATO headquarters that it was unrealistic for Ukraine to join NATO — something Zelenskyy argues is central to protecting Ukraine in the long-term, but that Putin has long opposed. Hegseth also called Ukraine's desire to regain territory that it lost to Russia an 'unrealistic objective.' Additionally, Trump said it was a mistake to kick Moscow out of the Group of Seven of industrialized democracies, then known as the G8, following Russia’s annexation of Ukraine's Crimea region in 2014. 'I'd love to have them back,' Trump said, adding that he and Putin 'agreed to work together, very closely, including visiting each other’s nations' and added that they would 'probably' meet in Saudi Arabia in the near future. Russian politicians have welcomed the shift from former President Joe Biden’s policies that aimed to isolate Moscow. 'I am sure that in Kyiv, Brussels, Paris and London they are now reading Trump’s lengthy statement on his conversation with Putin with horror and cannot believe their eyes,' Senior lawmaker Alexei Pushkov wrote on his messaging app Friday. European leaders have said they worry Washington is conceding key agenda items to Putin that would jeopardize Kyiv’s standing toward a potential settlement of the conflict. 'A failed Ukraine would weaken Europe, but it would also weaken the United States,' warned European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen, who spoke before Vance in Munich. Speaking to reporters upon his arrival in Munich, Zelenskyy said his priority is to speak with U.S. and European officials before engaging with the Russians. Moscow has said it is not sending a delegation to the conference. 'I will be very clear. First, I see the order of meetings and decisions is the United States, Europe then Russia. We’re not against everything but we are supporting this,' Zelenskyy said. Ukraine said that at the Munich meeting, its delegation will present its position on ending the war and explain its vision for achieving a lasting peace. Zelenskyy said that if Trump could bring him and Putin to the negotiating table, he would offer to swap Ukrainian-occupied territory in Russia for Russian-held land in Ukraine. America first The Munich Security Report released ahead of the conference noted that this year’s gathering takes place in the context of an international order that appears to be in flux under Trump’s 'America First' foreign policy. 'Donald Trump’s presidential victory has buried the U.S. post-Cold War foreign policy consensus that a grand strategy of liberal internationalism would best serve U.S. interests,' said the report. It is unclear what the Trump administration’s ultimate strategy is to end the war — a promise the president campaigned on. In an interview with The Wall Street Journal published Friday ahead of his Munich speech, Vance said Moscow could face more sanctions and even 'military tools' if it refuses to agree a deal ensuring Ukraine's long-term independence. Gaza and the fragile ceasefire agreement between Israel and Hamas also are likely to be a focus in Munich. Trump recently said that Palestinians should leave Gaza, and the U.S. will take over the enclave — a proposition that several governments have condemned. The conference will also host sessions on the conflicts in Sudan and the Democratic Republic of Congo, as well as climate change, energy security and artificial intelligence during the busy three-day conference.

Philippines increases defense efforts amid ongoing tension with China	TAIPEI, TAIWAN — The Philippines is increasing efforts to strengthen defense cooperation with several like-minded democracies amid ongoing tensions with China in the disputed South China Sea. Manila is trying to conclude major defense pacts with Canada and New Zealand and explore possibilities of expanding joint military drills with the United States, its main defense partner. Analysts say the development is part of Manila’s effort to counter China’s aggressive maritime activities near several disputed reefs in the South China Sea, which Beijing claims almost the entirety as its territory. 'The Philippines is trying to boost their capabilities to sufficiently deter China by putting a lot of emphasis on the Mutual Defense Treaty with the United States while broadening the net of cooperation to other like-minded democracies,' said Collin Koh, a maritime security expert at Singapore's S. Rajaratnam School of International Studies. Philippine Defense Secretary Gilberto Teodoro Jr. described the defense pacts with Canada and New Zealand as part of Manila’s efforts to 'build and strengthen' alliances with like-minded countries. 'The status of visiting forces agreement with New Zealand is an important part of … both countries’ and multilateral countries’ initiatives to resist China’s unilateral narrative to change international law,' he told journalists on the sideline of an event on Feb. 6. Meanwhile, the Canadian ambassador to the Philippines, David Hartman, said at a press event on Feb. 7 that the visiting forces agreement would enable Canada to 'have even more substantive participation in joint and multilateral training exercises and operations with the Philippines and allies' in the Indo-Pacific region. Some Philippine analysts describe the signing of the agreements as part of Philippine President Ferdinand Marcos Jr.’s efforts to 'reset' the country’s long-term strategic interests. As China continues to challenge different countries’ territorial claims across the Pacific region, 'the Philippines’ efforts to consolidate more agreements with allies fits Manila’s need to defend its maritime territories and safeguard the freedom of navigation in the region,' Joshua Espena, a resident fellow at the Philippine-based International Development and Security Cooperation, told VOA by phone. Since about one-third of global trade passes through the South China Sea, Koh in Singapore said other democratic countries view signing defense agreements with the Philippines as a way to safeguard their strategic and economic interests in the Indo-Pacific region. While the Philippines’ efforts to strengthen defense cooperation with other democracies may not fundamentally change China’s behaviors in the South China Sea, 'it is still a concern for China when you have so many partners being militarily involved with Manila,' Koh told VOA by phone. Apart from negotiating defense pacts with Canada and New Zealand, the Philippines is also looking to expand joint military exercises with the United States. During a call on Tuesday, the Armed Forces of the Philippines chief Gen. Romeo Brawner Jr. and U.S. Chairman of the Joint Chief of Staff Gen. CQ Brown talked about the 'military modernization initiatives, Enhanced Defense Cooperation Agreement sites and increasing the scope and capacity of joint exercises in the Philippines,' according to U.S. Joint Staff Spokesperson Navy Capt. Jereal Dorsey. In addition to the discussions, the Philippines has conducted a series of joint drills with the U.S. and Canada since last week, a development that China said undermines 'peace and stability in the South China Sea.' While countries around the world are bracing for uncertainties extending from the foreign policy of the administration of U.S. President Donald Trump, some experts say recent developments suggest the U.S. may continue to uphold its defense partnership with the Philippines. 'The people [that] the Trump administration has put into key security roles are mostly China hawks, so they see the China threat as being very real, and the Philippines remains on the front line [of that threat,]' said Raymond Powell, director of Stanford University’s Sealight project, which tracks Chinese maritime activities across the Indo-Pacific region. He said the Philippines may 'stand to gain' from the Trump administration’s foreign policy direction. Manila 'may have one of the strongest arguments' to convince the U.S. to shift resources to the Indo-Pacific region because 'they are on the front line,' Powell told VOA by phone. As the U.S. and the Philippines continue to uphold their defense cooperation, China has described the partnership as 'extremely dangerous.' 'China will not sit idly by when its security interests are harmed or threatened,' Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesperson Guo Jiakun said during a regular press conference on Wednesday. To counter the Chinese coast guard’s aggressive operations in the South China Sea, Brawner Jr. said Wednesday that the Philippines hoped to buy two more submarines and BrahMos missiles in India. The Reuters news agency reported that New Delhi is expected to sign a $200 million missile deal with Manila in 2025. Powell said the additional missiles could strengthen the Philippines’ deterrence against China, while Manila may need to put a lot of effort into familiarizing its military forces with the submarines. Despite Philippine President Marcos Jr.’s recent attempt to 'offer a deal' to reduce tension in the South China Sea, Powell said Beijing’s aggressive posture will make it hard for the proposal to materialize. 'We're seeing much heavier [Chinese] Coast Guard and militia activity around Scarborough Shoal, and I don’t see a lessening of tension there,' he said, adding that tensions between Beijing and Manila in the South China Sea will likely 'plateau' in the near future.	https://www.voanews.com/a/philippines-increases-defense-efforts-amid-ongoing-tension-with-china-/7975137.html	2025-02-14T07:49:26-08:00	
Taiwan pledges chip talks and investment in bid to ease Trump’s concerns	TAIPEI — Taiwan President Lai Ching-te pledged on Friday to talk with the United States about President Donald Trump’s concerns over the chip industry and to increase U.S. investment and buy more from the country, while also spending more on defense. Trump spoke critically about Taiwan on Thursday, saying he aimed to restore U.S. manufacturing of semiconductor chips and repeating claims about Taiwan having taken away the industry he wanted back in the United States. Speaking to reporters after holding a meeting of the National Security Council at the presidential office, Lai said that the global semiconductor supply chain is an ecosystem in which the division of work among various countries is important. 'We of course are aware of President Trump's concerns,' Lai said. 'Taiwan's government will communicate and discuss with the semiconductor industry and come up with good strategies. Then we will come up with good proposals and engage in further discussions with the United States,' he added. Democratic countries including the United States should come together to build a global alliance for AI chips and a 'democratic supply chain' for advanced chips, Lai said. 'While admittedly we have the advantage in semiconductors, we also see it as Taiwan's responsibility to contribute to the prosperity of the international community.' Taiwan is home to the world's largest contract chipmaker, TSMC, a major supplier to companies including Apple and Nvidia, and a crucial part of the developing AI industry. TSMC is investing $65 billion in new factories in the U.S. state of Arizona, a project begun in 2020 under Trump's first administration. TSMC's Taipei-listed shares closed down 2.8% on Friday, underperforming the broader market, which ended off 1.1%. A senior Taiwan security official, speaking to reporters on condition of anonymity in order to speak more freely, said if TSMC judged it was feasible to increase its U.S. investment, Taiwan's government would help in talks with the United States. TSMC did not immediately respond to a request for comment. The official added that communications between Taiwan and U.S. economic, security and defense officials at present was 'quite good' and 'strong support from the United States can be felt'. US support The United States, like most countries, has no formal diplomatic ties with Chinese-claimed Taiwan, but is the democratically governed island's most important international backer and arms supplier. Trump cheered Taiwan last week after a joint U.S.-Japan statement following Japanese Prime Minister Shigeru Ishiba's visit to Washington called for 'maintaining peace and stability across the Taiwan Strait' and voiced support for 'Taiwan's meaningful participation in international organizations.' But Taiwan also runs a large trade surplus with the United States, which surged 83% last year, with the island's exports to the U.S. hitting a record $111.4 billion, driven by demand for high-tech products such as semiconductors. Lai said that the United States is Taiwan's largest foreign investment destination, and that Taiwan is the United States' most reliable trade partner. Trump has also previously criticized Taiwan, which faces a growing military threat from China, for not spending enough on defense, a criticism he has made of many U.S. allies. 'Taiwan must demonstrate our determination to defend ourselves,' Lai said, adding his government is working to propose a special budget this year to boost defense spending from 2.5% of its GDP to 3%. His government is involved in a standoff with parliament, where opposition parties hold a majority, over cuts to the budget, including defense spending. 'Certainly, more and more friends and allies have expressed concern to us, worried whether Taiwan's determination for its self-defense has weakened,' Lai said.	https://www.voanews.com/a/taiwan-pledges-chip-talks-and-investment-in-bid-to-ease-trump-s-concerns-/7974979.html	2025-02-14T05:50:24-08:00	
Lebanon blocks Iranian passenger flight to Beirut, analysts cite Israeli pressure	Lebanon blocked an Iranian airliner from flying into Beirut Thursday after Israel accused Iran a day earlier of using civilian flights to deliver cash to Lebanese terror group Hezbollah. The chief executive of Tehran’s Imam Khomeini International Airport, Saeed Chalandri, told Iranian state news agency Mehr that the Mahan Air flight to Beirut was canceled before takeoff because Lebanon had not granted it permission to land. In a video posted on X by an Iran-based journalist and deemed credible by VOA Persian, the passengers could be seen waiting in a departure hall designated for religious pilgrims, with one man shouting in frustration at being stuck there. In a Thursday statement published by Lebanon’s National News Agency, Beirut’s Directorate General of Civil Aviation said the government was asking some airlines to 'temporarily reschedule' flights to Lebanon while it implements 'some additional security measures.' The civil aviation office did not immediately respond to a VOA request, emailed Friday, for comment on which airlines had been asked to reschedule and how many flights were affected. The statement said Lebanon also was working with its national carrier, Middle East Airlines, to send a plane to Tehran to bring the stranded passengers home. The moves followed a Wednesday Arabic statement by Israeli military spokesman Avichay Adraee, accusing Iran’s Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps Quds Force of exploiting civilian flights to Beirut airport to smuggle cash to its main proxy, Hezbollah, without oversight by the Lebanese government. Iran’s U.N. Mission in New York did not immediately respond to a VOA request, emailed on Thursday, for comment on the Israeli allegation. Mahan Air is sanctioned by the United States as part of a long-running U.S. effort to target entities that fund and arm Hezbollah. Researcher David Daoud of the Washington-based Foundation for Defense of Democracies told VOA he has tracked 26 Mahan Air flights from Iran to Beirut since December 1. He said Thursday’s cancelation was the first time Lebanon blocked one the airline’s flights since letting it resume service to Beirut following a November 27 ceasefire in a yearlong conflict between Israel and Hezbollah. Hezbollah initiated the conflict with Israel in October 2023 in solidarity with Palestinian terror group Hamas, before agreeing to the ceasefire under pressure from an Israeli offensive that had begun in September 2024 and killed its top leaders. Adraee said Israel provided information to a U.S.-led group monitoring the ceasefire to try to stop Iran flying cash to Hezbollah, which he said already had received some of the funds. But the Israeli military refused to comment on whether it had contacted the ceasefire monitoring group to urge Lebanon to block Thursday’s flight. The ceasefire obliges the Lebanese government to assert sovereignty over the country and prevent Hezbollah and other armed groups from receiving 'arms and related material' through border crossings and attacking Israel. It does not explicitly mention deliveries of cash to Hezbollah. Israel also is obligated to withdraw troops from southern Lebanon as Lebanese government forces deploy in the region. Adraee said the Israeli military 'will not allow [Hezbollah] to build up its forces and will use all available means to enforce the ceasefire understandings and ensure the security of [Israel's] citizens.' It was the strongest statement that Israel has made on Iranian cash deliveries to Hezbollah since the recent conflict began. Daoud said Adraee's warning 'put the Lebanese on notice that the Israelis are watching the Beirut airport and know funds for Hezbollah are coming through these Iranian flights.' 'Suddenly, there is movement at the Beirut airport,' he said, in reference to Lebanese authorities denying landing rights to the Mahan Air flight. 'This is part of a pattern in which the Israelis call out them out, and the Lebanese do something that makes them look like they are acting. But the issue is consistency.' Daoud said Lebanon could demonstrate consistency if it bans Mahan Air from flying to Beirut. Short of that step, he said Lebanon also could subject the airline's passengers and cargo to sustained high scrutiny on arrival. Matthew Levitt, a researcher at the Washington Institute for Near East Policy, said in a VOA interview that the Mahan Air flight cancelation is 'welcome news.' 'This is how the Lebanese government will reassert sovereignty over the country, if it continues to move in this direction. And that is not a guarantee,' he said. This article was produced in collaboration with VOA’s Persian service.	https://www.voanews.com/a/lebanon-blocks-iranian-passenger-flight-to-beirut-analysts-cite-israeli-pressure-/7974835.html	2025-02-14T04:54:07-08:00	
Pope Francis taken to hospital for bronchitis treatment	ROME — Pope Francis was taken to hospital on Friday morning for tests and to continue treatment of his ongoing bronchitis, the Vatican said. 'This morning, at the end of his audiences, Pope Francis was admitted to the Policlinico Agostino Gemelli for some necessary diagnostic tests and to continue his treatment for bronchitis, which is still ongoing, in a hospital environment,' it said in a statement. Francis, 88, has been pope since 2013 and has suffered from influenza and other health problems several times over the past two years. Earlier this month, Francis told pilgrims at a weekly audience that he was suffering from a 'strong cold,' which the Vatican later described as bronchitis. The pope has been keeping up his daily schedule of appointments despite his illness, taking meetings at the Vatican residence where he lives. Before going to hospital on Friday, the pope had an official meeting with Slovakian Prime Minister Robert Fico.

Roadside bomb kills 11 coal miners in southwest Pakistan	ISLAMABAD — Authorities in Pakistan’s southwestern Balochistan province said Friday that at least 11 coal mine workers were killed and six injured when their vehicle hit a roadside bomb. The early morning incident occurred near a coal mine in the Harnai district of the insurgency-hit province, which is rich in natural resources. 'The terrorists involved in this incident will be brought to justice soon,' an official statement quoted Provincial Chief Minister Sarfaraz Bugti as saying. In Islamabad, Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif’s office said he expressed sorrow over the deaths of miners and said his government 'is actively working to eliminate terrorism.' No one immediately claimed responsibility for the bombing in Balochistan, where ethnic Baloch militants frequently stage insurgent attacks against security forces and workers associated with public and private mining projects. The Baloch Liberation Army, particularly its suicide bomber unit known as the Majeed Brigade, has claimed responsibility for nearly all recent attacks in Balochistan, resulting in the killings of scores of civilians and security forces. At least 18 Pakistani paramilitary troops were killed Jan. 31 when BLA militants assaulted their bus in the province’s Kalat district, marking one of the deadliest days for security forces in recent months. The U.N. Security Council noted in its latest international terror threat assessment report released this week that BLA has been behind 'several high-casualty attacks' in Balochistan. The report quoted two U.N. member states as saying that the 'Majeed Brigade maintained connections with TTP, ISIL-K and ETIM/TIP, including collaborating with the latter in its operational bases in Afghanistan.' TTP stands for Tehrik-i-Taliban Pakistan, a globally designated terrorist group that carries out almost daily attacks in Pakistan, particularly in its northwestern districts near or on the Afghan border. The Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant-Khorasan, or ISIL-K, is the Afghan branch of the transnational Islamic State terrorist network. The East Turkestan Islamic Movement, or ETIM, is an anti-China militant group operating from sanctuaries in Afghanistan. Balochistan is on Pakistan’s borders with Iran and Afghanistan and has experienced years of attacks attributed to BLA, TTP, and Islamic State loyalists.	https://www.voanews.com/a/roadside-bomb-kills-11-coal-miners-in-southwest-pakistan/7974788.html	2025-02-14T01:22:55-08:00	
Russian drone attack damages Chernobyl nuclear plant's shelter, Zelenskyy says	KYIV, UKRAINE — A Russian drone attack caused significant damage to the radiation shelter of the Chernobyl nuclear power plant overnight, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskiy said on Friday. Chernobyl was the site of the world's worst civil nuclear catastrophe when one of its four reactors exploded in 1986. That reactor is now enveloped by a protective shelter, known as a sarcophagus, to contain the lingering radiation. The Russian drone struck the shelter of the destroyed power unit at the plant, causing a fire that has since been extinguished, he said. 'As of now, radiation levels have not increased and are being constantly monitored,' Zelenskyy said, adding that an initial assessment had found significant damage. 'The only country in the world that attacks such sites, occupies nuclear power plants, and wages war without any regard for the consequences is today’s Russia,' he said.	https://www.voanews.com/a/russian-drone-attack-damages-chornobyl-nuclear-plant-s-shelter-zelenskyy-says/7974778.html	2025-02-14T00:31:43-08:00	
Hamas expected to name 3 Israeli hostages for release this weekend	The militant group Hamas is expected to release the names of three hostages it will exchange for Palestinian prisoners this weekend, after it expressed its commitment to a ceasefire with Israel. The next release of hostages was cast in doubt after Hamas accused Israel of violations of the agreement and threats of a return to war. 'We are not interested in the collapse of the ceasefire agreement in the Gaza Strip, and we are keen on its implementation and ensuring that the occupation [Israel] adheres to it fully,' Hamas spokesperson Abdel-Latif al-Qanoua said. Qanoua also criticized what he called 'language of threats and intimidation' from Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and U.S. President Donald Trump, saying they do not help the implementation of the ceasefire. The Israeli government later reiterated that Hamas must release three hostages this weekend. 'If those three are not released, if Hamas does not return our hostages by Saturday noon, the ceasefire will end,' Israeli government spokesperson David Mencer said. Hamas earlier this week accused Israel of violating the deal by continuing airstrikes on people in Gaza and blocking aid. The group said future hostage releases would be postponed. Netanyahu said fighting would resume if more captives were not freed on Saturday, and Trump said Monday that 'all hell would break out' if hostages were not returned. On Wednesday, after Israel called up military reservists, Israeli Defense Minister Israel Katz reiterated Trump’s warning. 'If Hamas stops the hostage releases, then there is no ceasefire, and there is war,' he said. He added that the fighting would be more intense and would 'allow the realization of Trump's vision for Gaza.' Trump has discussed a plan under which the United States would take over Gaza and Palestinians would have no right to return. Other countries in the region, including Egypt, Jordan and Saudi Arabia, have rejected the idea. U.S. Secretary of State Marco Rubio said Thursday that the United States wanted to hear new proposals from Arab states on Gaza after Trump’s plan received backlash. 'If they’ve got a better plan, now’s the time to present it,' Rubio said on a conservative radio show. Since the ceasefire took effect last month, Hamas, which has been designated a terrorist organization by the United States, has freed 21 hostages, and Israel has released more than 730 prisoners. The next exchange on Saturday calls for the release of three more Israelis in exchange for hundreds of Palestinian prisoners jailed by Israel. The war in Gaza was triggered by the October 2023 Hamas terror attack on Israel that killed 1,200 people and led to the capture of 250 hostages. Israel’s counteroffensive killed more than 48,200 Palestinians, more than half of them women and children, according to local health authorities. Israel says the death toll includes 17,000 militants it has killed. Both Israel and Hamas stand accused of committing war crimes. The United States on Thursday sanctioned the chief prosecutor at the International Criminal Court over the ICC’s investigations targeting U.S. officials and alleged Israeli war crimes in Gaza.

As Germany election looms, far-right German party continues to gather support	German voters head to the polls this month for an election that will determine who the country’s new chancellor will be. The Feb. 23 poll is a snap election, following the collapse of center-left Chancellor Olaf Scholz’s coalition government last year. The far-right Alternative for Germany, or AfD, founded in 2013, appears to be gathering strength and support across the country and has emerged as a factor in the election. The party’s popularity has been fueled by dissatisfaction with the large numbers of immigrants in the country. While AfD has evolved to focus its attention on other issues, including the immediate lifting of sanctions against Russia, immigration remains its central theme. Alice Weidel, AfD’s first candidate for chancellor, is a staunch supporter of so-called 'remigration,' a term used to describe the mass deportation of immigrants. Political analysts say Weidel has little chance of becoming chancellor, but as AfD’s popularity has risen, it has forced politicians to rethink their conversations and debates about immigration. AfD won its first parliamentary seats in 2017, with 12.6% of the votes. In 2021, the party had only 10.3% of the votes. It has supporters across the country and its politicians have been elected to 14 of Germany’s 16 state legislatures. Its emergence as a political force occurs at the same time that other far-right parties are rising in Europe, including Austria's Freedom Party and the National Rally in France.

Category 5 cyclone nears Western Australia coast	sydney — Category 5 Cyclone Zelia swirled toward Australia's minerals-rich western coast Friday, with predicted gusts of up to 290 kilometers per hour sparking emergency warnings and port closures. Forecasters said the slow-moving, severe tropical cyclone was moving south toward Port Hedland — one of the world's busiest iron ore loading ports — with landfall expected in the afternoon. 'Very destructive winds of up to 290 kilometers per hour (180 miles per hour) are likely close to the center of the cyclone as it crosses the coast,' the Australian Bureau of Meteorology said. It warned residents of a possible dangerous storm tide as the cyclone made landfall. 'Tides are likely to rise significantly above the normal high tide mark with damaging waves and dangerous flooding of some low-lying areas close to the shoreline,' it said in an update. The cyclone was forecast to land near Port Hedland — about 17 hours' drive north of the state capital, Perth — before tracking inland across sparsely populated mining and cattle country. Initially arriving as a Category 5 cyclone, Zelia was expected to weaken to a Category 4 later in the evening. Pilbara Ports said it had cleared vessels and shut down operations at major minerals export centers Port Hedland and Port Dampier as well as the oil and gas shipping port of Varanus Island. Emergency services in Western Australia told people still in the cyclone's path to shelter in the strongest part of their homes, warning it was now too late to attempt to leave. The northwest coast of Western Australia is the most cyclone-prone region in the country, according to the Bureau of Meteorology. It also has 'the highest incidence of cyclones in the Southern Hemisphere.' The region holds significant deposits of iron ore, copper and gold, and is home to some of Australia's largest mining operations. Mining group Rio Tinto said its ships and trains had been cleared from ports in the area. 'It is too early to say how long port and rail operations will be closed and what the impact will be,' it said in a statement Thursday.	https://www.voanews.com/a/category-5-cyclone-nears-western-australia-coast/7974677.html	2025-02-13T18:37:12-08:00

France's Macron urges Syria's interim government to join US-led coalition fighting extremists	PARIS — French President Emmanuel Macron urged Syria's interim government to cooperate with a U.S.-led coalition fighting against extremist groups in that region as he hosted a conference Thursday on the Mideast country's future. Macron's comments come amid uncertainty over the United States' commitment to the region. Thursday's conference in Paris among European and Arab nations was the third on Syria since the repressive government of Bashar al-Assad was ousted in December and was attended by Syria's interim foreign minister, Asaad al-Shibani. 'Syria must very clearly continue to fight against all the terrorist organizations that are spreading chaos,' Macron said. 'If Syria decides to offer cooperation' with the international coalition, France would support the move, he added. The Paris conference of foreign ministers and other officials from participating countries was meant to coordinate efforts to support a peaceful transition, as the new government in Damascus underlines its desire to improve relations with the West. Integration of Kurdish-led forces Macron also called on the Syrian interim government to 'fully integrate' the U.S.-backed, Kurdish-led Syrian Democratic Forces (SDF) into the Syrian transition, calling them 'precious allies.' 'I think your responsibility today is to integrate them and also to allow these forces to join in,' he said. On Thursday, Syrian organizers of a conference in Damascus to chart the country's political future said those talks will include all segments of Syrian society except for the Kurdish-led administration in the northeast and Assad loyalists. Most of the country's former insurgent factions have agreed to dissolve and join the new Syrian army and security services, but the Kurdish-led SDF so far has refused to do the same. SDF forces have been clashing with Turkish-backed groups in northern Syria, and the Kurds are concerned about losing political and cultural gains they have made since carving out their own enclave in the northeast during the country's civil war. Discussions are ongoing between the SDF and the government in Damascus. Billions in aid needed More aid is crucial to achieve a peaceful reconstruction during the post-Assad transition. The country needs to rebuild housing, electricity, water and transportation infrastructure after nearly 14 years of war. The United Nations in 2017 estimated that it would cost at least $250 billion, while some experts now say the number could reach at least $400 billion. With few productive sectors and government employees making wages equivalent to about $20 per month, Syria has grown increasingly dependent on remittances and humanitarian aid. But the flow of aid was throttled after the Trump administration halted U.S. foreign assistance last month. The effects were particularly dire in the country's northwest, a formerly rebel-held enclave that hosts millions of people displaced from other areas by the country's civil war. Many of them live in sprawling tent camps. The freeze on USAID funding forced clinics serving many of those camps to shut down, and nonprofits laid off local staff. A workshop bringing together key donors from the Group of Seven leading industrialized nations, the United Nations and key agencies from Arab countries will be held alongside the conference to coordinate international aid to Syria. Doubts about US military support Uncertainty also surrounds the future of U.S. military support in the region. In 2019 during his first term, Trump decided on a partial withdrawal of U.S. troops from the northeast of Syria before he halted the plans. And in December last year, when rebels were on their way to topple Assad, Trump said the United States should not 'dive into the middle of a Syrian civil war.' Now that Syria's new leader, Ahmad al-Sharaa, is trying to consolidate his power, the U.S. intentions in the region remain unclear. A U.S. official attended Thursday's conference in Paris.	https://www.voanews.com/a/france-s-macron-urges-syria-s-interim-government-to-join-us-led-coalition-fighting-extremists-/7974614.html	2025-02-13T17:22:11-08:00	
Russian Vinnik back in Moscow after prisoner swap, news agency says	Alexander Vinnik, a Russian national convicted of cybercrime and released by U.S. authorities as part of a prisoner swap, arrived in Moscow on Thursday and thanked President Vladimir Putin and others for arranging the exchange, state news agency RIA said. Vinnik, who pleaded guilty in May 2024 to charges of conspiracy to commit money laundering, told RIA in a dispatch issued after midnight that he was at home with his family. He said he had flown on a U.S. plane that stopped in Poland and not in Turkey as his lawyer had said. Quoted by RIA, Vinnik thanked Putin, Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov, Russian diplomats and special services, his lawyers 'and especially my family.' He added: 'What can I say? And I can also thank [U.S. President Donald] Trump. On the whole, without him, things would probably have been difficult.' Leonid Slutsky, head of the foreign affairs committee of Russia's State Duma, the lower house of parliament, told the Tass news agency that Vinnik's return home was 'yet another victory for Russian diplomacy and all services and agencies associated with his liberation.' Unlike previous instances of Russians returning home after a prisoner swap, there was little fanfare around Vinnik's arrival. Vinnik operated a cryptocurrency exchange, BTC-e, through which he was suspected of funneling $4 billion in proceeds from ransomware attacks, identity theft, drug rings and other criminal activity. He was freed by the United States from prison in return for Moscow's release of American schoolteacher Marc Fogel, who returned home on Tuesday.	https://www.voanews.com/a/russian-vinnik-back-in-moscow-after-prisoner-swap-news-agency-says-/7974639.html	2025-02-13T17:17:12-08:00	
Trump administration lays off probationary employees, plans 'large-scale' cuts	washington — The Trump administration on Thursday intensified its sweeping efforts to shrink the size of the federal workforce, the nation's largest employer, by ordering agencies to lay off nearly all probationary employees who had not yet gained civil service protection — potentially affecting hundreds of thousands of workers. In addition, workers at some agencies were warned that large workplace cuts would be coming. The decision on probationary workers, who generally have less than a year on the job, came from the Office of Personnel Management, which serves as a human resources department for the federal government. The notification was confirmed by a person familiar with the matter, who spoke on condition of anonymity because of a lack of authorization to discuss the matter publicly. It's expected to be the first step in sweeping layoffs throughout the federal government. President Donald Trump signed an executive order Tuesday that told agency leaders to plan for 'large-scale reductions in force.' Elon Musk, whom Trump has given wide leeway to slash government spending with his Department of Government Efficiency, called Thursday for the country to 'delete entire agencies' from the federal government. 'I think we do need to delete entire agencies as opposed to leave a lot of them behind,' Musk said as he spoke via a videocall to the World Governments Summit in Dubai, United Arab Emirates. 'If we don't remove the roots of the weed, then it's easy for the weed to grow back.' 'Vast unraveling' Paul Light, an expert on the federal government and professor emeritus of public service at New York University, said it seemed like the administration was 'inventing new methods for destroying government capacity.' By laying people off, the government will be able to accomplish fewer things. 'It's a vast unraveling of what federal agencies do,' he said. Thursday's order was an expansion of previous directions from OPM, which told agencies earlier this week that probationary employees should be fired if they weren't meeting high standards. It's not clear how many workers are in a probationary period. According to government data maintained by OPM, there were 220,000 workers with under a year on the job as of March 2024, the most recent data available. The firing of probationary employees began earlier this week, and it has included workers at the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau and the Department of Education. At least 39 workers were fired from the Education Department on Wednesday, according to a union that represents agency workers, including civil rights workers, special education specialists and student aid officials. The civilian federal workforce, not including military personnel and postal workers, is made up of about 2.4 million people. While about 20% of the workers are in Washington and the neighboring states of Maryland and Virginia, more than 80% live outside the capital region. Trump's initial attempt to downsize the workforce was the deferred resignation program, commonly described as a buyout, which offered to pay people until September 30 if they agreed to quit. The White House said 75,000 people signed up, and a federal judge cleared a legal roadblock for the program on Wednesday. However, the number of workers who took the offer was lower than the administration's target, and Trump has made it clear that he would take further steps to lay people off. Employees at the National Science Foundation and Housing and Urban Development Department were told this week that large reductions in the workforce, in some cases a halving of the workforce, would be coming, according to a person familiar with the situation who spoke on condition of anonymity because of a lack of authorization to discuss it. The National Science Foundation was told to expect a 25% to 50% reduction in force within two months, while the Housing and Urban Development Department was told to plan for a 50% reduction, the person said. Employees at the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration were also bracing Thursday for reductions in their workforce. The order Trump signed Tuesday stipulated that government functions not required by law would be prioritized for cuts and hiring would be restricted. With exceptions for functions such as public safety, only one employee can be added for every four who leave. In addition, new hires would generally need the approval from a representative of the DOGE, expanding the influence of Musk's team.	https://www.voanews.com/a/trump-administration-lays-off-probationary-employees-plans-large-scale-cuts/7974612.html	2025-02-13T17:10:27-08:00	
Trump takes tit-for-tat trade action with tariffs	WASHINGTON — U.S. President Donald Trump on Thursday took what could become his most consequential action involving international trade early in his second administration. Trump, who signed a memorandum calling for reciprocal tariffs, told a group of reporters in the Oval Office that 'if you build your product in the United States, there are no tariffs.' The goal is to bring down America’s budget deficit, estimated to be approaching $2 trillion. The president added that the action 'is fair to all. No other country can complain.' Trump ordered Howard Lutnick and Jamieson Greer, his picks for commerce secretary and U.S. trade representative, respectively, to lead teams to calculate new import taxes on America’s trading partners. To assess the amounts, they are to take into consideration other countries’ tariff rates, subsidies to industry, value-added taxes — which are common in the European Union — regulations and undervaluing of currencies. The EU value-added tax is the 'poster child' for unfair trade, Peter Navarro, the president’s senior counselor for trade, told reporters on Thursday. Modi visit Trump put his signature on the edict just hours before welcoming Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi to the White House. India is expected to be one of the countries most affected by the action. India has relatively high tariff and non-tariff barriers on numerous American exports. It has faced pressure from Washington to reduce its 100% tariff on walnuts, the 70% levy on apples and the 60% import tax on dairy products. Other sectors include smartphones, pork and poultry, and medical devices. India reduced a 100% tariff on Harley-Davidson motorcycles — an iconic brand deeply embedded in the economy of the Midwestern state of Wisconsin — to 50% in 2018. The two countries announced on Thursday an energy agreement to make the United States the primary supplier of oil and gas to India. Trump, alongside Modi, at a Thursday evening news conference said he would pave the way for the United States to sell F-35 Stealth fighter jets to India and the two leaders would work to make tariff cuts in order to reduce America’s nearly $50 billion trade deficit with India. 'Prime Minister Modi and I agreed we would begin negotiations to address the long-standing disparities,' Trump said. Modi said he and Trump have set a 'target of more than doubling our bilateral trade to attain $500 billion by 2030. Our teams will work on concluding very soon a mutually beneficial trade agreement.' In response to a reporter’s question about the reciprocal tariffs, Trump confirmed India would also be targeted. 'Whatever India charges, we’re charging them,' he said. Some high-ranking government officials in New Delhi have suggested finding a way to appease the U.S. president amid concern that he could negotiate a sweeping trade deal with India’s neighbor and rival, China, according to Aparna Pande, director of the Hudson Institute’s Initiative on the Future of India and South Asia. If Trump and China’s leader, Xi Jinping, were to forge a sweeping trade pact, 'India could face a double challenge — on the trade/economic front and the strategic big picture front,' Pande told VOA on Thursday. 'India is a country that Trump has railed against in the past, although I don't think it's a particular obsession of his in the way that China is, because China is a major strategic competitor to the United States. Or the way Canada and Mexico are, because they are the bordering countries,' according to Milan Vaishnav, director of the South Asia program at the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace. Since being sworn into office on Jan. 20 for his second nonconsecutive term as president, Trump has moved quickly on the trade front. He imposed, and then put on hold amid further negotiations, across-the-board 25% tariffs on nearly all products from America’s two continental neighbors, Canada and Mexico. He placed a flat 10% tariff on all Chinese goods, which prompted Beijing to respond with countertariffs of 10% to 15% on crude oil, liquefied natural gas, farm machinery and some other U.S. products. Economists say the tariffs cover about $450 billion worth of Chinese goods, while the Chinese tariffs hit $15 billion to $20 billion in American products. Trump characterized his actions as a way to pressure those three countries into doing more to stop the flow of the synthetic opioid fentanyl into the United States. He also has blamed Canada and Mexico for being lax in preventing migrants from crossing their borders into the U.S. Trump earlier this week announced that effective in March, all steel and aluminum imports will be taxed at a minimum of 25%, an action analysts predict could significantly raise sticker prices at automotive dealerships in North America. 'Stagflationary shock' Analysts say Trump’s tariff actions will hurt the growth of the U.S. economy this year. 'Tariffs impart a modest stagflationary shock to an economy,' according to a report issued Thursday by financial services provider Wells Fargo. 'The U.S. economy entered 2025 with a fair amount of momentum, but we look for real GDP growth to downshift a bit over the next few quarters as the price-boosting effects of tariffs erode growth in real income, thereby weighing on growth in real consumer spending.' Peter Harrell, who was jointly appointed to the White House National Security Council and National Economic Council in the previous administration of President Joe Biden, said Trump 'promised us he would be a ‘tariff man’ and he is certainly delivering.' 'I think this is only part of the tariffs we are likely to see or at least threatened' over the coming months, Harrell said Thursday morning on 'The Capital Cable,' a livestream program of the Center for Strategic and International Studies’ (CSIS) Korea Chair. These actions or the threat of them give the Trump administration leverage by having 'a tariff bazooka ready to fire,' said Harrell, currently a Carnegie nonresident fellow. On the same livestream, Philip Luck, director of the CSIS economic program, warned that Trump’s 'Fortress America' will result in Americans paying 'really high costs' due to retaliatory actions by Washington’s trading partners. If the president’s goal is to use such trade actions partly to increase the cash coffers, tariff revenue is approximately 1.5% of government revenue, 'so it’s tiny,' Luck said. The United States is in a dominant position as the largest economy and well-integrated into the global trading system, giving it leverage built up over an 80-year period, but Trump’s actions could squander that goodwill, Luck said. 'We’ve been a reliable partner for a long period of time,' he noted, with the United States traditionally setting tariffs through negotiations involving international groups such as the World Trade Organization. 'There’s a lot of anxiety, bordering on panic in [South] Korea,' because Trump, immediately in his second term, is using tariffs for noneconomic reasons, said Yeo Han-Koo, a senior fellow at the Peterson Institute for International Economics 'U.S. policymakers really need to see the strategic angle' amid the regional competition with China and how they can collaborate with Tokyo and Seoul, suggested Yeo, who as South Korea’s trade minister coinciding with Trump’s first term was at the negotiating table across from American officials. Shipbuilding, civil nuclear power and biopharmaceuticals are three sectors where the United States, Japan and South Korea could cooperate to help counter Beijing’s rising trade and military influence, Yeo suggested.

Jailed Georgian journalist: 'I will not bow to this regime'	WASHINGTON — 'I will not bow to this regime,' writes Mzia Amaglobeli from pre-trial detention in the city of Batumi in Georgia. The 49-year-old journalist has been in custody since January 11 and on a hunger strike since January 12 over her detention. Amaglobeli was attending a protest where demonstrations were calling for fresh elections and objecting to the government's suspension of Georgia's EU accession plans. At first, police detained Amaglobeli for putting a sticker on a wall. She was released, only to be arrested later that day for slapping a police officer. Georgia's prime minister and other government officials have said that Amaglobeli should end her hunger strike and apologize for her actions. But media watchdogs believe her arrest is connected to her journalism. Journalist previously threatened Amaglobeli is the founder of the websites Batumelebi and Netgazeti, which focus on political news, investigations and corruption. Both Amaglobeli and her media group have come under pressure and threats previously for their work. Amaglobeli's health has declined after being on a hunger strike for a month, and she is being held in a private clinic under a doctor's supervision, but she remains in custody. Nestan Tsetskhladze, a friend and colleague, told VOA that the journalist plans to remain on her hunger strike until March 4, when she is due to appear in court. 'She is on hunger strike in protest, to show that she won't tolerate this regime,' Tsetskhladze told VOA. 'She is not going to live by this regime's agenda. That is her goal.' Amaglobeli has also written of her position in a letter last month to colleagues that was shared with media. 'Today it is me, tomorrow it could be anyone who dares to dream of a just, democratic European Georgia, untouched by Russian influence, unshaken by oppression,' wrote Amaglobeli. 'I will not bow to this regime. I will not play by its rules.' Hundreds arrested The journalist is one of hundreds of people to be arrested since parliamentary elections in October resulted in nationwide protests. The country's ruling Georgian Dream party officially won the election with around 54% of the vote, but the results were challenged by then-President Salome Zourabichvili and opposition parties, who claimed the elections were rigged. Observers, including the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe, said there were reports of voter irregularities. At the time, Prime Minister Irakli Kobakhidze, a member of Georgian Dream, called on Zourabichvili to turn over any evidence of rigging to authorities. He said he believed she did not have such evidence. A fresh wave of protests started on November 28, when Kobakhidze announced a suspension of all negotiations with the European Union on Georgia's EU accession until 2028. Police have responded to the protests with force, using water cannons against demonstrators, hundreds of whom have been detained, beaten and treated inhumanely, according to Transparency International Georgia. In Amaglobeli's case, the journalist's legal team says she was mistreated after her second arrest. They say that the police officer whom she slapped was trying to physically abuse her, that he spat in her face and did not let her use the restroom for several hours. Additionally, lawyers were not allowed to see the journalist for three hours. Amaglobeli faces charges of assaulting a police officer. If found guilty, she could face up to seven years in prison. Transparency International Georgia has said a video of the interaction shows the slap 'lacked sufficient force to cause harm,' and doesn't meet the standard for a formal charge. Gulnoza Said of the Committee to Protect Journalists told VOA that it is a 'very serious press freedom violation that she is in detention.' Rachel Denber, deputy director of the Human Rights Watch Europe and Central Asia division, said that, so far, no investigations have taken place into cases of riot police using excessive force or alleged mistreatment of protesters in custody. 'Suddenly, this is where the authorities are putting all of their time and resources and vigor — to punish one person who is a journalist and who has a record of being outspoken,' Denber told VOA. Tsetskhladze, the journalist's friend, believes the government's treatment of Amaglobeli is meant to be a warning for other independent media outlets and journalists in Georgia. 'They are punishing not only Mzia, who slapped a police officer, but also the media outlets she funded, the media in general, journalists and all critical, free people in this country,' he told VOA. At least 50 journalists have been attacked, obstructed and beaten during the protests. Some were hospitalized and their equipment was damaged, according to the Mapping Media Freedom platform.

Federal judge pauses Trump order restricting gender-affirming care for trans youth	BALTIMORE — A federal judge on Thursday temporarily blocked President Donald Trump's recent executive order aimed at restricting gender-affirming health care for transgender people under age 19. The judge's ruling came after a lawsuit was filed earlier this month on behalf of families with transgender or nonbinary children who allege their health care has been compromised by the president's order. A national group for family of LGBTQ+ people and a doctors organization are also plaintiffs in the court challenge, one of many lawsuits opposing one of the many executive orders Trump has issued. Judge Brendan Hurson, who was nominated by former President Joe Biden, granted the plaintiffs' request for a temporary restraining order following a hearing in federal court in Baltimore. The ruling, in effect for 14 days, essentially puts Trump's directive on hold while the case proceeds. The restraining order could also be extended. Shortly after taking office, Trump signed an executive order directing federally run insurance programs to exclude coverage for gender-affirming care. That includes Medicaid, which covers such services in some states, and TRICARE for military families. Trump's order also called on the Department of Justice to vigorously pursue litigation and legislation to oppose the practice. The lawsuit includes several accounts from families of appointments being canceled as medical institutions react to the new directive. Attorneys for the plaintiffs argue Trump's executive order is 'unlawful and unconstitutional' because it seeks to withhold federal funds previously authorized by Congress and because it violates anti-discrimination laws while infringing on the rights of parents. Like legal challenges to state bans on gender-affirming care, the lawsuit also alleges the policy is discriminatory because it allows federal funds to cover the same treatments when they're not used for gender transition. Some hospitals immediately paused gender-affirming care, including prescriptions for puberty blockers and hormone therapy, while they assess how the order affects them. Trump's approach on the issue represents an abrupt change from the Biden administration, which sought to explicitly extend civil rights protections to transgender people. Trump has used strong language in opposing gender-affirming care, asserting falsely that 'medical professionals are maiming and sterilizing a growing number of impressionable children under the radical and false claim that adults can change a child's sex.' Major medical groups such as the American Medical Association and the American Academy of Pediatrics support access to gender-affirming care. Young people who persistently identify as a gender that differs from their sex assigned at birth are first evaluated by a team of professionals. Some may try a social transition, involving changing a hairstyle or pronouns. Some may later also receive puberty blockers or hormones. Surgery is extremely rare for minors.	https://www.voanews.com/a/federal-judge-pauses-trump-order-restricting-gender-affirming-care-for-trans-youth-/7974321.html	2025-02-13T14:40:50-08:00	
Prosecutors quit after being ordered to end case against New York mayor	NEW YORK — The top federal prosecutor in Manhattan resigned Thursday after refusing a Justice Department order to drop corruption charges against New York City Mayor Eric Adams. Two senior Justice Department officials also quit after the department leadership in Washington moved to seize control of the case. Danielle Sassoon, a Republican serving as interim U.S. attorney for the Southern District of New York, announced her resignation in an email to her staff. The move was confirmed by a spokesperson for the office. Adams' case has yet to be dropped. After Sassoon declined to dismiss the case, the department's public integrity section in Washington was asked to take over, according to a person familiar with the matter. Two senior officials who oversee the unit, including the acting chief, resigned in response, according to the person, who spoke on the condition of anonymity to discuss personnel matters. The exits came days after a high-ranking Justice Department official directed federal prosecutors in New York to end the case against Adams, a Democrat who was accused of accepting illegal campaign contributions and bribes of free or discounted travel from people who wanted to buy his influence. He has pleaded not guilty. Acting Deputy Attorney General Emil Bove said in a memo Monday that the case should be dismissed so Adams could aid President Donald Trump's immigration crackdown and campaign for reelection free from facing criminal charges. The primary is four months away and Adams has multiple challengers. Bove had directed that be done as soon as 'practicable,' but there have been no public statements or actions by the prosecution team. On Wednesday, Attorney General Pam Bondi said she would 'look into' why the case had yet to be dismissed. As of Thursday afternoon, the charges remained in place. In the email to her staff, Sassoon did not give a reason for her resignation. In the note, the contents of which were obtained by The Associated Press, she said she had just submitted her resignation to Bondi. 'As I told her, it has been my greatest honor to represent the United States and to pursue justice as a prosecutor in the Southern District of New York,' Sassoon wrote. The Justice Department did not ask Sassoon to resign, according to a department official who spoke on condition of anonymity. The department declined public comment on Sassoon's exit. A message seeking comment was left for Adams' attorney, Alex Spiro. A spokesperson for the mayor did not immediately respond to a request for comment. The government's decision to end the Adams case because of political considerations, rather than the strength or weakness of the evidence, alarmed some career prosecutors who said it was a departure from long-standing norms. The directive from Bove, a former Trump personal lawyer, was all the more remarkable because Bove had been a longtime prosecutor and supervisor in the Southern District and because department leaders are historically reluctant to intervene in cases where charges have been brought — particularly in an office as prestigious as that U.S. attorney's office. Bove's memo also steered clear of any legal basis for the dismissal despite decades of department tradition dictating that charging decisions are to be guided by facts, evidence and the law. Sassoon, a former clerk for the late U.S. Supreme Court Justice Antonin Scalia, was not the prosecutor who brought the case against Adams last year. That was then-U.S. Attorney Damian Williams, who stepped down after Trump's election victory in November. Sassoon had only been tapped to serve as acting U.S. attorney on January 21, the day after Trump took office. Her role was intended to be temporary. Trump in November nominated Jay Clayton, the former chairman of the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission, to the post, an appointment that must be confirmed by the Senate. That has not happened yet. The Southern District of New York is among the largest and most prominent prosecutor's offices in the U.S., with a long track record of tackling Wall Street malfeasance, political corruption and international terrorism. It has a tradition of independence from Washington, something that has earned it the nickname 'the sovereign district.' During Trump's first term, the office prosecuted both the president's personal lawyer, Michael Cohen, and his strategic adviser, Steve Bannon, in separate cases. Cohen pleaded guilty to tax evasion and campaign finance charges. Trump ended the federal fraud case against Bannon by pardoning him, though nearly identical charges were then brought by state prosecutors. This is the second Justice Department tussle in five years between Washington and New York officials to result in a dramatic leadership turnover. In 2020, William Barr, who served as one of Trump's attorneys general during his first term pushed out Geoffrey Berman, the U.S. attorney in Manhattan, in a surprise nighttime announcement. Berman initially refused to resign his position, creating a brief standoff with Barr, but did so after an assurance that his investigations into allies of Trump would not be disturbed. Sassoon joined the U.S. attorney's office in 2016. In 2023 she helped lead the fraud prosecution of Sam Bankman-Fried, founder of the cryptocurrency exchange FTX. More recently, she had served as the office's co-chief of criminal appeals. Adams was indicted in September on charges that while he worked as Brooklyn borough president, he accepted over $100,000 in illegal campaign contributions and lavish travel perks such as expensive flight upgrades, luxury hotel stays and even a trip to a bathhouse. The indictment said a Turkish official who helped facilitate the trips then leaned on Adams for favors, including asking him to lobby the Fire Department to let a newly constructed, 36-story diplomatic building open in time for a planned visit by Turkey's president. Prosecutors said they had proof that Adams personally directed political aides to solicit foreign donations and disguise them to help the campaign qualify for a city program that provides a generous, publicly funded match for small dollar donations. Under federal law, foreign nationals are banned from contributing to U.S. election campaigns. As recently as Jan. 6, prosecutors had indicated their investigation remained active, writing in court papers that they continued to 'uncover additional criminal conduct by Adams.' Bove said in his memo that Justice Department officials in Washington hadn't evaluated the evidence in the case before deciding it should be dropped — at least until after the mayoral election in November. Federal agents also had been investigating other senior Adams aides. It was unclear what would happen to that side of the probe.	https://www.voanews.com/a/prosecutors-quit-after-being-ordered-to-end-case-against-new-york-mayor/7974287.html	2025-02-13T14:37:30-08:00	
Trump wants denuclearization talks with Russia and China, hopes for defense spending cuts	WASHINGTON — President Donald Trump said Thursday that he wants to restart nuclear arms control talks with Russia and China and that eventually he hopes all three countries could agree to cut their massive defense budgets in half. Speaking to reporters in the Oval Office, Trump lamented the hundreds of billions of dollars being invested in rebuilding the nation's nuclear deterrent and said he hopes to gain commitments from the U.S. adversaries to cut their own spending. 'There’s no reason for us to be building brand-new nuclear weapons. We already have so many,' Trump said. 'You could destroy the world 50 times over, 100 times over. And here we are building new nuclear weapons, and they’re building nuclear weapons.' 'We’re all spending a lot of money that we could be spending on other things that are actually, hopefully, much more productive,' Trump said. While the U.S. and Russia have held massive stockpiles of weapons since the Cold War, Trump predicted that China would catch up in its capability to exact nuclear devastation 'within five or six years.' He said if the weapons were ever called to use, 'that’s going to be probably oblivion.' Trump said he would look to engage in nuclear talks with the two countries once 'we straighten it all out' in the Middle East and Ukraine. 'One of the first meetings I want to have is with President Xi [Jinping] of China, President [Vladimir] Putin of Russia. And I want to say, ‘Let’s cut our military budget in half.’ And we can do that. And I think we’ll be able to.' Trump in his first term tried and failed to bring China into nuclear arms reduction talks when the U.S. and Russia were negotiating an extension of a pact known as New START. Russia suspended its participation in the treaty during the Biden administration, as the U.S. and Russia continued on massive programs to extend the lifespans or replace their Cold War-era nuclear arsenals.	https://www.voanews.com/a/trump-wants-denuclearization-talks-with-russia-china-hopes-for-defense-spending-cuts/7974285.html	2025-02-13T14:19:45-08:00

Chinese diplomat visits UK, restarts dialogue	WASHINGTON — Chinese Foreign Minister Wang Yi visited Britain for the first time on Thursday, marking the restart of a diplomatic dialogue mechanism that has been paused for nearly seven years. Wang had talks with Britain's foreign minister and national security adviser and briefly met with Prime Minister Keir Starmer. The top Chinese diplomat's visit restarts the U.K.-China Strategic Dialogue, which has been frozen since 2018 over human rights abuses in Hong Kong, spying allegations and China's support for Russia's war in Ukraine. British Foreign Secretary David Lammy said that discussions would involve 'areas of bilateral economic cooperation' and security issues such as the war in Ukraine. 'We will also discuss issues where the U.K. and China do not always see eye to eye, and in some cases, the U.K. does have significant concerns,' Lammy said. In the meetings, Wang said that cooperation was increasingly urgent, given the current state of global affairs. 'Under the current situation, it is more important than before for China and the U.K. to demonstrate their responsibilities as major countries, practice multilateralism, support free trade, advocate win-win cooperation, and promote political solutions to hot spot issues, so we can jointly work for the peace and stability of the world,' Wang said through an interpreter. 'It is important that we use channels such as this for robust but constructive discussion, as we are both members of the U.N. Security Council and we'll be better able to understand each other, and each other's perspectives,' Wang added. Wang's visit is another step in the new British labor government's effort to improve its relations with China. Lammy visited China in October, and British Treasury chief Rachel Reeves traveled to Beijing in January to reopen talks of investment between the countries. As British diplomats met with Wang, a small group of demonstrators gathered outside the Chinese Embassy to protest his arrival and Chinese human rights violations. 'We will take this opportunity to call on China, to hope that China can have freedom of speech, human rights and can end its dictatorship rule,' said Cheng Xiaodan, a Chinese immigrant living in England. Members of the crowd held small paper signs with images of Wang and banners that read 'Long live freedom. Long live human rights.'	https://www.voanews.com/a/chinese-diplomat-visits-uk-restarts-dialogue/7974252.html	2025-02-13T14:15:49-08:00

Pentagon chief calls on NATO partners to increase role in Europe’s defense	PENTAGON — U.S. Secretary of Defense Pete Hegseth has called for NATO’s European members to increase their role in the defense of Europe as the United States focuses on defending the alliance’s Pacific flank. It is a move that he says will likely require European allies to significantly increase defense spending from 2% of GDP to about 5% of GDP. 'We can talk all we want about values. Values are important, but you can't shoot values, you can't shoot flags, and you can't shoot strong speeches. There is no replacement for hard power,' Hegseth told reporters on Thursday at NATO headquarters in Brussels. Last year, NATO’s European allies collectively spent 2% of their GDP, amounting to about $380 billion, for the first time after setting a 2% defense spending goal in 2014. The U.S. currently spends about 3.5% of its GDP on defense. Canada, the other non-European NATO ally, currently spends about 1.4% of its GDP on defense. 'NATO is a great alliance, the most successful defense alliance in history, but to endure for the future, our partners must do far more for Europe's defense,' Hegseth said. He emphasized that deterrence of Chinese aggression 'in the Pacific is one that really can only be led by the United States.' He said the U.S. does not seek conflict with China, nor does it feel that conflict with China is inevitable, but he contended the administration must work with allies to ensure deterrence in the Indo-Pacific is 'hard power deterrence, not just reputational.' Russia-Ukraine war On Wednesday, Hegseth said keeping Ukraine’s pre-invasion boundaries is an 'unrealistic objective' in its war against Russian aggression, as was the expectation that Ukraine would join NATO. He advocated for a negotiated end to the war with security guarantees backed by European and non-European troops that would not include U.S. forces. German Defense Minister Boris Pistorius said Ukraine’s potential membership in NATO and whether it should concede any territory should not be decided before peace talks start, referring to Hegseth’s comments as 'concessions' made by the United States. 'Vladimir Putin responds to strength,' Hegseth said on Thursday when asked whether the U.S. was decreasing Ukraine’s leverage. 'No one's going to get everything that they want, understanding who committed the aggression in the first place,' he added, referring to Putin. NATO Secretary General Mark Rutte reiterated his support for higher defense spending and appeared to defend Hegseth’s comments on Ukraine not joining the alliance. Rutte said on Thursday that while NATO must 'make sure that Vladimir Putin never ever tries again to attack Ukraine,' he said, 'it has never been a promise to Ukraine that as part of a peace deal, they would be part of NATO.' The European Union’s top diplomat warned that any peace deal struck between the United States and Russia — without Ukraine or the EU — will fail. 'Trump says that the killing should stop. Putin can stop the killing by stopping bombing Ukraine. This is doable if there is a will,' said Kaja Kallas, the EU high representative for foreign affairs and security policy. She added that any agreement without Ukraine at the table amounts to appeasement. Kallas’ comments reflected those of many NATO allies at Thursday’s meeting following U.S. President Donald Trump’s call with Putin and Trump's signaling that talks on Ukraine between the two were imminent. After Thursday’s NATO ministerial gathering, Hegseth travels to Poland for what the Pentagon said will be talks with leaders about 'bilateral defense cooperation, continued deterrence efforts along NATO's eastern flank and Poland's leadership as a model ally in defense investment and burden-sharing in NATO.'

Number of accused 'high-threat' migrants at Guantanamo Bay rising	WASHINGTON — The U.S. military is now housing about 68 detainees at its prison at Guantanamo Bay, Cuba, as part of an effort to assist the Department of Homeland Security with mass deportations. The commander of U.S. Southern Command, which oversees the U.S. naval base at Guantanamo Bay, shared the updated figure with lawmakers Wednesday, but said he could not yet provide details on how much it will cost to house the growing number of individuals. Admiral Alvin Holsey said those efforts include both the detention of individuals described by DHS officials as 'high-threat criminal aliens' and eventually holding up to 30,000 non-violent migrants slated for deportation. 'We're doing a phased approach,' Holsey told members of the Senate Armed Services Committee, adding that the base has the capacity now to hold about 2,500 non-violent migrants. 'We’re working with DHS to understand the flow of migrants,' he said. 'We’re not going to go to 30,000 unless we know that migrant flow will come. So, we're waiting at this point.' U.S. Transportation Command told VOA on Monday that there have been at least five flights of migrants to Guantanamo Bay, each aboard a C-17 or C-130 military cargo plane. Most of the flights, according to multiple officials, have carried between 10 and 15 detainees. Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem, who visited the prison facility last Friday and oversaw the transfer of the third flight of detainees to the detention center, has repeatedly described the men as 'murderers and vicious gang members' from Venezuela and as 'the worst of the worst.' In one social media post, Noem said that at least one of the migrants sent to Guantanamo Bay had confessed to murder, while others were wanted for attempted murder, assault, weapons trafficking and impersonation. One official, speaking to VOA on the condition of anonymity to discuss the deportation efforts, said that all of the individuals held at Guantanamo Bay have been issued final deportation orders. But DHS has not yet provided charging documents or other details regarding the crimes the detainees are accused of committing. On Wednesday, the American Civil Liberties Union, along with several immigration rights groups, filed a lawsuit against DHS, alleging the detainees being held at the Guantanamo Bay prison facility have been improperly denied access to lawyers. 'By hurrying immigrants off to a remote island cut off from lawyers, family, and the rest of the world, the Trump administration is sending its clearest signal yet that the rule of law means nothing to it,' according to a statement from ACLU lead attorney Lee Gelernt. 'It will now be up to the courts to reaffirm that the rule of law governs our nation,' he added. According to the ACLU and the other groups, one of the plaintiffs in the lawsuit, Eucaris Carolina Gomez Lugo, learned her brother had been sent to Guantanamo Bay only after seeing him in a photo. The group also said she was shocked to learn that the government was alleging he was a member of the Tren de Aragua Venezuelan street gang. DHS dismissed the lawsuit’s allegations. 'There is a system for phone utilization to reach lawyers,' said a senior Homeland Security official in a written statement shared with VOA. 'If the AMERICAN Civil Liberties Union cares more about highly dangerous criminal aliens including murderers & vicious gang members than they do about American citizens—they should change their name,' the official added, responding to the lawsuit only on the condition of anonymity.	https://www.voanews.com/a/number-of-accused-high-threat-migrants-at-guantanamo-bay-rising/7974147.html	2025-02-13T12:30:38-08:00

UN report: China expands forced labor in Xinjiang, Tibet	WASHINGTON — A newly released report from the United Nations’ International Labor Organization states that authorities in China are not only using 'vocational skills training and education centers' for forced labor in Xinjiang and Tibet, but also the large-scale transfer of 'surplus' rural workers to state-led labor programs across the country. China called the report 'baseless' and 'false.' Released Monday, the ILO report details how Chinese authorities have intensified efforts to investigate and monitor poverty levels, setting higher targets for cross-provincial labor transfers while pressuring ethnic smallholder farmers to cede their land to large state-led cooperatives. Framed as 'liberating' rural workers, the report said, this process has forced tens of thousands of Uyghurs, Tibetans and other ethnic minorities in Xinjiang and Tibet into industries such as solar panel production, battery manufacturing, seasonal agriculture and seafood processing under coercive conditions. The Xinjiang Uyghur Autonomous Region and the Tibet Autonomous Region are two of China’s five provincial-level autonomous regions. Both are located in the country's western regions. Two systems Adrian Zenz, a senior fellow in China studies at the Victims of Communism Memorial Foundation, described the report as 'very up to date' in its assessment of forced labor practices. 'The new report not only corrected previous conceptual errors [the 2022 version], but is very up to date in its assessment,' Zenz told VOA in an emailed response Wednesday. 'ILO attributed all forced labor in Xinjiang to the internment camps' in its previous report. Zenz noted that in February 2022, an ILO report cited observations by the International Trade Union Confederation, or ITUC, on forced labor in Xinjiang but inaccurately suggested that the region’s entire system of coercive labor was based solely on 'internment or ‘re-education’ camps,' or what Beijing calls vocational skills training and education centers, or VSTECs. The ILO’s latest report cites allegations from the ITUC regarding two major coercive labor systems operating in Xinjiang. The first involves the mass arbitrary detention of Uyghurs and other ethnic minorities in VSTECs, which have since transitioned to long-term imprisonment in regular prisons. Released detainees from the centers, according to the report, are often subjected to forced labor in industries such as textiles and electronics. The second system, as detailed by the report, involves the mass transfer of 'surplus' rural workers into state-led labor programs, moving them away from traditional livelihoods into industries such as solar panel production, battery manufacturing, seasonal agriculture and seafood processing. 'In recent years, based on an intensified campaign of investigating and monitoring the poverty status of millions of rural households, the authorities had raised targets leading to increased cross-provincial labor transfers,' the report states. 'At the same time, local authorities had ‘actively guided’ ethnic smallholder farmers to transfer their agricultural plots to large state-led cooperatives, thus ‘liberating’ ‘surplus’ rural workers for transfer into manufacturing or the service sector.' Coercive labor transfers in Tibet The ILO report also highlights concerns over government-mandated labor transfers of Tibetans. 'These policies would apply coercive methods such as military-style vocational training methods and the involvement of political cadres to have Tibetan nomads and farmers swap their traditional livelihoods for jobs providing measurable cash income in industries such as road construction, mining, or food processing, thereby diluting ‘the negative influence of religion,’' the report said. The ITUC estimates that labor transfers in Tibet have increased significantly, affecting as many as 630,000 workers in 2024. Incentives for local labor brokers and companies have contributed to this rise, reinforcing concerns that Tibetans are being forcibly removed from their ancestral lands and cultural traditions. International response In recent years, human rights organizations, government bodies and U.N. agencies have repeatedly called for accountability and transparency regarding labor conditions in Xinjiang and Tibet, urging countries and international companies to reassess their ties to supply chains linked to these regions. The United States has taken a strong stance against Uyghur forced labor with the Uyghur Forced Labor Prevention Act, which took effect in 2022. The law bans imports from Xinjiang unless companies can prove they were not made with forced labor, operating on a 'rebuttable presumption' that all goods from the region are tainted by forced labor. Additionally, the U.S. has imposed sanctions and export controls on Chinese entities linked to forced labor, reinforcing its commitment to human rights and ethical trade while pressuring Beijing to end coercive labor programs. While China has maintained that its policies are aimed at poverty alleviation and economic development, the ILO findings reinforce concerns that these initiatives are mechanisms of repression and control. The ILO Committee of Experts has formally requested China to provide detailed explanations and clarify the measures it has taken to address these allegations. The report concludes by urging Beijing to amend national and regional policies to ensure that ethnic and religious minorities are not subjected to forced labor under the guise of employment and deradicalization programs. China’s response Liu Pengyu, spokesperson at the Chinese Embassy in Washington, dismissed the ILO report as 'baseless' and labeled the information as 'false,' aimed at attempting to 'deceive the international community and disrupt the stable development' of Xinjiang and Tibet. 'Some forces keep spreading lies that there are 'forced labor' in Xinjiang and Xizang. The aim is only to smear China's image, denigrate the Chinese government's policies governing Xinjiang and Xizang [Chinese spelling of Tibet], interfere in China's internal affairs, and attempt to deceive the international community and disrupt the stable development of Xinjiang and Xizang,' Liu told VOA in an emailed response late Tuesday.	https://www.voanews.com/a/un-report-china-expands-forced-labor-in-xinjiang-tibet/7974064.html	2025-02-13T11:40:02-08:00
