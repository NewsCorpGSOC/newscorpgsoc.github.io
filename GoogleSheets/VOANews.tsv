Russia gave North Korea anti-air missiles in exchange for troops, Seoul says	SEOUL, SOUTH KOREA — Russia gave North Korea anti-air missiles in exchange for deploying troops to support Moscow's war in Ukraine, Seoul's top security adviser said Friday. The United States and South Korea have accused the nuclear-armed North of sending more than 10,000 soldiers to help Russia fight Ukraine, with experts saying Kim Jong Un was eager to gain advanced technology, and battle experience for his troops, in return. Asked what Seoul believes Pyongyang has received for the troops, top security advisor Shin Won-sik said: 'It has been identified that equipment and anti-aircraft missiles aimed at reinforcing Pyonyang's vulnerable air defense system have been delivered to North Korea.' Speaking to local broadcaster SBS, Shin added that North Korea has received 'various forms of economic support' and 'following the failure (launch) on May 27, North Korea has been working on satellite-related technology.' Experts have previously said that in return for the troops, North Korea was likely aiming to acquire military technology, ranging from surveillance satellites to submarines, as well as possible security guarantees from Moscow. North Korean leader Kim and Russian President Vladimir Putin signed a strategic partnership treaty in June, during the Kremlin chief's visit. It obligates both states to provide military assistance 'without delay' in the case of an attack on the other and to cooperate internationally to oppose Western sanctions. Putin hailed the deal as a 'breakthrough document.' Experts say Pyongyang could be using Ukraine as a means of realigning foreign policy. By sending soldiers, North Korea is positioning itself within the Russian war economy as a supplier of weapons, military support and labor -- potentially bypassing its traditional ally, neighbor and main trading partner, China, according to analysts. Russia can also provide North Korea access to its vast natural resources, such as oil and gas, they say. North Korean Foreign Minister Choe Son Hui recently visited Moscow and said her country would 'stand firmly by our Russian comrades until victory day.' She called Moscow's offensive against Ukraine a 'sacred struggle' and said Pyongyang believed in Putin's 'wise leadership.' North Korea and Russia are under rafts of UN sanctions -- Kim for his nuclear weapons program, and Moscow for the Ukraine war. When asked publicly about the deployment of North Korean troops last month, Putin deflected the question to criticize the West's support of Ukraine. North Korea said last month that any troop deployment to Russia would be 'an act conforming with the regulations of international law,' but stopped short of confirming that it had sent soldiers. North Korea's deployment of troops has led to a shift in tone from Seoul, which has resisted calls to send lethal weapons to Kyiv but recently indicated it might change its long-standing policy.	https://www.voanews.com/a/russia-gave-north-korea-anti-air-missiles-in-exchange-for-troops-seoul-says/7873098.html	2024-11-22T00:13:00-08:00	
Storm dumps record rain and heavy snow on Northern California	FORESTVILLE, CALIFORNIA — A major storm moving through Northern California on Thursday dropped heavy snow and record rain, flooding some areas, after killing two people and knocking out power to hundreds of thousands in the Pacific Northwest. Forecasters warned that the risk of flash flooding and rockslides would continue, and scores of flights were canceled at San Francisco's airport. In Washington, nearly 223,000 people — mostly in the Seattle area — remained without power as crews worked to clear streets of electrical lines, fallen branches and debris. Utility officials said the outages, which began Tuesday, could last into Saturday. Meanwhile on the East Coast, where rare wildfires have raged, New York and New Jersey welcomed much-needed rain that could ease the fire danger for the rest of the year. The National Weather Service extended a flood watch into Saturday for areas north of San Francisco as the region was inundated by this season's strongest atmospheric river — a long plume of moisture that forms over an ocean and flows through the sky over land. The system roared ashore Tuesday as a ' bomb cyclone,' which occurs when a cyclone intensifies rapidly. It unleashed fierce winds that toppled trees onto roads, vehicles and homes, killing at least two people in the Washington cities of Lynnwood and Bellevue. Communities in Washington opened warming centers offering free internet and device charging. Some medical clinics closed because of power outages. 'I’ve been here since the mid-’80s. I haven’t seen anything like this,' said Trish Bloor, who serves on the city of Issaquah’s Human Resources Commission, as she surveyed damaged homes. Up to 41 centimeters of rain was forecast in southwestern Oregon and California's northern counties through Friday. Santa Rosa saw 16.5 centimeters of rain in the last 24 hours, marking the wettest day on record since 1998, according to Joe Wegman, a meteorologist with the National Weather Service. The Sonoma County Airport, in the wine country north of San Francisco, got more than 28 centimeters within the last 48 hours. The Ukiah Municipal Airport recorded about 7.6 centimeters Wednesday, and the unincorporated town of Venado had about 32.3 centimeters in 48 hours. In nearby Forestville, one person was hurt when a tree fell on a house. Small landslides were reported across the North Bay, including one on State Route 281 on Wednesday that caused a car crash, according to Marc Chenard, a weather service meteorologist. Daniela Alvarado said calls to her and her father’s Sonoma County-based tree business have nearly tripled in the last few days, with people reaching out about trimming or removing trees. 'We feel sad, scared, but also ready for action,' Alvarado said. Rain slowed somewhat, but 'persistent heavy rain will enter the picture again by Friday morning,' the weather service's San Francisco office said on the social platform X. 'We are not done!' Dangerous flash flooding, rockslides and debris flows were possible, especially where hillsides were loosened by recent wildfires, officials warned. Scott Rowe, a hydrologist with the weather service in Sacramento, said that so far the ground has been able to absorb the rain in Butte and Tehama counties, where the Park Fire burned this summer. 'It’s not necessarily how much rain falls; it’s how fast the rain falls,' Rowe said. Santa Rosa Division Chief Fire Marshal Paul Lowenthal said 100 vehicles were stuck for hours in the parking lot of a hotel and medical center after being swamped by thigh-high waters from a flooded creek. A winter storm watch was in place for the northern Sierra Nevada above 1,070 meters, with 38 centimeters of snow possible over two days. Wind gusts could top 121 kph in mountain areas, forecasters said. Sugar Bowl Resort, north of Lake Tahoe near Donner Summit, picked up 30 centimeters of snow overnight, marketing manager Maggie Eshbaugh said Thursday. She said the resort will welcome skiers and boarders on Friday, the earliest opening date in 20 years, 'and then we’re going to get another whopping of another foot or so on Saturday, so this is fantastic.' Another popular resort, Palisades Tahoe, said it is also opening Friday, five days ahead of schedule. The storm already dumped more than 30 centimeters of snow along the Cascades in Oregon by Wednesday night, according to the weather service. More than a dozen schools closed in the Seattle area Wednesday, and some opted to extend the closures through Thursday. Covington Medical Center southeast of Seattle postponed elective surgeries and diverted ambulances after losing power and having to rely on generators Tuesday night into Wednesday, according to Scott Thompson, spokesperson for MultiCare Health System. Nearby, MultiCare clinics closed Wednesday and Thursday after losing power. In Enumclaw, also southeast of Seattle, residents were cleaning up after their town clocked the highest winds in the state Tuesday night: 119 kph. Ben Gibbard, lead singer of the indie rock bands Death Cab for Cutie and Postal Service, drove from his Seattle neighborhood Thursday morning to the woods of Tiger Mountain for his regular weekday run, but trees were blocking the trail. 'We didn’t get hit that hard in the city,' he said. 'I just didn’t assume it would be this kind of situation out here. Obviously you feel the most for people who had their homes partially destroyed by this.' Washington Gov. Jay Inslee thanked utility crews for toiling around the clock. It could take weeks to assess the scope of the damage and put a dollar figure on it, he said in a statement, and after that 'we’ll know whether we will be able to seek federal assistance.' In California, there were reports of nearly 13,000 power outages. Authorities limited vehicle traffic on part of northbound Interstate 5 between Redding and Yreka due to snow, according to California's Department of Transportation. Officials also shut down a 3.2-kilometer stretch of the scenic Avenue of the Giants, named for its towering coast redwoods, due to flooding. About 550 flights were delayed and dozens were canceled Thursday at San Francisco International Airport, according to tracking service FlightAware. Parched areas of the Northeast got a much-needed shot of precipitation, providing a bit of respite in a region plagued by wildfires and dwindling water supplies. More than 5 centimeters was expected by Saturday morning north of New York City, with snow mixed in at higher elevations. Weather service meteorologist Brian Ciemnecki in New York City, which this week saw its first drought warning in 22 years, said 'any rainfall is going to be significant' but the storm will not be enough to end the drought.	https://www.voanews.com/a/storm-dumps-record-rain-and-heavy-snow-on-northern-california/7873095.html	2024-11-21T23:56:52-08:00	
US agency votes to launch review, update undersea telecommunications cable rules	WASHINGTON — The Federal Communications Commission voted on Thursday to propose new rules governing undersea internet cables in the face of growing security concerns, as part of a review of regulations on the links that handle nearly all the world's online traffic. The FCC voted 5-0 on proposed updates to address the national security concerns over the global network of more than 400 subsea cables that handle more than 98% of international internet traffic. 'With the expansion of data centers, rise of cloud computing, and increasing bandwidth demands of new large language models, these facilities are poised to grow even more critical,' FCC Chair Jessica Rosenworcel said. Baltic nations said this week they are investigating whether the cutting of two fiber-optic undersea telecommunication cables in the Baltic Sea was sabotage. Rosenworcel noted that in 2023 Taiwan accused two Chinese vessels of cutting the only two cables that support internet access on the Matsu Islands and Houthi attacks in the Red Sea may have been responsible for the cutting of three cables providing internet service to Europe and Asia. 'While the details of these incidents remain in dispute, what is clear is that these facilities -- with locations that are openly published to prevent damage -- are becoming a target,' Rosenworcel said. The Chinese Embassy in Washington said 'turning undersea cables into a political and security issue severely disrupts international market rules, threatens global digital connectivity and cybersecurity, and denies other countries, especially developing countries, the right to develop their undersea cable industry.' The FCC is conducting its first major review since 2001 and proposing to bar foreign companies that have been denied telecommunications licenses on national security grounds from obtaining submarine cable landing licenses. It also proposes to bar the use of equipment or services in those undersea cable facilities from companies on an FCC list of companies deemed to pose threats to U.S national security including Huawei, ZTE 000063.SZ 601728.SS, China Telecom 0728.HK and China Mobile 600941.SS. FCC Commissioner Geoffrey Starks said the commission is considering whether to bar companies from getting undersea cable licenses that are on other lists like the Commerce Department's Consolidated Screening List. 'China has made no secret of its goal to control the market, and therefore the data that flows throughout the world,' Starks said. Last month, a bipartisan group of eight U.S. senators called on President Joe Biden to undertake 'a review of existing vulnerabilities to global undersea cable infrastructure, including the threat of sabotage by Russia and China.' The United States has for years expressed concerns about China’s role in handling network traffic and potential for espionage. Since 2020, U.S. regulators have been instrumental in the cancellation of four cables whose backers had wanted to link the United States with Hong Kong. In June, the FCC advanced a proposal to boost the security of information transmitted across the internet after government agencies said a Chinese carrier misrouted traffic.	https://www.voanews.com/a/us-agency-votes-to-launch-review-update-undersea-telecommunications-cable-rules/7873090.html	2024-11-21T23:28:52-08:00	
Kabul residents queue up for hours to collect water	Kabul residents are struggling with severe water shortages, often waiting hours at the Afghan capital’s dwindling wells for drinking water. The United Nations cautions that urbanization and climate change could deplete the city's groundwater within the next five to six years.

Feds outline 'necessary steps' for Colorado River agreement by 2026	LAS VEGAS — Federal water officials made public on Wednesday what they called 'necessary steps' for seven states and multiple tribes that use Colorado River water and hydropower to meet an August 2026 deadline for deciding how to manage the waterway in the future. 'Today, we show our collective work,' Bureau of Reclamation Commissioner Camille Calimlim Touton said as she outlined four proposals for action and one 'no action' alternative that she and Biden's government will leave for the incoming Trump Administration — with formal environmental assessments still to come and just 20 months to act. The announcement offered no recommendation or decision about how to divvy up water from the river, which provides electricity to millions of homes and businesses, irrigates vast stretches of desert farmland and reaches kitchen faucets in cities including Denver, Salt Lake City, Albuquerque, Las Vegas, Phoenix and Los Angeles. Instead it provided a bullet-point sample of elements from competing proposals submitted last March by three key river stakeholders: Upper Basin states Colorado, Utah, New Mexico and Wyoming, where most of the water originates; Lower Basin states California, Arizona and Nevada, which rely most on water captured by dams at lakes Powell and Mead; and more than two dozen Native American tribes with rights to river water. 'They're not going to take the any of the proposals,' said Sarah Porter, director of the Kyl Center for Water Policy at Arizona State University. 'The federal government put the components together in a different way ... and modeled them to provide near-maximum flexibility for negotiations to continue.' One alternative would have the government act to 'protect critical infrastructure' including dams and oversee how much river water is delivered, relying on existing agreements during periods when demand outstrips supply. 'But there would be no new delivery and storage mechanisms,' the announcement said. A second option would add delivery and storage for Lake Powell and Lake Mead, along with 'federal and non-federal storage' to boost system sustainability and flexibility 'through a new approach to distributing' water during shortages. The third, dubbed 'cooperative conservation,' cited a proposal from advocates aimed at managing and gauging water releases from Lake Powell amid 'shared contributions to sustain system integrity.' And a fourth, hybrid proposal includes parts of Upper and Lower Basin and Tribal Nations plans, the announcement said. It would add delivery and storage for Powell and Mead, encourage conservation and agreements for water use among customers and 'afford the Tribal and non-Tribal entities the same ability to use these mechanisms.' The 'no action' option does not meet the purpose of study but was included because it is required under the National Environmental Policy Act, the announcement said. In 2026, legal agreements that apportion the river will expire. That means that amid the effects of climate change and more than 20 years of drought, river stakeholders and the federal government have just months to agree what to do. 'We still have a pretty wide gap between us,' Tom Buschatzke, Arizona's main negotiator on the Colorado River, said in a conference call with reporters. He referred to positions of Upper Basin and Lower Basin states. Tribes including the Gila River Indian Community in Arizona have also been flexing their long-held water rights. Buschatzke said he saw 'some really positive elements' in the alternatives but needed time to review them in detail. 'I think anything that could be done to move things forward on a faster track is a good thing,' he said. Democratic U.S. Sen. John Hickenlooper of Colorado said in a statement the alternatives 'underscore how serious a situation we're facing on the Colorado River.' 'The only path forward is a collaborative, seven-state plan to solve the Colorado River crisis without taking this to court,' he said. 'Otherwise, we'll watch the river run dry while we sue each other.' Wednesday's announcement came two weeks after Democratic Vice President Kamala Harris lost the election to Republican former President Donald Trump, and two weeks ahead of a key meeting of the involved parties at Colorado River Water Users Association meetings in Las Vegas. Kyle Roerink, executive director of the Great Basin Water Network advocacy group, said 'snapshots' offered in the announcement 'underscore the uncertainty that is swirling around future river management as a new administration prepares to take office.' 'The river needs basin-wide curtailments, agreements to make tribes whole, a moratorium on new dams and diversions, commitments for endangered species and new thinking about outdated infrastructure,' he said. Buschatzke declined to speculate about whether Trump administration officials will pick up where Biden's leaves off. But Porter, at the Kyl Center, said the announcement 'shows an expectation of continuity.' 'The leadership is going to change, but there are a lot of people who have been working on this for a long time who will still be involved in the negotiations and modeling,' she said.	https://www.voanews.com/a/feds-outline-necessary-steps-for-colorado-river-agreement-by-2026/7873043.html	2024-11-21T19:50:17-08:00	
Democrat Casey concedes to Republican McCormick in Pennsylvania Senate contest	HARRISBURG, PENNSYLVANIA — Democratic Senator Bob Casey of Pennsylvania conceded his reelection bid to Republican David McCormick on Thursday, as a statewide recount showed no signs of closing the gap, and his campaign suffered repeated blows in court in its effort to get potentially favorable ballots counted. Casey's concession comes more than two weeks after Election Day, as a grindingly slow ballot-counting process became a spectacle of hourslong election board meetings, social media outrage, lawsuits and accusations that some county officials were openly flouting the law. Republicans had been claiming that Democrats were trying to steal McCormick's seat by counting 'illegal votes.' Casey's campaign had accused Republicans of trying to block enough votes to prevent him from pulling ahead and winning. In a statement, Casey said he had just called McCormick to congratulate him. 'As the first count of ballots is completed, Pennsylvanians can move forward with the knowledge that their voices were heard, whether their vote was the first to be counted or the last,' Casey said. The Associated Press called the race for McCormick on November 7, concluding that not enough ballots remained to be counted in areas Casey was winning for him to take the lead. As of Thursday, McCormick led by about 16,000 votes out of almost 7 million ballots counted. That was well within the 0.5% margin threshold to trigger an automatic statewide recount under Pennsylvania law. But no election official expected a recount to change more than a couple hundred votes or so, and Pennsylvania's highest court dealt Casey a blow when it refused entreaties to allow counties to count mail-in ballots that lacked a correct handwritten date on the return envelope. Republicans will have a 53-47 majority next year in the U.S. Senate.	https://www.voanews.com/a/democrat-casey-concedes-to-republican-mccormick-in-pennsylvania-senate-contest-/7873040.html	2024-11-21T19:31:19-08:00	
Dr. Oz nominated to oversee Medicare, Medicaid	WASHINGTON — Mehmet Oz, a renowned heart surgeon and television host best known for 'The Dr. Oz Show,' has been nominated by President-elect Donald Trump to serve as administrator of the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services, or CMS. If confirmed by the Senate, Oz will oversee two of the nation's most vital health insurance programs, which provide coverage for elderly and low-income Americans. Born in Cleveland, Ohio, in 1960, Oz is the son of Turkish immigrants — Dr. Mustafa Oz, a thoracic cardiovascular surgeon, and Suna Oz. Raised in Wilmington, Delaware, Oz graduated from Harvard University in 1982 with a degree in biology before earning joint medical and master of business administration degrees from the University of Pennsylvania School of Medicine and Penn's Wharton School in 1986. Oz built his medical career as a prominent cardiac surgeon in New York City, where he developed innovative medical devices and authored bestselling health books that have been translated into many languages, including Turkish. His rise to national fame began after he appeared as a regular guest on 'The Oprah Winfrey Show.' He launched 'The Dr. Oz Show' in 2009, which ran for 13 seasons, dealing with topics on health and wellness, and won nine Emmy Awards. Trump also noted Oz's multiple TV awards in a written statement after he nominated him for the CMS position, adding Oz 'taught millions of Americans how to make healthier lifestyle choices.' Meeting Trump In a statement in 2022 to The Associated Press, Oz said he first met Trump in 2004 or 2005, when he asked the future president for permission to use his golf course to organize an event for his children's charity. Although the two later met at social events, the most well-known public moment was during the 2016 presidential campaign when Oz interviewed Trump on his television show, in which Trump revealed his medical records. In 2018 — during his first term as president — Trump appointed Oz to the President's Council on Sports, Fitness and Nutrition. While praised for his ability to communicate complex medical issues, Oz faced criticism for promoting unproven health products and for alleged conflicts of interest in endorsing commercial products. The controversy peaked in 2014, when he was called to testify before a Senate subcommittee about his promotion of weight loss products with questionable scientific backing. While Oz has not been found to be involved in medical weight loss fraud, his remarks on his television program have been used in campaigns to market weight loss products and sell them online in many countries. Political aspirations Oz entered the political arena in late 2021 because of what he saw as a failure of the U.S. to manage the COVID-19 pandemic. He announced his candidacy for a U.S. Senate seat in the eastern state of Pennsylvania as a Republican. Despite receiving Trump's endorsement, his campaign was scrutinized over his dual U.S.-Turkish citizenship. Opponents, including President Joe Biden, also criticized Oz for running for a Senate seat in Pennsylvania when his longtime home was in New Jersey. Opponents have criticized Oz for showing a lack of loyalty to the U.S. after a photo of him voting in the 2018 Turkish presidential election was posted on the official Facebook account of the Turkish Consulate General in New York. Oz also starred in Turkish Airlines' multimillion-dollar Super Bowl commercial in 2018. As a brand ambassador in 2021, he appeared in a 4-minute, in-flight briefing video, featuring the airline's COVID-19 safety protocols. Oz has often said that he maintains dual U.S.-Turkish citizenship to care for his mother, who lives in Turkey and has Alzheimer's disease. He served in the Turkish army in the early 1980s to retain his Turkish citizenship. Sixty days of training was mandatory for citizens who reside in foreign countries. Facing such criticism when he ran for the U.S. Senate in 2022, Oz said he would renounce his Turkish citizenship if elected. He lost the race to Democrat John Fetterman. Despite retreating from the public eye after his Senate loss, Oz's nomination to lead the CMS marks a return to national prominence. If confirmed, he will oversee a $1.1 trillion budget and programs that provide health care to nearly half of the U.S. population. As the Senate considers his nomination, Oz faces the challenge of transitioning from media personality to federal administrator, taking on a pivotal role in shaping the future of American health care. Some information for this report came from The Associated Press.	https://www.voanews.com/a/dr-oz-nominated-to-oversee-medicare-medicaid/7873017.html	2024-11-21T18:53:05-08:00	
IAEA board orders Iran to cooperate more; West pushes Tehran toward talks	VIENNA — The United Nations atomic watchdog's 35-nation Board of Governors passed a resolution on Thursday again ordering Iran to urgently improve cooperation with the agency and requesting a 'comprehensive' report aimed at pressuring Iran into fresh nuclear talks. Britain, France, Germany and the United States, which proposed the resolution, dismissed as insufficient and insincere a last-minute Iranian move to cap its stock of uranium that is close to weapons-grade. Diplomats said Iran's move was conditional on scrapping the resolution. Iran tends to bristle at such resolutions and has said it would respond in kind to this one. After previous criticism at the International Atomic Energy Agency's Board, it has stepped up its nuclear activities and reduced IAEA oversight. China, Russia and Burkina Faso voted against the text, diplomats in the meeting said. Nineteen countries voted in favor and 12 abstained. Standoffs The IAEA and Iran have long been locked in standoffs on a range of issues, including Tehran's failure to explain uranium traces found at undeclared sites, its barring last year of most of the agency's top uranium-enrichment experts on the Iran inspection team, and its refusal to expand IAEA monitoring. The resolution seen by Reuters repeated wording from a November 2022 resolution that it was 'essential and urgent' for Iran to explain the uranium traces and let the IAEA take samples as necessary. The resolution in June of this year did the same. The new text asked the IAEA to issue 'a comprehensive and updated assessment on the possible presence or use of undeclared nuclear material in connection with past and present outstanding issues regarding Iran's nuclear program, including a full account of Iran's cooperation with the IAEA on these issues.' Western powers hope that report, due by spring 2025, will pressure Iran into negotiations on fresh restrictions on its nuclear activities, albeit less far-reaching ones than in a 2015 deal with major powers that unraveled after then-President Donald Trump withdrew the United States from it in 2018. With Trump set to return to office in January and Iran having taken its uranium enrichment far beyond the deal's limits, it is far from clear whether Trump would back negotiations aimed at setting new limits before those of the 2015 deal are lifted on 'termination day' in October of next year. If no new limits are agreed before then, the report could be used to strengthen the case for so-called 'snapback,' a process under the 2015 deal where the issue is sent to the U.N. Security Council and sanctions lifted under the deal can be re-imposed. Iranian reaction Last week IAEA chief Rafael Grossi visited Tehran, hoping to persuade new Iranian President Masoud Pezeshkian, who is seen as relatively moderate, to improve Iran's cooperation with the agency. Grossi formally reported to member states on Tuesday that 'the possibility of Iran not further expanding its stockpile of uranium enriched up to 60% U-235 was discussed' in his meetings with Iranian officials, and that the IAEA had verified Iran had 'begun implementation of preparatory measures.' Iran already has enough material enriched to that level — close to the roughly 90% purity that is weapons grade — for four nuclear weapons if enriched further, according to an IAEA yardstick. It has enough material enriched to lower levels for more bombs, but Iran denies seeking nuclear weapons. Grossi said on Wednesday he had asked Iran to cap that stock of 60% material and Iran had accepted his request. He said at a news conference that day that it was 'a concrete step in the right direction,' suggesting that he felt a resolution could undermine that progress. With the resolution passed, Iran is likely to respond. Moments after the vote, Iranian state media cited a joint statement by the foreign ministry and the Atomic Energy Organization of Iran saying Iran's nuclear chief Mohammad Eslami has issued orders for measures like activating various new and advanced centrifuges, machines that enrich uranium. 'If there is a resolution, it [Iran] will either increase its activities or reduce the agency's access,' a senior diplomat said before the vote.	https://www.voanews.com/a/iaea-board-orders-iran-to-cooperate-more-west-pushes-tehran-toward-talks/7872720.html	2024-11-21T16:35:58-08:00

New EU diplomat vows tough stance on China, strong alliance with US	VIENNA, AUSTRIA — Kaja Kallas, the European Union's next foreign policy chief, is already sending signals that she will take a tough stance on Russia and China and be an advocate for a strong alliance between Europe and America. Kallas spoke to the European Parliament for the first time in her new role at a hearing on November 12, where she stressed that the EU will be steadfast in its commitment to support Ukraine against Russian aggression. She begins her five-year term as the High Representative of the Union for Foreign Affairs and Security Policy on December 1. The former Estonian prime minister warned that Russia, Iran, North Korea and — more covertly — China want to change the rules-based world order. She called on the EU to respond to this threat alongside its closest allies and partners 'without losing an inch of who we are.' Elze Pinelyte, an expert at the European Economic and Social Committee (EESC) with a focus on Sino-EU relations, told VOA Mandarin that Kallas' policies 'remain firmly supporting Ukraine's victory.' In response to worries that the incoming Trump administration may reduce U.S. support for Ukraine, Kallas stressed that the United States' strategic interests in China are inseparable from the outcome of the war on Ukraine. 'If the U.S. is worried about China and other actors, they should also be worried about how we respond to Russia against Ukraine,' Kallas said during the November 12 hearing. Ivan U. Kłyszcz, a researcher at the Estonian International Defense and Security Center, told VOA Mandarin, that Kallas 'reflects the view that Europe needs to do more for its own defense and security, and this is not inconsistent with NATO and the European and American alliance.' As for whether the second Trump administration will change Brussels' considerations, he said, 'there are still too many unknowns.' Tougher policy toward China Kallas' tough stance toward China was first seen during her tenure as prime minister of Estonia, when her government advocated that Estonia's China policy should be promoted within the framework of EU-China relations. In 2022, Estonia announced its withdrawal from the Beijing-led 'Cooperation between China and Central and Eastern European Countries,' the so-called '16+1' mechanism. After the European Parliament elections this year, Kallas was nominated as the candidate for new foreign policy chief. She then resigned as prime minister of Estonia. Some experts say Kallas will take a tougher policy toward China than her predecessor Josep Borrell. Pinelyte agreed and added that Kallas likely will 'seek support to limit China's ability to fight Russia's war.' Since Russia's full-scale invasion of Ukraine in February 2022, the EU has condemned Beijing's support for Moscow. Kallas said that without China's support, 'Russia cannot maintain the war with the same intensity.' China should face 'a higher cost' for supporting Russia in the war against Ukraine, Kallas said, hinting at more deterrent sanctions. In October, Kallas wrote to the European Parliament that during her tenure as EU high representative on foreign policy, she would be committed to countering Russia's 'imperialist dream' and China's 'unfair competition.' A trade dispute between the EU and China over products such as electric vehicles has lasted for more than a year, and negotiations are still ongoing. The EU said China's large subsidies for electric vehicles constitute unfair competition. Unpredictable alliance It is not clear whether the Trump administration will continue to provide security guarantees and support to Ukraine, and whether it will impose higher tariffs on the European Union. Given the United States' greater focus on the Indo-Pacific region and its strategic competition with China, many European leaders are calling on the EU to reduce its security dependence on the United States. Pinelyte at EESC said 'Kallas seems to have taken office at a time when the idea of an alliance with the United States is outdated.' Abigael Vasselier, director of policy and European affairs at the German Mercator Institute for China Studies, told VOA that the EU needs to avoid the state of panic it fell into with the first Trump administration. Instead, she said, it must seek to coordinate with the second Trump administration, including 'making recommendations' on China issues. 'The EU needs to be prepared because the Trump and Biden administrations will have completely different approaches to China,' she said.	https://www.voanews.com/a/new-top-eu-diplomat-vows-tougher-stance-on-china-strong-alliance-with-us-/7872696.html	2024-11-21T15:34:05-08:00	
Heavy gunfire erupts in South Sudan's capital Juba	NAIROBI — Heavy gunfire erupted in South Sudan's capital Juba on Thursday evening after security forces moved to arrest the former head of the intelligence service, according to Reuters reporters and an alert sent to United Nations staff. The gunfire began about 7 p.m. local time (1700 GMT) and continued sporadically for more than an hour before dying down, Reuters reporters said. A U.N. safety alert to staff members in Juba, seen by Reuters, said the shooting was related to the arrest of the former head of the National Security Service, or NSS. It urged U.N. staff to shelter in place. In early October, President Salva Kiir dismissed Akol Koor Kuc, who had led the NSS since the country's independence from Sudan in 2011, and he appointed a close ally to replace him. Reached by telephone, a military spokesperson said he was trying to establish what was going on. Analysts said the sacking of Akol Koor reflected a power struggle at the highest levels of government. It came weeks after the transitional government that Kiir leads announced that elections expected in December would be postponed for a second time.	https://www.voanews.com/a/heavy-gunfire-erupts-in-south-sudan-s-capital-juba-/7872699.html	2024-11-21T15:18:14-08:00	
North Korea's troop deployment to Russia jeopardizes China's balancing act	Washington — Several of Beijing’s leading trading partners are urging Chinese President Xi Jinping to do more to pressure North Korea to stop or reverse its deployment of troops to Russia, where more than 10,000 North Korean soldiers have joined the front lines in the war against Ukraine. The appeals at the past week’s twin summits in Brazil and Peru reflect the awkward position in which the Chinese leader finds himself as he attempts a delicate balancing act between Russia and the West. At a joint press conference with Brazilian President Luis Inacio Lula da Silva in Brasilia on Thursday, Xi called for bringing together 'more voices of peace' in Ukraine. He pushed for a six-point consensus on Ukraine first put forward by China and Brazil in May that stresses dialogue and negotiations leading to a political settlement. Before his bilateral meeting in the Brazilian capital, Xi was told by world leaders on the sidelines of the G20 summit in Rio de Janeiro and the APEC summit in Lima, Peru, that Beijing needs to persuade North Korea to stop sending more troops to fight for Russia. German Chancellor Olaf Scholtz warned Xi on Tuesday at the G20 that the deployment of North Korea troops to fight against Ukraine amounted to an escalation of the war. South Korean President Yoon Suk Yeol asked Xi last week at APEC to play a 'constructive' role on North Korea’s deepening ties with Russia. Yoon used the global gatherings as an opportunity to consolidate the West’s condemnation of Pyongyang-Moscow military ties. U.S. President Joe Biden also told Xi at APEC that Beijing has influence and capacity to prevent the conflict in Ukraine from expanding through the presence of more North Korean troops, National Security Adviser Jake Sullivan said at a press briefing Sunday. Biden pointed out China’s position calling for the de-escalation of the conflict and said the presence of North Korean troops runs counter to that stance. Balancing act China has been reluctant to call out North Korean leader Kim Jong Un for providing troops and munitions to help Russian President Vladimir Putin’s war efforts. Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy warned Tuesday that North Korea could deploy up to 100,000 soldiers, and the U.S. estimates that about 11,000 North Korean troops have been mobilized in the Russian border region of Kursk. 'Beijing currently finds itself in a tricky situation,' said Patricia Kim, a fellow at Brookings Institution where she leads the Global China Project. 'It is uncomfortable with North Korea’s growing military cooperation with Russia that has extended into the Ukrainian battlefield. Putin is now indebted to Kim, and this may embolden Pyongyang to engage in risky behavior at home that can have blowback effects on China,' she told VOA. 'At the same time, Beijing believes it cannot afford to alienate Pyongyang or Moscow, especially as the potential for a U.S.-China confrontation grows with [President-elect Donald Trump’s] return to office,' she said. Despite the discomfort, it is unlikely that Xi will confront Moscow or Pyongyang about sending more North Korean troops, said Bonnie Glaser, managing director of the Indo-Pacific program at the German Marshall Fund of the United States. Glaser suggested that China is less concerned about the North Korean troops in Russia than about responses by the U.S., Japan and South Korea that could 'negatively impact Chinese interests.' Liu Pengyu, spokesperson for the Chinese Embassy in Washington, told VOA on Wednesday that China’s position on both Ukraine and the Korean Peninsula remains 'consistent,' and that Beijing has been 'making efforts toward de-escalation of the situation' in Ukraine. While being silent on North Korean troops, China is accused of providing dual-use goods that Russia needs to produce weapons. The European Union has also warned Beijing that the attack drones that Russia is producing in China’s Xinjiang Province would have consequences. China has been trying to support Russia’s war in Ukraine without angering the West out of concern over any economic backlash it could trigger — including trade restrictions and sanctions that could further cripple its struggling economy, analysts said. 'China is skilled at playing this role' of ambiguity, 'given its history of nonalignment, while knowing its economy relies on good trade relations with the U.S. and the EU,' said Joseph DeTrani, who served as the special envoy for six-party denuclearization talks that included North Korea and China, from 2003 to 2006. 'China appears reluctant to use its limited leverage with North Korea due, in part, to the tension in the U.S.-China relations,' he said. At the same time, DeTrani said, the Chinese president will not openly support Russia’s war for fear that would undermine his government’s credibility with the Global South, where Xi is trying 'to prove that China’s system of governance is far superior to the liberal democracy in the U.S.' In October, the U.S. sanctioned Chinese companies for directly helping Russia build long-range attack drones. In response, China’s Foreign Ministry urged the U.S. to stop using the Ukraine issue to 'smear or put pressure' on China. Aligned against US Richard Weitz, senior fellow and director at the Center for Political-Military Analysis at the Hudson Institute, said China views its partnership with Russia as more important than any differences it has over North Korea. China does not 'want to antagonize Russia' over North Korea,' he said. 'Despite their differences on particular issues,' including North Korea, 'they are fundamentally aligned globally against the U.S. and the Western order. So, they’re not going to let these specific differences over narrower issues interfere with that global alignment,' said Weitz. Chinese Foreign Minister Wang Yi said at a meeting with his Russian counterpart Sergey Lavrov on the sidelines of the G20 summit in Brazil on Monday that Beijing is ready to cooperate closely with Russia within the Shanghai Cooperation Organization, according to Russian news agency TASS. They also stressed the importance of strengthening foreign policy coordination between Moscow and Beijing at international venues, including the U.N., BRICS and the G20, the Russian Foreign Ministry said on Tuesday. 'By failing to condemn Russian aggression, China threw away any claim to neutrality,' said John Erath, senior policy director at the Center for Arms Control and Non-Proliferation. 'It is unlikely, however, that Beijing believes Russia-DPRK [North Korea] military cooperation to be in its interest. If China has objected to the partnership, it does not seem to have produced much of an effect on Putin or Kim,' said Erath.	https://www.voanews.com/a/north-korea-s-troop-deployment-to-russia-jeopardizes-china-s-balancing-act-/7872662.html	2024-11-21T15:11:19-08:00

Serbia arrests 12 in connection with railway station roof collapse	Twelve people have been arrested in connection with a roof collapse at a railway station earlier this month that killed at least 15 people in the city of Novi Sad, Serbian prosecutors said Thursday. Novi Sad’s Higher Prosecutor’s Office said the suspects, who were not identified, were arrested on suspicion of committing criminal acts against public safety. One suspect remains at large. If convicted, they face up to 12 years in prison. Fourteen people were killed on the day of the November 1 incident and three were injured, one of whom died Sunday. Former Novi Sad Mayor Borislav Novakovic said the arrests should have happened sooner. 'For the past 20 days, all suspects could influence witnesses, tamper with evidence and alter documentation,' he told The Associated Press. The deadly collapse sparked several rounds of protests, with demonstrators, joined by opposition leaders, taking to the streets with claims that government corruption and nepotism led to the roof’s shabby construction. Opposition politicians have called for prosecutors of organized crime to handle the case, according to AP. Other news outlets reported that ministers of transport, construction, infrastructure and trade, along with the head of state-run Serbian Railways, have resigned because of the incident. Goran Vesic, the former construction minister, was reported by Serbian media to be among those detained. Vesic, however, posted on the X social media platform that he reported to authorities voluntarily. The protesters who have clashed with police are calling for indictments in connection with the roof collapse and for the release of activists who were arrested in earlier demonstrations. Serbia’s populist president, Aleksandar Vucic, has characterized the activists as 'thugs and bullies,' and he has described the protests as 'terror' and 'brutal violence by certain political factors.' Some information for this report came from The Associated Press and Reuters.	https://www.voanews.com/a/serbia-arrests-12-in-connection-with-railway-station-roof-collapse-/7872638.html	2024-11-21T14:05:16-08:00	
Emboldened North Korea awaits second Trump administration	WASHINGTON — In his first message aimed at Washington since the U.S. presidential election, North Korean leader Kim Jong Un has expressed his unwavering determination to hold onto nuclear weapons, U.S. analysts say. At a conference with army officials last Friday, Kim vowed to bolster his country's nuclear capabilities 'without limit,' while condemning Washington for its nuclear deterrence strategies with Seoul. 'The U.S., Japan and South Korea will never get away from the responsibility as the culprits of destroying the peace and stability of the Korean peninsula and the region,' Kim said, according to the Korean Central News Agency. 'The most important and critical task for our armed forces is preparations for a war.' Nuclear rhetoric Evans Revere, former acting U.S. assistant secretary of state for East Asian and Pacific affairs, interpreted Kim's remarks, which were made 10 days after the election, as a message directed to President-elect Donald Trump, whom he met with face-to-face three times from 2018 to 2019. 'Kim Jong Un is making clear to President-elect Trump that everything has changed since their previous meetings,' Revere told VOA Korean via email Tuesday. 'Pyongyang has become a de facto nuclear weapons state and will not give up its treasured sword, as it once called its nuclear deterrent.' Nuclear talks between then-President Trump and North Korea's supreme leader collapsed during their Hanoi summit in February 2019, after Trump rejected the lifting of sanctions in exchange for Kim's offer to dismantle one major nuclear facility. Since then, Pyongyang has not slowed the ramp-up of its nuclear capabilities. In one of its latest moves, just five days before the U.S. election, the regime tested a new intercontinental ballistic missile called Hwasong-19 that could potentially reach most of the United States mainland. 'Having already developed a credible deterrent, complete with sophisticated medium- and long-range delivery systems, North Korea wants to be accepted, or at least acknowledged, as a nuclear power,' Revere said. Kim is trying to remind the incoming U.S. president that 'the door to denuclearization has now been firmly closed and he will be dealing with a DPRK that intends to keep its nuclear arsenal,' said Revere. DPRK stands for Democratic People's Republic of Korea, the official name of North Korea. Joseph DeTrani, former U.S. special envoy for six-party denuclearization talks with North Korea, said Kim would still want to meet with Trump, but the terms this time would be drastically different. 'I think Kim Jong Un is open to a dialogue with President-elect Trump's administration, once it is in place,' DeTrani told VOA Korean via email Tuesday. DeTrani said Kim would come to another potential summit with Trump 'from a position of strength,' given his alliance and defense treaty with Russia. Russia and North Korea have committed to coming to the aid of the other if attacked. Other experts cautioned, however, against reading too deeply into what Kim said. New alliance Sydney Seiler, former national intelligence officer for North Korea on the U.S. National Intelligence Council, said that Kim's latest remarks provide little insight into how Kim may handle the incoming Trump administration. 'Kim Jong Un is exploring the benefits available in being an active member of the axis of upheaval: states such as Russia, China, North Korea, and Iran who seek to overturn the existing rules-based order and justify using force to achieve their objectives,' Seiler told VOA Korean via email Tuesday. Seiler said that Kim has begun to enjoy benefits in his cooperation with Russia — cash, food and fuel aid, assistance with weapons of mass destruction, and conventional capabilities, and diplomatic recognition and acceptance of North Korea's nuclear status. 'Why would he reach out to Donald Trump when he has friends like Vladimir Putin?' he asked. In June, Kim and Russia's President Vladimir Putin signed a comprehensive strategic partnership treaty, which calls for Russia and North Korea to immediately assist each other militarily if either of them is attacked by a third country. Russia and North Korea respectively ratified the treaty into law earlier this month. Gary Samore, former White House coordinator for arms control and weapons of mass destruction, told VOA Korean via email Tuesday that Kim does not need Trump for assistance and sanctions relief as he used to because of his new alliance with Putin. Samore said another Trump-Kim meeting won't be very high on Trump's agenda. 'Trump's top foreign policy issues will be ending the wars in Ukraine and the Middle East and imposing tariffs on China,' he said. 'In contrast, the Korean situation is pretty stable and quiet, and nobody thinks another Trump-Kim summit will produce big results.' VOA Korean Service asked the U.S. State Department about Kim's latest message toward the U.S. but did not receive a reply by the time this article was published. In a response to an inquiry made by VOA Korean earlier this month, the State Department spokesperson reiterated the U.S. commitment to protect South Korea from any North Korean nuclear attack. 'President Biden reaffirmed the U.S. extended deterrence commitment to the ROK using the full range of U.S. defense capabilities, including nuclear, conventional, and missile defense capabilities, and that any nuclear attack by the DPRK against the ROK will be met with a swift, overwhelming and decisive response,' the spokesperson said.	https://www.voanews.com/a/emboldened-north-korea-awaits-second-trump-administration/7872606.html	2024-11-21T14:02:17-08:00

Who’s to blame for climate change: Fossil fuel producers or purchasers?	BAKU, AZERBAIJAN — The role of Azerbaijan as a growing exporter of fossil fuels has forced a debate at this month’s climate conference in Baku over which countries are most responsible for worsening climate change — the producers or the countries that buy and burn those fuels. Climate activists have cited a slew of new contracts signed by Azerbaijan’s state oil company in the past year, a development that President Ilham Aliyev has defended as a 'gift from God' and a realistic response to market demand. Oil and gas account for more than 90% of the southern Caucasus country’s exports, boosted by the discovery of the Shah Deniz gas field in the early 2000s, according to the International Energy Agency. The main buyers of its petroleum are Croatia, Germany, Israel, Italy, Portugal, Spain, Turkey and Ukraine, among others. After imposing sanctions on Russian gas in response to Moscow’s invasion of Ukraine, the European Union turned to other sources, including Azerbaijan. This prompted Baku to begin planning a major expansion of its oil and gas production, according to Ufuk Alparslan, regional lead for Turkey and the surrounding regions at energy research group Ember. 'Azerbaijan’s expectations are that the EU will have higher fossil fuel demand,' Alparslan told VOA. 'Their target market will always be the EU, especially after the Ukraine war.' Asked whether the buyer or the seller of fossil fuel should take the blame, Alparslan said both share the same responsibility. 'It’s not fair to blame the producers. There’s demand for it [fossil fuels]. … I think they should share the blame together,' he said. Myrto Tilianaki, senior advocate of environment and human rights at Human Rights Watch, said all countries should double down on their transition from fossil fuels to clean energy sources. Tilianaki said Azerbaijan has not set a good example as the host of this year’s U.N. climate change conference, COP29. 'As a COP president, you are meant to be galvanizing and gathering countries around higher [climate] ambitions for this COP,' Tilianaki told VOA. She said Baku’s stark support for fossil fuel expansion while calling for more ambitious climate goals is 'contradictory.' But Fadhel Kaboub, senior adviser with Kenya-based research group Power Shift Africa, told VOA it is 'hypocritical' to place the blame for rising carbon emissions on producers like Azerbaijan. 'The problem is the countries of Global North that caused climate change and exceeded their carbon budget by far. And they are in a situation where they owe climate debt they need to pay to the Global South,' he said. Azerbaijan has set a goal of reducing its greenhouse gas emissions by 40% from 1990 levels in the next 25 years, provided it receives international support. The country has several planned solar and wind projects that would generate 2 gigawatts of renewable energy. It is said to own 'considerable' potential to develop renewable energy from solar, wind, hydropower, biomass and geothermal resources. As the EU seeks to reduce its own demand for fossil fuels, Alparslan said Baku’s current strategy to boost oil and gas production might not be ideal. He said discussions on how to diversify its energy sources will be inevitable. 'The EU won’t be a good market in the future, and demand reduction will affect it. They are already at maximum capacity, and if they need to produce more, they have to develop more gas fields, which need financing,' he said. Other developing nations in the fossil fuel-rich region will also need to develop alternatives both for domestic use and export, Alparslan added. He cited the case of Uzbekistan, which exported more than $2 billion worth of gas in 2019 but has seen its production dry up and now is a net gas importer, according to local media reports. While it relies on gas from Russia and other countries for now, Uzbekistan has shifted its energy investment into developing renewable sources with an eye to future exports. President Shavkat Mirziyoyev said at the COP29 talks this month that he expects to sign a multilateral deal to that effect with the EU 'in the coming days.' Kaboub said developing nations with huge renewable potential like those in Africa have been denied manufacturing technology from the Global North due to perceived 'geopolitical risk.' 'It’s a question of power. The Global North is not interested in disrupting the colonial geopolitical hierarchy,' he argued. Climate finance to Africa reached $44 billion in 2021-2022, but more than one-third of that was in the form of loans to already debt-ridden nations, according to a report from the Climate Policy Initiative. Alparslan suggested that developing countries that are highly reliant on generating and exporting fossil fuels should begin their transition by seeking to boost regional cooperation and share renewable energy through improved grid connectivity. 'These projects can attract international and external funding,' he said. 'Green energy projects are more appealing than fossil fuel.'	https://www.voanews.com/a/who-s-to-blame-for-climate-change-fossil-fuel-producers-or-purchasers-/7872616.html	2024-11-21T13:37:12-08:00	
Journalist Pham Chi Dung marks 5 years in prison in Vietnam	Washington — Vietnamese journalist Pham Chi Dung marked a grim milestone this week: five years in a prison cell. The journalist, blogger and VOA contributor is now one-third of the way through a 15-year term after being convicted of 'propaganda against the state.' He was arrested for promoting media freedom, for cooperating with foreign media to deliver 'distorted information,' and for his criticism of the Communist Party’s control of the media. The journalist’s lawyers and supporters are pushing the international community to help free him. For Pham, life in Xuan Loc Prison, in Vietnam’s Dong Nai province, is tough. Prison authorities allow a one-hour visit every month, when visitors can bring in essential food items that have to be screened. And he is allowed an unannounced 10-minute home phone call every month, according to a family member who asked not to be named for fear of retaliation. Despite his situation, Pham remains resolute, the family member said. 'Maybe because the time spent in prison was quite long, his spirit seemed full of endurance and acceptance of fate as he is going to mark five years in jail, out of 15 years of the difficult and challenging journey that he has to go through,' the family member told VOA. Pham is experiencing health issues that are worsened by prison. He has insomnia, tinnitus and knee pain. The family asked for private medical care but prison authorities denied the request. Because he is classified as a political prisoner, Pham is restricted within the prison. 'Pham is not allowed to use common areas or write letters home. Any note he writes to family is screened by the prison authorities before being handed over to family during prison visits,' the relative said. Authorities in Ho Chi Minh City arrested Pham on Nov. 21, 2019, days after he sent a petition to the European Union urging it to postpone a signed but not-yet-ratified EU-Vietnam free trade agreement. The petition recommended the deal be delayed until Vietnam improves its press freedom and human rights records. Grace Bui, an American activist in Thailand who met Pham before his arrest, remembers the journalist as a 'nice, placid and calm man.' 'He was arrested just because he raised his voice over human rights violations and social issues,' Bui told VOA. Bui was in Geneva lobbying the EU over the trade deal when Pham was detained. At the time, Pham was already under a travel ban so the petition was the only way he could raise his concerns, Bui said. Bui said she believes the case against him is 'ridiculous.' 'Pham is a person who dares to stand up for press freedom and tell the truth. The government of Vietnam fears such a free press and they arrested him and his group members to shut down people’s voice and any independent outlets,' Bui said. Pham is the founder and president of the Independent Journalists Association of Vietnam, IJAVN. Established in July 2014, the group of independent bloggers, journalists and authors promotes a free press. Vietnam’s government has said that the organization is 'illegal' and that Pham’s role in it was one of the reasons for his arrest. Two other members of the IJAVN — Radio Free Asia contributor Nguyen Tuong Thuy and freelancer Le Huu Minh Tuan — are also serving 11 years each on anti-state charges. All three are accused of creating the IJAVN to 'fight and change the current political institutions of Vietnam.' Pham’s work with the association and his writing for foreign outlets including VOA were cited in the indictment. Pham also reported for independent websites including Dan Luan and Dan Lam Bao, covering economics, social stories, human rights violations, and government corruption. He promoted democracy, freedom of the press, political pluralism, the rule of law, and the development of an independent civil society. Vietnam's Ministry of Public Security has accused Pham of 'dangerous' anti-state actions, including 'fabricating, storing, and disseminating information, as well as other materials opposing the Vietnamese government.' State media said that he carried out 'anti-regime activities such as producing anti-state articles [and] cooperating with foreign media.' But others see the case as part of Vietnam’s control over media. 'There are three main reasons for Pham's arrest,' Annie Nguyen, a member of the IJAVN who is based in the Netherlands, told VOA. 'His articles touched many people and many walks of life, including the articles he wrote on VOA Vietnamese; he is the president of a journalist association, a professional association,' she said, and he 'wrote a letter to the EU to postpone the ratification of the EU-Vietnam Free Trade Agreement.' Vietnam’s National Assembly ratified the deal on June 8, 2020, following ratification by the European Parliament on Feb. 12, 2020. The deal entered into force in August 2020. Manh Dinh Dang, a lawyer who represented Pham before going into exile in the United States, said the journalist decided not to appeal his prison term 'because he wouldn’t believe in any positive change in his verdict.' 'The authorities did not allow any visit to Pham during his long investigation period. They only gave me limited time to counsel my client because the authorities claimed this was a national security case,' Manh said. Manh added that the journalist denied the charges and said he did not violate any laws. Vietnam has one of the worst records globally for jailing journalists. The country ranks 174th out of 180th on the World Press Freedom Index, where 1 signifies a good media environment.	https://www.voanews.com/a/journalist-pham-chi-dung-marks-5-years-in-prison-in-vietnam/7872558.html	2024-11-21T12:39:20-08:00	
Senegal's ruling party wins majority in parliament, paving way for reforms	DAKAR, Senegal — Senegal's ruling party, PASTEF, secured a resounding victory in the country's legislative elections, winning 130 of 165 seats, according to provisional results announced Thursday by the national vote counting commission. The win grants newly elected President Bassirou Diomaye Faye a clear mandate to carry out ambitious reforms promised during the campaign, which include fighting corruption, revamping the fishing industry and maximizing the country's natural resource benefits. The main opposition coalition led by former President Macky Sall won 16 seats. Sall congratulated PASTEF in a post on X on election day, and two other major opposition leaders conceded defeat hours after the polls closed on Sunday. The results will now have to be confirmed by the constitutional council, which is expected to do so in the coming week. Before Sunday's legislative election, PASTEF held 56 seats in the National Assembly while Sall's coalition had a slim majority of 83 seats. Faye, who was elected in March on an anti-establishment platform, said the lack of a majority had prevented him from executing reforms he pledged during his presidential campaign. In September, he dissolved the opposition-led parliament, paving the way for an early legislative election. Voting in the West African nation known for its stability was calm and peaceful despite an electoral campaign that was marked by sporadic clashes between rival groups of supporters. Observers from the international community, including the African Union and ECOWAS, praised the smooth voting process and the maturity of Senegalese democracy. Faye, 44, became Africa's youngest elected leader in March, less than two weeks after he was released from prison. The former tax inspector's rise has reflected widespread frustration among Senegal's youth with the country's direction — a common sentiment across Africa, which has the world's youngest population and a number of leaders accused of clinging to power for decades.	https://www.voanews.com/a/senegal-s-ruling-party-wins-majority-in-parliament-paving-way-for-reforms/7872565.html	2024-11-21T12:38:58-08:00	
Brazil indicts Bolsonaro, aides over alleged 2022 coup attempt	SAO PAULO, brazil — Brazil's federal police said Thursday that they had indicted former President Jair Bolsonaro and 36 other people for allegedly attempting a coup to keep him in office after his defeat in the 2022 elections. Police said their findings were being delivered Thursday to Brazil's Supreme Court, which must decide whether to refer them to Prosecutor-General Paulo Gonet, who will either formally charge Bolsonaro and put him on trial or toss the investigation. The former right-wing president has denied that he tried to stay in office after his narrow electoral defeat in 2022 to his rival, leftist President Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva. Bolsonaro has faced a series of legal threats since then. Police said in a brief statement that the Supreme Court had agreed to reveal the names of all 37 people who were indicted 'to avoid the dissemination of incorrect news.' The 700-page police document likely will take several days for the court to review, Supreme Court Justice Alexandre de Moraes said. The others indicted included General Walter Braga Netto, who was Bolsonaro's running mate in the 2022 campaign; former Army commander General Paulo Sergio Nogueira de Oliveira; Valdemar Costa Neto, the chairman of Bolsonaro's Liberal Party; and his veteran former adviser, General Augusto Heleno. The investigation started last year. On Tuesday, four military officers and a federal police officer were arrested as part of the same probe. They were accused of plotting to overthrow the government following the 2022 elections, including alleged plans to kill Lula and other top officials. Other investigations focus on Bolsonaro's potential roles in smuggling diamond jewelry into Brazil without properly declaring it, and in directing a subordinate to falsify his and others' COVID-19 vaccination statuses. Bolsonaro has denied any involvement in either. Another probe found that he had abused his authority to cast doubt on the country's voting system, and judges barred him from running again until 2030. The far-reaching investigations have weakened Bolsonaro's status as a leader of Brazil's right wing, said Carlos Melo, a political science professor at Insper University in Sao Paulo. 'Bolsonaro is already barred from running in the 2026 elections,' Melo told The Associated Press. 'And if he is convicted, he could also be jailed by then. To avoid being behind bars, he will have to convince Supreme Court justices that he has nothing to do with a plot that involves dozens of his aides. That's a very tall order.'	https://www.voanews.com/a/brazil-indicts-bolsonaro-aides-over-alleged-2022-coup-attempt/7872536.html	2024-11-21T12:22:14-08:00	
Russia’s use of advanced missile sends signal to West, analysts say	Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy condemned Russia's use of a fast, powerful new missile to attack the city of Dnipro on Thursday, calling it a 'nuclear adventure' and a stark escalation in the war. The attack has ignited fears of a dangerous new phase in the war. In a nationwide address, Russian President Vladimir Putin later confirmed the use of a medium-range ballistic missile in the strike. Zelenskyy pointed to the strike as a sign of Moscow’s broader strategy, stating, 'It is obvious that Putin is using Ukraine as a testing ground for weapons that threaten the world.' His remarks underscored the growing alarm in Kyiv over the deployment of advanced Russian missile systems against civilian targets. In his address, Putin framed the use of the nuclear-capable Oreshnik missile as a routine test within the conflict. 'The Russian Federation tested a medium-range ballistic missile, known as Oreshnik, during its operation in Ukraine,' he said. While he offered few technical details, analysts said the use of the missile and Putin’s acknowledgment appears intended to showcase Russia’s military capabilities to NATO and the United States. Putin’s announcement marks the first time Russia has openly acknowledged using such a missile during the war. In Washington, Deputy Pentagon Press Secretary Sabrina Singh said the missile used was based on Russia's RS 26 rubes intercontinental ballistic missile model.' In terms of notifications to the United States, the United States was pre notified briefly before the launch through Nuclear Risk Reduction channels,' she said. Strategic escalation Valeriy Chaly, Ukraine’s former ambassador to the U.S., described the attack as a 'new stage' in Russia’s aggression. Speaking to VOA, he emphasized that the strike was not just a challenge to Ukraine but also to its Western allies. 'This isn’t just about Ukraine,' Chaly said. 'It’s a challenge to the European security system and the United States. Moscow is signaling its readiness to escalate dramatically to influence the West.' He said that the response to the attack 'must be clear, united, and decisive — anything less risks emboldening Russia and jeopardizing global security.' Western leaders quickly condemned the strike. British Prime Minister Keir Starmer labeled it 'reckless and dangerous,' while EU foreign affairs spokesperson Peter Stano described it as a 'qualitative escalation' in Russia’s tactics. Dnipro attack The missile targeted industrial facilities in Dnipro, injuring two people and causing significant damage. Ukrainian officials initially suggested the use of an ICBM, or intercontinental ballistic missile, citing the weapon’s speed and trajectory. Some analysts, including those in the U.S., believed it was more likely a medium- or intermediate-range ballistic missile, consistent with Putin’s confirmation. Dnipro residents, accustomed to regular air-raid sirens and missile attacks, reported that this strike felt uniquely different. Oleksiy Poltorazky, a local resident, recounted: 'We’ve learned to recognize the sounds of different missile types. This one was different — it hit almost immediately after the siren. Many here believe it was a ballistic missile because there was no usual warning sound.' The speed and power of the strike left many shaken. Poltorazky, however, remained resolute. 'There’s no panic, no apocalypse as everyone says. We have to live through this, raise our kids, protect our families and work. We have to fight and do everything possible for our country,' he told VOA. George Barros, an expert on the Russia team at the Institute for the Study of War, told VOA that Ukrainians should try not to overreact to the attack. 'It seems that the Russians targeted the city with an R-26 IRBM,' Barros said, referring to a Soviet-era intermediate-range missile. 'The main thing is to not panic. There's no reason to think that Putin’s likelihood to use a nuclear weapon or a weapon of mass destruction is any higher than at other points in the war. 'This is not the first time that Russia has used nuclear-capable weapon systems against Ukraine,' he said. 'Russia regularly uses Iskander nuclear-capable weapons, and this appears to be a signaling effort designed to deter further Western support for Ukraine.' Strategic ambiguity While Putin confirmed the missile test, Kremlin spokesperson Dmitry Peskov and Russian Foreign Ministry spokesperson Maria Zakharova provided limited details about the strike. Zakharova was reportedly instructed not to address the attack at all during a Thursday press conference. The calculated reticence deepens global unease, as Moscow oscillates between overt warnings and veiled threats, said some analysts, suggesting the ambiguity is part of a broader strategy to keep Western nations uncertain about Russia’s next moves.	https://www.voanews.com/a/russia-s-use-of-advanced-missile-sends-signal-to-west-analysts-say/7872528.html	2024-11-21T12:21:39-08:00	
Malawi refugees receive first-ever insurance payout	BLANTYRE, MALAWI — Refugees at Malawi's only refugee camp, Dzaleka, have started receiving their first-ever insurance payouts to mitigate the impact of the El Nino weather pattern, which has destroyed their crops. The payouts, amounting to nearly $408,000 in total, were facilitated by the African Risk Capacity Group and KfW Development Bank, after the U.N. refugee agency office in Malawi leveraged the group's innovative Replica program. This program enables humanitarian actors to purchase insurance on behalf of countries to address climate-related disasters. Officials of the U.N. refugee agency, the UNHCR, say the beneficiaries will receive approximately $33 per household per month for three months to enhance food security. 'The payout that has come from this is targeting those that are taking part in agricultural activities and have suffered effects of El Nino or drought that came last year,' said Precious Mkoka, development officer for the UNHCR in Malawi. 'We have 4,000 households that are benefiting from this.' Some of the money will go to refugee communities, with the rest going to Malawians that are hosting them. In August, the Malawi government received an insurance payout of $11.2 million to support the country’s recovery from a devastating drought largely blamed on El Nino. The African Risk Capacity Group said the Replica program ensures that more people in need, including refugees, can be reached with critical assistance. Evaristo Sikasunda, country engagement manager at African Risk Capacity Group, said the aim 'is to help countries prepare and respond to adverse conditions like El Nino.' Some beneficiaries of the payouts say they will use the money to buy seeds. However, others say the payment is too little to compensate for crops they lost to the drought. The Dzaleka camp is home to refugees and asylum-seekers from Burundi, the Democratic Republic of Congo, Ethiopia, Rwanda and Somalia. The camp originally was intended to accommodate about 12,000 refugees, but is home to more than 50,000.	https://www.voanews.com/a/malawi-refugees-receive-first-ever-insurance-payout-/7872490.html	2024-11-21T12:11:55-08:00	
How beekeeping is helps communities cope with climate change in Kenya	The U.N. Environment Program says communities living in drylands are the most affected by global warming, with frequent droughts and subsequent floods rendering traditional livelihoods like farming and livestock keeping nearly impossible. Conservation experts in Kenya are helping such communities develop climate-resilient alternative livelihoods like beekeeping to help them cope with the changing weather patterns.

Gaetz withdraws name as Trump’s attorney general nominee	Former Republican Representative Matt Gaetz is withdrawing his name from consideration as U.S. President-elect Donald Trump’s attorney general. 'I had excellent meetings with Senators yesterday. I appreciate their thoughtful feedback – and the incredible support of so many. While the momentum was strong, it is clear that my confirmation was unfairly becoming a distraction to the critical work of the Trump/Vance Transition,' Gaetz wrote on social media platform X. The U.S. House of Representatives Ethics Committee failed Wednesday to reach agreement on whether to release findings from its nearly finished investigative report on Gaetz. The panel’s chair, Republican Representative Michael Guest, emerged from a lengthy committee meeting, saying, 'There was no agreement by the committee to release the report.' He declined further comment. Gaetz was accused of sexual misconduct and illicit drug use before he was picked by Trump to become the country’s top law enforcement official in the administration that takes office on January 20. ABC News and The Washington Post reported that the committee had obtained documents that showed Gaetz paid two women who appeared before the committee as witnesses a total of more than $10,000 between July 2017 and late January 2019. The women, who were over the age of 18 at the time of the payments, told the panel that some of the money was for sex. A Trump transition spokesperson defended Gaetz in a statement. 'The Justice Department received access to roughly every financial transaction Matt Gaetz ever undertook and came to the conclusion that he committed no crime. These leaks are meant to undermine the mandate from the people to reform the Justice Department,' with Gaetz at the head of the agency, the spokesperson said. Several U.S. senators, Democrats and Republicans alike, were demanding that the report be released so they could consider the scope of Gaetz’s background as they undertook their constitutionally mandated role of confirming or rejecting a new president’s Cabinet nominees. Hours after Trump named him as a nominee, Gaetz, 42, resigned from Congress, even though he had just been reelected to a fifth term. His resignation ended the House Ethics Committee’s investigation, which had been nearing a conclusion. Gaetz was in the Capitol on Wednesday to meet with some of the senators who would have voted on his nomination. The Senate has not voted to reject a presidential nominee for a Cabinet position since 1989, with members of both political parties giving wide deference to new presidents to fill top-level jobs with appointees of their choosing. Republican Senator Lindsey Graham said he met with Gaetz and Vice President-elect JD Vance, still a sitting senator, and told them there would be 'no rubber stamps, no lynch mobs' in the confirmation process. 'These allegations will be dealt with in committee, but [Gaetz] deserves a chance to confront his accusers,' Graham told reporters. The Justice Department investigated the allegations against him but last year declined to bring any charges. Gaetz, like other Trump nominees for top government jobs, has been a vocal supporter of the president and his Make America Great Again agenda. Gaetz, however, angered some fellow Republican lawmakers in the House in 2023 by spearheading the effort to oust then-House Speaker Kevin McCarthy.	https://www.voanews.com/a/gaetz-withdraws-name-as-trump-s-attorney-general-nominee/7872311.html	2024-11-21T10:09:57-08:00	
US imposes new sanctions on Russia's Gazprombank	The U.S. Treasury Department announced Thursday a new set of sanctions targeting Russia’s financial sector and its ability to fund its war with Ukraine, hitting Gazprombank as well as many other internationally connected financial institutions, entities and individuals. In a statement posted to its website, the Treasury Department’s Office of Foreign Assets Control said the sanctions designate Gazprombank — Russia's largest remaining unsanctioned bank — plus more than 50 other Russian banks, more than 40 Russian securities registrars and 15 Russian finance officials. The Treasury department said Gazprombank is a conduit for Russia to purchase military equipment for its war against Ukraine and the Russian government also uses the bank to pay its soldiers. Australia, Canada, New Zealand and Britain have previously sanctioned Gazprombank. The sanctions mean that all property and interests of the institutions, entities or individuals targeted by the sanctions are blocked. In the statement, U.S. Treasury Secretary said the sanctions 'will further diminish and degrade Russia’s war machine. This sweeping action will make it harder for the Kremlin to evade U.S. sanctions and fund and equip its military.' In a statement posted to the White House website, U.S. national security adviser Jake Sullivan said the new sanctions are part of a pledge made by President Joe Biden in September to provide additional assistance and actions to 'help Ukraine as it continues to resist Russia’s aggression.' The Biden administration is expected to step up assistance to Ukraine before the president leaves office. President-elect Donald Trump and leading Republicans have suggested they will reduce funding for Ukraine once Trump takes office on January 20.	https://www.voanews.com/a/us-imposes-new-sanctions-on-russia-s-gazprombank-/7872270.html	2024-11-21T09:52:50-08:00	
Jussie Smollett's conviction in 2019 attack on himself is overturned	SPRINGFIELD, Illinois — The Illinois Supreme Court on Thursday overturned actor Jussie Smollett's conviction on charges that he staged a racist and homophobic attack against himself in downtown Chicago in 2019 and lied to police. The state's highest court ruled that a special prosecutor should not have been allowed to intervene after the Cook County state's attorney initially dropped charges against Smollett in exchange for forfeiting his $10,000 bond and conducting community service. The ruling and the appeal did not address Smollett's continued claim of innocence. Smollett, who is Black and gay, claimed two men assaulted him, spouted racial and homophobic slurs and tossed a noose around his neck, leading to a massive search for suspects by Chicago police detectives and kicking up an international uproar. Smollett was on the television drama 'Empire,' which filmed in Chicago, and prosecutors alleged he staged the attack because he was unhappy with the studio's response to hate mail he received. 'We are aware that this case has generated significant public interest and that many people were dissatisfied with the resolution of the original case and believed it to be unjust,' Justice Elizabeth Rochford wrote in the 5-0 decision. 'Nevertheless, what would be more unjust than the resolution of any one criminal case would be a holding from this court that the state was not bound to honor agreements upon which people have detrimentally relied.' Smollett's attorneys have argued that the case was over when the Cook County State's Attorney Kim Foxx's office dropped an initial 16 counts of disorderly conduct. A grand jury restored charges after a special prosecutor took the case. A jury convicted Smollett of five counts of disorderly conduct in 2021. Emailed messages seeking comment were sent Thursday to Foxx's office and to Smollett's attorney, who have argued that Smollett has been victimized by a racist and politicized justice system. Testimony at his trial indicated Smollett paid $3,500 to two men whom he knew from 'Empire' to carry out the attack. Prosecutors said he told them what slurs to shout, and to yell that Smollett was in 'MAGA country,' an apparent reference to Donald Trump's presidential campaign slogan. Smollett testified that 'there was no hoax' and that he was the victim of a hate crime in his downtown Chicago neighborhood. He was sentenced to 150 days in jail — six of which he served before he was freed pending appeal — 30 months of probation and ordered to pay about $130,000 in restitution. A state appellate court ruling upheld Smollett's conviction, declaring that no one promised Smollett he wouldn't face a fresh prosecution after accepting the original deal. Illinois Supreme Court Chief Justice Mary Jane Theis and Justice Joy Cunningham took no part in Thursday's decision.	https://www.voanews.com/a/jussie-smollett-s-conviction-in-2019-attack-on-himself-is-overturned-/7872222.html	2024-11-21T09:19:21-08:00	
Burkina freezes assets of more than 100 people over 'financing of terrorism'	Abidjan, Ivory Coast — Military-led Burkina Faso has frozen the 'assets and resources' of more than 100 people, including ex-president Paul-Henri Sandaogo Damiba, and two jihadist groups over the 'financing of terrorism,' according to a decree sent to AFP Thursday. The decision affects 113 individuals and two 'terrorist organisations' — the Group for the Support of Islam and Muslims (JNIM) and Islamic State in the Greater Sahara (ISGS) — according to the document, dated Tuesday and signed by Finance Minister Aboubacar Nacanabo. Former president Lieutenant-Colonel Damiba, who is currently in exile in Togo, was among the individuals cited. Damiba was ousted after seizing power in a January 2022 coup against elected president Roch Marc Christian Kabore. Little more than eight months later, Damiba himself was overthrown by 34-year-old Captain Ibrahim Traore, who now heads the Sahel nation's regime. Damiba was expelled from the military at the end of October along with around 15 officers, for alleged acts of disclosing 'intelligence with a foreign power' and 'terrorist groups aimed at destabilising Burkina Faso.' The regime also froze the assets of the late former Burkinabe special forces commander Ahmed Kinda, whom the authorities previously described as the 'head' of 'destabilisation operations' allegedly involving expelled officers. Former intelligence services second-in-command Commander Sekou Ouedraogo, as well as exiled former ministers General Djibril Bassole, and Alpha Barry, who founded the press group Omega Media, were also named in the ministerial order. Dozens of others — all Burkinabe nationals — including some currently serving prison sentences also had their finances seized over accusations of 'terrorist criminal conspiracy,' 'terrorist murders' and 'illegal possession of firearms.' Burkina Faso also banned the 113 individuals from traveling while their assets and economic resources remain frozen, the minister wrote. Since 2015, violence attributed to armed groups affiliated with al-Qaida and the Islamic State group has claimed more than 26,000 lives in Burkina Faso, including more than 13,500 since the September 2022 coup. More than two million people have also been forced to flee their homes inside the country.	https://www.voanews.com/a/burkina-freezes-assets-of-more-than-100-people-over-financing-of-terrorism-/7872143.html	2024-11-21T08:20:33-08:00	
X's former policy chief takes job with Elon Musk rival Sam Altman	NEW YORK — Nick Pickles, the former head of global affairs at Elon Musk's social media platform X, is joining forces with one of Musk's rivals, his fellow OpenAI co-founder Sam Altman. Pickles, who resigned from X in September, told Reuters on Wednesday that he will serve as chief policy officer for Altman's Tools for Humanity, the company building the technology to support World Network, formerly known as Worldcoin. Pickles' old boss, Musk, and his new boss, Altman, founded ChatGPT creator OpenAI in 2015 but have since fallen out in a messy legal dispute. World Network, which has faced scrutiny over its data collection, is ramping up efforts to scan people's irises, using its 'orb' devices, to create World ID. The ID will serve as a digital passport to prove, in the online realm, that its holder is an actual human being as opposed to an AI bot. Pickles told Reuters that AI is 'on the cusp' of overtaking traditional online defenses to determine whether a user is a real person, such as Captcha puzzles. Once AI can blow through those barriers, trust on the Web will further disintegrate. 'It's imminent,' said Pickles. 'Throughout my time at X and at Twitter, one of the consistent issues that kept coming up is, 'Is this a real account or a bot?'' He added: 'I saw every day how this issue is going to be central to the future of online interaction.' During his 10 years at X, formerly known as Twitter, Pickles served most recently as the company's top ambassador to heads of state across the globe. In that capacity, he worked closely with policymakers and regulators to shape regulatory proposals, negotiate compliance and represent the company in global forums. He received a promotion at X in July. One month later, billionaire Musk sued OpenAI and Altman for allegedly violating contract provisions that would have put the public good ahead of profits. Pickles declined to comment on the litigation. Pickles said he was optimistic about the new regulatory framework likely to be ushered in by the administration of President-elect Donald Trump. His priority, he said, is hiring a lobbyist in Washington.	https://www.voanews.com/a/x-s-former-policy-chief-takes-job-with-elon-musk-rival-sam-altman/7872113.html	2024-11-21T08:07:19-08:00	
Gunmen massacre dozens of passengers in Pakistan	ISLAMABAD — Authorities in Pakistan reported Thursday that 'terrorists' sprayed multiple passenger vehicles with bullets in a turbulent northwestern district, killing at least 45 people and injuring 20 others. Pakistani Interior Minister Mohsin Naqvi confirmed to reporters the casualties from the attack in Kurram, which borders Afghanistan. District police and hospital officials reported that among the dead were security personnel, women and children, and that they expect the death toll to rise. They also stated that the police had launched an operation in the area to track down the assailants. No group immediately took responsibility for the massacre in a Pakistani district known for sectarian violence between heavily armed Shiite and Sunni Muslim tribes. Officials in Kurram blame a land dispute for the latest round of sectarian tensions, which led to weeks of armed clashes and killed more than 100 people between August and October. The fighting compelled authorities in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa province, where Kurram is situated, to halt all traffic to and from the district until earlier this month, when tribal leaders brokered a temporary cease-fire between the opposing factions. Thursday's violence occurred amid a series of militant attacks in several border districts of the province over the past week, resulting in the deaths of at least 20 Pakistani soldiers. More than 60 Pakistani security personnel have been killed by militant attacks nationwide this month alone, according to official data. The Tehrik-i-Taliban Pakistan, commonly called TTP, has been blamed or claimed responsibility for much of the violence in recent years. The militant outfit is listed as a global terrorist organization by the United Nations, and Islamabad says TTP is orchestrating terrorism against the country from Afghan 'sanctuaries.' Pakistani Foreign Ministry spokesperson Mumtaz Baloch reiterated Thursday her government’s long-running complaints, again emphasizing the urgency for Taliban authorities in Afghanistan to act against 'terror groups' operating on their territory. 'We have, on several occasions, shared concrete evidence with the Afghan authorities with regards to these terror groups and their operations in Afghanistan, and their continued threat to the security of Pakistan,' Baloch said at her weekly news conference in Islamabad. 'We hope that the Afghan authorities will consider terrorism to be a serious threat, not just to the region, but also to their own security, and fulfill their obligations under various international agreements,' she said. Taliban leaders deny they harbor terrorist groups, including TTP, or allow anyone to threaten neighboring countries from Afghan soil.	https://www.voanews.com/a/gunmen-massacre-dozens-of-passengers-in-pakistan/7872050.html	2024-11-21T07:25:36-08:00	
Kenya cancels airport and energy deals with Adani group after US indicts tycoon	Nairobi, Kenya — Kenya's president said Thursday he has cancelled multimillion-dollar airport expansion and energy deals with Indian tycoon Gautam Adani after U.S. bribery and fraud indictments against one of Asia's richest men. President William Ruto in a state of the nation address said the decision was made 'based on new information provided by our investigative agencies and partner nations.' He didn't specify the United States. The Adani group had been in the process of signing an agreement that would modernize Kenya's main airport in the capital, Nairobi, with an additional runway and terminal constructed, in exchange for the group running the airport for 30 years. The widely criticized deal had sparked anti-Adani protests in Kenya and a strike by airport workers, who said it would lead to degraded working conditions and job losses in some cases. The Adani group had also been awarded a deal to construct power transmission lines in Kenya, East Africa's business hub. Also Thursday, Energy Minister Opiyo Wandayi told a parliamentary committee there had been no bribery or corruption involved on Kenya's part in signing that deal. U.S. prosecutors indicted Adani this week on charges he duped investors in a massive solar energy project in India by concealing that it was facilitated by an alleged bribery scheme. He was charged with securities fraud and conspiracy to commit securities and wire fraud.	https://www.voanews.com/a/kenya-cancels-airport-and-energy-deals-with-adani-group-after-us-indicts-tycoon/7872025.html	2024-11-21T06:53:35-08:00	
Southeast Asian defense chiefs talk regional security with US, China, others	VIENTIANE, LAOS — Southeast Asian defense chiefs met Thursday with their counterparts from China, the United States and other nations in Laos for security talks, which come as Beijing's increasingly assertive stance in its claim to most of the South China Sea is leading to more confrontations. The closed-door talks put U.S. Secretary of Defense Lloyd Austin and Chinese Defense Minister Dong Jun in the same room, a day after Dong refused a request to meet with Austin one-on-one on the sidelines of the ASEAN summit of defense ministers. The U.S. and China have been working to improve frayed military-to-military communications, and Austin said he regretted Dong's decision, calling it 'a setback for the whole region.' A Chinese statement indicated that Beijing was unhappy with U.S. actions related to Taiwan, the self-governing island that China claims. The U.S. recently approved $2 billion in arms sales to Taiwan, including an advanced surface-to-air missile defense system. 'The U.S. side cannot undermine China's core interests on the Taiwan issue while conducting exchanges with the Chinese military as if nothing had happened,' Defense Ministry spokesperson Wu Qian said in a statement posted online Thursday. The ASEAN meetings come as member nations are looking warily toward the change in American administrations at a time of increasing maritime disputes with China. The U.S. has firmly pushed a 'free and open Indo-Pacific' policy under outgoing President Joe Biden, and it is not yet clear how the incoming administration of President-elect Donald Trump will address the South China Sea situation. Dong called for resolving issues through dialogue and not provoking disputes or introducing external forces, China's official Xinhua News Agency reported. South China Sea Beijing believes that U.S. backing has emboldened the Philippines to act more assertively in its South China Sea disputes with China. Other nations attending the ASEAN meeting from outside Southeast Asia include Japan, South Korea, India, Russia, Australia and New Zealand. The meetings with the ASEAN dialogue partners were also expected to address tensions in the Korean Peninsula, the Russia-Ukraine war and wars in the Middle East. Before heading to Laos, Austin concluded meetings in Australia with officials there and with Japan's defense minister. They pledged to support ASEAN and expressed their 'serious concern about destabilizing actions in the East and South China Seas, including dangerous conduct by the People's Republic of China against Philippines and other coastal state vessels.' Along with the Philippines, ASEAN members Vietnam, Malaysia and Brunei have competing claims with China in the South China Sea, which Beijing claims almost entirely as its own territory. Indonesia, Thailand, Singapore, Myanmar, Cambodia and Laos are the other members of ASEAN, which stands for Association of Southeast Asian Nations. As China has grown more assertive in pushing its territorial claims in recent years, it and ASEAN have been negotiating a code of conduct to govern behavior in the sea. Progress has been slow. Officials have agreed to try to complete the code by 2026, but talks have been hampered by thorny issues, including disagreements over whether the pact should be binding. Chinese and Philippine vessels have clashed repeatedly this year, and Vietnam in October charged that Chinese forces assaulted its fishermen in disputed areas in the South China Sea. China has also sent patrol vessels to areas that Indonesia and Malaysia claim as their exclusive economic zones. Myanmar crisis Another thorny regional issue is the civil war and humanitarian crisis in ASEAN member Myanmar. The group's credibility has been severely tested by the war in Myanmar, where the army ousted an elected government in 2021 and fighting has continued with pro-democracy guerillas and ethnic rebels. More than a year into an offensive initiated by three militias and joined by other resistance groups, observers estimate the military controls less than half the country. Myanmar military rulers have been barred from ASEAN meetings since late 2021, but this year the country has been represented by high-level bureaucrats, including at the summit in October. At the defense meetings, the country is represented by Zaw Naing Win, director of the Defense Ministry's International Affairs Department.	https://www.voanews.com/a/southeast-asian-defense-chiefs-talk-regional-security-with-us-china-others/7872007.html	2024-11-21T06:46:43-08:00	
ICC issues war crimes arrest warrants for Netanyahu, Gallant	The International Criminal Court issued arrest warrants Thursday for Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and former defense minister Yoav Gallant for alleged war crimes and crimes against humanity in Israel’s war against Hamas militants in Gaza. In a statement on its website, the ICC said the warrants charge each man with the war crime of starvation as a method of warfare, along with crimes against humanity including murder, persecution and other inhumane acts. The warrants cover acts committed from 'at least 8 October 2023 until at least 20 May 2024, the day the Prosecution filed the applications for warrants of arrest.' Israel is not a member of the ICC, and Netanyahu and Gallant do not face any immediate risk of prosecution. But the threat of arrest could create issues if either man travels abroad. Netanyahu condemned the ICC arrest warrant. A statement from his office Thursday said Israel 'rejects with disgust the absurd and false actions.' The court also issued an arrest warrant for Hamas military chief Muhammad Deif for crimes against humanity, including murder, hostage taking and sexual violence. Those charges are drawn from Hamas’ October 7, 2023 attack on Israel that killed some 1,200 people, including 46 U.S. citizens. Hamas also took roughly 250 hostages. Following the attack, Israel began a campaign to eliminate Hamas in Gaza that has killed about 44,000 people, according to the Gaza health ministry. The ministry does not distinguish between civilians and combatants in its count but says more than half of those killed were women and children. When the original charges were brought to the court in May by ICC chief prosecutor Karim Khan, Netanyahu issued a statement calling them 'a moral outrage of historic proportions. It will cast an everlasting mark of shame on the international court.' Netanyahu maintained that 'Israel is waging a just war against Hamas,' and the 'absurd' charges against him and Gallant 'are merely an attempt to deny Israel the basic right of self-defense.' Netanyahu fired Gallant earlier this month, saying the trust between the two men had evaporated over the course of Israel’s war on Gaza. Hamas has been designated a terrorist group by the United States, Britain. and other Western countries.	https://www.voanews.com/a/icc-issues-war-crimes-arrest-warrants-for-netanyahu-gallant/7871959.html	2024-11-21T06:14:48-08:00	
Finnish police arrest 5 suspects over separatist violence in Nigeria	HELSINKI — Police in Finland said Thursday they had detained five suspects in connection with deadly violence in southeastern Nigeria and were seeking a court extension of the detentions. The police did not identify the suspects, only saying that a dual Finnish-Nigerian citizen, born in the 1980s, was under criminal investigation. However, Simon Ekpa, a Nigerian linked to the Biafran separatist movement, lives in Lahti, where the Paijat-Hame District Court will consider a request from the Finnish National Bureau of Investigation to keep the suspects in custody. Ekpa is one of the leaders of the Indigenous People of Biafra separatist group that is demanding the creation of an independent Biafra state from the troubled southeast region of Nigeria. 'The police suspect that the man [under investigation] has furthered his efforts from Finland in such a way that has resulted in violence against civilians and public authorities and in other crimes in South-East Nigeria,' Detective Chief Inspector Otto Hiltunen said in a statement. The suspect 'carried out this activity by campaigning, for example, on his social media channels,' Hiltunen said. The secessionist campaign in southeastern Nigeria dates to the 1960s when the short-lived Republic of Biafra fought and lost a civil war from 1967 to 1970 to become independent from the West African country. An estimated 1 million people died in the conflict, many from starvation. Nigerian authorities have accused Ekpa of using social media to instigate violence by his followers in Nigeria, many of them young people. Police in Finland said the investigation involves international cooperation. Nigerian authorities have been contacted for comment. For many years Nigeria, Africa's most populous nation, with at least 210 million people, has been wracked by violence related to the activities of armed extremist groups. Most recently, social protests were held over a worsening cost-of-living crisis and alleged bad governance.	https://www.voanews.com/a/finnish-police-arrest-5-suspects-over-separatist-violence-in-nigeria/7871953.html	2024-11-21T06:12:02-08:00	
US envoy to meet Netanyahu in push for ceasefire with Hezbollah	A U.S. envoy was expected to meet with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu Thursday amid a push to secure a cease-fire in Israel’s war with the Lebanon-based militant group Hezbollah. Envoy Amos Hochstein reported progress in what he described as constructive talks this week with Lebanese officials, including Parliament Speaker Nabih Berri, a Hezbollah ally mediating for the militants. Israeli forces continued their military campaign that Netanyahu says is aimed at pushing Hezbollah back from border areas in southern Lebanon where the militants could pose a threat to northern Israel. Israel’s military issued new evacuation orders in southern Lebanon, in Beirut’s southern suburbs and in the Tyre area. Such calls for people to flee have frequently been followed by Israeli strikes that the military says target Hezbollah fighters. Israel has used the same tactic in the Gaza Strip in its fight against Hamas militants, while critics of the strategy say people often have no safe place to go and are given short notice to leave. 'They are trapped with no safe place to go,' Philippe Lazzarini, head of the United Nations agency for Palestinian refugees, said Thursday. 'In northern Gaza, people remain under a tight siege. They run for their lives in vicious circles and have been deprived of humanitarian aid for more than 40 days now.' Cease-fire resolution The United States blocked a U.N. Security Council resolution Wednesday, demanding a permanent cease-fire in Gaza and the release of Israeli hostages, saying the proposed language would have sent the wrong message to Hamas. 'The United States worked for weeks in good faith to avoid this outcome,' U.S. Deputy U.N. Ambassador Robert Wood said after the vote. 'We made clear throughout negotiations, we could not support an unconditional cease-fire that failed to release the hostages, because, as this council has previously called for, a durable end to the war must come with the release of the hostages. These two urgent goals are inextricably linked.' The U.S. veto was its fourth on Gaza since the war between Israel and Hamas started 14 months ago. The failed resolution 'demands an immediate, unconditional and permanent ceasefire to be respected by all parties; and further reiterates its demand for the immediate and unconditional release of all hostages.' The text was drafted and put forward by the 10 elected members of the Security Council, which have expressed growing frustration over the past months at the council’s inability to take decisive action to end the war and free the hostages held by Hamas. Wood said the proposed resolution 'would have sent a dangerous message to Hamas: there's no need to come back to the negotiating table.' 'This resolution is trying to restore life, to save lives. It's not a dangerous message,' the Palestinian deputy ambassador Majed Bamya told the council. 'The draft resolution is not a dangerous message. This veto is a dangerous message to Israel that it can continue executing its plans — the very plans you oppose — and the messages we send do matter, and that is the wrong message at the worst possible time. Israel is responsible for the Palestinian civilians it kills. It cannot be absolved of that responsibility.' The Palestinian envoy said that while the proposed cease-fire would not solve everything, it would be a first step and vetoing it is unjustifiable when atrocities are taking place. 'I truly do not understand, you're saying we cannot be for an unconditional cease-fire,' Bamya said, emotion rising in his voice. 'What that means, in effect now, is that we are for a war. You're saying we cannot be for an unconditional cease-fire that does not release the hostages. Is this war releasing the hostages? Is it? Is it even trying to release the hostages?' Israel’s ambassador said the proposed text would have sent the message that terrorists can act with impunity. 'The resolution brought before this chamber was not a path to peace, it was a road map to more terror, more suffering and more bloodshed,' Danny Danon said. 'Many of you attempted to pass this injustice. We thank the United States for exercising its veto, for standing on the side of morality and justice, for refusing to abandon the hostages and their families.' Council members expressed their disappointment that the resolution was not adopted, and Algeria, which represents the Arab group of nations on the 15-nation Security Council said it would return soon with an even stronger resolution. 'This war represents everything the U.N. Charter stands against. We regret the veto was cast,' said Slovenia’s deputy ambassador Ondina Blokar Drobic. 'Our collective efforts to end the hostilities will not stop,' Guyana’s Ambassador Carolyn Birkett, who led the elected members effort, told reporters after the vote, flanked by her colleagues. 'Once more, the E10 [elected 10 members] is underscoring to the international community, and more importantly to the hundreds of thousands of innocent civilians who continue to bear the cost of these hostilities, including those still held hostage and their loved ones, that we are deeply conscious that the Security Council bears the primary responsibility for the maintenance of international peace and security,' she said. She said they would continue to try to facilitate council unity, adding 'too many lives have already been lost.' 'It is shameful that the United States has once again used the veto to block consensus on a life-saving cease-fire, while they continue to approve deadly arms transfers to fuel the violence and humanitarian catastrophe,' Brenda Moyfa, head of Oxfam’s New York office said in a statement. Hezbollah began its campaign after its ally Hamas launched its October 7, 2023, terror attack on Israel. About 1,200 Israelis were killed, and 250 were taken hostage. About 100 of the hostages have yet to be released, although a third of them are believed to be dead. Following the attack, Israel began a campaign to eliminate Hamas in Gaza that has killed about 44,000 people, according to the Gaza health ministry. Since the fighting with Hezbollah began, more than 3,500 people in Lebanon have been killed, according to authorities. Most of the fatalities have occurred since late September. Hamas and Hezbollah have been designated as terror groups by the United States, the U.K. and other Western countries. VOA United Nations Correspondent Margaret Besheer contributed to this report.

Ukrainian opinion survey tracks fluctuating opinion on quick end to war	Washington — A new survey of public opinion in Ukraine indicates that for the first time a slight majority of Ukrainians say they are ready to concede their lands for peace; however, other recent polls indicate opinions may be more complicated. The Gallup polls released Tuesday, conducted in August and October, found that 52 percent of Ukrainians want their country to negotiate a quick end to the war, while 38 percent want to keep fighting until victory. Although media reports about the survey said it reflects a shift in popular opinion from the outset of the war, when most Ukrainians wanted to fight until victory, other surveys have reported less support for a quick resolution. In September and October of this year, the International Republican Institute's (IRI) Center for Insights in Survey Research (CISR) found that 'strong majorities believe that Ukraine will defeat Russia in the current war and support recapturing all lost territory.' According to this survey, released November 12 and conducted by computer-assisted telephone interviews in the Kyiv-controlled territories in late September and early October, 88% of Ukrainians believe that Ukraine will win the war. This number is lower than 98% in June 2022 but has not changed since February 2024. Similar results came from surveys conducted by Ukrainian pollsters. A study from the Kyiv International Institute of Sociology (KIIS) conducted in September-October 2024 found that 81% of Ukrainians believe Ukraine can succeed if the West provides adequate support. Only 14% believe Russia is too strong (up from 7% in December 2023). Similarly, a national survey conducted by the Ilko Kucheriv Foundation 'Democratic Initiatives' with the sociological service of the Razumkov Center in August reported that Ukrainians are not ready to capitulate to Russia's territorial demands. Only 9% of Ukrainians said they would agree to recognize the occupied territories as part of the Russian Federation in exchange for peace (up from 5% in August 2023), and 81% consider it unacceptable (down from 90% in August 2023). Pollsters attribute the differences in their results to different methodologies. Benedict Vigers, the author of the Gallup report, says while they asked questions by phone, the Razumkov survey asked questions in person. There are also some differences in sample coverage. For instance, the IRI survey did not get data from in Donetsk or Kherson. In a written response to VOA, Vigers explained that a desire to end the war as soon as possible does not equal a willingness to give away territories. He points out that only half of those who want to negotiate peace are open to unspecified territorial concessions. 'Of the 52% who think Ukraine should seek to negotiate an ending to the war as soon as possible, around half (52%) are open to making some territorial concessions to achieve peace with Russia. Another 38% are not open to these concessions,' he wrote. That means that only a quarter of Ukraine's polled population is open to territorial concessions in exchange for peace. 'There is still a significant chunk of society that wants to keep fighting until victory, and for most of these people, victory means taking back all land lost since 2014, including Crimea,' Vigers said. Mykhailo Mishchenko, deputy director of the Ukrainian Razumkov Center Sociological Service, showed how a slight difference in the question's wording can alter the results. 'When you ask the question, ‘Do you agree that Ukraine should be open to making some territorial concessions as a part of a peace deal to end the war?’ you get a different answer. It does not mean that all 52% of those who said ‘yes’ in the Gallup poll agree to the territorial concessions. They may be open to considering this question,' Mishchenko told VOA. He said that Ukrainian society is tired of war after 2.5 years, and the number of people who support negotiations has grown. They also can observe the change of rhetoric from Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy, who said that Russia should be invited to the next peace summit. But Mishchenko cautions against interpreting the polls' results as a desire of Ukrainians to surrender. In one of his previous interviews, Mishchenko pointed out that many Ukrainians do not believe that territorial concessions would end the war. 'Among those who are ready to make concessions, 26% answered that Russia's goal is genocide and the physical destruction of the majority of Ukrainians. Another 20% of this category indicated that Russia's goal is the destruction of the Ukrainian nation. In total, it is 46%. And only 15% of those who are ready to make concessions answered that Russia's goal is to keep the already occupied territory without claims to the rest of the territory of Ukraine,' he said in an interview with an independent Russian newspaper. Mishchenko points out that Russian polls indicate a greater willingness of Russian society to return lands they occupied to Ukrainians in order to end the war. One such poll was conducted in September 2024 by the Levada Center, a Russian independent pollster. 'They asked respondents if they thought ‘it was necessary to continue military operations or start peace negotiations,’ ' Michshenko said. 'The majority (54%) of the surveyed Russians were in favor of peace negotiations, and the minority (39%) were in favor of the continuation of hostilities. In September 2022, 48% of Russians supported negotiations, and 44% supported the continuation of hostilities,' he said.	https://www.voanews.com/a/ukrainian-opinion-survey-tracks-fluctuating-opinion-on-quick-end-to-war/7871814.html	2024-11-21T04:18:15-08:00	
UK defense secretary to be quizzed on Ukraine’s firing of British missiles into Russia	London — British Defense Secretary John Healey is expected to face lawmakers’ questions Thursday on media reports Ukraine used British-donated Storm Shadow missiles on targets deep inside Russia for the first time Wednesday. Healey is to appear before the parliamentary Defense Committee Thursday morning. The hearing was scheduled before Wednesday’s reported attack. Both the British and Ukrainian governments have refused to confirm or deny reports that Ukrainian forces fired up to 10 Storm Shadow missiles at targets in Maryino, a village in Russia’s Kursk border region. Social media images purport to show Storm Shadow missile fragments in the vicinity. The reports follow U.S. President Joe Biden’s decision this week to approve the use of American ATACMS missiles on targets far inside Russia. Ukraine fired the American missiles into Russia within hours of Biden’s decision. Moscow earlier warned Western nations that allowing Ukraine to attack its territory with long-range missiles would prompt a ’tangible’ response. Kyiv reported Thursday that Russia had launched an intercontinental ballistic missile (ICBM) carrying a conventional warhead at the central city of Dnipro. Authorities said two people were injured. Russia did not immediately respond to the Ukraine statement. ICBMs are also capable of carrying nuclear warheads thousands of kilometers. The attack follows Moscow’s lowering of its threshold for the use of nuclear weapons earlier this week. The British Storm Shadow missiles have already been used against Russian forces in occupied Ukraine, including in a September 2023 attack that destroyed Russia’s former Black Sea fleet headquarters in Crimea. France has also supplied Ukraine with its version of the Storm Shadow missiles, known as Scalp. The European missiles differ from the American-supplied ATACMS, said Patrick Bury, a defense analyst at Britain’s University of Bath. 'They are air launch missiles. Generally, depending on the export variant, they’ve usually got a range of 250 kilometers, or 155 miles. The ATACMS has a longer range than that and isn't air-launched - so therefore it's harder to intercept - in theory, at least,' Bury told VOA. Both weapons systems will open a range of new targets, according to James Nixey, who leads the Russia-Eurasia program at London’s Chatham House. 'The range of both missiles is enough to get behind Russian lines and into Russian infrastructure targets so that will cut their supplies to their front line. So, the actual range of each missile is not as significant as the fact that Ukraine needs them in great quantity - and very fast indeed.' The weapons are unlikely to change the course of the war, Nixey added. 'No single new innovation into the Ukrainian battlefield will do the trick, although they are hoping it will do. They're hoping that it will break the Russian spine and that the [Russian military] will fold, collapse and that will have a chain reaction back up into the Moscow. That seems relatively unlikely, I have to say. But the Ukrainians are desperate and they will do all that they possibly can with however little that they have,' Nixey told Reuters. Ukraine will have to select its targets carefully, said Bury. 'It will slow down the rate of advance, but will it have a strategic impact? Would it change the course of the war? If you're giving them clearance to fire inside Russia, are you going to allow them to actually up the ante and start hitting energy infrastructure, you know, military infrastructure, oil refineries, etcetera, stuff that would really start to hurt the Russian economy? That's the question,' Bury said. Meanwhile Germany, Ukraine’s second-biggest supplier of arms after the United States, this week again ruled out giving Kyiv its long-range Taurus cruise missiles, something Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy has long desired. Berlin fears being dragged into the war. 'Nothing has changed for us, the situation, the circumstances are the same. And Taurus is Taurus - and not ATACMS or Storm Shadow - so our perspective on that issue is the same,' German Defense Minister Boris Pistorius told reporters Tuesday. Germany’s main opposition, the Christian Democrats, support giving Ukraine the Taurus missiles. The party is ahead in the polls, with a general election scheduled in February. However, the future of Western military aid to Kyiv remains uncertain following Donald Trump’s victory in the U.S. presidential election. Trump has pledged to end the war on his first day in office, although he has not provided any details on how he would achieve that goal. Ukraine fears U.S. support may be cut under Donald Trump. Britain and France could opt to continue supplying Ukraine with missiles, Bury said. 'They're both nuclear powers, they can take that risk if they want to. I think you might find a divergence between European NATO and U.S. NATO on some policy issues around Ukraine,' he told VOA.	https://www.voanews.com/a/uk-defense-secretary-to-be-quizzed-on-ukraine-s-firing-of-british-missiles-into-russia/7871792.html	2024-11-21T03:58:37-08:00	
Volcano on Iceland's Reykjanes Peninsula erupts for the 7th time in a year	GRINDAVIK, Iceland — A volcano on the Reykjanes Peninsula in southwestern Iceland has erupted for the seventh time since December. The eruption started with little warning at 11:14 p.m. Wednesday and created a fissure around 3 kilometers (1.8 miles) long. The activity is estimated to be considerably smaller than the previous eruption in August, Iceland's meteorological office that monitors seismic activity said. 'In the big picture, this is a bit smaller than the last eruption, and the eruption that occurred in May,' Magnus Tumi Guomundsson, a professor of geophysics who flew over the scene with the Civil Protection agency to monitor the event, told the national RUV broadcaster. While the eruption poses no threat to air travel, authorities warned of gas emissions across parts of the peninsula, including the nearby town of Grindavik. Around 50 houses were evacuated after the Civil Protection agency issued the alert, along with guests at the famous Blue Lagoon resort, according to RUV. The repeated volcanic eruptions close to Grindavik, which is about 50 kilometers (30 miles) southwest of the capital, Reykjavik, and has a population of 3,800 people, have damaged infrastructure and property and forced many residents to relocate to guarantee their safety. 'Grindavik is not in danger as it looks and it is unlikely that this crack will get any longer, although nothing can be ruled out,' Magnus Tumi said. Iceland, which sits above a volcanic hot spot in the North Atlantic, averages one eruption every four to five years. The most disruptive in recent times was the 2010 eruption of the Eyjafjallajokull volcano, which spewed clouds of ash into the atmosphere and disrupted trans-Atlantic air travel for months.	https://www.voanews.com/a/volcano-on-iceland-s-reykjanes-peninsula-erupts-for-the-7th-time-in-a-year/7871729.html	2024-11-21T01:11:35-08:00	
US regulators seek to break up Google, forcing Chrome sale	U.S. regulators want a federal judge to break up Google to prevent the company from continuing to squash competition through its dominant search engine after a court found it had maintained an abusive monopoly over the past decade. The proposed breakup floated in a 23-page document filed late Wednesday by the U.S. Department of Justice calls for sweeping punishments that would include a sale of Google's industry-leading Chrome web browser and impose restrictions to prevent Android from favoring its own search engine. A sale of Chrome 'will permanently stop Google's control of this critical search access point and allow rival search engines the ability to access the browser that for many users is a gateway to the internet,' Justice Department lawyers argued in their filing. Although regulators stopped short of demanding Google sell Android too, they asserted the judge should make it clear the company could still be required to divest its smartphone operating system if its oversight committee continues to see evidence of misconduct. The broad scope of the recommended penalties underscores how severely regulators operating under President Joe Biden's administration believe Google should be punished following an August ruling by U.S. District Judge Amit Mehta that branded the company as a monopolist. The Justice Department decision-makers who will inherit the case after President-elect Donald Trump takes office next year might not be as strident. The Washington, D.C., court hearings on Google's punishment are scheduled to begin in April and Mehta is aiming to issue his final decision before Labor Day. If Mehta embraces the government's recommendations, Google would be forced to sell its 16-year-old Chrome browser within six months of the final ruling. But the company certainly would appeal any punishment, potentially prolonging a legal tussle that has dragged on for more than four years. Besides seeking a Chrome spinoff and a corralling of the Android software, the Justice Department wants the judge to ban Google from forging multibillion-dollar deals to lock in its dominant search engine as the default option on Apple's iPhone and other devices. It would also ban Google from favoring its own services, such as YouTube or its recently launched artificial intelligence platform, Gemini. Regulators also want Google to license the search index data it collects from people's queries to its rivals, giving them a better chance at competing with the tech giant. On the commercial side of its search engine, Google would be required to provide more transparency into how it sets the prices that advertisers pay to be listed near the top of some targeted search results. Kent Walker, Google's chief legal officer, lashed out at the Justice Department for pursuing 'a radical interventionist agenda that would harm Americans and America's global technology.' In a blog post, Walker warned the 'overly broad proposal' would threaten personal privacy while undermining Google's early leadership in artificial intelligence, 'perhaps the most important innovation of our time.' Wary of Google's increasing use of artificial intelligence in its search results, regulators also advised Mehta to ensure websites will be able to shield their content from Google's AI training techniques. The measures, if they are ordered, threaten to upend a business expected to generate more than $300 billion in revenue this year. 'The playing field is not level because of Google's conduct, and Google's quality reflects the ill-gotten gains of an advantage illegally acquired,' the Justice Department asserted in its recommendations. 'The remedy must close this gap and deprive Google of these advantages.' It's still possible that the Justice Department could ease off attempts to break up Google, especially if Trump takes the widely expected step of replacing Assistant Attorney General Jonathan Kanter, who was appointed by Biden to oversee the agency's antitrust division. Although the case targeting Google was originally filed during the final months of Trump's first term in office, Kanter oversaw the high-profile trial that culminated in Mehta's ruling against Google. Working in tandem with Federal Trade Commission Chair Lina Khan, Kanter took a get-tough stance against Big Tech that triggered other attempted crackdowns on industry powerhouses such as Apple and discouraged many business deals from getting done during the past four years. Trump recently expressed concerns that a breakup might destroy Google but didn't elaborate on alternative penalties he might have in mind. 'What you can do without breaking it up is make sure it's more fair,' Trump said last month. Matt Gaetz, the former Republican congressman that Trump nominated to be the next U.S. Attorney General, has previously called for the breakup of Big Tech companies. Gaetz faces a tough confirmation hearing. This latest filing gave Kanter and his team a final chance to spell out measures that they believe are needed to restore competition in search. It comes six weeks after Justice first floated the idea of a breakup in a preliminary outline of potential penalties. But Kanter's proposal is already raising questions about whether regulators seek to impose controls that extend beyond the issues covered in last year's trial, and — by extension — Mehta's ruling. Banning the default search deals that Google now pays more than $26 billion annually to maintain was one of the main practices that troubled Mehta in his ruling. It's less clear whether the judge will embrace the Justice Department's contention that Chrome needs to be spun out of Google and or Android should be completely walled off from its search engine. 'It is probably going a little beyond,' Syracuse University law professor Shubha Ghosh said of the Chrome breakup. 'The remedies should match the harm, it should match the transgression. This does seem a little beyond that pale.' Google rival DuckDuckGo, whose executives testified during last year's trial, asserted the Justice Department is simply doing what needs to be done to rein in a brazen monopolist. 'Undoing Google's overlapping and widespread illegal conduct over more than a decade requires more than contract restrictions: it requires a range of remedies to create enduring competition,' Kamyl Bazbaz, DuckDuckGo's senior vice president of public affairs, said in a statement. Trying to break up Google harks back to a similar punishment initially imposed on Microsoft a quarter century ago following another major antitrust trial that culminated in a federal judge deciding the software maker had illegally used his Windows operating system for PCs to stifle competition. However, an appeals court overturned an order that would have broken up Microsoft, a precedent many experts believe will make Mehta reluctant to go down a similar road with the Google case.	https://www.voanews.com/a/us-regulators-seek-to-break-up-google-forcing-chrome-sale/7871725.html	2024-11-21T01:03:09-08:00	
Philippines death toll rises to 12	MANILA, PHILIPPINES — The death toll from Super Typhoon Man-yi in the Philippines has risen to 12, the national disaster agency said Thursday as widespread flooding subsided. Man-yi submerged villages and smashed flimsy buildings in the archipelago nation over the weekend, packing maximum sustained wind speeds of 185 kilometres (115 miles) an hour. It was the sixth major storm in a month to strike the Philippines. Together they have killed at least 175 people and displaced thousands, as well as wiping out crops and livestock Most of the Man-yi deaths were in mountainous areas north of the capital Manila, including seven people killed after a landslide buried their house in Nueva Vizcaya province. A boulder also crushed a house, burying three people alive, in the coastal town of Dipaculao, where Man-yi had made a second landfall, Ariel Nepomuceno, a senior official with the government's civil defence office, told AFP. Four people remain missing, he added. 'We are now in the recovery period, people have started to fix their houses,' Nepomuceno said. 'Construction materials have been arriving in hard-hit provinces.' In the northern city of Tuguegarao, floodwaters induced by a dam release and a swollen Cagayan River have started to subside, after swamping thousands of houses in the days after the typhoon exited the country. 'The water level has subsided and is now just one foot (0.3 metres) high. Some evacuees have also gone back to their homes,' city disaster official Ian Valdepenas told AFP on Thursday. Schools and government offices have reopened. About 20 big storms and typhoons hit the Southeast Asian nation or its surrounding waters each year, killing scores of people, but it is rare for multiple such weather events to take place in a small window.	https://www.voanews.com/a/philippines-death-toll-rises-to-12/7871727.html	2024-11-21T01:01:48-08:00	
Russian attack causes damage in Ukraine’s Dnipropetrovsk region	Ukrainian officials reported damage Thursday to an industrial site in the Dnipropetrovsk region after a series of Russian attacks. Dnipropetrovsk Governor Serhiy Lysak said the attacks hit the city of Dnipro and also caused several fires. Volodymyr Artiukh, governor of Ukraine’s Sumy region, said on Telegram that Russian forces shelled areas along the border between the two countries and attacked with an aerial drone. Russia’s Defense Ministry said its air defenses destroyed two Ukrainian drones over the Rostov region and two drones over Volgograd. Yuri Slyusar, the acting governor of Rostov, said on Telegram there were no casualties and no damage as a result of the Ukrainian attack. US mines The U.S. is planning to send Ukraine antipersonnel land mines to help Kyiv’s forces fend off the advance of Russian ground troops, U.S. Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin said Wednesday. The decision is the second U.S. policy reversal in recent days after President Joe Biden, in the last two months of his White House tenure, switched his stance and said Ukraine is now free to launch Washington-supplied, long-range missiles deeper into Russia. Ukraine quickly targeted munitions warehouses with its first attack on Tuesday. Austin, speaking to reporters traveling with him on a trip to Laos, said allowing the shipment of the U.S. land mines to Ukraine became necessary because of changing battlefield tactics by Moscow’s forces. He said Russian ground troops are leading the movement on the battlefield, rather than forces protected by armored carriers, so Ukraine has 'a need for things that can help slow down that effort on the part of the Russians.' Russia has captured more territory in eastern Ukraine in recent weeks. Austin said the land mines that the U.S. will provide can be controlled for self-activation and self-detonation. Russia, like the United States, did not sign the United Nations convention on the prohibition of anti-personnel mines, but Ukraine had, Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov noted on Wednesday. Russia has deployed at least 13 types of land mines in Ukraine, according to Human Rights Watch, and uses them extensively in territory it has captured from Ukraine, according to The Washington Post. The U.S. on Wednesday also said it is sending another $275 million package of munitions to Kyiv, including arms for rocket systems, artillery and antitank weapons. It is the 70th such shipment since August 2021. The changing policies and additional arms supply appear to be an effort by Biden and his defense team to shore up Ukraine’s war effort before U.S. President-elect Donald Trump takes office January 20. Trump has been a skeptic of continuing U.S. support for Ukraine, claiming he will have the war ended before he even takes office but not offering any details on how he would do so.

Australian teen dies after alcohol poisoning in Laos	An Australian teenager died Thursday in Laos, a week after drinking alcohol tainted with methanol. Nineteen-year-old Bianca Jones is the fourth person to die since a group became sick during a night out in the town of Vang Vieng. The other deaths include an American and two Danes. 'This is every parent's worst fear and a nightmare no one should have to endure,' Australian Prime Minister Anthony Albanese told parliament on Thursday. 'All Australians offer them our deepest sympathy in this time of heartbreak.' Vang Vieng is an area popular with backpackers located about 100 kilometers north of Vientiane.

Daughter of jailed Eritrean journalist continues to fight for his release	Journalist Betlehem Isaak, the daughter of journalist Dawit Isaak — a dual Eritrean-Swedish citizen imprisoned without trial in Eritrea since 2001— accepted the 2024 Edelstam Prize on her father's behalf Tuesday during a ceremony at the House of Nobility in Stockholm. The prize honors Dawit for his 'outstanding courage' in championing freedom of expression. The judges noted his commitment to advocating for democracy in Eritrea despite harassment, threats and repeated interrogations. 'His punishment, his perpetual unlawful detention, never charged with a crime, defenseless and deprived of his basic rights without a trial, his de facto status of civil death, is untenable,' said Caroline Edelstam, chair of the Edelstam Prize jury and co-founder of the Edelstam Foundation. The loss of her father not only has brought pain but has also taught her resilience, Betlehem said. Speaking to VOA from Gothenburg, Sweden, ahead of the award ceremony, she said continuing her father's legacy is both a painful burden and a source of inspiration. 'Losing a parent as a 7-year-old little girl is, of course, very traumatic,' Betlehem said. 'But it's also the strength I get from it today, and I really value it, even though I don't wish this on my worst enemies.' Arrested during 2001 crackdown Dawit was arrested during a government crackdown on independent media in Eritrea in September 2001. Eritrea ranks among the most tightly controlled countries in the world. A country with no independent media, Eritrea subjects all citizens to indefinite national service and has never held national elections. Twenty-one journalists and politicians from the 2001 roundup remain in detention, according to Amnesty International. Betlehem said although her father's disappearance left a void in the family, she chose to follow in his footsteps and advocate for justice and freedom of expression. 'Freedom, in general, is actually something that we have to fight for almost every day,' she said. This personal battle has informed Betlehem's perspective as a journalist. In her work, she highlights the stories of those who face oppression. She said that her father's plight should not be taken 'for granted, especially when it comes to freedom.' 'I continue the work' In more than 23 years, Dawit's imprisonment has prompted international campaigns and requests from the Swedish government for his release. 'My father is actually a symbol,' Betlehem said, adding that his story and 'his colleagues with him' are 'a symbol of what's really happening and has happened in Eritrea for the last 25 years.' For her, continuing his legacy is both a privilege and a responsibility. Though she was just a little girl when he was taken away, she follows his principles. 'I continue the work that my father and his colleagues started,' she said. The Eritrean government 'will never silence their voice, because I am my father's voice, and I am also the voice of every Eritrean.' Several attempts by VOA to reach out to the government on Dawit's status went unanswered. Daughter calls for father's release Betlehem's advocacy extends beyond journalism. She frequently engages in campaigns calling for her father's release and raises awareness about press freedom. Despite challenges, Betlehem remains hopeful. Without going into details, she said, she has proof of life to keep her going. 'We know that my father is alive, and we know that that's the truth,' she said. 'We have sources that say that, and we believe those sources.' Freedom isn't just about writing or speaking as a journalist where there's censorship, she said. 'You cannot even exist as a free human being,' she said. 'You cannot even think.'

Biden negotiators hopeful of Mideast deal	President Joe Biden’s top Mideast envoy said Wednesday he’s hopeful about negotiations with Hezbollah to bring the conflict along Israel’s northern border to an end, although fighting continues, and an end appears nowhere in sight in Gaza. Meanwhile, the U.S. Senate blocked legislation Wednesday night that would have sent certain armaments to Israel – a move that opponents say will extend the war.

US Senate blocks bid to halt some Israel military sales	washington — The U.S. Senate on Wednesday blocked legislation that would have halted the sale of some U.S. weapons to Israel. The measures had been introduced out of concern about the human rights catastrophe Palestinians face in Gaza. Seventy-nine of the 100 senators opposed a resolution that would have blocked sales of tank rounds to Israel, while 18 approved it and one voted present. Seventy-eight opposed a second measure, which would have stopped the shipment of mortar rounds, while 19 supported it and one voted present. The Senate was to vote later Wednesday on a third resolution that would stop shipments of a GPS guidance system for bombs. All of the votes in favor of the measures came from the Democratic caucus. Those against came from both Democrats and Republicans. The 'resolutions of disapproval' were filed by Senator Bernie Sanders, an independent who caucuses with Democrats, and co-sponsored by a handful of Democrats. Strong bipartisan support for Israel in Congress meant the resolutions were never likely to pass, but backers hoped significant support in the Senate would encourage Israel's government and President Joe Biden's administration to do more to protect civilians in Gaza. The Biden administration opposed the resolutions. Most of Gaza's population of 2.3 million people has been displaced and the enclave is at risk of famine, more than a year into Israel's war against Hamas in the Palestinian enclave. Gaza health officials say nearly 44,000 Palestinians have been killed in Israel's offensive. Sanders, accusing Israel of blocking aid shipments, said providing military aid to Israel violates U.S. law barring weapons sales to human rights abusers. 'It is time to tell the [Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin] Netanyahu government that they cannot use U.S. taxpayer dollars and American weapons in violation of U.S. and international law and our moral values,' Sanders said in a Senate speech before the vote. Opponents said the resolutions were inappropriate as Israel faces threats from designated terror groups like Hamas and Hezbollah, and from archenemy Iran. 'Israel is surrounded by enemies dedicated to its annihilation,' the Senate's Democratic majority leader, Chuck Schumer, said in a Senate speech before the votes. Israel says that it has been working to address humanitarian needs and that the main problem with aid deliveries is U.N. distribution challenges. Its embassy in Washington did not respond this week to a request for comment on Sanders' resolutions. U.S. law gives Congress the right to stop major foreign weapons sales by passing resolutions of disapproval. Although no such resolution has passed Congress and survived a presidential veto, the law requires the Senate to vote if a resolution is filed. Such resolutions have at times led to angry debates embarrassing to past presidents.	https://www.voanews.com/a/us-senate-blocks-bid-to-halt-some-israel-military-sales-/7871616.html	2024-11-20T18:15:22-08:00	
US charges Indian billionaire Gautam Adani with fraud, conspiracy	new york — An Indian businessman who is one of the world's richest people has been indicted in the United States on charges he duped investors by concealing that his company's huge solar energy project on the subcontinent was being facilitated by an alleged bribery scheme. Gautam Adani, 62, was charged in an indictment unsealed Wednesday with securities fraud and conspiracy to commit securities and wire fraud. The case involves a lucrative arrangement for Adani Green Energy Ltd. and another firm to sell 12 gigawatts of solar power to the Indian government — enough to light millions of homes and businesses. The indictment portrays Adani and his co-defendants as playing two sides of the deal. It accuses them of portraying the plan as rosy and aboveboard to Wall Street investors who poured several billion dollars into the project while, back in India, they were paying or planning to pay about $265 million in bribes to government officials in exchange for billions of dollars' worth of contracts and financing. Adani and his co-defendants allegedly sought to 'obtain and finance massive state energy supply contracts through corruption and fraud at the expense of U.S. investors,' Deputy Assistant Attorney General Lisa Miller said. In a parallel civil action, the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission accused Adani and two co-defendants of violating anti-fraud provisions of U.S. securities laws. The regulator is seeking monetary penalties and other sanctions. Both cases were filed in federal court in Brooklyn. Adani's co-defendants include his nephew, Sagar Adani, the executive director of Adani Green Energy's board, and Vneet Jaain, who was the company's chief executive from 2020 to 2023 and remains managing director of its board. Online court records did not list lawyers who could speak on the defendants' behalf. An email message seeking comment was left with an arm of Adani's company, the Adani Group. Sanjay Wadhwa, acting director of the SEC's Enforcement Division, said Gautam and Sagar Adani are accused of persuading investors to buy their company's bonds by misrepresenting 'not only that Adani Green had a robust anti-bribery compliance program but also that the company's senior management had not and would not pay or promise to pay bribes.' Adani is a power player in the world's most populous nation. He built his fortune in the coal business in the 1990s. The Adani Group grew to involve many aspects of Indian life, from making defense equipment to building roads to selling cooking oil. In recent years, Adani has made big moves into renewable energy, embracing a philosophy of sustainable growth reflected in its slogan: 'Growth with Goodness.' Last year, a U.S.-based financial research firm accused Adani and his company of 'brazen stock manipulation' and 'accounting fraud.' The Adani Group called the claims 'a malicious combination of selective misinformation and stale, baseless and discredited allegations.' The firm in question is known as a short-seller, a Wall Street term for traders that essentially bet on the prices of certain stocks to fall, and it had made such investments in relation to the Adani Group.	https://www.voanews.com/a/us-charges-indian-billionaire-gautam-adani-with-fraud-conspiracy-/7871576.html	2024-11-20T17:26:43-08:00	
Finnish authorities open probe into ruptured undersea cable between Finland, Germany	HELSINKI, Finland — Finnish authorities said Wednesday they have opened an investigation into the rupture of a data cable under the Baltic Sea, adding to a Swedish probe into the possible sabotage of that link and another cable. The C-Lion1 cable, which runs between Finland and Germany was damaged on Monday, the day after similar damage to a cable that crosses the Baltic between Lithuania and Sweden, with the incidents occurring off the Swedish islands of Oland and Gotland respectively. Germany's defense minister said Tuesday that the damage appeared to have been caused by sabotage, though there is no proof at present. Finland's National Bureau of Investigation said it opened a criminal investigation into the rupture of the C-Lion1 cable on suspicion of 'aggravated criminal mischief and aggravated interference with communications.' Swedish police already opened a preliminary investigation Tuesday into suspected sabotage regarding the two cable breaches, and said Wednesday that 'Swedish police and prosecutors are also interested in a ship that has been seen at the locations in question.' They didn't give any details or identify the vessel but said that 'it is not currently in Swedish waters.' The official investigations came as news reports said a Chinese-flagged vessel, the Yi Peng 3, had been in the area at the time of the ruptures. Vessel tracking information from the Marine Traffic website showed the 225-meter (738-foot) long bulk carrier not moving Wednesday afternoon off the coast of Denmark in the Baltic. The Royal Danish Navy did not immediately respond to an emailed request for comment from The Associated Press.	https://www.voanews.com/a/finnish-authorities-open-probe-into-ruptured-undersea-cable-between-finland-germany/7871578.html	2024-11-20T17:07:30-08:00	
Georgia election workers say Giuliani continues to defame them	Two former Georgia election workers who won a $148 million defamation judgment against Rudy Giuliani asked a judge Wednesday to penalize him even further for continuing to falsely accuse them of tampering with ballots during the 2020 presidential election. Attorneys for Ruby Freeman and her daughter, Wandrea 'Shaye' Moss, argued in a filing in a Washington federal court that Giuliani has violated an agreement he signed to stop repeating the falsehoods. The alleged violations came in statements he made during two recent broadcasts of his nightly show on the social media platform X. 'These statements repeat the exact same lies for which Mr. Giuliani has already been held liable, and which he agreed to be bound by court order to stop repeating,' read the filing, which asked the judge to hold Giuliani in contempt and impose sanctions against him. A lawyer for Giuliani, Joseph M. Cammarata, said he had not seen the court filing and could not respond to its specific claims, but accused the women's attorneys of trying to intimidate the former New York City mayor. In a statement, Giuliani's spokesperson, Ted Goodman, called the new legal filing an attempt to 'deprive Mayor Rudy Giuliani of his First Amendment right to freedom of speech.' Giuliani is barred from accusing the women of election wrongdoing. The longtime Donald Trump ally was found liable last year for defaming Freeman and Moss by accusing them of ballot tampering as he pushed then-President Trump's lies about election fraud. The women said they faced death threats after Giuliani falsely claimed they sneaked in ballots in suitcases, counted ballots multiple times and tampered with voting machines. The $148 million judgment led to a failed bankruptcy attempt by Giuliani. He has since been ordered to turn over many of his assets to Freeman and Moss, including his $5 million Upper East Side apartment. In December, the women sued Giuliani again for continuing to repeat his ballot-tampering claims, resulting in the court issuing a permanent injunction in May that barred the former mayor from making any statements that suggest the women engaged in any wrongdoing in connection with the 2020 presidential election. Lawyers for the two plaintiffs argued in Wednesday's court filing that Giuliani broke that agreement when he referred to the pair again on his recent video broadcasts on November 12 and 14, including baselessly claiming that he was not allowed to show tapes of 'quadruple counting' ballots during the trial. In his statement responding to the filing, Goodman argued that Giuliani 'has every right to defend himself.' Giuliani's lawyer says 90% to 95% of his possessions have been turned over to Freeman and Moss. Giuliani has been critical of a judge's ruling that ordered him to turn over many prized possessions, including the apartment, a Mercedes once owned by movie star Lauren Bacall and dozens of luxury watches. He said he should not have had to surrender his possessions until his appeal is decided.	https://www.voanews.com/a/georgia-election-workers-say-giuliani-continues-to-defame-them/7871577.html	2024-11-20T17:05:13-08:00	
Foreign fighters flocking to Islamic State in Somalia	washington — The Islamic State terror group's small but influential affiliate in Somalia is growing, thanks in part to what the United Nations describes as an 'influx of foreign fighters.' A new report this week by the U.N. Sanctions Monitoring Team for Somalia warns that fighters, including some from countries in the Middle East, have helped the Islamic State's Somali affiliate, also known as IS-Somalia, to more than double in size to between 600 and 700 fighters. 'Foreign fighters arrive in Puntland [Somalia] using both maritime and overland routes,' according to the report, which is based on intelligence estimates from U.N. member states. The foreign fighters 'have expanded and enhanced the group's capabilities,' the report said, strengthening IS's presence in Somalia's Puntland region while also helping it take territory from its key rival, al-Qaida-linked terror group al-Shabab. Intelligence sources described the IS-Somalia advance, especially in Puntland's Cal Miskaad mountains, as a 'drastic change,' crediting the foreign fighters for IS-Somalia's change in fortune. The U.N. report said the IS foreign fighters have come from at least six countries: Syria, Yemen, Ethiopia, Sudan, Morocco and Tanzania. It also said some captured foreign fighters have reported working with trainers who have come from parts of the Middle East. The new report builds on previous warnings from U.S. and Somali officials, including the commander of U.S. Africa Command, who told VOA last month that IS-Somalia had grown 'twofold' over the past year. Somali officials have likewise warned of hundreds of foreign fighters flocking to Somalia to join the ranks of the IS affiliate. 'This reporting on an influx of foreign terrorist fighters in Africa is concerning,' said Austin Doctor, the director of counterterrorism research initiatives at the National Counterterrorism Innovation, Technology and Education Center. And while the flow of foreign fighters to Somalia pales in comparison to the tens of thousands of fighters who flocked to join IS in Syria and Iraq during the height of the terror group's self-declared caliphate, Doctor told VOA the trend is likely to continue. 'A number of factors present in the Horn [of Africa] and other Africa regions as well will likely appeal to aspiring travelers looking to join the rank and file of an extremist militant organization,' he said. 'Global and local security forces should prepare to see more of this in the near term.' There are likewise concerns about IS-Somalia's growing prominence on the global stage. Since 2022, Somalia has been home to al-Karrar, one of nine regional Islamic State offices established to help sustain the terror group's global capabilities. The U.N. report cautions that despite some leadership losses, the al-Karrar office has become both more powerful and more decentralized, making it more difficult to disrupt its activities. And the report confirms that former IS-Somalia leader Abdulqadir Mumin, who escaped a U.S. airstrike this past June, has been elevated to head of the Islamic State's general directorate of provinces, 'placing him in a leadership role over [IS] affiliates in Africa.' IS-Somalia, according to the report, is now being led by Mumin's former deputy, Abdirahman Fahiye Isse, with Abdiwali Waran-Walac running IS-Somalia's finances. And the group's finances appear to be in good shape. 'Given the relatively small size of [IS]-Somalia, the group can sustain itself and generate additional revenue for other [IS] affiliates through the al-Karrar office,' the report said.	https://www.voanews.com/a/foreign-fighters-flocking-to-islamic-state-in-somalia/7871573.html	2024-11-20T17:01:44-08:00	
Maui Invitational returns to a Lahaina still struggling after deadly wildfire	Honolulu, hawaii — Three generations of TJ Rickard's family lost their homes in the deadly Maui wildfire more than a year ago, and he and his extended family still have not rebuilt. That leaves Rickard, a high school basketball coach, conflicted about next week's return of the storied Maui Invitational college tournament. Like many, Rickard is excited to have top-drawer basketball played in Lahaina's humble arena, but he worries people will think it's business as usual in his hometown. In truth, he said, Lahaina is still struggling after the fire killed at least 102 people and leveled thousands of homes. 'Not even a minute drive away from where they play, there's houses that are burned down that are still waiting to be rebuilt,' said Rickard, the boys head coach at Lahainaluna High School. Many residents are excited about the local exposure to high-caliber competition and the economic boost the Maui Invitational will bring. But there's also a fear that travelers might show disrespect by wandering into the Lahaina burn zone and taking photos of the devastation, or trigger unpleasant memories with questions about that catastrophic day. 'People are in a weird state right now over here because there's so much displacement and loss of community,' said Jon Conrad, Lahainaluna's athletic director. 'It's a highly sensitive and slightly charged environment.' Boosters coming to Lahaina should know 'it's been a year and more, but things are still a little raw,' Conrad said. 'It's our home' The Maui Invitational will bring eight of the NCAA's best men's teams — including two-time defending champion University of Connecticut — to Lahaina's 2,400-seat gymnasium for three days. Last year, organizers moved the tournament to Honolulu instead of intruding on Lahaina when many survivors were still living in hotels and charred rubble littered properties. This year, they decided to bring the 40-year-old event back after meeting with the governor's office, the Hawaii Tourism Authority and Maui's mayor, said Tom Valdiserri, executive vice president of KemperSports LIVE. 'It's our home and we want to be there. And Maui is our ohana, frankly,' Valdiserri said, using the Hawaiian word for family. Reconstruction is progressing slowly. The Army Corps of Engineers has fully cleared all residential lots and 91% of commercial lots of fire debris. Maui County has issued 133 building permits after receiving 291 applications. One property has been finished. Rickard's experience shows how challenging housing is even 15 months after the fire. The blaze burned down his grandparents' house and the in-law unit on their property where Rickard lived with his wife and dog. His parents' house a few lots away got torched. The blaze claimed a cousin's house across the street and another cousin's place the next street over. A great-aunt who lived down the road lost her house, too. Rickard now lives in an apartment a 45-minute drive away that's paid for by the Federal Emergency Management Agency. His relatives are living with friends or other family. Maui officials hope the tournament will help rebuild the tourism industry, which took a massive hit. In 2022, the last year the Maui Invitational was held in Lahaina, the competition brought 6,500 visitors and $24 million in spending to Maui, KemperSports LIVE said. University of Hawaii researchers said last month that fewer than half of those who had full-time jobs in Lahaina's tourism industry still do. Those with jobs are working fewer hours, their report said. Bringing life 'back to normal' Rebuilding helps Javier Barberi cope with the disaster. His company, Hana Hou Hospitality, reopened a popular beachfront restaurant that was spared by the flames — Mala Ocean Tavern — eight months after the fire. He and his partners overhauled another restaurant and launched it as a new establishment called Coco Deck. To him, the tournament's return is a sign of hope. 'Like, hey, we used to have this. It was gone. Now it's back,' Barberi said. 'That restaurant was gone. Now it's back. That house was gone, now it's being rebuilt. To see these things happen, it starts to bring things back to normal and bring Maui back.' Jason Donez, general manager of Leilani's restaurant, remembers his daughter Lola meeting Mike Krzyzewski, Duke's head coach at the time, at a free-throw contest in 2018. The Hall of Fame coach told the 12-year-old she had a nice shot, she should stick with it and he would see her in college one day, Donez said. Today, Lola Donez is a freshman guard at Cal. Being around the teams helped her 'dream big,' her father said. Organizers ask teams to show respect Tickets to the games this year range from $56 to $236 depending on the game and seat location, but local residents get about a 28% discount. Tournament organizers and teams will hold basketball clinics for local students. Organizers have reminded participating schools and their teams to be respectful, and the tournament website has the same message for fans. The athletes and their coaches say they understand. 'I think that's where you try to remind guys that we're very fortunate to be able to travel and do the things the way we do, and we're going to a community that had a huge devastation that none of us would want anyone go to through,' said North Carolina assistant coach Sean May. 'So, we've got to have some compassion.' 'But I think at the end, they're happy we're there, we're happy to be there, it's great for the community. And to me, it brings so much excitement.'	https://www.voanews.com/a/maui-invitational-returns-to-a-lahaina-still-struggling-after-deadly-wildfire/7871555.html	2024-11-20T17:00:28-08:00	
As international force struggles to stabilize Haiti, calls grow for UN force	united nations — A senior U.N. official urged the international community on Wednesday to make good on its commitments to fund and equip a multinational security force in Haiti, which is struggling to help the Haitian National Police subdue armed gangs who are terrorizing the population, while some nations want to transform the multinational force into a U.N. peacekeeping force. 'Without a substantial and sustained increase in voluntary contributions from member states, there is a real risk that the MSS will never be fully equipped, fully deployed or able to sustain its support for the Haitian National Police,' Miroslav Jenca, U.N. assistant secretary-general, told Security Council members, using the acronym for the Multinational Security Support mission. He said the mission requires a 'sizable increase' in weapons, equipment and specialized expertise that the Haitian National Police lack. 'This must be accompanied by efforts to build up national police capabilities to support the government in sustainably delivering security,' Jenca said. He said efforts must also be made to stem the illicit flow of drugs, weapons and ammunition and to curb corruption. He urged the council to utilize sanctions to their 'full potential' to address the root causes of gang violence. 'Any further delays or operational gaps in providing international security support to the Haitian National Police, whether through the MSS or bilateral assistance, present a catastrophic risk of collapse of national security institutions,' Jenca cautioned. 'This could lead to a complete breakdown of state authority, rendering international operations and the support to Haitians in need in the country untenable.' Jenca acknowledged that there are no ideal options for addressing the spiraling situation in Haiti. 'But as time passes and the situation deteriorates, we are left with less options, and the Haitian people are left with less hope,' he said. 'It is high time we turn commitments into action to prevent any further erosion of security and state authority in Haiti.' The MSS is led by Kenya, which has contributed most of the 416 police officers who have deployed to Haiti since June. The misson’s full strength has been set at 2,500 police, but equipment and funding challenges have tempered contributions. So far, only Kenya, Belize, the Bahamas and Jamaica have sent personnel. Monica Juma, Kenyan President William Ruto’s national security adviser, told the council in a remote briefing that her government has 617 more police who are trained and ready to deploy. She said they need equipment and logistics to support their rapid deployment. Calls for a UN force The United States and Ecuador, the co-leads on Haiti on the 15-nation Security Council, want the MSS to become a U.N. peacekeeping operation. The current mission is not a U.N. one, but it does have Security Council authorization. Haiti’s past experiences with U.N. peacekeeping missions have ended badly, and it was originally felt that a non-U.N. mission was a better idea. But a lack of funding, equipment and logistics has brought even Haiti’s struggling government around to the idea of a U.N. mission, which would benefit from sustainable funding and access to more resources. Haitian Ambassador Antonio Rodrigue expressed his government’s support for a U.N. peacekeeping force, saying the armed gangs are becoming increasingly violent and fearless. 'They are committing terrifying abuse, murders, abductions, rapes and burning of homes,' he said. 'Children, women and men are caught and entrapped in this indiscriminate violence.' The United Nations says more than 700,000 people are displaced across Haiti, most from the capital, Port-au-Prince, where armed groups control 80% of neighborhoods. The International Organization for Migration said Monday that more than 20,000 people had been displaced across the capital area in just four days. 'This alarming situation really shows us that we need to call for the MSS to be transformed into a U.N. peacekeeping mission,' Haiti’s ambassador said. 'We are not just talking about restoring public order, we are talking about preserving human lives,' Rodrigue emphasized, adding that without security, there would be no economic, social or political progress. 'Haiti is at a crossroads — either the international community lends significant support, or it leaves the country to plunge further into violence with consequences that are bound to spill over across our borders,' he said. Washington’s envoy said the U.S. and Ecuador are ready to move forward to take the initial step and ask the U.N. secretary-general to prepare recommendations on a peacekeeping mission to follow the MSS. But not all council members have embraced the idea. Russia and China, which called for Wednesday’s council meeting, both expressed serious reservations about sending peacekeepers to Haiti, where there is a lack of peace to keep. 'Deploying a peacekeeping operation at this time is nothing more than putting peacekeepers into the front lines of battles with gangs,' said China’s Deputy Ambassador Geng Shuang. 'This will expose peacekeepers to great security risks.' The U.N. secretary-general has also not generally favored the idea, saying last year that it is an option of last resort. Regional support Several regional countries back the idea of a U.N. peacekeeping mission. The Organization of American States adopted its own resolution of support last week, while regional bloc CARICOM has also endorsed the idea. Canada, one of the largest financial donors to the MSS, urged the council to move to create a mission that could succeed. 'We must act now,' Ambassador Bob Rae said. 'Time is not our friend. It is not our friend. There is not a moment to lose.' 'Haiti is out of control, and it is a danger to the Haitian people and a constant threat to the Dominican Republic and the region,' said Dominican Ambassador Jose Alfonso Blanco Conde. His country shares the island with Haiti and supports a U.N. deployment. Haiti has been rocked by instability since 2021, when President Jovenel Moise was assassinated. Prime Minister Ariel Henry then led the country until he announced his resignation in March. A transitional government is now in place with the goal of organizing free and fair elections, but it has been beset by internal and external challenges. Haiti has not held elections since 2016.	https://www.voanews.com/a/as-international-force-struggles-to-stabilize-haiti-calls-grow-for-un-force-/7871559.html	2024-11-20T16:40:08-08:00	
Susan Smith denied parole 30 years after drowning sons by rolling car into lake	columbia, south carolina — A parole board decided unanimously Wednesday that Susan Smith should remain in prison despite her plea that God has forgiven her for killing her two young sons 30 years ago by rolling her car into a South Carolina lake while they were strapped in their car seats. It was the first parole hearing for Smith, 53, who is serving a life sentence after a jury convicted her of murder but decided to spare her the death penalty. She is eligible for a parole hearing every two years now that she has spent 30 years behind bars. Smith made her case by video link from prison. She started by saying she was 'very sorry,' then broke down in tears and bowed her head. 'I know what I did was horrible,' Smith said, pausing and then continuing with a wavering voice. 'And I would give anything if I could go back and change it.' In her final statements, Smith said God has forgiven her. 'I ask that you show that same kind of mercy, as well,' she said. Smith made international headlines in 1994 when she insisted for nine days that a Black carjacker drove away with her sons. Prosecutors have long argued that Smith killed 3-year-old Michael and 14-month-old Alex because she believed they were the reason the wealthy son of the owner of the business where she worked broke off their affair. Her attorneys blame her mental health. A group of about 15 people urged against parole. They included her ex-husband and father of the boys, David Smith; his family members; prosecutors; and law enforcement officials. Along with a few others, David Smith had a photo of Michael and Alex pinned to his suit jacket. He struggled to get out words at first, pausing several times to compose himself. He said he has never seen Susan Smith express remorse toward him. 'She changed my life for the rest of my life that night,' he said. 'I'm asking that you please deny her parole today, and hopefully in the future, but specifically today,' he said, adding that he plans to attend each parole hearing to make sure Michael and Alex aren't forgotten. A decision to grant parole requires a two-thirds vote of board members present, according to the state. Parole in South Carolina is granted only about 8% of the time and is less likely with an inmate's first appearance before the board, in notorious cases, or when prosecutors and the families of victims are opposed. Before Smith testified, she listened stoically to a statement from her attorney, Tommy Thomas. He called her situation one about 'the dangers of untreated mental health.' He also noted she had no criminal history before her conviction, making her 'low risk' to the public. The board's decision was the one David Smith had hoped for, Smith said in a news conference following the hearing. 'In two more years, we'll go through this again,' he said. 'But at least I know, for now, she'll still be behind bars.' The family and prosecution had been 'cautiously optimistic,' former prosecutor Tommy Pope said, because Susan Smith has continually demonstrated that it's 'always been about Susan.' Mother pleas for children Smith had claimed in October 1994 that she was carjacked late at night near the city of Union and that a Black man wearing a toboggan hat drove away with her sons. The claims by Smith, who is white, played into a centuries-old racist trope of Black men being a danger to white women and stoked concerns about crime that were prevalent in 1990s America and remain so today. For nine days, Smith made numerous and sometimes tearful pleas asking that Michael and Alex be returned safely. The whole time, the boys were in Smith's car at the bottom of nearby John D. Long Lake, authorities said. Investigators said Smith's story didn't add up. Carjackers usually just want a vehicle, so investigators asked why they would let Smith out but not her kids. The traffic light where Smith said she had stopped when her car was taken would only be red if another car was waiting to cross, and Smith said no other cars were around. Other bits and pieces of the story did not make sense. Smith ultimately confessed to letting her car roll down a boat ramp and into the lake. A re-creation by investigators showed it took six minutes for the Mazda to dip below the surface, while cameras inside the vehicle showed water pouring in through the vents and steadily rising. The boys' bodies were found dangling upside-down in their car seats, one tiny hand pressed against a window. Smith says she was 'scared' The 1995 trial of the young mother became a national sensation and a true-crime touchstone. Smith's lawyers said she was remorseful, was suffering a mental breakdown and intended to die alongside her children but left the car at the last moment. They were successful at sparing her life. 'I just felt strongly that had the Black man with the toboggan committed the crime, people would expect the death penalty,' Pope said at Wednesday's hearing. 'If David Smith had committed the crime, people would have expected the death penalty.' The parole board asked Smith about the law enforcement resources used to try to locate her children. In reply, she told the board she was 'just scared' and 'didn't know how to tell them.' Smith's crime traumatized not only her family, prosecutor Kevin Brackett said, but also people in South Carolina and around the country who 'fixated' on this 'global sensation.' Her allegation that a Black man kidnapped her children also led to other Black men being wrongfully pulled over as police searched for a 'fictitious man,' he said. From prison, Smith can make phone calls and answer text messages, many from journalists and interested men. Those messages and phone calls were released under South Carolina's open records act, something Smith didn't initially realize could happen. She said the invasion of her privacy upset her, along with the public revelation that she was juggling conversations about the future with several men. Some men know why she is famous. Others are more coy. One told her he was going to use the dates of her birthday and those of her dead sons when he played the Powerball lottery. Others chatted about their lives and sports.

Development bloc concerned about Mozambique’s post-election violence	Mount Hampden, ZIMBABWE — The Southern African Development Community held an extraordinary summit of heads of state in Zimbabwe on Wednesday to discuss the post-election strife in Mozambique and the conflict in eastern Democratic Republic of the Congo. Mozambique has been rocked by violence since last month’s elections, with police accused of killing at least 30 protesters, according to civil society organizations there. The opposition accuses the FRELIMO government, which was represented by Mozambican President Filipe Nyusi, of stealing the October 9 elections. 'Summit received an update of the Republic of Mozambique on the post-election political and security situation in the country and reaffirmed its unwavering commitment to work with the Republic of Mozambique in ensuring peace, security and stability through the relevant structures of the SADC organ on politics, defense and security cooperation,' said the group's executive secretary, Elias Magosi. 'Summit extended condolences to the government and people of the Republic of Mozambique for the lives lost during the post-election violence.' Earlier in the day, Magosi said those aggrieved in Mozambique should pursue legal solutions instead of resorting to violence. Zimbabwean President Emmerson Mnangagwa, who holds the rotating chairmanship of SADC, did not speak about the situation in Mozambique during his eight-minute closing remarks. He talked only about the conflict in eastern DRC. Since 2022, the Congolese army has been fighting a rebel army with the assistance of soldiers from some SADC countries. Speaking from Maputo via WhatsApp before Mnangagwa’s speech, Albino Forquilha of the Optimist Party for the Development of Mozambique (PODEMOS) — which is protesting together with supporters of Venancio Mondlane, the runner-up in last month's disputed presidential election — said they were not reading much into the SADC meeting. 'The PODEMOS party has mobilized people to protest the result that was announced by the electoral commission of Mozambique, which presented results which differ with those that were collected on the voting tables [polling stations],' Forquilha said. 'So, we are requesting fair elections. The constitutional court, which is the last institution to give results in a transparent manner — it’s important to call representatives of competing political parties when they validate the election. Everyone can accept them, because the [confirming] process of these two different numbers has been transparent. This is what we are requesting now.' Opposition parties in Mozambique disagree that FRELIMO’s candidate, Daniel Chapo, won the presidential election. In a state of the nation address on Tuesday, Nyusi invited the four presidential candidates for a dialogue as part of a bid to end post-election protests.	https://www.voanews.com/a/development-bloc-concerned-about-mozambique-s-post-election-violence-/7871296.html	2024-11-20T16:13:47-08:00

Sharing information 'is delivering freedom,' Jimmy Lai says at Hong Kong trial	washington — Wearing a gray jacket and flanked by prison officers, pro-democracy publisher Jimmy Lai smiled and waved to supporters Wednesday as he entered the Hong Kong courtroom. For his son, Sebastien, Lai's testimony at his national security trial hearing was a chance to see — from afar — how his 77-year-old father is doing. Sebastien Lai followed the hearing from Washington, where he has been advocating for his father's release. Lai's international legal team says the publisher has been denied access to specialized medical care for diabetes. Based on Wednesday's court appearance, Sebastien said it's clear that his father's physical health has worsened. 'It's incredibly heartbreaking that he spent the last almost four years in solitary confinement,' he said Wednesday during a press conference. After the press conference, Lai told VOA that it was 'bittersweet' to see that his father's mental health has remained strong, even as his physical health has worsened. 'His spirit is holding strong. His mind is holding strong,' Sebastien told VOA. Lai accused of sedition Jimmy Lai's court appearance on Wednesday marked the first time the former publisher provided testimony in a high-profile trial that started nearly one year ago. The case was initially expected to last about 80 days. His international legal team now expects the trial to continue into 2025. Lai is accused of collusion with foreign forces and sedition. The British national rejects the charges, but if convicted, he faces life in prison. Rights groups and foreign governments have condemned the case against Lai as politically motivated, which Hong Kong officials dispute. In a more than 700-word statement to VOA, a Hong Kong government spokesperson said it was 'inappropriate' to comment on the case because legal proceedings are ongoing. The spokesperson said that Hong Kong 'rejected any fact-twisting remarks and baseless smears against the legal system and safeguarding of rights and freedom in Hong Kong.' Publisher strived to deliver 'freedom' A one-time billionaire, Lai founded the Apple Daily newspaper in 1995. The newspaper closed in 2021 after authorities jailed its staff, raided its office, and froze millions of its assets. In court, Lai said he decided to get into the media business 'to participate in delivering information, which is delivering freedom.' 'The more information you have, the more you are in the know, the more you're free,' Lai said. 'The core values of Apple Daily are actually the core values of the people of Hong Kong,' Lai added. These values, he said, include the 'rule of law, freedom, pursuit of democracy, freedom of speech, freedom of religion, freedom of assembly.' Lai told the court that he opposed violence and 'never allowed' his newspaper's staff to advocate for Hong Kong independence, which he characterized as a 'conspiracy' and 'too crazy to think about.' Earlier in the trial, prosecutors alleged that Lai had requested that foreign governments, including the United States, impose sanctions or 'engage in other hostile activities' aimed at the Hong Kong or Chinese governments. In court, Lai testified that he had 'never' used his foreign contacts to influence foreign policy on Hong Kong. Lai's plight illustrates how press freedom and broader civil liberties have declined in Hong Kong following the implementation of Beijing's national security law in 2020, according to Caoilfhionn Gallagher KC, the head of Lai's international legal team. 'Jimmy Lai is on trial in Hong Kong, but journalism is on trial in Hong Kong, too,' Gallagher said Wednesday at the Washington press conference. Earlier this year, Hong Kong introduced a new law known as Article 23 that rights experts say will erode civil liberties even more. In September, two journalists from Hong Kong's now-shuttered Stand News were sentenced to jail for sedition. And this week, 45 pro-democracy activists were sentenced to prison under the national security law. Lai's case symbolizes the broader assault on freedoms taking place in Hong Kong, according to Gallagher. 'His case was designed to send a chill down the spine of anyone who might want to wear a T-shirt or sing a song or post a Tweet or say anything which might stand up to Hong Kong or Beijing's leaders,' Gallagher told VOA at the press conference. Lai's son 'cautiously optimisic' There are currently more than 1,900 political prisoners jailed in Hong Kong, according to the Washington-based nonprofit Hong Kong Democracy Council. Diplomatic pressure will be the key to securing Lai's release, Gallagher said. She cited this past August's historic prisoner swap between Russia and the United States, which included the release of American journalists Alsu Kurmasheva and Evan Gershkovich, as an example of the kind of creative thinking that is needed to help Lai. 'With creativity and political will, you can do what might seem impossible,' Gallagher said. Lai's son Sebastien said he remains 'cautiously optimistic' about the prospect of his father's freedom. 'I'm incredibly proud of what he's doing, and I think he knows that he's also doing the right thing,' Sebastien said.	https://www.voanews.com/a/sharing-information-is-delivering-freedom-jimmy-lai-says-at-hong-kong-trial/7871272.html	2024-11-20T15:29:41-08:00	
Lower turkey costs set table for cheaper US Thanksgiving feast this year	Inflation-weary consumers should see the cost of their classic Thanksgiving dinner gobble less of their paychecks this year, largely because Americans are buying less of the meal's centerpiece dish, turkey. The price tag of the traditional holiday meal, which also includes cranberries, sweet potatoes and stuffing, has dropped for a second consecutive year, according to the American Farm Bureau Federation's annual survey released on Wednesday. Cooks can thank the bird. Turkey prices dropped 6% on cooling demand as some consumers opted to add beef and pork to the menu, the Farm Bureau and market analysts said. Still, the meal's price tag will cost families about 19% more than pre-pandemic times, the Farm Bureau said. Frustration over high prices was seen as a major factor in Donald Trump's presidential election victory over Kamala Harris, but the Farm Bureau data suggests some of the worst inflation has abated. 'We are seeing modest improvements in the cost of a Thanksgiving dinner for a second year, but America's families, including farm families, are still being hurt by high inflation,' said Farm Bureau President Zippy Duvall. Cheaper meal The average cost for a 10-person meal came to $58.08, down from $61.17 last year and a record $64.05 in 2022, Farm Bureau data showed. The price of a turkey, which represents the bulk of the bill, fell even as supplies dropped 6% in 2024 partly because of a bird-flu outbreak. Turkey demand of 13.9 pounds per person in 2024 is down nearly a pound from 2023, according to the U.S. Agriculture Department. Like most grocery items, turkey prices rose alongside overall inflation in recent years, which may have spooked consumers in 2024, said Ashley Kohls, the Minnesota Turkey Growers Association's executive director. 'We're working on bringing folks back to purchasing turkey after a number of years of having elevated prices at the grocery store,' Kohls said. Indiana turkey farmer Greg Gunthorp said his customers appear to have plenty of supply to meet consumer demand this year. There have been far fewer frantic calls from buyers scrambling to restock, he said. 'We've had those outlier years when there just aren't enough turkeys to go around and our phones are just ringing off the hook. This is definitely not one of those years,' Gunthorp said. 'I think lots of people are adding items to the menu in addition to the turkey, things like brisket and ham.' The Farm Bureau survey found that the price of other ingredients in the Thanksgiving meal also fell, including the cost of fresh vegetables and whole milk, although the price of processed ingredients, such as dinner rolls and cubed stuffing, increased.	https://www.voanews.com/a/lower-turkey-costs-set-table-for-cheaper-us-thanksgiving-feast-this-year/7871291.html	2024-11-20T15:22:23-08:00	
About 1,500 migrants form US-bound caravan in Mexico	TAPACHULA, Mexico — About 1,500 migrants, mainly from Central and South America, formed a caravan Wednesday in southern Mexico, hoping to walk or catch rides to the U.S. border. Some say they are hoping to reach the United States before Donald Trump's inauguration in January, thinking it might be more difficult after that. They began walking from Tapachula, near the border with Guatemala, where thousands of migrants are stranded because they do not have permission to cross further into Mexico. What are migrant caravans? Migrant caravans began forming in 2018, and they became a final, desperate hope for poorer migrants who do not have the money to pay smugglers. If migrants try to cross Mexico alone or in small groups, they are often either detained by authorities and sent back to southern Mexico or, worse, deported to their home countries. In that sense, there is safety in numbers: It is hard or impossible for immigration agents to detain groups of hundreds of migrants. So, police and immigration agents often try to pick off smaller groups and wait for the main body of the caravan to tire itself out. Usually, the caravans stop or fall apart within 250 kilometers (150 miles). What are the obstacles? There is no safety in numbers against threats, extortion or abduction by drug cartels in Mexico, which have become heavily involved in migrant trafficking. The cartels charge migrants or their smugglers for permission to cross their territories along the border. In addition, the gangs often kidnap migrants, hold them in terrible conditions or torture them until they call relatives to send money for their release. The biggest obstacle, though, is the searing heat, dehydration and distance — it is over 1,770 kilometers (1,100 miles) from Tapachula to the nearest border crossing at Matamoros, across from Brownsville, Texas. And that is the shortest, but also one of the most dangerous routes. It would mean 16 days of walking, with no rest stops. And many of the migrants come with their children. Why do they set out? Since migrants usually cannot find work to support themselves in Tapachula, most of the foreigners trapped there are desperate to leave. Some feel a sense of urgency. 'It is going to be more difficult' after Trump's January 20 inauguration. 'That's why we are going — in hopes of getting an appointment quicker, so we are able to cross before he takes office,' said Yotzeli Peña, 23, a migrant from Venezuela. 'That would be easier.' Weren't there changes to keep caravans from forming? This year, in a bid to stop people from gathering at the border to claim asylum, the U.S. government expanded areas where migrants can apply online for appointments to enter the United States to a large swath of southern Mexico. The CBP One cellphone app was instituted to make asylum claims more orderly. About 1,450 appointments are made available daily, encouraging migrants to get an appointment before they show up at the border. But the service was available only in northern and central Mexico. By extending the app south to Tapachula, officials hoped it would stem the rush north. But some migrants still want to be close to the border so that if they do get one of the cherished appointments, they can get to it quickly and not risk missing it. Trump has promised to end the app, reduce legal pathways to the U.S. and organize mass deportations. Do caravans ever reach the border? The biggest caravans formed in 2018 and 2019, and back then Mexican officials helped some of the migrants by arranging buses to border cities. But that created a backlash in those communities. Groups from those original caravans eventually reached the border. In caravans since then, most participants have sought out as many hitchhiking or paid rides as they can and often swarm empty trucks to hitch a ride on empty freight platforms. But that has become much harder as Mexican authorities discouraged buses, taxis and trucks from stopping to pick up migrants. In recent years, authorities have eventually offered temporary transit permits to dissolve the caravans.	https://www.voanews.com/a/about-1-500-migrants-form-us-bound-caravan-in-mexico/7871284.html	2024-11-20T15:10:10-08:00	
Myanmar photojournalist goes free after two years of imprisonment, torture	washington — Photojournalist Kyaw Swa Tun, who was released last week from Yangon’s notorious Insein Prison after serving more than two years, has recounted the brutal treatment he endured at the hands of prison guards in an exclusive interview with VOA. 'When the authorities learned I was a journalist,' he said, 'I was isolated, tortured privately and subjected to threats of further harm if any news about the prison leaked out.' Having been accused of 'insulting the state,' Kyaw, 27, was sentenced to three years of hard labor in January 2023 under Section 505(a) of the penal code, one of several key amendments to Myanmar’s colonial-era penal code made after the 2021 coup. Section 505(a) is widely seen as one of the junta’s primary means for charging journalists, student leaders and civil servants seen as a threat to their military rule. As a photojournalist, Kyaw captured iconic images of protest as people nationwide demonstrated in the streets because of the military coup. Myanmar’s military junta has systematically targeted journalists, aiming to silence independent reporting and dissent. According to Reporters Without Borders (RSF), Myanmar has become one of the world’s largest jailers of journalists, with dozens arbitrarily detained under charges such as incitement or spreading 'fake news.' 2022 arrest Kyaw was arrested by military security forces at his home in Yangon on September 8, 2022. 'They found a message on my phone where I had contacted an ethnic armed group to verify some facts,' he told VOA. 'I always made sure to carefully delete all my messages and contact numbers, but on that day, I wasn’t able to delete that particular message.' At the time of his arrest, he was working with the VOA Burmese-affiliated news outlet, Mizzima, in their fact-checking department. Mizzima had been forced underground after the military junta revoked their operating license, along with several other popular media outlets, due to their coverage of anti-coup protests. Mizzima and DVB are now based in a neighboring country, broadcasting online. 'The authorities accused me of spreading false information as part of my work with Mizzima News Agency and other outlets,' he told VOA. After his arrest, Kyaw was taken to an interrogation center, where he was detained for more than a month before being sentenced and sent to Insein prison in November. He recalled being brutally beaten by the prison authorities upon arrival. 'When they found out I was a journalist, they beat me even more,' he said. Inside Insein Prison Arriving at Insein Prison, journalists like Kyaw were subjected to degrading treatment, 'including body and cavity searches upon arrival.' He was violently beaten at the prison entrance, where he was forced to kneel for 45 minutes. 'The conditions were appalling. Upwards of 30 prisoners were crammed into a cell designed for 10,' where some suffocated to death amid poor ventilation, he said. 'The food provided wasn’t enough to sustain even one person.' Several prominent figures associated with Myanmar’s ousted government and civil society have died while in detention or shortly after their release. Zaw Myint Maung, 72, a senior member of Myanmar’s former ruling party, the National League for Democracy, and a close ally of the ousted leader Aung San Suu Kyi, died last month while serving a prison sentence. He had been battling leukemia since 2019. Win Khaing, 73, a former minister in Aung San Suu Kyi’s government, died 10 days ago, shortly after being released from prison due to the poor treatment he endured during his incarceration. Similarly, award-winning documentary filmmaker Pe Maung Same, 50, died in August, just three days after his medical parole from a prison. According to his wife, Khin Suu Htay, he suffered severe complications from tuberculosis exacerbated by the torture he endured during his arrest in 2022 and the harsh conditions in detention. The military junta has not allowed the International Committee of the Red Cross, or ICRC, to visit prisons in Myanmar since the coup. 'We consistently urge the ICRC to take action,' said Ambassador Kyaw Moe Tun, Myanmar’s permanent representative to the United Nations, who spoke with VOA on Sunday. 'In the past, the ICRC has visited prisons, and during these visits, prisoners’ rights were upheld to some extent. We have observed that their presence helps ensure these rights are respected. We strongly call on the ICRC to protect political prisoners and prevent further violations of their rights.' Enduring impact Despite his release, Kyaw still suffers psychologically. 'I can no longer feel safe. At night, even the sound of a dog barking or the sight of a car can startle me,' said Kyaw. He added that imprisonment, poor living conditions and torture have taken a toll on his health. Myanmar ranks 171 out of 180 countries on the global Press Freedom Index, making it one of the world’s most oppressive environments for journalists. 'If not for China’s population size, Myanmar would lead in the number of journalists imprisoned relative to its population,' said Toe Zaw Latt, secretary-general of the Independent Press Council Myanmar, a group formed last year to help promote media freedom and safety for journalists reporting in the country. Research by the VOA Burmese Service indicates that approximately 40 journalists are imprisoned across Myanmar. Among them is VOA contributor Sithu Aung Myint, who was sentenced to 12 years in prison for 'sedition,' among other charges. He had been providing news analysis for a VOA Burmese weekly program until his arrest in August 2021. 'The junta has weaponized laws like Section 505(a) to suppress dissenting voices and control the narrative,' Toe Zaw Latt told VOA. 'This is a deliberate attempt to silence journalists and ensure that only the military’s version of the truth is disseminated.' Journalists and press freedom advocates are urging the international community to take stronger action. 'If the international community is serious about democracy and stability in Myanmar, they must support independent journalism,' Toe Zaw Latt said. 'Journalists are the messengers who expose atrocities and violence on the ground. Without them, the world would remain blind to the realities in Myanmar. Supporting them is not just about protecting individuals; it’s about safeguarding truth and democracy.'	https://www.voanews.com/a/myanmar-photojournalist-goes-free-after-two-years-of-imprisonment-torture/7871286.html	2024-11-20T15:08:05-08:00	
US House panel: No agreement on release of report on Trump's attorney general nominee	The U.S. House of Representatives Ethics Committee failed Wednesday to reach agreement on whether to release findings from its nearly finished investigative report on former Republican Representative Matt Gaetz, President-elect Donald Trump’s nominee for attorney general. The panel’s chair, Republican Representative Michael Guest, emerged from a lengthy committee meeting, saying, 'There was no agreement by the committee to release the report.' He declined further comment. The other nine committee members — four Republicans and five Democrats — also did not comment immediately. Gaetz was accused of sexual misconduct and illicit drug use before he was picked by Trump to become the country’s top law enforcement official in the new administration that takes office on January 20. Two news outlets, ABC News and The Washington Post, reported that the committee had obtained documents that showed Gaetz paid two women who appeared before the committee as witnesses a total of more than $10,000 between July 2017 and late January 2019. The women, who were over the age of 18 at the time of the payments, told the panel that some of the money was for sex. A Trump transition spokesman defended Gaetz in a statement. 'The Justice Department received access to roughly every financial transaction Matt Gaetz ever undertook and came to the conclusion that he committed no crime. These leaks are meant to undermine the mandate from the people to reform the Justice Department,' with Gaetz at the head of the agency, the spokesman said. Several U.S. senators, Democrats and Republicans alike, are demanding that the report be released so they can consider the scope of Gaetz’s background as they undertake their constitutionally mandated role of confirming or rejecting a new president’s Cabinet nominees. Hours after Trump named him as a nominee, Gaetz, 42, resigned from Congress, even though he had just been reelected to a fifth term. His resignation ended the House Ethics Committee’s investigation, which had been nearing a conclusion. It remained uncertain whether the panel would divulge what conclusions lawmakers had reached. With the allegations hovering over him, Gaetz quickly became Trump’s most controversial selection for his Cabinet, although the president-elect has continued to support him and has been making calls to lawmakers to bolster his chances of confirmation. Gaetz was in the Capitol Wednesday to meet with some of the senators who will decide his fate. The Senate has not voted to reject a presidential nominee for a Cabinet position since 1989, with members of both political parties giving wide deference to new presidents to fill top-level jobs with appointees of their choosing. Republican Senator Lindsey Graham said he met with Gaetz and Vice President-elect JD Vance, still a sitting senator, and told them there would be 'no rubber stamps, no lynch mobs' in the confirmation process. 'These allegations will be dealt with in committee, but [Gaetz] deserves a chance to confront his accusers,' Graham told reporters. The Justice Department investigated the allegations against him but last year declined to bring any charges. Senate Democrats on the Judiciary Committee that will consider the Gaetz nomination asked the FBI to release the evidentiary file from its investigation. That material would include interviews with a woman who said she was paid to have sex with Gaetz when she was 17. Gaetz has denied the accusations. Representative Dean Phillips, a Democrat who previously served on the House Ethics Committee, said Gaetz's situation — a former member of Congress nominated for one of the most powerful jobs in the U.S. government — is an argument in favor of releasing the report. 'He's not just gone [from the House]. He's now been nominated for a very important position in this country, which is the chief legal officer, if you will, of the country. It would seem bizarre and incongruent with any ethical principle to not release it,' Phillips said. House Speaker Mike Johnson, who leads the narrow Republican majority in the House, has said he is opposed to the release of the as-yet unfinished report by the House Ethics Committee because Gaetz is no longer a member of Congress. But reports about wrongdoing by other former members of Congress have been released in a few instances in the past. Ultimately, the Senate, which Republicans will control by at least a 52-48 margin next year, will decide whether to confirm Gaetz, who has never worked at the Justice Department or served as a prosecutor at any level of government. But Gaetz, like other Trump nominees for top government jobs, has been a vocal supporter of the president and his Make America Great Again agenda. Gaetz, however, angered some fellow Republican lawmakers in the House in 2023 by spearheading the effort to oust then-House Speaker Kevin McCarthy, who eventually was replaced by Johnson.	https://www.voanews.com/a/us-house-panel-no-agreement-on-release-of-report-on-trump-s-attorney-general-nominee/7871276.html	2024-11-20T14:55:20-08:00	
Some US weapons may be delivered to Ukraine after Biden's term ends, Pentagon says	Some U.S. weapons deliveries to Ukraine may take place after President Joe Biden's term ends in January, Pentagon officials tell VOA, noting it will take time for certain capabilities to arrive in Ukraine. 'As you know, some equipment and some systems can get to Ukraine very quickly, and you've seen that happen within days or weeks. Sometimes, it does take longer … and that could be longer than weeks; that could be months,' Pentagon Deputy Press Secretary Sabrina Singh said November 14 in response to a question from VOA. Singh noted that under the Ukraine Security Assistance Initiative, or USAI, weapon deliveries could take years. 'The long and short of it is, is that some equipment does get to Ukraine exceptionally quickly. But then there are some that take longer,' she said. The United States has remaining funds for two main programs supporting Ukraine’s defense — PDA, or Presidential Drawdown Authority, and USAI. The first program allows weapons to be provided from existing U.S. stockpiles, ensuring faster delivery. The second program involves purchasing weapons from industry, a process that can take longer. As of November, the U.S. has around $9 billion left for military assistance for Ukraine, the Pentagon has reported. Of this, approximately $7 billion is available under the PDA program, including around $4 billion approved by Congress in April and an additional $2.8 billion made available after accounting adjustments by the Department of Defense. Some $2.2 billion is available through the USAI program. On November 20, the U.S. announced an additional security assistance package for Ukraine valued at $275 million. It included munitions for rocket systems, artillery rounds and anti-tank weapons. Pentagon officials have confirmed to VOA that the Department of Defense is committed to allocating all remaining PDA funds authorized by Congress before January 20 and additional funds made available due to recalculations. The exact total will depend on ongoing assessments of Ukraine's defense needs and the logistics of assistance delivery. U.S. Secretary of Defense Lloyd Austin has said that some weapons deliveries to Ukraine could take time. 'Everything won't be delivered immediately,' he told reporters during a visit to Italy in October. 'Things that we're purchasing now, for example, may wind up showing up a couple of months later.' The secretary added that some materiel from U.S. stocks is refurbished before being delivered to Ukraine. 'And again, it's not instantaneous, it may take weeks or in some cases, a couple of months,' he said. Austin underscored that the Pentagon has provided a plan to the Ukrainians and is confident that weapon deliveries will proceed according to the expected schedule. If the incoming Trump administration decided to stop some remaining deliveries, they could do so. In this case, however, they would have to de-obligate aid that was previously obligated by the Biden administration, Austin said last month in Italy. On November 12, Pentagon spokesperson Major General Pat Ryder said that between the passage of the supplemental funding by Congress in April and the middle of October, the U.S. has delivered 83% of committed munitions from its stockpiles, 67% of other critical air defense commitments and 60% of artillery and close air support capabilities. 'Since the passage of the supplemental, we've delivered hundreds of thousands of artillery rounds, thousands of armored vehicles, thousands of munitions for HIMARS and antitank weapons, dozens of artillery systems, significant air defense capabilities, including a Patriot battery, hundreds of interceptors and dozens of other systems,' Ryder said. 'And together with our allies and partners, the deliveries of the strategic air defense system we committed to providing at the NATO summit are nearly completed,' he said.	https://www.voanews.com/a/some-us-weapons-may-be-delivered-to-ukraine-after-biden-term-ends-pentagon-says/7871204.html	2024-11-20T13:31:48-08:00	
Trump picks former acting attorney general as US envoy to NATO	U.S. President-elect Donald Trump on Wednesday named Matt Whitaker, a former acting attorney general from his first presidency, as the U.S. ambassador to NATO, the cornerstone Western military alliance whose member countries Trump has criticized for not spending enough money on defense. In a statement, Trump described Whitaker, 55, as 'a strong warrior and loyal patriot' who 'will ensure the United States' interests are advanced and defended' and 'strengthen relationships with our NATO allies and stand firm in the face of threats to peace and stability.' As with several of Trump’s choices for positions in his new administration, the nomination of Whitaker to the 32-country North Atlantic Treaty Organization based in Brussels is unusual in that his professional background does not match the job to which he is being named. Whitaker has a long career as a lawyer but is not steeped in foreign or military policy. Whitaker, like numerous other Trump appointees, has been an ardent Trump loyalist. Whitaker has been a vocal critic of the two federal criminal cases brought against Trump that are now likely to be erased as he assumes power again on January 20. During his first administration, Trump goaded other NATO countries that did not meet the alliance’s military spending goal: 2% of their national economic output. As he left office in 2021, six of the NATO countries were spending that much on defense. But 23 of the 32 do now as the threat of Russian aggression against nearby NATO countries mounted after Moscow’s 2022 invasion of Ukraine, which is not a NATO country but wants to join. During his presidency, Trump assailed the countries who were not spending enough on defense, saying they were in arrears in their 'dues' to NATO. 'NATO was busted until I came along,' Trump said at a political rally earlier this year. 'I said, ‘Everybody’s going to pay.’' Trump said that 'one of the presidents of a big country' at one point asked him whether the U.S. would still defend the country if they were invaded by Russia even if they 'don’t pay.' 'I said, ‘Absolutely not.’ They couldn’t believe the answer.' 'No, I would not protect you,' Trump recalled saying to that president. 'In fact, I would encourage them to do whatever the hell they want. You got to pay. You got to pay your bills.' Under the NATO treaty, member nations are obligated to protect each other militarily if they are attacked. The obligation has been invoked only once in the 75-year history of the alliance that was formed in the aftermath of World War II. That was when other NATO countries joined the United States in fighting al-Qaida in Afghanistan after the terrorist group attacked the U.S. in 2001, killing nearly 3,000 people. Whitaker, a former federal prosecutor in the Midwestern state of Iowa, served as acting attorney general between November 2018 and February 2019, as special counsel Robert Mueller's investigation into Russian interference in the 2016 presidential election was ending. Before then, Whitaker was chief of staff to Trump's first attorney general, Jeff Sessions, before being picked to replace his boss after Sessions was fired amid Trump’s lingering outrage over his decision to withdraw from the Russia investigation. Whitaker held the acting attorney general position for several months without Senate confirmation, until William Barr was confirmed as attorney general in February 2019. Other appointments Trump has been making new top appointments to his nascent administration on an almost daily basis. Late Tuesday, he named Linda McMahon as his nominee to lead the Education Department, even though Trump and some Republican lawmakers want to abolish the agency and hand over most education policy decisions and much of the current federal funding to state and local control. McMahon served as the head of the Small Business Administration during Trump’s previous term in office and is well known for her decadeslong role, along with her husband, in helping lead World Wrestling Entertainment. 'Linda will use her decades of leadership experience, and deep understanding of both education and business, to empower the next generation of American students and workers and make America number one in education in the world,' Trump said in a statement. 'We will send education back to the states, and Linda will spearhead that effort.' Also on Tuesday, Trump announced he’d nominate Wall Street financier Howard Lutnick as commerce secretary in his new administration. Additionally, the president-elect picked Dr. Mehmet Oz, a longtime television show host, as administrator of the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services, the agency that oversees the government’s two key health insurance programs for older Americans and impoverished people. Trump backed Oz’s failed attempt to win a Senate seat in Pennsylvania in 2022.	https://www.voanews.com/a/trump-picks-former-acting-attorney-general-as-us-envoy-to-nato/7871097.html	2024-11-20T12:22:45-08:00

Nigeria's Mining Week sharpens focus on long-neglected sector	Abuja, Nigeria — Nigeria concluded a three-day conference Wednesday to mark National Mining Week. Authorities in the West African nation have been seeking to expand investments in the mining industry in a bid to diversify the economy, amid the global surge in demand for minerals. The conference, attended by government officials, mining industry players and international investors, was part of the Nigerian government's campaign to boost not only mining, but also local processing of the minerals extracted. Earlier this year, the Nigerian government said new investors will be required to set up local processing plants if they want to obtain a mining license. Mary Ogbe, permanent secretary of the mining and solid minerals industry, spoke about the impending changes. 'Before now, people will come in, cart away our minerals and go and refine [them] and bring [them] back and then we're paying so much on what belongs to us,' she said. 'Now, with the local value addition, no one is allowed to legally carry out our products without adding value. Now, this is creating jobs.' Nigeria has rich deposits of more than 40 minerals, including tin, iron ore, lead, zinc and gold. The country is also a new source of lithium, a metal used in batteries and electric vehicles. But the country's minerals are often illegally exploited and exported without generating much revenue locally. At the summit authorities pledged to address the problem by investing in mining technologies, surveillance, data gathering, community enlightenment and enforcement of mining laws. In March, authorities deployed 2,500 agents to police unauthorized mining activities. This week, the government said the 'Mining Marshal Corps' has arrested more than 300 illegal miners, including foreign nationals. But economist and founder of the Center for Social Justice Eze Onyekpere said authorities are still not doing enough to boost income from the mining sector. 'It's been a mantra of successive governments to improve government revenue by diversifying into the solid minerals sector, but we're getting very infinitesimal sum of money from solid minerals mining,' he said. 'And it's not as if we don't have enough solid minerals or that mining is not taking place, it is because solid minerals mining has been converted to a criminal activity especially in those areas where there's security threats and crisis but the federal government has not taken it seriously.' Despite the government's lofty goals, the mining sector contributed only about 0.77% of Nigeria’s GDP last year. Onyekpere says until the government gets more serious, Nigeria's mining industry will not be able to reach its potential.	https://www.voanews.com/a/nigeria-mining-week-sharpens-focus-on-long-neglected-sector/7870991.html	2024-11-20T11:21:13-08:00	
Too little too late? Ukrainians react to US permission to strike deep into Russia	Many Ukrainians welcome the U.S. decision to let Ukraine use U.S.-supplied missiles to strike deep into Russian territory.

Xi, Lula elevate China-Brazil ties in state visit	BRASILIA, BRAZIL — Chinese President Xi Jinping and his Brazilian counterpart Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva said on Wednesday they had raised the status of their countries' global strategic partnership during a state visit on a regional tour showing Beijing's growing diplomatic clout. Xi and Lula said the China-Brazil relationship had become a 'Community with a Shared Future for a More Just World and Sustainable Planet' — expanding a key slogan from the Chinese president — in a news conference at the presidential residence. They also agreed to find 'synergies' between the Chinese Belt and Road Initiative and Brazilian development programs, after Lula had declined to formally enroll Brazil in China's global infrastructure initiative. The leaders signed nearly 40 cooperation agreements to strengthen ties between the two economies with more than $150 billion of bilateral trade, Lula said. 'This is another historic moment in the development of China-Brazil relations,' said Xi, adding that China was ready to make them 'golden partners.' Xi uses the term 'Community with a Shared Future' to formalize what Beijing sees as a positive and wide-ranging bilateral relationship with a country sharing geopolitical and economic interests. China has used the slogan in the past year to describe ties with countries such as Vietnam and Serbia. The state visit in Brasilia came after twin summits for Xi in one week: the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation forum in Lima and the Group of 20 major economies in Rio de Janeiro. While Xi played a central role at both summits, U.S. President Joe Biden arrived as a lame duck with just two months left in the White House and little room for lasting pledges, as his successor Donald Trump vows a total foreign policy overhaul. A group portrait on the first day of the G20 summit captured the moment, with Xi front and center, next to the presidents of Brazil, India and South Africa — China's partners in the BRICS group of major developing nations and the three consecutive G20 hosts from 2023 to 2025. Biden missed that photo op for 'logistical reasons,' the White House said. With Biden diminished and Trump averse to multilateral forums, diplomats and foreign policy experts said Xi's charm offensive was filling a vacuum in an unsettled global order. China's side meetings with Western powers amid trade and geopolitical tensions, from the United States and Britain to France and Germany, showed a conciliatory turn from Beijing ahead of four more rocky years facing down Trump, said Li Xing, a professor at the Guangdong Institute for International Strategies. 'China's strategy is clear; the posture it is displaying is to let go of past resentment,' said Li. 'This is definitely an adjustment, and it's all because this year's G20 summit is in a transition period following the U.S. election.' Behind the scenes, several diplomats who had been part of previous G20 summits noticed an evolving posture from the Chinese — less focused on their own narrow interests and more proactive about forging a wider consensus. 'China is much more participative and much more constructive,' said one Brazilian diplomat, requesting anonymity to discuss the negotiations. A European diplomat noted that Chinese peers helped to build consensus this year on several fronts, including topics such as women's rights in which they had not been traditionally active. It looked like a conscious move to occupy a multilateral forum that Trump is likely to neglect, the diplomat added. 'A place left unoccupied will be occupied by another,' said the European diplomat. 'Apparently China is interested in occupying more than it has to date.'	https://www.voanews.com/a/xi-lula-elevate-china-brazil-ties-in-state-visit/7870896.html	2024-11-20T10:20:20-08:00	
Zambia's Catholic bishops raise concern over rights violations	LUSAKA, ZAMBIA — In Zambia, Catholic bishops raised the alarm this week about increased arrests and prolonged detentions of opposition leaders. In a letter signed by all 11 of the country’s Catholic bishops, they lamented what they called significant restrictions on democratic freedom, illustrated by charges being brought against at least six opposition leaders, as well as journalists and civil society activists, for political activities. The Zambia Conference of Catholic Bishops, the church’s national leadership body, released a pastoral letter Sunday. It said the church is alarmed by gross violations of human rights and undemocratic tendencies by the Zambian government. The group’s president, Kasama Archbishop Ignatius Chama, said, 'Even more alarming is the disturbing trend by the police of keeping suspects in detention for a period more than prescribed by the law.' Hate speech penalties Chama urged authorities to withdraw a penal code amendment bill being considered by parliament to allow for further consultations. According to the National Assembly website, the bill is aimed at increasing penalties for hate speech. Introducing the bill in June, President Hakainde Hichilema said certain sections of society were promoting hate speech against some tribes, which he said could cause civil strife. He said the proposed law would help ensure that perpetrators were given stiffer punishments and deter others. However, the bishops said the proposals would undermine fundamental freedoms needed to ensure democracy. Jackson Silavwe, a spokesperson for the United Kwacha Alliance, a network of 10 opposition political parties, told VOA that the Catholic Church has shown commitment to being the voice of the voiceless in Zambia. 'We commend the ZCCB for its courageous and principled stance in addressing these critical issues, which resonate with the cries of many Zambians yearning for justice, equity and peace in our nation,' Silavwe said. Government response Zambia‘s chief government spokesperson, Cornelius Mweetwa, told journalists Tuesday that the government is studying the contents of the letter. 'The church are all-weather partners of government, and where they raise issues of concern, we shall not be in a hurry to respond to them,' Mweetwa said. 'We would like to internalize and be able to consult widely.' University of Zambia lecturer and political scientist Boniface Cheembe emphasized the need for the church and government to strengthen dialogue and address issues of mutual interest. In August 2024, senior United Nations human rights officials issued a report that concluded the restrictions and arrests of political opponents in Zambia has had a chilling effect on freedom of opinion, association and assembly in the country and has stunted the building of democratic institutions.	https://www.voanews.com/a/zambia-s-catholic-bishops-raise-concern-over-rights-violations/7870859.html	2024-11-20T10:00:27-08:00	
China reclaims position as second-largest donor to Pacific Islands, report finds	China has surpassed the United States and regained its place as the second-largest bilateral donor to the Pacific Islands, according to a new report published Wednesday by the Lowy Institute. Australia remains the largest donor. Every year, the Lowy Institute, an Australia-based research group, releases a Pacific Aid Map that tracks loans and grants to the region in detail. The 2024 map includes spending in the Pacific from 2008 to 2022. Over the past decade, China has invested billions of dollars in Pacific Island nations in a bid to increase influence in the region amid competition with the U.S. and its allies. Following a reduction in investment during the COVID-19 pandemic in 2020, China resumed its focus on projects in the Pacific Islands in 2022, the last year covered in the report. 'Beijing has emerged from a pandemic-induced lull with a more competitive, politically targeted model of aid engagement,' reported Lowy Institute in its annual Pacific Aid Map. 'China’s ODF [overseas development finance] has acquired a more targeted focus on winning influence in specific countries, involving more grants and community-level outreach.' While total development finance from all countries to the islands fell by 18% in 2022 in the midst of the global pandemic, according to the report, China increased its financing that year by 6% with support of $256 million dollars. That was up nearly 14% from three years earlier. 'The uptick in Chinese spending has been accompanied by a resurgence in new Chinese project commitments, signaling a revival in its ambition to engage in major infrastructure works in the Pacific,' the report said. Australia is the largest financier for the Pacific Island nations, contributing $1.5 billion, while the United States ranks third, allocating $249 million. From 2008-2016, Chinese banks lent more than $1.1 billion to the region, which raised concerns that the area may become increasingly vulnerable to diplomatic pressure from Beijing. The report says, recently, China has taken a more strategic approach toward their financing, shifting away from funding through debt towards financing through large grants and community-level projects. 'China has opted for a new double-pronged approach relying on large-scale grant financing, rather than loans, and high-frequency embassy activity in priority countries,' the report said. 'This reflects a more competitive and politically attuned method to regional engagement.' China sees itself as a development partner with Pacific Island nations and has previously stressed that its aid comes with no political conditions attached. Examples of community-level projects cited in the report include 'vehicle donations to local governments, cash grants to schools, and the gifting of agricultural equipment to local farmers.' Despite this shift in aid strategies, China has still engaged in potentially risky debt financing such as in the Solomon Islands and Vanuatu, where, according to the report, 'debt risks have significantly worsened over the past five years.' 'The lack of transparency around these loans [to the Solomon Islands and Vanuatu] and uncertainty regarding the efficacy of the projects they finance undermine aspects of China’s own debt sustainability frameworks and risk further degrading the political economy of many Pacific Island countries,' the report said. The report says geopolitical motives were a factor in how China decided to provide aid. 'China’s aid involvement in the Pacific has grown to pursue various objectives but reinforcing the ‘One China’ policy remains a key motivating factor in its regional engagement, emphasizing that Taiwan is part of China, with Beijing as the sole legitimate government,' the report added. 'Consequently, countries can only diplomatically recognize — and thus receive aid and development funding from — one of the two governments.' In 2022, self-ruled Taiwan dropped out of the top 10 donors to the Pacific Islands, spending $7.2 million, after several nations severed diplomatic ties with Taipei and switched to Beijing, according to the report. Some material in this report came from Reuters and Agence France-Presse.	https://www.voanews.com/a/china-reclaims-position-as-second-largest-donor-to-pacific-islands-report-finds/7870835.html	2024-11-20T09:23:22-08:00	
Man convicted of murder in killing of Georgia nursing student Laken Riley	athens, georgia — A Venezuelan man has been convicted of murder in the killing of Georgia nursing student Laken Riley, a case that fueled the national debate over immigration during this year's presidential race. Jose Ibarra was charged with murder and other crimes in Riley's February death, and the guilty verdict was reached Wednesday by Athens-Clarke County Superior Court Judge H. Patrick Haggard. Ibarra, 26, had waived his right to a jury trial, meaning that Haggard alone heard and decided the case. Riley's family and roommates cried as the verdict was read. Ibarra didn't visibly react. The killing added fuel to the national debate over immigration when federal authorities said Ibarra illegally entered the U.S. in 2022 and was allowed to stay in the country while he pursued his immigration case. The trial began Friday, and prosecutors called more than a dozen law enforcement officers, Riley's roommates and a woman who lived in the same apartment as Ibarra. Defense attorneys called a police officer, a jogger and one of Ibarra's neighbors on Tuesday and rested their case Wednesday morning. Prosecutor Sheila Ross told the judge that Ibarra encountered Riley while she was running on the University of Georgia campus on Feb. 22 and killed her during a struggle. Riley, 22, was a student at Augusta University College of Nursing, which also has a campus in Athens, about 70 miles (115 kilometers) east of Atlanta. Defense attorney Dustin Kirby said in his opening that Riley's death was a tragedy and called the evidence in the case graphic and disturbing. But he said there was not sufficient evidence to prove that his client killed Riley. Riley's parents, roommates and other friends and family packed the courtroom throughout the trial.	https://www.voanews.com/a/7870837.html	2024-11-20T09:22:56-08:00	
Mozambique president wants talks to end weeks of post-election unrest	Maputo, Mozambique — In a state of the nation address late Tuesday, outgoing Mozambican President Filipe Nyusi invited the four presidential candidates for a dialogue as part of a bid to end post-election unrest that has left several people dead and dozens of others injured. Protesters say the October 9 election won by ruling party candidate Daniel Chapo was rigged. The government denies that accusation. Nyusi said the demonstrations are having a negative impact on the economy, as they limit the activities of companies and ports and increase unemployment, among other issues. He said in his address that he will work to pacify Mozambique until the last day of his term, but he needs all Mozambicans to come together to solve the problems. He also hoped that, by meeting with the four candidates from the recent election, they could find a solution that benefits the country. At least 30 people are reported to have died during the post-election violence that flared after electoral officials said Chapo, of the ruling Frelimo party, won the presidential election with more than 60% of the vote. Venancio Mondlane, the independent candidate who came in second with 20%, challenged the result and called for nationwide protests. International observers say the election was marred by irregularities. Nyusi’s invitation to the dialogue comes a few days after the Attorney General’s Office filed cases against Venancio Mondlane and his PODEMOS party to compensate the state for property damage caused during protests. Human rights activist Adriano Nuvunga said the president is trying to prod Mondlane into dialogue while refusing to acknowledge the protesters’ grievances. The president has repeatedly called for protesters to wait until the Constitutional Council validates the election results. Nuvunga expressed skepticism over the dialogue, which he said is carried out with sticks through legal proceedings. He said the president’s call for a meeting did not seem genuine, adding Nyusi has been hiding behind the Constitutional Council for a long time, which has discredited the legitimacy of the results. Mondlane holds historical ruling Frelimo figures responsible for issues troubling the country, including widespread poverty and high rates of youth unemployment. But Methodist Bishop Dinis Matsolo said dialogue is the best way to calm the country and move forward. In a telephone interview, Matsolo told VOA that Mozambique needs credible elections to achieve domestic peace. 'What is happening now is the consequence of bad mismanagement of the electoral process, so it is very crucial that people should talk and put things right,' Matsolo said. 'If we look at the whole thing, the whole electoral process is not well conducted in the country and that creates a lot of anxiety.' So far, none of the four candidates have accepted the president’s offer to hold talks. Chapo is scheduled to be inaugurated in January.	https://www.voanews.com/a/mozambique-president-wants-talks-to-end-weeks-of-post-election-unrest-/7870828.html	2024-11-20T09:20:50-08:00	
Protesters scuffle with police in Serbia as they demand arrests over a deadly roof collapse	belgrade, serbia — Scuffles erupted for a second day Wednesday in a northern Serbian city between police and opposition protesters demanding arrests over a deadly roof collapse at the city's railway station earlier this month. Anti-government protesters sought to block a courthouse in Novi Sad, where the roof collapse at the station on Nov. 1 killed 15 people and injured two others. Riot police pushed the protesters away from the building. A similar opposition action on Tuesday resulted in an hours-long standoff. The collapse in Novi Sad has triggered a wave of protests against the populist authorities and arrests of several activists who have taken part. Many in Serbia believe rampant corruption led to sloppy renovation work at the station and consequently to the roof collapse. Serbia's Interior Minister Ivica Dacic on Wednesday warned protesters in a statement that police 'won't tolerate disruption of public law and order, threats to the security of the country and state institutions, as well as attacks on police.' Separately, police detained two activists in Belgrade who were protesting against plans to demolish a World War II-era bridge that carries trams as well as vehicle traffic over the Sava river between the new and old parts of the city. Authorities plan to build a new bridge in its place, a process that will take at least three years. Opposition activists say the existing bridge should be preserved and that the process of awarding contracts for the building work lacks transparency. In Novi Sad, a group of opposition lawmakers managed to enter the court building on Wednesday while police pushed away others who were standing outside. Protesters are also demanding the release from detention of activists jailed during the recent protests over the collapse. The huge concrete outer roof of the railway station building suddenly crashed on Nov. 1, falling on people sitting on benches or standing below. Initially 14 people died and three were severely injured but one of the injured people died on Sunday. The authorities have promised a thorough investigation and Serbia's construction minister, Goran Vesic, resigned shortly after the tragedy. Populist President Aleksandar Vucic has said more resignations will follow, and on Wednesday a former construction minister now in charge of trade, Tomislav Momirovic, also said he was stepping down. No one has been arrested, however, and no charges have been brought, though prosecutors said dozens of people have been questioned as part of the probe. The station was originally built in 1964 and was renovated twice in recent years as part of a wider agreement with Chinese state construction companies.	https://www.voanews.com/a/protesters-scuffle-with-police-in-serbia-as-they-demand-arrests-over-a-deadly-roof-collapse-/7870817.html	2024-11-20T09:15:21-08:00	
Fearful after arrest, Cambodian reporter who exposed scam centers quits media	BANGKOK — The announcement by Cambodian journalist Mech Dara that he will quit journalism after his recent arrest shows how effective legal threats are in silencing media, say analysts. Dara, who worked for several media outlets, made a name for himself as an investigative reporter, including by exposing illegal scam centers that operate in Cambodia and have links to powerful interests. In September, authorities arrested the journalist and charged him with incitement related to social media posts. He spent over 30 days in pretrial detention and could still face up to two years in prison if convicted. The arrest of one of Cambodia’s best-known journalists brought an outpouring of protest from the international community. Dara acknowledged that support when he was released on bail on October 24. But in an interview with the Agence France-Presse not long after, the journalist said he had 'no more courage' and planned to quit journalism. In the interview, Dara said he was 'still afraid' after the arrest and questioning. Experts have long said that jailing journalists or threatening legal action has become an effective way to silence reporting. For analysts, Dara’s case, coming after a yearslong crackdown on media, underscores the challenges for media working in difficult environments. 'Dara’s decision to quit journalism speaks volumes about the state of press freedom in Cambodia,' Beh Lih Yi, the Asia program coordinator at the Committee to Protect Journalists, told VOA via email. 'It is worrying that Cambodia is losing more and more independent journalists. The right thing for Cambodia to do is to allow the media to operate and report freely in the country,' she said. VOA contacted the Cambodian government’s press office and its Ministry of Foreign Affairs for comment by email but didn’t receive a reply. Cambodia’s press freedom environment has declined rapidly since 2017, when pressure from the government led to more than 30 independent news outlets closing and several journalists being detained. In the years since, other journalists have been imprisoned for charges that include false news or incitement over their coverage or social media posts. In 2023, three media outlets were stripped of their licences. One of them, Voice of Democracy, was one of the country’s last independent media outlets. Nop Vy, the executive director at CamboJA, the Cambodian Journalist Alliance, said the number of reporters being targeted is growing. 'Legal threat has increased more than double if compared to the 9-month report last year and this year released by CamboJA,' Vy told VOA via email. 'Some journalists who have been [actively] reporting on deforestation, land conflict, illegal logging, human rights issues, have experiences with court cases which more or less have created more challenges for them,' he said. Since the start of the year, CamboJa has recorded 28 cases of harassment, including legal intimidation. Alongside legal threats, journalists covering the scam centers that Dara helped to expose have previously told VOA of the security risks they encountered. Jacob Sims, an expert on transnational crime, said that Dara’s arrest concluded a crackdown on independent journalists who reported on the scam center issues. '[Dara’s] arrest can only be viewed as a 2½-year project of systematic repression,' Sims told an event at the Foreign Correspondents’ Club of Thailand in November. Aleksandra Bielakowska, advocacy officer at media watchdog Reporters Without Borders, known as RSF, said arrests send a chilling message to other journalists. 'By repressing journalists such as Mech Dara, the Cambodian government sent a chilling message and directly threatens any remaining independent journalists in the country,' she told VOA. 'The Cambodian government draws inspiration from the practices of other authoritarian regimes, which views journalists as mouthpieces for authorities,' she said, adding that it 'suppresses any independent voices.' According to the RSF latest press freedom index, Asia is the second-most difficult region for journalism. Four countries in the region — Myanmar, China, North Korea and Vietnam — are among the world’s 10 most repressive countries for media. Cambodia ranks 151 out of 180 on the Press Freedom Index, where 1 shows the best environment.	https://www.voanews.com/a/fearful-after-arrest-cambodian-reporter-who-exposed-scam-centers-quits-media/7870797.html	2024-11-20T09:07:28-08:00	
Strike blamed on Israel kills 36 in historic Palmyra, Syrian media say	DAMASCUS, SYRIA — Syria's state-run media said a strike on the country's historic town of Palmyra on Wednesday killed 36 people and wounded more than 50, an attack that Damascus has blamed on Israel. The Israeli military declined to comment. The news agency SANA said the strikes also led to 'significant material damage to the targeted buildings and the surrounding area. Palmyra is known for the historic Roman temple complex nearby. Israel frequently targets military sites and facilities associated with Iran-linked groups in Syria but rarely acknowledges the strikes. The death toll from Wednesday's strike was unusually high. It was not immediately clear if the ruins were damaged. The temple complex already suffered significant damage years ago amid the Islamic State group's rampage across Syria. In 2015, the world watched in horror as the militants blew up an iconic arch and temple in Palmyra. Since the Islamic State lost its hold on the area, restoration work on the site has been held up by security issues, leftover IS land mines and lack of funding. The strike in Syria comes as negotiations are underway for a potential cease-fire between Israel and the Hezbollah militant group in Lebanon, but it is unclear if the cease-fire would include Syria.	https://www.voanews.com/a/strike-blamed-on-israel-kills-36-in-historic-palmyra-syrian-media-say/7870732.html	2024-11-20T08:16:14-08:00	
Danish military says it’s staying close to Chinese ship after data cable breaches	STOCKHOLM — The Danish military said on Wednesday that it was staying close to a Chinese ship currently sitting idle in Danish waters, days after two fiber-optic data telecommunication cables in the Baltic Sea were severed. Chinese bulk carrier Yi Peng 3 was anchored in the Kattegat strait between Denmark and Sweden on Wednesday, with a Danish navy patrol ship at anchor nearby, MarineTraffic vessel tracking data showed. 'The Danish Defence can confirm that we are present in the area near the Chinese ship Yi Peng 3,' the military said in a post on social media platform X, adding it had no further comments. It is rare for Denmark's military to comment publicly on individual vessels traveling in Danish waters. It did not mention the cable breaches or say why it was staying with the ship. The Chinese ship left the Russian port of Ust-Luga on November 15 and was in the areas where the cable damages occurred, according to traffic data, which showed other ships to also have been in the areas. One cable running between Sweden and Lithuania was cut on Sunday, and another one between Finland and Germany was severed less than 24 hours later. The breaches happened in Sweden's exclusive economic zone, and Swedish prosecutors started a preliminary investigation Tuesday on suspicion of possible sabotage. Swedish Civil Defence Minister Carl-Oskar Bohlin told Reuters on Tuesday that the country's armed forces and coast guard had picked up ship movements that corresponded with the interruption of two telecoms cables in the Baltic Sea. A Chinese government spokesperson told a daily news briefing on Wednesday that it always required its vessels to abide by relevant laws and regulations. 'We also attach great importance to the protection of seabed infrastructure and, together with the international community, we are actively promoting the construction and protection of submarine cables and other global information infrastructures,' the spokesperson said. Russia dismissed on Wednesday any suggestion that it had been involved in damaging the two cables. European governments accused Russia on Tuesday of escalating hybrid attacks on Ukraine's Western allies, but they stopped short of directly accusing Russia of destroying the cables. Asked about the matter on Wednesday, Kremlin spokesperson Dmitry Peskov told a regular news briefing: 'It is quite absurd to continue to blame Russia for everything without any reason.'	https://www.voanews.com/a/danish-military-says-it-s-staying-close-to-chinese-ship-after-data-cable-breaches/7870679.html	2024-11-20T07:44:45-08:00	
Spain will legalize hundreds of thousands of undocumented migrants	MADRID — Spain will legalize about 300,000 undocumented migrants a year, starting next May and through 2027, the country's migration minister said Wednesday. The policy aims to expand the aging country's workforce and allow foreigners living in Spain without proper documentation to obtain work permits and residency. Spain has largely remained open to receiving migrants even as other European nations seek to tighten their borders to illegal crossings and asylum seekers. Spain needs around 250,000 registered foreign workers a year to maintain its welfare state, Migration Minister Elma Saiz said in an interview on Wednesday. She contended that the legalization policy is not aimed solely at 'cultural wealth and respect for human rights; it's also prosperity.' 'Today, we can say Spain is a better country,' Saiz told national broadcaster Radiotelevision Espanola. Spanish Prime Minister Pedro Sanchez has often described his government's migration policies as a means to combat the country's low birthrate. In August, Sanchez visited three West African nations in an effort to tackle irregular migration to Spain's Canary Islands. The archipelago off the coast of Africa is seen by many as a step toward continental Europe with young men from Mali, Senegal, Mauritania and elsewhere embarking on dangerous sea voyages there seeking better job opportunities abroad or fleeing violence and political instability at home. The new policy, approved Tuesday by Spain's leftist minority coalition government, simplifies administrative procedures for short and long-term visas and provides migrants with additional labor protections. It extends a visa offered previously to job-seekers for three months to one year. By mid-November, some 54,000 undocumented migrants had reached Spain this year by sea or land, according to the country's Interior Ministry. The exact number of foreigners living in Spain without documentation is unclear. Many irregular migrants make a living in Spain's underground economy as fruit pickers, caretakers, delivery drivers or other low-paid but essential jobs often passed over by Spaniards. Without legal protections, they can be vulnerable to exploitation and abuse. Saiz said the new policy would help prevent such abuse and 'serve to combat mafias, fraud and the violation of rights.' Spain's economy is among the fastest-growing in the European Union this year, boosted in part by immigration and a strong rebound in tourism after the pandemic. In 2023, Spain issued 1.3 million visas to foreigners, according to the government.	https://www.voanews.com/a/spain-will-legalize-hundreds-of-thousands-of-undocumented-migrants/7870581.html	2024-11-20T06:32:53-08:00	
Opposition leader victorious in self-declared Somaliland elections	Mogadishu, Somalia — The recent presidential elections in the self-declared Republic of Somaliland have concluded with a landslide victory for Abdirahman Mohamed Abdullahi, commonly known as Irro. He competed against the incumbent president, Muse Bihi Abdi. Irro could reopen dialogue with the federal government of Somalia that stalled after Bihi signed a Memorandum of Understanding that leases a portion of land and sea to Ethiopia in exchange for recognition. Irro received 64 percent of the votes cast, while the Kulmiye Party, led by outgoing President Muse Bihi Abdi, garnered 34 percent. Following his victory, Irro expressed gratitude to those who worked to help him win. He emphasized that everyone had won today and that no one was defeated. And he Irro focused on unity of the people in his speech. Irro said that this election was not about one group being defeated while another emerged victorious; rather, it was an election of brotherhood, aimed at unifying the people and fostering coexistence and development. In Burco, the second-largest city in Somaliland, large crowds gathered at a square to celebrate Irro's landslide victory. Among them was Hawa Elmi, a woman wearing the flag of Irro’s Wadani party. Elmi expressed her joy, saying that after more than 30 years, her political party had finally won the presidency. She said that she is happy that after 34 years of serious attempts at gaining power, she is finally proud to have elected a president who is loyal to both the country and its people. Somaliland declared its independence from the rest of Somalia in 1991, following the collapse of the military government led by the late dictator Mohamed Siad Barre. Somalia has never accepted the breakaway, nor has it received international recognition. Efforts by the international community to broker a settlement between the two have been unsuccessful. With Irro's victory, discussions between Somalia and Somaliland may resume, according to Mohamed Husein Gaas, the founding director of the RAAD Peace Research Institute and a Research Associate at the Conflict Research Program at the London School of Economics. He said that Irro's win presents an opportunity to reopen stalled dialogue. During his campaign, Irro expressed a willingness to initiate discussions with the Federal Government of Somalia, potentially leading to a formal agreement and reunification. Gaas also said that Irro's election means a new hope for those who advocate for Somali unification and togetherness, adding that he believes Irro has a vision for development and is a decent leader with a long-term perspective. Irro’s election has also been well-received in Mogadishu, where many, like Abdullahi Mohamed, a university graduate, see him as a decent leader. Abdullahi noted that the implementation of a one-man, one-vote election in Somaliland could provide a lesson for people in the southern regions, such as Mogadishu, where residents have never voted to elect their leaders. He saaid that the people in the South are pleased with Irro's election as president of the Northern region of Somaliland, believing that he is a unifying figure from whom they can learn a lot. Somaliland has long sought international recognition since declaring independence in 1991, but no government has yet recognized its status. In its pursuit of recognition, Somaliland signed a Memorandum of Understanding with Ethiopia in January, which involves leasing a seaport in exchange for recognition. However, the Somali government has labeled this arrangement as illegal, viewing it as Ethiopia's attempt to create a rift within Somalia.	https://www.voanews.com/a/opposition-leader-victorious-in-self-declared-somaliland-elections-/7870537.html	2024-11-20T06:02:23-08:00	
Iran defies international pressure, increasing its stockpile of near weapons-grade uranium, UN says	VIENNA — Iran has defied international demands to rein in its nuclear program and has increased its stockpile of uranium enriched to near weapons-grade levels, according to a confidential report by the United Nations' nuclear watchdog seen Tuesday by The Associated Press. The report by the International Atomic Energy Agency said that as of Oct. 26, Iran has 182.3 kilograms (401.9 pounds) of uranium enriched up to 60%, an increase of 17.6 kilograms (38.8 pounds) since the last report in August. Uranium enriched at 60% purity is just a short, technical step away from weapons-grade levels of 90%. The IAEA also estimated in its quarterly report that as of Oct. 26, Iran's overall stockpile of enriched uranium stands at 6,604.4 kilograms (14,560 pounds), an increase of 852.6 kilograms (1,879.6 pounds) since August. Under the IAEA's definition, around 42 kilograms (92.5 pounds) of uranium enriched to 60% purity is the amount at which creating one atomic weapon is theoretically possible — if the material is enriched further, to 90%. The reports come at a critical time as Israel and Iran have traded missile attacks in recent months after more than a year of war in Gaza, which is governed by Hamas, a group supported by Iran. Adding to the complexity, Donald Trump's reelection raises questions about whether and how the incoming administration and Iran may engage. Trump's first term in office was marked by a particularly troubled period, when he pursued a policy of 'maximum pressure' against Tehran. He unilaterally withdrew America from Iran's nuclear deal with world powers, leading to sanctions hobbling the economy and ordered the killing of the country's top general. Western diplomats consider censuring Iran Iran last week offered not to expand its stockpile of uranium enriched up to 60%, during a visit to Tehran by the IAEA chief, Rafael Mariano Grossi. The IAEA said during the meetings that 'the possibility of Iran not further expanding its stockpile of uranium enriched up to 60% U-235 was discussed, including technical verification measures necessary for the Agency to confirm this, if implemented.' The report said that one day after Grossi left Iran, on Nov. 16, IAEA inspectors verified that 'Iran had begun implementation of preparatory measures aimed at stopping the increase of its stockpile of uranium enriched up to 60 % U-235' at its underground nuclear sites in Fordow and Natanz. The reports come ahead of this week's regular IAEA Board of Governors meeting in Vienna. A senior western diplomat, who spoke on the condition of anonymity to discuss a sensitive matter, confirmed to the AP that the United Kingdom, France and Germany, with the support from the U.S., are going ahead with a resolution at this week's IAEA Board of Governors meeting, censuring Iran for its lack of cooperation, leading to potential confrontation with Iran ahead of Trump's return to the White House. 'We remain tightly coordinated with our E3 partners (France, Germany and UK) in advance of the IAEA Board of Governors meeting. And, we strongly support efforts to hold Iran accountable,' U.S. State Department spokesperson Matthew Miller told reporters Tuesday in Washington. 'The Iranian regime continues to amass a growing stockpile of highly enriched uranium for which there is no credible civilian purpose and they continue to not cooperate fully with the IAEA,' he added. A senior diplomat, who spoke on the condition of anonymity because of the sensitivity of the issue, said it is possible that the commitments made by Iran during the IAEA's chief visit may not stand in case a resolution is passed. In the past, Iran has responded to resolutions by the IAEA Board of Governors by further enhancing its nuclear program. Iran has maintained its nuclear program is for peaceful purposes only, but Grossi has previously warned that Tehran has enough uranium enriched to near-weapons-grade levels to make 'several' nuclear bombs if it chose to do so. He has acknowledged the U.N. agency cannot guarantee that none of Iran's centrifuges may have been peeled away for clandestine enrichment. Iran's mission at the United Nations in New York did not immediately respond to a request for comment. Little progress on improving ties The IAEA also reported that Iran has failed to take concrete steps as of now to improve cooperation, despite pleas by Grossi, who held talks last week with Mohammad Eslami of the Atomic Energy Organization of Iran, Iranian Foreign Minister Abbas Araghchi and Iran's reformist President Masoud Pezeshkian. However, Tuesday's confidential report also said that during Grossi's visit to Iran on Nov. 14, 'Iran agreed to respond to the Agency's concerns related to Iran's withdrawal of the designation of several experienced Agency inspectors by considering the acceptance of the designation of four additional experienced inspectors.' In September 2023, Iran barred some of the Vienna-based agency's most experienced inspectors. The report also said there was no progress thus far in reinstalling more monitoring equipment, including cameras, removed in June 2022. Since then, the only recorded data comes from IAEA cameras installed at a centrifuge workshop in Isfahan in May 2023 — although Iran has not provided the IAEA with access to this data and inspectors have not been able to service the cameras. Last week, Eslami warned that Iran could retaliate if challenged at the upcoming IAEA board meeting. Grossi acknowledged some nations were considering taking action against Iran. In an effort to ensure Iran could not develop atomic weapons, world powers struck a deal with Tehran in 2015 under which it agreed to limit enrichment of uranium to levels necessary for nuclear power in exchange for the lifting of economic sanctions. U.N. inspectors were tasked with monitoring the program Under the original 2015 nuclear deal, Iran was allowed to enrich uranium only up to 3.67% purity, can maintain a stockpile of uranium of 300 kilograms and is permitted to use only very basic IR-1 centrifuges, machines that spin uranium gas at high speed for enrichment purposes. A year after the U.S. withdrawal from the deal under Trump, Iran started to gradually abandon all limits the deal put on its program and began enriching uranium to up to 60% purity.	https://www.voanews.com/a/iran-defies-international-pressure-increasing-its-stockpile-of-near-weapons-grade-uranium-un-says-/7870410.html	2024-11-20T04:18:41-08:00

Suicide bombing kills 12 Pakistan soldiers	ISLAMABAD — Authorities in northwestern Pakistan said Wednesday that militants overnight launched a gun and suicide bomb attack against a military outpost, killing at least 12 troops and injuring several others. The deadly assault took place in the militancy-hit Bannu district in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa province, which borders Afghanistan. The statement reported that Pakistani security forces in the ensuing gunfight killed six assailants and 'effectively' blocked their attempt to enter the post, prompting a suicide bomber to ram an explosive-laden vehicle into the facility. The explosion caused the collapse of a pylon on 'the perimeter wall and damaged the adjoining infrastructure,' resulting in fatalities, the military said. 'Sanitization operation is being conducted in the area, and the perpetrators of this heinous act will be brought to justice,' the statement added. It did not share further details. Local security sources have confirmed that at least six troops also sustained injuries, with two of them in 'critical' condition. The military statement attributed the attack to 'Khwarij,' a term the government uses for militants linked to the Tehrik-i-Taliban Pakistan (TTP). The outlawed group frequently targets army and police forces in the province’s districts near or on the Afghan border. Hafiz Gul Bahadur, a militant organization affiliated with the TTP, claimed responsibility for the Tuesday night raid in Bannu. Pakistan says that TTP, which the United Nations lists as a global terrorist organization, is orchestrating the deadly violence from sanctuaries in Afghanistan. Islamabad has persistently urged the Islamist Taliban government in Kabul, which is not recognized by any country, to prevent TTP and other anti-Pakistan groups from using Afghan soil for cross-border terrorism. Taliban authorities in Afghanistan deny the allegations, saying no foreign militant groups are present in the country. Pakistani security forces are also battling ethnic separatists in the country's largest but sparsely populated province, Balochistan in the southwest. Resurgent militant violence, mainly affecting the two provinces, has claimed the lives of more than 1,100 Pakistanis, many of them security forces, so far this year, according to the Islamabad-based independent Center for Research and Security Studies. The surge in attacks in natural resources-rich Balochistan prompted Pakistani Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif on Tuesday to approve a new military offensive against separatists in the province, which borders Afghanistan and is home to China-funded major infrastructure development projects.	https://www.voanews.com/a/suicide-bombing-kills-12-pakistan-soldiers-/7870355.html	2024-11-20T02:42:17-08:00	
China overtakes Germany in industrial use of robots, says report	BERLIN — China has overtaken Germany in the use of robots in industry, an annual report published by the International Federation of Robotics (IFR) showed on Wednesday, underscoring the challenges facing Europe's biggest economy from Beijing. In terms of robot density, an important indicator for international comparisons of the automation of the manufacturing industry, South Korea is the world leader with 1,012 robots per 10,000 employees, up 5% since 2018, said the IFR, which is based in Germany. Singapore comes next, followed by China with 470 robots per 10,000 workers - more than double the density it had in 2019. That compares with 429 per 10,000 employees in Germany, which has had an annual growth rate of 5% since 2018, said IFR. 'China has invested heavily in automation technology and ranks third in robot density in 2023 after South Korea and Singapore, ahead of Germany and Japan,' said IFR president Takayuki Ito. Germany has in the past relied heavily on its industrial base and exports for growth but is facing ever tougher competition from countries like China. It expects economic contraction for the second year running in 2024, making it the worst performer among the Group of Seven rich democracies.	https://www.voanews.com/a/china-overtakes-germany-in-industrial-use-of-robots-says-report/7870337.html	2024-11-20T02:11:50-08:00	
National security trial of Hong Kong media tycoon Jimmy Lai: what's happened so far	HONG KONG — Hong Kong media tycoon and pro-democracy advocate Jimmy Lai, 76, testified in court for the first time on Wednesday in his landmark national security trial, accused of endangering China's national security by colluding with foreign forces. Lai was first arrested, under the national security law in August 2020, and has spent much of the time since in prison. He also faces separate sedition charges linked to his newspaper. The prosecution has accused Lai of alleged collusion with foreign forces, which it says included meetings with U.S. officials in Washington during the presidency of Donald Trump, calling for sanctions against Chinese and Hong Kong officials. Lai has pleaded not guilty to two charges of conspiracy to collude with foreign forces and a charge of conspiracy to publish seditious material. Why does it matter? The trial is widely seen as a landmark national security case after Beijing imposed sweeping security laws on Hong Kong in 2020 following months of pro-democracy protests in 2019. Lai, a longstanding critic of the Chinese Communist Party, is one of the most high-profile figures to face prosecution under the law. Diplomats are actively observing the court hearings in person with this case seen as a key test for Hong Kong's judicial independence. Hong Kong's former colonial ruler Britain and the United States have condemned the trial and have called for Lai's immediate release. Hong Kong officials say Lai will receive a fair trial. What is the prosecution's case? Prosecutor Anthony Chau described Lai as a 'radical' and alleged he was at the center of conspiracies to collude with foreign forces and publish seditious material in his Apple Daily newspaper. Chau alleged that Lai used 'the guise of fighting for freedom and democracy' to request that foreign countries, in particular the United States, impose sanctions or engage in other hostile activities against Hong Kong and China. The court heard that one example of Lai's alleged collusion was July 2019 meetings he held with U.S. President Donald Trump's then-vice president Mike Pence and Secretary of State Mike Pompeo at a time when Hong Kong's mass pro-democracy and pro-democracy protests were intensifying. Lai said in giving his first court testimony on Wednesday that he had never sought to influence the foreign policy of other countries, such as the U.S., towards China and Hong Kong. 'I would not dare to ask the vice president (Pence) to do anything. I would just relay to him what happened in Hong Kong when he asked me,' Lai told the Hong Kong court. Who is the prosecution linking with Lai? The prosecution listed agents and intermediaries of Lai, including former U.S. Deputy Defense Secretary Paul Wolfowitz, former U.S. Consul General to Hong Kong James Cunningham, and founder of the Hong Kong Watch rights group Benedict Rogers. Commenting from outside Hong Kong, Cunningham and Rogers said Lai's interactions were normal, legal activity. Prosecutors also said they had identified a syndicate led by Lai, which they said included activists, his aide, rights campaigners, a Japanese congresswoman and a U.S. financier. The prosecution case says these people contacted the U.S., Britain, New Zealand, Australia, Japan, Czech Republic, Portugal and Ireland to impose sanctions or take other hostile actions against Hong Kong and China. Prosecutors described Lai as 'the mastermind and financial supporter at the highest level command of the syndicate.' Lai, however, said he had never donated any money to political parties overseas or in Taiwan. He added that he had only donated money to U.S. thinktanks and religious groups. One count of collusion said Lai had links to a group the prosecution named as 'Stand With Hong Kong Fight For Freedom' (SWHK), which it said lobbied countries for sanctions on China and Hong Kong. Mark Simon, Lai's aide and a U.S. citizen, executed his instructions and vetted requests for financial support, according to prosecutors. But Andy Li, a key prosecution witness linked to SWHK, who had been jailed for seven months in a Chinese prison before the trial, said under cross examination on April 10 that he had never met nor contacted Lai, and had 'never' received money from Lai nor from entities he believed were associated with Lai. Prosecutors also accused Lai of using Apple Daily as a platform to conspire with three of its subsidiaries, six former executives linked to the newspaper, and staff members Mark Simon and others to collude with foreign forces. Lai, however, said he rarely issued instructions or directions on coverage to the newsroom. Cheung Kim-hung, the former CEO of Apple Daily's parent company Next Digital, told the court he had been instructed by Lai to call people to join protests in 2019, and to push for sanctions against Hong Kong and Chinese officials. Cheung denied being asked by the police to become a prosecution witness while remanded in custody.	https://www.voanews.com/a/national-security-trial-of-hong-kong-media-tycoon-jimmy-lai-what-s-happened-so-far/7870332.html	2024-11-20T02:05:14-08:00	
China’s joint security proposal sparks controversy in Myanmar	WASHINGTON — China’s recent proposal to establish a joint security company with Myanmar’s military junta has drawn sharp criticism from those who view it as an encroachment on national sovereignty and a sign of the junta’s inability to ensure security. According to a report in the Myanmar Gazette published on November 8, the junta formed a 13-member committee on Oct. 22 to review China’s proposal and draft a memorandum of understanding for the joint venture. The committee evaluated the logistical aspects of the draft MOU, such as importing weapons and security equipment, while ensuring the plan does not undermine Myanmar’s sovereignty. Myanmar observers believe the proposal may have been prompted by the Oct. 18 bombing of its consulate in Mandalay, highlighting Beijing’s growing concerns over its investments in Myanmar’s unstable political environment. A question of sovereignty and security 'China’s top priority in Myanmar is stability for its Belt and Road Initiative projects,' according to a Myanmar scholar who requested anonymity for safety concerns of his family in Myanmar. 'The junta’s failure to control the revolution has forced China to explore alternative measures,' he added. The scholar explained that because Myanmar’s 2008 Constitution, drafted by the military, prohibits the deployment of foreign troops on its soil, the referencing of a Chinese 'company' in the proposed joint venture is a strategic move 'to avoid accusations of military intervention.' 'But the public perceives it as a breach of sovereignty, and even the junta would be uncomfortable with such overt Chinese involvement,' he said. The proposal indicates Beijing’s lack of confidence in the junta’s ability to maintain control and security. Regime’s lack of control Chinese projects under the China-Myanmar Economic Corridor (CMEC), including the oil and gas pipelines, have faced increasing threats since the opposition declared a 'People’s Defensive War' in 2021. 'The limitations of both the SAC and the NUG have jeopardized the CMEC,' said Kyi Sin, a research officer at ISEAS-Yusof Ishak Institute. In his paper Securing the China-Myanmar Economic Corridor: Navigating Conflicts and Public Skepticism, Kyi cited the January 2022 attack on the $800 million Tagaung Taung nickel-processing plant by a local People’s Defense Force as a stark example. According to Jason Tower, Burma country director at the United States Institute of Peace, the Myanmar military has shown signs of weakening control. Mandalay, the country’s second-largest city and a major commercial hub, was the site of an attack on October 18, which occurred during the day, raising questions about the regime’s security capabilities. China responded swiftly, saying it was 'deeply shocked at the attack and strongly condemns it.' China’s balancing act and mounting challenges China’s involvement in Myanmar since the 2021 coup has been a delicate balancing act, according to Thomas Kean, a senior consultant on Myanmar and Bangladesh at the International Crisis Group. While Beijing has provided economic, diplomatic, and military support to the junta, it has also maintained relationships with ethnic armed organizations and opposition groups, underscoring its strategic interest in stability. However, Beijing's approach shifted as the military lost control of significant territories. 'They don’t want to see a disorderly collapse in Myanmar; they feel compelled to get involved,' Kean said. 'It’s not something they want to do. Like the first few years after the coup, they really tried not to get too involved. And I think that’s their preferred position.' Kean explained that China’s recent military support, including the supply of combat aircraft, reflects its concerns about the junta’s inability to maintain order. While this involvement aims to safeguard China’s investments and projects, it has drawn sharp criticism from Myanmar’s citizens and resistance groups, complicating Beijing’s position further. 'The military's grip is somewhat tenuous,' Kean said of the junta. Overstretched junta forces Abdul Rahman Yaacob, a security expert on Southeast Asia and research fellow at the Lowy Institute, highlighted the junta’s overstretched military and security capacity. 'The junta forces are actually overstretched,' Yaacob said. 'That’s the reason why they are looking at conscripts to support the numbers. But numbers don’t mean you have good quality. The junta is fighting across multiple fronts in the south, north, and border areas. They don’t have enough forces, actually, to provide comprehensive security.' He noted a significant shift in the dynamics of the conflict. 'What we are seeing now is that opposition or rebel groups are able to start operating within the city area, targeting government interests there,' Yaacob said. A complex future While the junta’s inability to provide security highlights its weakening grip, experts caution that the introduction of Chinese security forces could further complicate Myanmar’s political landscape. 'The proposed joint security company poses challenges for both revolutionary forces and ethnic armed organizations,' the Myanmar scholar said. 'It’s crucial for opposition groups to prepare for this scenario.' As China deepens its involvement in Myanmar, it risks alienating not only the public but also regional powers like India. The question remains whether Beijing can achieve its goal of stability without becoming further entangled in Myanmar’s conflict. 'Beijing will have to consider its economic interest in the long term versus its need to support the junta in the short and medium term,' Yaacob said.	https://www.voanews.com/a/china-s-joint-security-proposal-sparks-controversy-in-myanmar/7870325.html	2024-11-20T01:54:23-08:00	
More rescued victims of insurgency handed over to Borno state government	Abuja, Nigeria — Stability is returning to northeastern Nigeria after decades of insurgency as the military and the Borno State government work to reduce terrorist activities and rescue abducted civilians. Operation Hadin Kai, the military's counter-insurgency operation in the northeast launched in 2021, has rescued of numerous civilians held captive by insurgents. The deputy theater commander of Operation Hadin Kai, Kenneth Chigbu, praised the partnership with Borno State government. 'The Borno State government has always come to our aid and support in ensuring that the entire state is rid of the activities of terrorists,' Chigbu said. Alice Loksha was working for UNICEF when she was abducted by the Islamic State West Africa Province insurgent group in a 2018 raid on a humanitarian camp in Borno. After six years in captivity, she escaped and found refuge in a military camp. Loksha credits her freedom to military efforts. 'We want to thank God for the military,' she said. 'We pray that God will continue to strengthen them and give them victory over these terrorists' The Borno State government is working closely with the military to support survivors like Loksha. Zuwaira Gambo, the state's commissioner for women’s affairs, said the partnership is key to the region's stability. 'The synergy that exists between the military and the government, because without the enabling environment, Borno State won't be enjoying the peace and stability we are witnessing today,' Gambo said. 'It is that singular commitment and political will of the government that our sisters are able to escape, to be received by the military and officially being handed over today to the Bono state government.' Chigbu has urged terrorists to surrender, promising amnesty to those who lay down their arms. 'Let me also use this opportunity on behalf of the theater commander to once again extend the olive branch to the so-called terrorists,' he said. 'The fight is long enough. They should come out. Amnesty will be given, will be granted them, just as the lot of them who have surrendered.' In July, Operation Hadin Kai successfully rescued 330 captives, including a schoolgirl abducted in the town of Chibok in 2014. Most recently, Alice Loksha and another victim have been handed over to the Borno State government for rehabilitation.	https://www.voanews.com/a/more-rescued-victims-of-insurgency-handed-over-to-borno-state-government/7870317.html	2024-11-20T01:27:26-08:00	
Hong Kong tycoon Jimmy Lai tells court he championed 'freedom'	HONG KONG — Jailed Hong Kong media tycoon Jimmy Lai insisted his newspaper had championed democracy and 'freedom' as he took the witness stand for the first time in his collusion trial on Wednesday. Lai's case is one of the most prominent prosecuted under the national security law imposed by Beijing in 2020, with Western countries and rights groups demanding his release. The 76-year-old founder of tabloid Apple Daily is accused of colluding with foreign forces, a charge that could carry a sentence of up to life in prison. The case centers around articles in the newspaper that supported huge, sometimes violent pro-democracy protests in 2019 and criticized Beijing's leadership. On Wednesday, Lai insisted that 'the core values of Apple Daily are actually the core values of the people of Hong Kong... (including) rule of law, freedom, pursuit of democracy, freedom of speech, freedom of religion, freedom of assembly'. He said he had entered the media business because 'to participate in delivering freedom is a very good idea for me... The more you are in the know, the more you are free.' But he said he opposed violence and was not an advocate of Hong Kong independence, calling it 'too crazy to think about.' Lai did not appear to be in ill health as he stood in the dock, flanked by four prison officers and waving to people in the public gallery. His testimony comes with Hong Kong's political freedoms already under the spotlight after a court jailed 45 democracy campaigners for subversion in the city's largest national security trial on Tuesday. 'Deserves admiration' Lai has been behind bars since December 2020, and concerns have been raised about his medical and jail conditions. He has not opted to testify in any of his five previous cases, all of which resulted in convictions, including for organizing and participating in marches during the 2019 democracy protests. Outside the court in pouring rain on Wednesday, an 80-year-old retiree named Liu told AFP Lai 'deserves our admiration.' 'He has a lot of money, he could have left anytime, but he didn't because he felt a responsibility,' Liu said. Hong Kong and Beijing have rejected criticism of the case, condemning Lai as 'a voluntary political tool of foreign forces trying to curb China through Hong Kong.' The case against him revolves around 161 articles published in Apple Daily as well as his own interviews and social media postings. The newspaper was forced to close in 2021 after police raids and the arrests of its senior editors. 'Hostile activities' Since the prosecution opened in January, it has alleged that Lai on multiple occasions asked the United States and other countries to impose sanctions 'or engage in other hostile activities' against China and Hong Kong. On Wednesday, Lai was asked about his contacts with politicians and other figures from places including the United States, Britain and Taiwan. Asked whether he tried to influence foreign policy on Hong Kong and China via a list of overseas contacts compiled by prosecutors, Lai answered 'never.' Lai said he had met former U.S. vice president Mike Pence in 2019 and asked the Republican to 'say something in support' of Hong Kong. But he insisted he hadn't asked Pence to take action, saying it was 'beyond me.' Questioned if he had ever 'communicated directly or indirectly' with then-president Donald Trump, Lai said no. Lai holds British citizenship, and last month Prime Minister Keir Starmer told parliament the case was 'a priority' for his Labour government. Starmer raised the issue in a meeting with Chinese President Xi Jinping on Monday. Health concerns Lai's son had previously said 'much stronger' support from the British government was needed as Lai's health 'could get much worse at any moment.' A legal team led by a senior British rights lawyer has filed a number of complaints to the United Nations concerning arbitrary detention and prolonged solitary confinement. On Sunday, the Hong Kong government condemned the legal team for 'spreading misinformation,' saying Lai himself had requested to be kept apart from other inmates. Robertsons, a Hong Kong law firm representing Lai in the trial, has brushed off some of the allegations. 'Mr. Lai wishes to make known that he has been receiving appropriate medical attention for conditions suffered by him, including diabetes,' the firm said in a statement in September. 'He has access to daylight through the windows in the corridor outside his cell, albeit he cannot see the sky. He exercises for an hour every day in a secure area.'	https://www.voanews.com/a/hong-kong-tycoon-jimmy-lai-tells-court-he-championed-freedom-/7870305.html	2024-11-20T00:35:48-08:00	
Russian farmers ditch wheat for other crops after heavy losses	MOSCOW/IRTYSH VILLAGE, RUSSIA — Russian farmers say they will sow less wheat after heavy losses this year, switching to more profitable crops such as peas, lentils, or sunflowers. Such decisions will have direct implications for global wheat prices and inflation in major buyers like Egypt, as Russia is the world's top exporter of the grain. The trend represents a challenge for President Vladimir Putin's plan to expand exports and cement Russia's position as an agriculture superpower, while trying to gain more international clout amid confrontation with the West over its actions in Ukraine. The country's wheat harvest will decline to 83 million tons this year due to frosts and drought, down from 92.8 million tons in 2023 and a record 104.2 million tons in 2022. New forecasts point to a clouded outlook for next year as well. Although Russia has been exporting wheat at a near record pace in the recent months, exports are expected to slow due to a bad harvest and export curbs aimed at containing domestic price growth, including an expected cut in export quota by two-thirds from January 2025. At a farm in Siberia's Omsk region, which was hit by heavy rain during the peak of the harvesting season, farmer Maxim Levshunov takes advantage of a rare sunny day to collect what remains in the fields. He chuckles as he picks up ears of wheat that sprouted early due to the moisture. Now, most of his crops are only suitable for animal feed, meaning the farm will receive a fraction of the price, and income, it had hoped for. 'We'll probably start moving away from wheat, cutting back as much as possible. So, we'll be thinking about what more profitable crops we can replace it with right now,' Levshunov told Reuters. As this year's harvesting campaign comes to an end, Russian farmers are assessing their losses from the exceptionally bad weather and considering their next steps amid falling profit margins for wheat, Russia's main agricultural export. Winter wheat became the first victim as areas sown with it are set to shrink by 10% this year, the lowest since 2019, according to data from Rusagrotrans, Russia's flagship grain rail carrier. 'There are losses on each ton. The selling price does not cover the cost,' said Arkady Zlochevsky, head of the Russian Grain Union industry lobby, predicting that Russia's 26% share of the global wheat trade will shrink. Agriculture Minister Oksana Lut joked that farmers might pray to Saint Ilya, the patron saint of weather in Russia, to improve conditions for winter crops. The joke did not go down well with farmers, who are considering more pragmatic options. Some say they have already decided to plant less wheat next year. Others are waiting to see how global wheat prices perform in the next few weeks before making a final decision. 'The profitability of grain crops is approaching zero. The company has reduced the volume of winter wheat sowing by 30%. There are two drivers now — soybeans and sunflower,' said Dmitry Garnov, CEO of Rostagro Group, which owns land in the Penza and Saratov regions around the Volga River. Rising costs of equipment and fuel, high export duties, a rising benchmark interest rate that hit 21% in October as the country's central bank fights inflation, and the removal of some agricultural subsidies have also eaten into profit margins. 'It is evident that in 2022-2024, the price has been practically the same, while the cost of grain production has increased by at least 28%,' said Sergei Lisovsky, a member of the lower house of Russia's parliament from the Kurgan region. Lisovsky argued that the high export duty for grains, introduced in 2021, as well as rising transportation costs for regions with no direct access to seaports, were also factors behind low margins. 'Therefore, as of today, farmers are not planting grain, not because of the autumn drought, but because they are waiting to see what the price will be, and have not yet made a decision,' Lisovsky added, referring to spring wheat sowing. In Russia's most fertile Krasnodar region, the profitability of wheat is still holding around 10%, but some large local farms are also pondering a change of strategy as droughts become more severe each year. 'It is gradually getting warmer in the south, and we need to think about changing the structure of the sowing areas for the future,' said Yevgeny Gromyko, executive from Tkachev Agrocomplex, one of Russia's largest landowners, and a former deputy agriculture minister. The niche crops have the potential to become new export success stories with Russia's allies among the BRICS countries, aiding the government in achieving Putin's goal of increasing agricultural exports by half by 2030. Russia overtook Canada this year as the top peas exporter to China. Regulators in India, the leading importer of lentils, used to make daal, a staple for millions of people, gave a green light to Russian imports. Russia takes pride in being the world's top wheat exporter, with the older generation recalling the food shortages of the Soviet era and the humiliating grain imports from Cold War foes like the United States and Canada. However, for struggling farmers, it is declining profits, not global status, that matter most. 'Many farms that specialized exclusively in wheat crops have operated at a loss this year and will face very serious financial difficulties, potentially leading to bankruptcy,' Levshunov said.	https://www.voanews.com/a/russian-farmers-ditch-wheat-for-other-crops-after-heavy-losses/7870301.html	2024-11-20T00:26:18-08:00	
China’s Xi, Lula meet in Brasilia to 'enhance ties'	Brasilia, Brazil — China's President Xi Jinping will pay a state visit to Brazil Wednesday, fresh off a warm reception at summits of the G20 and APEC groups, both held under the cloud of Donald Trump's White House return. Xi has said he would seek to 'further enhance' ties with Brasilia when he meets counterpart Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva, host of the G20 summit that closed in Rio Tuesday. The bilateral comes as China is looking with trepidation to a future after U.S. President Joe Biden, with whom Xi had led efforts to ease tensions over issues from trade to Taiwan. Trump, who will be sworn in on January 20, has signaled a confrontational approach to Beijing, threatening tariffs of up to 60% on imports of Chinese goods. China and Brazil have sought to position themselves as leaders of the Global South at a time of great global uncertainty, with wars in Ukraine and the Middle East. 'The Global South is on a collective rise,' Xi wrote in an article published in Brazilian media ahead of his visit. Both China and Brazil have sought to mediate in the Ukraine war while declining to sanction fellow BRICS member Russia for its invasion. Value-added exports China is Brazil's biggest trading partner overall, with two-way commerce exceeding $160 billion last year. Xi looked forward to talks with Lula 'on further enhancing China-Brazil relations, promoting synergy of the two countries' development strategies, international and regional issues of common interest,' state news agency Xinhua forecast. Brazil, in turn, will push for increasing exports of value-added products, said secretary for Asia Eduardo Paes. The South American agricultural power sends mainly soybeans and other primary commodities to China, while the Asian giants sells it semiconductors, telephones, vehicles and medicines. Since returning to power last year, Lula has sought to balance efforts to improve ties with both China and the United States. A visit to Beijing this year by Vice President Geraldo Alckmin was seen as paving the way for Brazil to join China's Belt and Road Initiative to stimulate trade -- a central pillar of Xi's bid to expand China's clout overseas. South American nations that have signed up include Argentina, Chile, Bolivia, Ecuador, Peru, and Venezuela. Xi inaugurated South America's first Chinese-funded port while in Lima last week for an Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation (APEC) summit, where he also met with Biden. The port opening prompted senior U.S. officials to warn Latin America to be vigilant of Chinese investment. 'We encourage Brazil and our allies in general to evaluate with open eyes the risks and benefits of a rapprochement with China,' U.S. State Department spokeswoman Natalia Molano told AFP. Wednesday's meeting between the leaders of the second- and seventh-most populated countries of the world, comes as Brazil and China mark 50 years of diplomatic ties. Evan Ellis, an analyst at the Center for Strategic and International Studies in Washington, told AFP Lula will likely discuss with Xi how to adjust their economic relationship 'to give more advantage to Brazilian companies.' He would also be interested 'in seeing how Brazil can continue to posture itself as an international player in the context of a possibly diminished U.S. role in Latin America and globally' under Trump. To address trade imbalance concerns, China 'will need to make good on its commitment to supporting re-industrialization,' added Margaret Myers of the Inter-American Dialogue think tank.	https://www.voanews.com/a/china-s-xi-lula-meet-in-brasilia-to-enhance-ties-/7870297.html	2024-11-20T00:14:03-08:00	
Dark energy pushing our universe apart may not be what it seems, scientists say	NEW YORK — Distant, ancient galaxies are giving scientists more hints that a mysterious force called dark energy may not be what they thought. Astronomers know that the universe is being pushed apart at an accelerating rate and they have puzzled for decades over what could possibly be speeding everything up. They theorize that a powerful, constant force is at play, one that fits nicely with the main mathematical model that describes how the universe behaves. But they can't see it and they don't know where it comes from, so they call it dark energy. It is so vast it is thought to make up nearly 70% of the universe — while ordinary matter like all the stars and planets and people make up just 5%. But findings published earlier this year by an international research collaboration of more than 900 scientists from around the globe yielded a major surprise. As the scientists analyzed how galaxies move they found that the force pushing or pulling them around did not seem to be constant. And the same group published a new, broader set of analyses Tuesday that yielded a similar answer. 'I did not think that such a result would happen in my lifetime,' said Mustapha Ishak-Boushaki, a cosmologist at the University of Texas at Dallas who is part of the collaboration. Called the Dark Energy Spectroscopic Instrument, it uses a telescope based in Tucson, Arizona to create a three-dimensional map of the universe's 11-billion-year history to see how galaxies have clustered throughout time and across space. That gives scientists information about how the universe evolved, and where it might be heading. The map they are building would not make sense if dark energy were a constant force, as it is theorized. Instead, the energy appears to be changing or weakening over time. If that is indeed the case, it would upend astronomers' standard cosmological model. It could mean that dark energy is very different than what scientists thought — or that there may be something else altogether going on. 'It's a time of great excitement, and also some head-scratching and confusion,' said Bhuvnesh Jain, a cosmologist at the University of Pennsylvania who is not involved with the research. The collaboration's latest finding points to a possible explanation from an older theory: that across billions of years of cosmic history, the universe expanded and galaxies clustered as Einstein's general relativity predicted. The new findings aren't definitive. Astronomers say they need more data to overturn a theory that seemed to fit together so well. They hope observations from other telescopes and new analyses of the new data over the next few years will determine whether the current view of dark energy stands or falls. 'The significance of this result right now is tantalizing,' said Robert Caldwell, a physicist at Dartmouth College who is not involved with the research, 'but it's not like a gold-plated measurement.' There's a lot riding on the answer. Because dark energy is the biggest component of the universe, its behavior determines the universe's fate, explained David Spergel, an astrophysicist and president of the Simons Foundation. If dark energy is constant, the universe will continue to expand, forever getting colder and emptier. If it's growing in strength, the universe will expand so speedily that it'll destroy itself in what astronomers call the Big Rip. 'Not to panic. If this is what's going on, it won't happen for billions of years,' he said. 'But we'd like to know about it.'	https://www.voanews.com/a/dark-energy-pushing-our-universe-apart-may-not-be-what-it-seems-scientists-say/7870294.html	2024-11-20T00:06:09-08:00	
NATO holds large Arctic exercises in Russia's backyard	Rovaniemi, Finland — Thousands of NATO soldiers are taking part in large-scale artillery exercises in Finland's Arctic this month, seen by some as a signal to neighboring Russia over its war on Ukraine. Sounds of cannon fire and rocket artillery echo across the snowy, hilly Lapland landscape as some 3,600 soldiers from the United States, Sweden, the United Kingdom, France and other NATO members conduct live fire drills throughout November. They are part of NATO's largest artillery exercise ever held in Europe, dubbed Dynamic Front 25, which also includes drills in Estonia, Germany, Romania and Poland involving a total of around 5,000 soldiers. Joel Linnainmaki, a researcher at the Finnish Institute of International Affairs, said the massive exercises should be interpreted as a message to Russia, with which Finland shares a 1,340-kilometre border. 'These NATO exercises are increasingly intended to show other countries, in this case especially Russia of course, that the alliance is united and is capable of defending its members,' he said. The exercises are the first large-scale maneuvers held in Finland since the Nordic country joined NATO last year, when it dropped decades of military non-alignment following Russia's February 2022 invasion of Ukraine. The move angered Moscow, which has long opposed any expansion of NATO. Colonel Janne Makitalo, director of the Dynamic Front 25 exercise in Finland, said the main goal was to train and develop inter-operability within the alliance's artillery units, and prepare troops for harsh Arctic conditions, now that Norway, Sweden and Finland are all NATO members. 'Of course this sends a message that we are able to train together and we are developing our assets,' he told reporters. 'Artillery is basically the king and queen of the battlefield, as we have seen from experience of combat in Ukraine,' Makitalo said. He dismissed the notion that NATO could provoke Moscow by flexing its military might in Russia's backyard. 'It is not any sort of show of force,' he insisted. That said, Finland joining NATO brought '280,000 soldiers to NATO's northern flank,' he said. In the hilly Rovajarvi area, troops are camped and stationed at gun positions covered in thin layers of snow and ice. The sun rises at around 9:30 am this time of year above the Arctic Circle and sets less than six hours later, before 3:00 pm. Measuring more than 1,000 square kilometers, it is Europe's largest firing range and training area, and allies come to rehearse in its difficult conditions. 'This is a unique place to train, because this is one of the few places where you can train things at their actual scale,' said lieutenant Antti-Matti Puisto, a firing platoon leader for the Finnish Karelia brigade. In a region where temperatures typically drop to below minus 20 degrees Celsius during winter months, the Finnish defense forces are known for being well-trained and equipped for harsh winter conditions. Puisto underlined the importance of staying warm by wearing many layers of clothes, and of keeping encampments dry and free of humidity. 'The aim is to practice our skills as artillerymen and mountaineers, working in a very cold environment,' said Captain Romain, the French unit commander of the Ecrins battery of the 93rd mountain artillery regiment, told AFP. 'Also to work on interoperability with our allies, to carry out artillery fire in coherence with our NATO allies,' he told AFP, choosing only to give his first name. 'We are making history and it's really nice to see different nations in Finland,' conscript and sergeant Olli Myllymaki said after his brigade conducted fire drills with K9 tanks in a snowy forest.	https://www.voanews.com/a/nato-holds-large-arctic-exercises-in-russia-s-backyard/7870288.html	2024-11-19T23:51:03-08:00	
Islamic Council's VPN decree raises concerns about privacy in Pakistan	WASHINGTON — Pakistan's top cleric has declared that virtual private networks, or VPNs, are unlawful, igniting a debate on privacy rights and access to information amid a government crackdown on the internet. Allama Raghib Naeemi, head of the Council of Islamic Ideology (CII), issued a decree saying it makes no difference whether a VPN is registered or unregistered. 'If attempts are made to access indecent or immoral sites, character assassination is done, statements are being made against national security, or if various incidents of religious blasphemy are being spread through it, then [using] it would completely be un-Islamic,' he said. A VPN protects online privacy by creating a secure connection and is used to access blocked content, protect data from hackers and support remote work or secure transactions. Several internet service providers in Pakistan expressed concerns Tuesday over the possible imposition of blanket restrictions on VPNs, warning that the move would anger users and impact online businesses. Shahzad Arshad, chairman of the Wireless and Internet Service Providers Association of Pakistan, said in a statement, 'It is essential to recognize that blanket restrictions or sweeping narratives around tools like VPNs risk alienating segments of society, particularly those who rely on these tools for entirely legitimate purposes, such as IT exports, financial transactions, and academic research.' Arshad, in reference to CII's declaration, said technology is neutral and that how it is used determines whether it is aligned with ethics. Amnesty Tech, part of Amnesty International, said last week on X that imposing restrictions on VPNs would amount to 'violating the right to privacy under international law, restricting people’s access to information, and suppressing free expression.' Qibla Ayaz, former chairman of CII, told VOA Deewa it seems as if a government agency has reached out to the religious body seeking its stance on the VPN issue. 'Similar requests were sent by the government in 2023,' he said. The CII is a constitutional body in Pakistan that advises the legislature on whether a certain law is repugnant to Islam, namely to the Quran and Sunna. According to activists and experts, CII’s declarations on technology use are unwarranted and will only strengthen the government's digital suppression of social media users. Haroon Baloch, a Pakistani digital rights activist, believes the proposed restrictions on VPNs are aimed at suppressing political dissent. 'First, the government had compliance challenges with X. And when the platform did not agree with the government’s requests, then it banned X. And when X was available with the help of VPN, the government is planning to ban the VPN now,' Haroon told VOA. Pakistan banned X in February and installed firewalls to restrict access to certain online content. But consumers are using VPNs to access restricted networks and content and to hide their identities and locations. Pakistan Army Chief General Asim Munir told a gathering at the Islamabad Policy Research Institute on November 16 that technology has played a pivotal role in the dissemination of information, but 'the spread of misleading and incorrect information has become a significant challenge.' In a speech to religious leaders in Islamabad earlier in August, Munir said, 'Anarchy is spread through social media.' A directive in October from the Interior Ministry asked the Pakistan Telecommunication Authority to block 'illegal' VPNs that had not registered by the end of November. The Interior Ministry charged in a letter to the Pakistan Telecommunication Authority, which oversees the internet and mobile industry and has broad powers over online content and the licensing of service providers, that terrorists are increasingly using VPNs to facilitate violent activities and financial transactions in Pakistan. 'Of late, an alarming fact has been identified, wherein VPNs are used by terrorists to obscure and conceal their communications,' the letter said, adding that pornography sites are frequently accessed using VPNs. 'These trends ... warrant the prohibition of unauthorized virtual private networks in order to address critical threats,' the letter said. The 2024 'Freedom on the Net' report published by Freedom House says the Pakistan Telecommunication Authority has historically implemented policies that undermine internet freedom, removed content without a transparent process and instituted wholesale bans on platforms.

Myanmar led world in landmine victims in 2023: monitor	BANGKOK — Landmines and unexploded munitions claimed more victims in Myanmar than in any other country last year, a monitor said on Wednesday, with over 1,000 people killed or wounded in the country. Decades of sporadic conflict between the military and ethnic rebel groups have left the Southeast Asian country littered with deadly landmines and munitions. But the military's ouster of Aung San Suu Kyi's government in 2021 has turbocharged conflict in the country and birthed dozens of newer 'People's Defense Forces' now battling to topple the military. Anti-personnel mines and explosive remnants of war killed or wounded 1,003 people in Myanmar in 2023, the International Campaign to Ban Landmines (ICBL) said on Wednesday. There were 933 landmine casualties in Syria, 651 in Afghanistan and 580 in Ukraine, the ICBL said in its latest Landmine Monitor report. Myanmar is not a signatory to the United Nations convention that prohibits the use, stockpiling or development of anti-personnel mines. The ICBL said there had been a 'significant increase' of anti-personnel mines use by the military in recent years, including around infrastructure like mobile phone towers and energy pipelines. Those infrastructure are often targeted by its opponents. Myanmar's military has been repeatedly accused of atrocities and war crimes during decades of internal conflict. ICBL said it had seen evidence of junta troops forcing civilians to walk in front of its units to 'clear' mine-affected areas.	https://www.voanews.com/a/myanmar-led-world-in-landmine-victims-in-2023-monitor/7870273.html	2024-11-19T22:12:41-08:00

US to send antipersonnel mines to Ukraine	The United States will soon provide antipersonnel mines to Ukraine, a U.S. official confirmed late Tuesday, in a move that followed Ukraine’s first deployment of long-range U.S.-supplied ballistic missiles in an attack on Russia. The official said the United States sought commitments from Ukraine on how it will use the mines, with the expectation they will be deployed only on Ukrainian territory in areas where Ukrainian civilians are not living. The official also pointed to the function of the mines, which they said require a battery for operation and will not detonate once the battery runs out after a period of a few hours to a few weeks. Ukrainian forces hit ammunition warehouses in Russia’s Bryansk region before dawn Tuesday using the long-range missiles that Ukrainian officials long sought to hit areas Russia has used to deploy daily waves of rocket and drone attacks against Ukrainian cities. The two sides disputed the effectiveness of the attack, which came two days after it was reported that President Joe Biden had reversed U.S. policy and approved use of the longer-range missiles as Russia’s invasion of Ukraine reached the 1,000-day mark. Two U.S. officials confirmed to VOA on Tuesday that the policy prohibiting Ukrainians' use of U.S.-provided, long-range weapons to hit military targets deep inside Russia 'has changed.' The Russian defense ministry said in a statement, 'Ukraine’s armed forces last night struck a facility in the Bryansk region' with six U.S.-made Army Tactical Missile System rockets, or ATACMS, but that its forces shot down five of them and damaged the sixth. It said falling fragments from the exploding rockets caused a fire at the military facility, but there were no casualties. Ukraine’s military general staff said in a post on Facebook that its forces had 'caused fire damage' to 'warehouses with ammunition for the army of the Russian occupiers' in Bryansk, about 100 kilometers from Ukraine’s border. The attack caused '12 secondary explosions and detonations in the area of the target,' the statement said, while not specifying that ATACMS had been used. But a Ukrainian official, speaking on condition of anonymity to discuss ongoing operations, confirmed the use of the American weapons system. The initial target using the long-range missile system was far short of the 300-kilometer range of the missile system. Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy had long sought U.S. approval of its use to launch attacks on military sites deep inside Russia. Until Sunday, though, Biden had resisted for fear of escalating tensions in the nearly three-year conflict between Moscow and the U.S.-led NATO military alliance, four of whose member countries border Russia. Biden reportedly reversed his position after North Korea sent about 10,000 troops to Russia to fight alongside Moscow’s forces in Russia’s Kursk region that Ukraine captured in August and still holds. Biden leaves office in two months, and it is not clear what stance President-elect Donald Trump might adopt. Trump has been a skeptic of continued U.S. military support for Ukraine, claiming he would end the war before he even takes office; however, Trump has not offered any public plan on how he would do so. With Ukraine now having the ability to fire the long-range missiles into Russia, President Vladimir Putin on Tuesday signed a revised nuclear doctrine stating that a conventional attack on Russia by any nation supported by a nuclear power is considered a joint attack and could trigger a nuclear response. When Russian government spokesman Dmitry Peskov was asked if the revised doctrine was issued in response to the U.S. missile authorization, he said it was put forth 'in a timely manner' and that Putin wanted it updated to be 'in line with the current situation.' In response, a White House National Security Council spokesperson said the United States was not surprised by Russia’s announcement that it is updating its nuclear doctrine since it had been signaling its intent to do so for several weeks. The spokesperson said the U.S. sees no need to change its posture. 'This is more of the same irresponsible rhetoric from Russia, which we have seen for the past two years,' the spokesperson said. The Russian doctrine states nuclear weapons could be used in the case of a massive air attack involving ballistic and cruise missiles, aircraft, drones and other flying vehicles. It says an attack against Russia by a nonnuclear power with the 'participation or support of a nuclear power' will be seen as their 'joint attack on the Russian Federation,' a definition that would fit the Ukraine-U.S. alliance. It doesn’t specify whether such an attack would definitely be met with a nuclear response. Peskov said the aim of the updated policy was to make potential enemies understand the inevitability of retaliation for an attack on Russia or its allies. It also states that Russia could use nuclear weapons if another country attacks Belarus, a Moscow ally. Tear gas detected near front line Also on Tuesday, Ukraine urged action after the international chemical weapons watchdog said banned CS riot control gas, also known as tear gas, had been found in Ukrainian soil samples from the Dnipropetrovsk region. Russia has not reacted to the report by the Organization for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons, which did not assign blame for the chemical. The Chemical Weapons Convention strictly bans the use of riot control agents including CS outside riot control situations when it is used as 'a method of warfare,' Agence France-Presse reported. CS gas causes irritation to the lungs, skin and eyes. Both sides have accused each other of using chemical weapons in the conflict, and Ukraine’s Western allies have claimed Moscow has employed banned weapons. 'Russia's use of banned chemicals on the battlefield once again demonstrates Russia's chronic disregard for international law,' a statement from Ukraine’s foreign ministry said. The OPCW stressed however, that the report did 'not seek to identify the source or origin of the toxic chemical.' Carla Babb, Jeff Seldin and Patsy Widakuswara contributed to this report.	https://www.voanews.com/a/us-to-send-antipersonnel-mines-to-ukraine/7870265.html	2024-11-19T21:38:12-08:00	
Azerbaijan accused of cracking down on critics ahead of COP29	Several international human rights organizations have raised alarm about Azerbaijan’s crackdown on rights defenders, government critics and journalists before the start of the COP29 climate change conference currently being held in its capital, Baku. 'We urge every delegation attending COP29 to press the Azerbaijani government to end its clampdown on civil society, guarantee the rights to freedom of expression, association and peaceful assembly throughout and beyond the conference, and take meaningful action to reverse the deterioration of human rights in the country,' Amnesty International said in a statement before the start of the event on Nov. 11. The United Nations’ annual conference on combating global warming, COP29, began last week as the Azerbaijani government escalated its crackdown on government critics. Azerbaijani authorities have jailed at least 14 journalists since November 2023. Many of them are facing charges of currency smuggling. All of them deny the allegations, calling them bogus. On November 12, a group of Azerbaijani civil society representatives issued an open appeal to COP29 participants, claiming that after Azerbaijan was announced as the conference host in December 2023, the country's government began to silence dissidents and alternative voices. 'In a short period of time, opposition leaders, human rights defenders, socio-political activists, independent media organizations, including the leaders and employees of 'Abzas Media,' 'Toplum TV,' 'Kanal 13,' and the civil society organization Institute for Democratic Initiatives, were detained on politically motivated charges. The trial of those arrested was postponed until December, as they coincided with COP29,' they said. The Azerbaijani government, which has rejected accusations that the arrests were politically motivated, insists that journalists and activists are being detained 'on the basis of credible suspicions of violations of individual articles of the Criminal Code [of the Republic of Azerbaijan].' Climate change and human rights On Tuesday, COP29 hosted a debate titled 'No Climate Justice Without Civic Space and Meaningful Participation,' organized by Human Rights Watch, Amnesty International and several other human rights organizations. After the event, Fuad Hasanov, head of the nongovernmental organization Democratic Monitor, told VOA that the main theme of the debate was that it is impossible to hold discussions on climate change in an environment where the space for civil society is limited. Panel members also called on Azerbaijani authorities to release all political prisoners, including journalists, and to create conditions for the free operation of independent civil society institutions and the media. In a letter to President Ilham Aliyev published on Monday, Council of Europe Commissioner for Human Rights Michael O'Flaherty also urged the immediate release of all political prisoners. 'I share with you my concern about the recent arrests of a number of human rights defenders, journalists and civil society activists,' O'Flaherty said in the letter. O'Flaherty said that as a member of the Council of Europe, Azerbaijan should create a safe environment for human rights. 'I urge the Azerbaijani authorities to take the necessary steps to ensure that all laws and practices in connection with freedoms of association, assembly and expression and the situation of human rights defenders, journalists and civil society activists in the country comply with relevant Council of Europe human rights standards,' O'Flaherty said. Rufat Safarov, executive director of the human rights organization Defense Line, told VOA that the 29th annual U.N. Climate Change Conference should not have been held in Baku. He said this legitimizes the country's authorities, who deny fundamental rights and freedoms in Azerbaijan, on the international stage. 'In an environment where law is worthless, human rights are ignored, political rights are denied, violence has become the official state policy, and there are 319 political prisoners, holding COP29 in Baku serves the interests of the repressive regime at best,' Safarov said. Azerbaijan response The unsigned response letter from Azerbaijani authorities to the Council of Europe commissioner emphasizes that Azerbaijan remains committed to upholding its international obligations, including those under international human rights law, and ensuring the safety and freedom of all persons. The letter was made available on the Council of Europe commissioner’s website Monday. The letter stated: 'It should be emphasized that no journalist or media representative is being targeted for carrying out their professional work in Azerbaijan. Every individual, irrespective of their standing, is equal before the law and is expected to adhere to the legislation in force, as this forms the foundation of the rule of law principle. 'Therefore, it is of utmost importance to exercise due diligence and refrain from any actions, especially calling for immediate release of the persons under criminal investigation, that may be construed as interfering with the judicial process.' Lawmaker Bahruz Maharramov, a member of the parliament’s Human Rights Committee, told VOA on Thursday that the attacks on Azerbaijan from the West under the guise of human rights and democracy on the eve of and during COP29 are 'an instrument for cheap imperialist intentions.' 'In this sense, the claims and statements of those circles are irrelevant for us, and we rightly consider these claims to be part of a smear campaign against Azerbaijan,' he said.

Bomb cyclone' brings high winds and soaking rain to Northern California and Pacific Northwest	SEATTLE — What was expected to be one of the strongest storms in the northwest U.S. in decades arrived Tuesday evening, knocking out power and downing trees across the region. The Weather Prediction Center issued excessive rainfall risks beginning Tuesday and lasting through Friday as the strongest atmospheric river — a large plume of moisture — that California and the Pacific Northwest has seen this season bears down on the region. The storm system is considered a 'bomb cyclone,' which occurs when a cyclone intensifies rapidly. The areas that could see particularly severe rainfall will likely reach from the south of Portland, Oregon, to the north of the San Francisco area, said Richard Bann, a meteorologist with the National Weather Service Weather Prediction Center. 'Be aware of the risk of flash flooding at lower elevations and winter storms at higher elevations. This is going to be an impactful event,' he said. Hurricane-force winds, which are gusts above 121 kph, could be felt along the Oregon coast, according to the National Weather Service in Medford, Oregon. And near Seattle, conditions for a 'mountain wave' were shaping up, bringing large, low elevation wind gusts that could cause widespread power outages and downed trees, said Larry O'Neill, director of the Oregon Climate Service and Oregon State University associate professor. 'This will be pretty strong in terms of the last 10 or 20 years,' he said. 'We've only seen a couple storms that have really been this strong.' About 94,000 customers were without power in western Washington as strong winds ramped up and snow fell in the Cascade Mountain passes Tuesday evening. More than 12,000 customers had lost power in Oregon, according to poweroutage.us. The National Weather Service in Seattle said a peak wind speed of 109 kph was recorded at Crystal Mountain near Mount Rainier. Winds were expected to increase in western Washington throughout the evening, the weather service said. In northern California, flood and high wind watches were in effect, and a winter storm watch was issued for the northern Sierra Nevada above 1,066 meters, where 28 centimeters of snow was possible over two days. 'Numerous flash floods, hazardous travel, power outages and tree damage can be expected as the storm reaches max intensity' on Wednesday, the Weather Prediction Center warned. In Northern California's Yolo County, crews spent Monday clearing culverts, sewers and drainage ditches to avoid clogs that could lead to street flooding. Mesena Pimentel said she hoped the efforts would prevent a repeat of floods last February that inundated her property near Woodland. 'We had about 10 inches of water in our garage, had a couple gophers swimming around,' Pimentel told KCRA-TV. Woodland city officials set up two locations where residents could pick up free sandbags. Authorities urged people to stock up on food and charge phones and electronics in case power goes out and roads become unpassable. In southwestern Oregon near the coast, 10 to 18 centimeters of rain was predicted — with as much as 25 centimeters possible in some areas — through late Thursday night and early Friday morning, Bann said. The National Weather Service issued a flood watch for parts of southwestern Oregon through Friday evening. Washington could also see strong rainfall, but likely not as bad as Oregon and California. A blizzard warning was issued for the majority of the Cascades in Washington, including Mount Rainier National Park, starting Tuesday afternoon, with up to a foot of snow and wind gusts up to 97 kph, according to the weather service in Seattle. Travel across passes could be difficult if not impossible. Officials also urged motorists to consider delaying travel around the state until Wednesday because of high winds and heavy snow expected in the mountains. 'It will only be a winter wonderland in the sense that you'll be wondering where the heck you are on any given patch of land,' the Washington State Department of Transportation said on social media.	https://www.voanews.com/a/bomb-cyclone-brings-high-winds-and-soaking-rain-to-northern-california-and-pacific-northwest/7870251.html	2024-11-19T19:58:03-08:00	
Los Angeles passes 'sanctuary city' ordinance to protect migrants	LOS ANGELES — The Los Angeles City Council on Tuesday unanimously passed a 'sanctuary city' ordinance to protect immigrants living in the city, a policy that would prohibit the use of city resources and personnel to carry out federal immigration enforcement. The move by the Southern California city, the second most populated city in the U.S. after New York City, follows President-elect Donald Trump's vow to carry out mass deportations of immigrants. The ordinance codifies the protection of migrants in municipal law. Council member Paul Krekorian said the measure addresses 'the need to ensure that our immigrant community here in Los Angeles understands that we understand their fear.' Pro-immigrant protesters spoke on the steps of Los Angeles City Hall before the vote, holding up signs saying, 'Los Angeles Sanctuary City Now!' They chanted in Spanish 'What do we want? Sanctuary. When do we want it? Now.' The city is home to 1.3 million migrants, council members said, without specifying how many entered the country legally. 'We are extremely concerned, given that this is a city where about a third of the population is immigrants,' Shiu-Ming Cheer said at the rally. She is deputy director of immigrant and racial justice at the California Immigration Policy Center. People were 'afraid that the National Guard or other people are going to be forced to execute Trump's mass deportation plans,' she said. 'But, you know, we're also organized.' Eleven states have, to varying degrees, taken steps toward reducing cooperation with federal immigration enforcement, according to the non-profit Immigrant Legal Resource Center. Trump, winner of the Nov. 5 election, takes office on Jan. 20. The Trump transition team did not respond to a request for comment.	https://www.voanews.com/a/los-angeles-passes-sanctuary-city-ordinance-to-protect-migrants/7870241.html	2024-11-19T19:26:31-08:00	
Spain's royals return to flood disaster zone for 1st time since being pelted by mud	BARCELONA, Spain — Spain's royal couple returned Tuesday to the area devastated by last month's catastrophic flooding for the first time since enraged survivors pelted them and top elected officials with mud on their first visit to the disaster zone. King Felipe VI and Queen Letizia visited the town of Chiva along with a central government minister and the regional leader of eastern Valencia, whom many citizens have slammed for bungling the flood response. No mud flew this time as Felipe and Letizia shook hands with people at the beginning of their tour of the village. Other spectators took photos. Chiva, a hilltop town some 30 kilometers (20 miles) to the west of Valencia city, was ripped apart by a crushing wall of water that overflowed a normally dry gorge on the night of Oct. 29. Two of the four bridges spanning the gorge were demolished and several houses were washed away. The royals, Spain's prime minister and Valencia's leader had attempted to visit a hard-hit neighborhood of Valencia's southern outskirts on Nov. 3 just a few days after the floods. But they had to cut it short when angry locals tossed mud and other objects on their arrival in Paiporta. The royals withstood the vitriol for half an hour and spoke to several furious residents, but they eventually had to cancel the visit and postpone a subsequent stop planned for later that day in Chiva. The floods claimed a confirmed 227 lives and destroyed thousands of homes and vehicles. The cleanup effort continues three weeks on.	https://www.voanews.com/a/spain-s-royals-return-to-flood-disaster-zone-for-1st-time-since-being-pelted-by-mud/7870237.html	2024-11-19T19:14:35-08:00	
White House's Christmas tree is symbol of resilience for hurricane-hit North Carolina farms	NEWLAND, N.C. — The Cartner family had known since last year that one of their farm's Christmas trees would be headed to the White House this winter. But then Hurricane Helene struck, unleashing a deadly deluge across western North Carolina, including Avery County, where Cartner's Christmas Tree Farm has stood for decades. Though the farm lost thousands of trees to a mudslide, many more survived, including a 20-foot conical tree that dwarfs most of the others on the sprawling farm. That one will soon be cut down, lifted by a crane and put on a truck bound for the nation's capital. 'We wanted to really be an uplifting symbol for the other farmers and other people in western North Carolina that have experienced so many losses,' said Sam Cartner Jr., one of three brothers who owns the farm. From the back of the farm property, where the White House tree is located, it's hard to see the extent of Helene's damage. Countless rows of dark green trees stand in formation, contrasting against the lighter, mossy green shade of the rolling hills. It's mostly quiet, aside from chirping birds and rustling leaves. As Cartner ventures back to the front of the property in his SUV, the damage from Helene comes into view. A section of one of the grassy hills looks like it was clawed out to expose the brown earth beneath it — the aftermath of a mudslide that took out between 5,000 to 6,000 trees, Cartner said. Luckily, those trees were smaller and not market-size, meaning it wasn't an immediate problem for this harvest season, he said. Culverts and gullies on the property were also washed out from the storm, making immediate access to certain parts of the farm treacherous. It took a few weeks to fill in the dirt roads twisting through the farm, Cartner said, but it could have been much worse. 'We're looking forward to a relatively normal harvest,' Cartner said. 'Others will have a much harder time.' The biggest challenge for Christmas tree farmers across western North Carolina has been fixing infrastructure on their property, including roads, said Jennifer Greene, North Carolina Christmas Tree Association executive director. Despite tree losses on some farms, Greene said farmers across the region — who harvest between 4-5 million Christmas trees annually — are persevering. She doesn't anticipate Helene's damage drastically affecting this harvest season, but it's still uncertain how the devastation will affect future seasons. 'They're resourceful, and you know, so they're going to find a way, you know, to make it happen,' Greene said of the area's Christmas tree farmers. 'I mean, they have to.' From a small farm to sprawling acres of Christmas trees Cartner's parents, Sam and Margaret Cartner, founded the farm in 1959, where they grew Fraser firs, a tree species indigenous to the Appalachians. They later passed the farm on to Cartner Jr. and his two brothers. The farm started off small, raising cows, cabbage and beans alongside the Fraser firs, Cartner said. The family initially planted their trees on the steepest field because they didn't want to use up their best land for them, Cartner said. Now, Cartner's Christmas Tree Farm has grown to about 500 planted acres of land. Most of the farm's business is selling wholesale to independent garden centers and stores around the country. Their staffing operation is also much larger, as the farm employs temporary workers from Mexico to continue the year-round duties of maintaining the land, such as trimming trees. The task in recent days has been loading trees of various sizes into trailers ready to ship. 'We say we've touched a tree over 100 times by the time it gets to the consumer, and that's all manual labor,' Cartner said. Selecting the right tree for the White House All of that work led to Cartner's Christmas Tree Farm being named the 2024 grand champion at the National Christmas Tree Association's contest. Winning the competition traditionally means the champion will supply the White House's official Christmas tree that year. The visit to Cartner's Christmas Tree Farm by White House staff was initially delayed because of damaged roads, Greene said. When the staff made their selection in late October, they adorned their tree of choice with a red, white and blue ribbon that was larger than a basketball, Cartner said. The selected tree is about 25 years old and weighs between 180 to 230 kilograms — so heavy that a crane will be brought in to bring the tree to its transport truck ahead of its travels to Washington. Its 'wonderful verdant color' and short limbs were just a few reasons Cartner listed off that may have drawn White House staff to the tree, in addition to meeting certain size requirements for display. Cartner and his family will present the tree to first lady Jill Biden in front of the White House. Then, Cartner said they plan to return in December to see it decorated in the White House's Blue Room. Cartner's tree represents hope for western North Carolina While the buzz about the White House Christmas tree has been exciting, Cartner said he will be 'glad to have all this behind us.' It's been a tough year because of Helene, and harvest season is already difficult enough as is, he said. 'You've got to cut and ship that number of trees in two to three weeks, you put a hurricane on top of that, White House tree and all the activities, it gets almost overwhelming,' he said. And work has already begun for next year. The farm has some obstacles to overcome, including finding places to buy seedlings after Helene devastated some greenhouses. There's also paperwork to fill out for workers to return to the farm next season, as well as several orders to make for fertilizer and insecticide. It's a large-scale operation that has come a long way from when Cartner's parents started it. While his parents wouldn't have liked all the attention the farm has received, Cartner said they would be proud that they were representing western North Carolina during a time of hardship for many after Helene. 'They would want this tree to represent the faith, and hope, and love, and joy and family and generosity, all those good things of mankind that we need to stop and recognize,' he said.	https://www.voanews.com/a/white-house-s-christmas-tree-is-symbol-of-resilience-for-hurricane-hit-north-carolina-farms/7870235.html	2024-11-19T19:02:06-08:00	
Alleviating poverty can mitigate migration crisis, say experts at G20	Poverty and hunger are major factors in the global migration crisis, say experts.

Trump sentencing in hush money case remains uncertain	Back in May, former President Donald Trump was found guilty of 34 felony counts of falsifying business records to suppress damaging information ahead of his 2016 election. His sentencing was delayed until after the election, but now that he is president-elect, what happens next is less clear.

Wife of slain Pakistani journalist’s long and lonely fight for justice	WASHINGTON — The last time Javeria Siddique spoke with her husband, the renowned Pakistani news anchor Arshad Sharif, he was 'happy and excited,' she said. Sharif was in Kenya after leaving his home country because of threats and legal issues. On that video call on October 21, 2022, he talked to all the family members, Siddique said, even the pets. 'His dogs were so excited to see him on video call as they thought he had returned home,' Siddique told VOA. But the journalist never returned home. Two days after that call, Sharif was shot dead at a roadblock in Kenya. His death shocked Pakistan and led to competing theories about what happened. Was it, as Kenyan authorities claim, a case of mistaken identity, or had powerful interests that Sharif took on in his journalism found a way to silence him? For Siddique, she is balancing grief over her husband of 12 years with fighting for answers about what led to his death, and who may be responsible. But it is a lonely fight. 'It is so quiet in my house right now that you can hear the ticking of the wall clock. It seems like everything is getting out of hand,' Siddique told VOA during a video call. Siddique, one of Sharif’s two widows, wants the government to re-open the case into her husband’s killing. 'A special judicial commission should be formed,' she said, 'so that an investigation can be conducted into the murder of Arshad Sharif and other journalists who have been killed in Pakistan this year.' Siddique’s push for justice is a challenge shared by other families of journalists killed in apparent retaliation for their work. Pakistan has legislation to ensure journalist safety at provincial and federal levels, said Iqbal Khattak, Pakistan representative for Reporters Without Borders, known as RSF. But, 'both the laws appear to be failing in protecting journalists and combating impunity, leaving journalists vulnerable, without any use of the legal framework protections,' said Khattak. Part of the reason, he added, is because the safety commissions and systems required have not been fully established. 'Without robust and functioning safety mechanisms, these laws will remain ineffective, and the lives of media professionals will continue to be at greater risks.' Pakistan has proved to be one of the deadliest countries for journalists this year, with at least six killings, according to media watchdogs. But the Pakistani media watchdog Freedom Network, of which Khattak is executive director, has documented attempted killings this year as well. In the group’s first report focused on journalist safety, it documented at least 57 violations, including threats, assaults, and legal harassment between November 2023 and August 2024. Sharif had experienced threats and legal harassment before he finally left Pakistan in August 2022. The one-time anchor of Pakistan’s ARY News channel had become a vocal critic of Pakistan's powerful military establishment after former Prime Minister Imran Khan was removed from office in April 2022. 'Arshad acted on his own will,' said Siddique. 'And when you do that, the system starts to feel threatened by such people.' Siddique said that suspicious people would stand outside their home, and on one occasion someone tried to enter their property. The journalist also received anonymous threatening calls. But, she said, Sharif refused to back down. 'I saw him becoming even more fearless. I saw him crossing the so-called ‘red lines.’ He started questioning various things that we normally cannot question in Pakistan.' Sharif also came under legal threats, with sedition charges leveled against him when he finally left, traveling first to Dubai and then to Kenya. Two months later, he was killed. Two years later, Sharif’s case remains unresolved. Cross-border probe The government of Pakistan sent an investigation team to Kenya and requested collaboration with Kenyan authorities, saying 'an assassination cannot be ruled out.' In December 2022, the chief justice of Pakistan’s supreme court ordered a five-member bench to look into Arshad’s death. The following year, that chief justice retired; since his departure, there has been no movement in the case. Siddique says the Pakistan court proceedings have been marred with delays and hurdles. There have been delays in Kenya, too. After a court there ruled that the journalist’s death was unlawful and arbitrary, law enforcement was ordered to pay compensation. But an appeal led to a stay on the case until January, one of the Kenyan lawyers who represents Siddique told VOA. RSF’s Iqbal Khattak believes Pakistan should be taking the lead. 'Sharif’s murder story begins from Pakistan,' Khattak said. 'If we do not find who killed him and why was he killed, then the conspiracy theories surrounding his death will stay the course and people will believe them.' For Siddique, the two years since her husband’s death have been hard. She faced threats and harassment that she believes are intended to deter her from demanding a transparent investigation. 'In last two years, I had to relocate twice,' she said. 'I have seen my ID card, home address, all plastered on the internet.' She is also trying to keep the legal cases moving forward. Siddique has demanded that the Pakistani state form a special judicial commission to investigate her husband’s death as well as the killings of other journalists in Pakistan this year. 'Now, I speak up for everyone. Because they all have the option to be reunited with their loved ones. I don't have that option,' said Siddique.	https://www.voanews.com/a/wife-of-slain-pakistani-journalist-s-long-and-lonely-fight-for-justice/7870212.html	2024-11-19T18:17:19-08:00	
Doctors Without Borders halts operations in Haiti's capital	Port Au Prince — Doctors Without Borders said on Tuesday that it is stopping operations across the Haitian capital, Port-au-Prince, and its wider metropolitan area because of an escalation in violence and threats to its staff from members of the Haitian police. The suspension would begin Wednesday and last 'until further notice,' Doctors Without Borders — also known as MSF — said. MSF said in a statement that since a deadly attack on one of its ambulances last week, police had repeatedly stopped its vehicles and directly threatened their staff, some with death or rape. 'We are used to working in conditions of extreme insecurity in Haiti and elsewhere, but when even law enforcement becomes a direct threat, we have no choice but to suspend our projects,' MSF's Haiti mission chief Christophe Garnier said. A spokesperson for Haiti's national police declined to comment. Earlier Tuesday, police reported that more than two dozen suspected gang members were killed after residents joined police to fight off attempted overnight attacks in a resurgence of a civilian vigilante movement. MSF, whose presence grew in Haiti in the wake of the devastating 2010 earthquake, is one of the main providers of quality free health care in the Caribbean nation and operates key services such as a trauma center and a burn clinic. The United Nations estimated last month that 24% of the Port-au-Prince metropolitan area's health facilities remain open, while those outside the capital face an influx of displaced people jeopardizing their ability to provide essential care. MSF cited four separate incidents of police threats and aggressions, including from an armed plain clothed officer it said threatened to start executing and burning staff, patients and ambulances as of next week. Each week, the medical aid group treats on average 1,100 outpatients, 54 children in emergency situations, more than 80 sexual- and gender-based violence survivors, and many burn victims, MSF said. Garnier added that while MSF remained committed to the population it could only resume services if it receives guarantees of security and respect by armed groups, members of self-defense groups and law enforcement. In the earlier violence, residents joined police to fight off an attempted overnight attack on an affluent hillside suburb of Port-au-Prince, police said. The suburb of Petion-Ville was closed off on Tuesday as residents barricaded streets and asked those not from the area to stay home as they mobilized, some with machetes and hammers in hand, to protect the district from another gang invasion. A Reuters reporter saw at least 25 bodies across the neighborhoods of Petion-Ville, Delmas and Canape Vert. National police deputy spokesperson Lionel Lazarre told Reuters about 30 people he described as gang members had been fatally wounded throughout the day. 'The population stood along the Haitian National Police during these moments. They will continue to work hand in hand,' he said. The U.N. has reported at least 149 cases of vigilantism between June and September this year, just more than half outside Port-au-Prince where residents fear gangs spreading their influence from the capital. The U.N. Security Council approved a support mission last October but has so far deployed just a fraction of the promised personnel. Haitian leaders have pushed for it to be transformed into a peacekeeping mission to secure more funding.	https://www.voanews.com/a/7870195.html	2024-11-19T17:59:22-08:00	
Pakistan’s Islamic Council calls for ban on use of VPNs	WASHINGTON — Pakistan's top cleric has declared that virtual private networks, or VPNs, are unlawful, igniting a debate on privacy rights and access to information amid a government crackdown on the internet. Allama Raghib Naeemi, head of the Council of Islamic Ideology (CII), issued a decree saying it makes no difference whether a VPN is registered or unregistered. 'If attempts are made to access indecent or immoral sites, character assassination is done, statements are being made against national security, or if various incidents of religious blasphemy are being spread through it, then [using] it would completely be un-Islamic,' he said. A VPN protects online privacy by creating a secure connection and is used to access blocked content, protect data from hackers and support remote work or secure transactions. Several internet service providers in Pakistan expressed concerns Tuesday over the possible imposition of blanket restrictions on VPNs, warning that the move would anger users and impact online businesses. Shahzad Arshad, chairman of the Wireless and Internet Service Providers Association of Pakistan, said in a statement, 'It is essential to recognize that blanket restrictions or sweeping narratives around tools like VPNs risk alienating segments of society, particularly those who rely on these tools for entirely legitimate purposes, such as IT exports, financial transactions, and academic research.' Arshad, in reference to CII's declaration, said technology is neutral and that how it is used determines whether it is aligned with ethics. Amnesty Tech, part of Amnesty International, said last week on X that imposing restrictions on VPNs would amount to 'violating the right to privacy under international law, restricting people’s access to information, and suppressing free expression.' Qibla Ayaz, former chairman of CII, told VOA Deewa it seems as if a government agency has reached out to the religious body seeking its stance on the VPN issue. 'Similar requests were sent by the government in 2023,' he said. The CII is a constitutional body in Pakistan that advises the legislature on whether a certain law is repugnant to Islam, namely to the Quran and Sunna. According to activists and experts, CII’s declarations on technology use are unwarranted and will only strengthen the government's digital suppression of social media users. Haroon Baloch, a Pakistani digital rights activist, believes the proposed restrictions on VPNs are aimed at suppressing political dissent. 'First, the government had compliance challenges with X. And when the platform did not agree with the government’s requests, then it banned X. And when X was available with the help of VPN, the government is planning to ban the VPN now,' Haroon told VOA. Pakistan banned X in February and installed firewalls to restrict access to certain online content. But consumers are using VPNs to access restricted networks and content and to hide their identities and locations. Pakistan Army Chief General Asim Munir told a gathering at the Islamabad Policy Research Institute on November 16 that technology has played a pivotal role in the dissemination of information, but 'the spread of misleading and incorrect information has become a significant challenge.' In a speech to religious leaders in Islamabad earlier in August, Munir said, 'Anarchy is spread through social media.' A directive in October from the Interior Ministry asked the Pakistan Telecommunication Authority to block 'illegal' VPNs that had not registered by the end of November. The Interior Ministry charged in a letter to the Pakistan Telecommunication Authority, which oversees the internet and mobile industry and has broad powers over online content and the licensing of service providers, that terrorists are increasingly using VPNs to facilitate violent activities and financial transactions in Pakistan. 'Of late, an alarming fact has been identified, wherein VPNs are used by terrorists to obscure and conceal their communications,' the letter said, adding that pornography sites are frequently accessed using VPNs. 'These trends ... warrant the prohibition of unauthorized virtual private networks in order to address critical threats,' the letter said. The 2024 'Freedom on the Net' report published by Freedom House says the Pakistan Telecommunication Authority has historically implemented policies that undermine internet freedom, removed content without a transparent process and instituted wholesale bans on platforms. This story originated in VOA’s Deewa Service.	https://www.voanews.com/a/pakistan-s-islamic-council-calls-for-ban-on-use-of-vpns/7870198.html	2024-11-19T17:23:52-08:00	
G20 wraps with talk of climate change, poverty reduction, tax on billionaires	rio de janeiro — Leaders of the world's largest economies ended their two-day G20 summit in Rio de Janeiro with a statement supporting the priorities of the Global South: climate change, poverty reduction and taxing billionaires. The Global South is generally considered to be developing countries, as well as Russia and China. Brazilian President Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva, host of the G20 summit, focused the talks around three key pillars: social inclusion and tackling hunger and poverty; energy, transitions and climate action, and reforming global governance. Globalization has failed, Lula said. 'In the midst of growing turbulence, the international community seems resigned to sailing aimlessly through hegemonic disputes,' he said. 'We remain adrift as if swept along by a torrent pushing us towards tragedy.' In their joint statement, the group underscored the need to slow global warming and reduce poverty. They agreed to work together to 'ensure that ultra-high-net-worth individuals are effectively taxed.' The communique states that progressive taxation 'is one of the key tools to reduce domestic inequalities … promote strong, sustainable balanced and inclusive growth and facilitate the achievement of the UN Sustainable Development Goals [SDGs].' Call for expansion The G20 again called to expand the United Nations Security Council beyond its five current permanent members. The outcomes are a reasonable reflection of Biden administration priorities, said Matthew Goodman, director of the Greenberg Center for Geoeconomic Studies at the Council on Foreign Relations. 'But it isn't clear how much of this will carry forward into a second Trump administration,' he said. President-elect Donald Trump will be inaugurated in January. A senior Biden administration official said they're working to ensure the durability of U.S. commitments with a 'multiprong, multitier approach,' including through civil society, so 'there is some real staying power.' At the summit, President Joe Biden continued his 'legacy of leadership,' the White House said, including rallying leaders 'to invest in their futures, accelerate the global clean energy transition, tackle global health threats, and champion an inclusive digital transformation' while building on the U.S.'s 'longstanding leadership on food security.' Global conflicts The group called for a cease-fire in Gaza and Lebanon but did not mention Israel's right to defend itself, a line that Biden pushes for in various global forums. 'I ask everyone here to increase the pressure on Hamas, which is currently refusing this deal,' Biden said. As in last year's summit, G20 leaders highlighted the human suffering and economic impact of the war in Ukraine, without any condemnation of Russia. The war is escalating as Ukraine begins using long-range weapons provided by the U.S. and Britain to strike inside Russian territory. Kyiv accuses the G20 of failing to act. 'Today, G20 countries are sitting in Brazil. Did they say something? Nothing strong,' Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy said on Tuesday. 'G20 countries don't have any strong strategy? So, our strategy is to be strong.' There is 'less international consensus now on Russia's culpability than there was before,' said Kristine Berzina, managing director of GMF Geostrategy North. 'Countries skeptical of a rules-based or rights-based order are flexing their muscles at the G20, much as they brazenly sidled up to Russia at the BRICS summit in Kazan weeks ago,' she said. Support for Ukraine is on the minds of leaders ahead of the incoming U.S. administration under Trump, who has criticized sending aid to help Kyiv. Biden and Lula met on the summit's sidelines, underscoring the urgent need to address the climate crisis, another area of uncertainty among leaders here. Trump has repeatedly called climate change a hoax and withdrew the U.S. from the Paris Climate Accords in 2017 during his first term. Brazil ended the summit by passing the baton to South Africa, the next G20 president.	https://www.voanews.com/a/g20-wraps-highlighting-global-south-issues/7870178.html	2024-11-19T17:14:40-08:00

Iran increases its near weapons-grade uranium	Iran has increased its supply of uranium that has been enriched to 60% purity, according to confidential International Atomic Energy Agency reports sent to member states and seen by several news agencies. Atomic weapons can be created when uranium enriched to 60% is further enriched to 90%. The enrichment procedure is a short, technical process. However, Iran has offered to cap its stockpile of enriched uranium if Western powers abandon their plan to pass a resolution against the Middle Eastern country at the IAEA Board of Governors meeting this week in Vienna. The resolution is about Iran’s lack of cooperation with the IAEA, the U.N. nuclear watchdog agency. Diplomats told Reuters the campaign for the resolution, backed by Britain, France, Germany and the United States, continues. If the resolution is adopted, the IAEA would then have to issue a 'comprehensive report' on Iran’s nuclear activities, diplomats told Reuters. Iran made the offer to stop producing the enriched uranium last week during a visit to Tehran by IAEA Director General Rafael Mariano Grossi. One day after Grossi’s visit, IAEA inspectors confirmed that 'Iran had begun implementation of preparatory measures aimed at stopping the additional stockpile of uranium enriched up to 60% U-235' at its underground nuclear sites in Fordow and Natanz. The IAEA report revealed that as of October 26, Iran had 182.3 kilograms of 60%-enriched uranium, an increase of 17.6 kilograms since the August report. The Middle Eastern country maintains that its nuclear activities are for peaceful purposes only. Grossi has previously warned that Iran has enough enriched uranium that could be further enriched to make several atomic weapons. Iran’s original IAEA deal allowed it to enrich uranium to 3.67% purity and keep a supply of only 300 kilograms of uranium. IAEA’s dispute with Iran comes at an internationally sensitive time as Iran and Israel have exchanged missile attacks related to Israel’s war with Hamas and Hezbollah, designated terror groups that Iran supports. In addition, Donald Trump will become the U.S. president in January. During Trump’s first term in office, he withdrew the U.S. from the world’s nuclear deal with Iran, a move that exposed Iran to sanctions that have had a crippling effect on its economy. Some information provided by The Associated Press and Reuters.	https://www.voanews.com/a/iran-increases-its-near-weapons-grade-uranium-/7870147.html	2024-11-19T16:32:54-08:00	
Falling yuan poses challenge for China's policymakers	new delhi — The Chinese yuan has plummeted since U.S. President-elect Donald Trump's victory, and finance experts are questioning why the Chinese government is not doing more to defend the currency. 'The slide in the yuan's value reflects the negative expectations of the world towards China-U.S. relations after the recent victory of Donald Trump, as well as some misperception in the international market towards China's growth,' Wang Wen, dean of Renmin University's Chongyang Institute for Financial Studies, told VOA. The yuan, or renminbi, has been slipping against the U.S. dollar since well before the U.S. election on November 5, dropping more than 3% against the dollar in a seven-week losing streak, Reuters reported on November 15. Will the yuan continue to slide until early 2025 when the Trump administration takes charge? The Chinese currency closed Tuesday at 7.23 to a U.S. dollar, compared to 7.09 to a dollar on U.S. Election Day. 'There's been a broad strengthening of the dollar over the past few weeks which is in part a response to Donald Trump's election victory but also to stronger U.S. economic data,' said Mark Williams, chief Asia economist at London-based Capital Economics. 'Both developments have led investors to pare back expectations for rate cuts by the U.S. Federal Reserve.' Export strategy Some economists believe that Beijing deliberately allowed its currency to slide to enhance China's export prospects. Trump has promised to impose a 60% tariff on all Chinese goods. 'A weaker currency also acts as a safety valve, offsetting the impact of the tariff by making the country's exports cheaper,' Williams said. China's policymakers are sitting on the world's biggest reserve at $3.26 trillion, according to the state-run Global Times. Though this offers a strong cushion against shocks, Beijing prefers not to spend much of it to defend the yuan. 'The PBoC [Bank of China] will not wish to burn through its foreign reserves in a doomed effort to keep the RMB at current levels,' said Benn Steil, a senior fellow and director of international economics at the Council on Foreign Relations. 'The PBoC can slow RMB depreciation, but market pressure will eventually win out — if not in the coming weeks, in the coming months,' Steil said. Trump's plans to impose massive tariffs will keep U.S. interest rates higher, and in turn, reduce U.S. demand for foreign currency to pay for imports, Steil said. 'Both of these effects will act to push up the value of the dollar and push down the value of the currencies of U.S. trade partners, in particular China,' he said. But Wang of Renmin University said the yuan would absorb the initial shock and begin to rise after next year. 'At present, the competition between China and the United States has reached a critical period. But China will not lose in the longer term and the yuan will begin to appreciate,' he said, adding, 'Time is on China's side.' The biggest risk for China is an accelerating capital flight — unrecorded outflows from Chinese residents as they lose confidence in the domestic economy, Steil pointed out. 'This will hurt China's ambition of boosting household domestic consumption, which is the only way to stabilize the Chinese economy in the medium term,' he said. Risk of declining yuan A weak yuan will also reduce confidence in the Chinese economy among foreign investors while hampering Beijing's long-standing effort to internationalize its currency. Goldman Sachs said it expects China's exports to fall 0.9% next year in nominal dollar terms, mostly because of higher tariffs, according to Reuters. 'The tariff impacts should, however, be partially offset by domestic easing and currency depreciation,' Goldman said. It expects the yuan to weaken to 7.50 per dollar by the end of 2025.	https://www.voanews.com/a/falling-yuan-poses-challenge-for-china-s-policymakers/7869906.html	2024-11-19T16:14:07-08:00	
Months after Venezuelan election, US recognizes opposition candidate as president-elect	CARACAS, Venezuela — The U.S. government recognized Venezuelan opposition candidate Edmundo Gonzalez as 'president-elect' of the South American country on Tuesday, months after President Nicolas Maduro claimed to have won the July election. U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken recognized Gonzalez in a post on X in which he also demanded 'respect for the will' of Venezuelan voters. The administration of U.S. President Joe Biden has said Gonzalez earned the most votes in the disputed July 28 election but has fallen short of acknowledging him as president-elect. Venezuela's National Electoral Council, which is stacked with Maduro loyalists, declared Maduro the election winner hours after polls closed. Unlike previous presidential elections, electoral authorities did not provide detailed vote counts. But the opposition coalition collected tally sheets from 80% of the nation's electronic voting machines and posted them online. González and opposition leader Maria Corina Machado said the voting records showed the former diplomat won the election with twice as many votes as Maduro. 'We deeply appreciate the recognition of the sovereign will of all Venezuelans,' Gonzalez said in a post on X shortly after Blinken's statement on Tuesday. 'This gesture honors the desire for change of our people and the civic feat that we carried out together on July 28.' Gonzalez left Venezuela in September for exile in Spain after a warrant was issued for his arrest in connection with an investigation into the publishing of the vote tally sheets. Venezuelan Foreign Minister Yvan Gil responded to Blinken's comment with personal attacks. 'In the last days of his government, he should dedicate himself to reflecting on his failures, getting rid of imperial and colonial complexes and going to write the memoirs of how the Bolivarian Revolution made him bite the dust of defeat, just like his predecessors,' Gil said of Blinken in a statement, which did not mention election results. Maduro and electoral authorities have rejected repeated calls from the U.S., the European Union, Colombia, Brazil and other nations to show the detailed vote records that back up the president's reelection. Swift condemnation of the lack of post-election transparency prompted Maduro to ask Venezuela's Supreme Tribunal of Justice, whose members are aligned with the ruling party, to audit the results. The high court reaffirmed his victory. Experts from the United Nations and the U.S.-based Carter Center, which observed the election at the invitation of Maduro's government, determined the results announced by electoral authorities lacked credibility. The U.N. experts stopped short of validating the opposition's claim to victory but said the faction's voting records published online appear to exhibit all of the original security features. Earlier in the week, Colombian President Gustavo Petro, who has friendly relations with Maduro, reversed his support for the July elections, calling the vote a 'mistake.' Petro spoke in an interview with Brazilian news outlet Globo News, which released excerpts online that Petro's office shared Tuesday on social media. Petro told the news outlet Monday while visiting Brazil for the G20 summit that he initially was in favor of Venezuela holding the elections, but that he later decided that the vote was not 'free.' 'I think the elections were a mistake,' Petro said. His office did not immediately respond to a request for him to elaborate on the reasons for his change of heart. Petro, Brazilian President Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva and then-Mexican President Andrés Manuel Lopez Obrador — all leftists friendly with Maduro — attempted to make peace as the results came under dispute, but the effort went nowhere. Venezuela's next presidential term begins on January 10. Maduro has already received an invitation from the ruling party-controlled National Assembly for a swearing-in ceremony.	https://www.voanews.com/a/us-recognizes-venezuela-s-opposition-candidate-as-president-elect-months-after-election-/7869895.html	2024-11-19T15:42:02-08:00

China's Xi, Germany's Scholz discuss EV tariffs, 'broad market opportunities'	China has asked Germany to support efforts to resolve a dispute between the European Union and Beijing over electric vehicle tariffs. Last month, the EU decided to raise tariffs on electric vehicles imported from China to as much as 45.3%. Beijing has been negotiating with the EU to repeal the tariffs and sees Germany – the bloc's biggest economy and Beijing's largest trading partner in Europe – potentially playing a key role. In a meeting Tuesday on the sidelines of the G20 Summit in Rio de Janeiro, China's President Xi Jinping told Germany's Chancellor Olaf Scholz that, in return Beijing would 'continue to provide broad market opportunities for German companies,' according to readout of the meeting from state news agency Xinhua. 'China regards Germany as an important partner in advancing Chinese modernization,' Xi said. 'It is hoped that Europe and China will resolve the issue of electric vehicles through dialogue and negotiation as soon as possible, and the German side is willing to make active efforts in this regard.' Xi also urged Beijing and Berlin to strengthen their 'long-term' strategic partnership. 'China and Germany are both major countries with significant influence,' Xi told Scholz, according to Xinhua. He also said: 'The two countries need to view and develop bilateral relations from a long-term and strategic perspective.' A German government spokesman said the meeting between Scholz and Xi lasted 30 minutes and that the chancellor also discussed the war in Ukraine and the Middle East. 'In particular, he warned of (the dangers of) escalation due to the deployment of North Korean troops, the statement said, a reference to the deployment of what the U.S. estimates is at least 11,000 North Korean troops to fight for Russia against Ukraine. The meeting between Germany's chancellor and China's president was their first since April in Beijing, where Scholz urged Xi to leverage his influence over Russia to help end the war in Ukraine. Some material in this report came from Reuters and Agence France-Presse.	https://www.voanews.com/a/china-xi-germany-scholz-discuss-ev-tariffs-broad-market-opportunities/7869790.html	2024-11-19T13:57:46-08:00	
Americans confront racial past in debate over critical race theory	New Orleans, Louisiana — The teaching of America’s racial history is dividing voters as state governments and federal judges weigh in on what is known as critical race theory. 'What we are seeing is that America is having a very public argument about how to discuss race in our country,' explained Stanford law professor Ralph Richard Banks. 'It is a conversation about how we talk about the racist incidents in our past but also about how the past continues to shape inequalities in the present. 'But what makes the topic especially charged,' he added, 'is that this is a debate that has reached our children and their classrooms.' Banks says part of the issue is disagreement over an approach to the subject known as critical race theory. Liberals largely see it as a way of understanding how American racism has shaped public policy, while conservatives view it as a divisive discourse aimed at shaming white Americans for past atrocities while further dividing the country’s racial groups. 'I have no problem with the teaching of history,' explained Cody Clark, a Republican voter from Denton, Texas. 'But I don’t like the idea of teachers telling our children that some of them are privileged and some of them are oppressed. I think that just passes our divisions to the next generation.' Louisiana Republican Governor Jeff Landry this year signed an executive order banning the teaching of critical race theory in public schools, making the Pelican State the 18th in the country to limit or ban the subject. Public school teachers and civil rights attorneys are responding. Civil rights attorneys in Little Rock are arguing before a federal judge that an Arkansas law banning critical race theory in schools violates the U.S. Constitution. Louisiana public school teacher Lauren Jewett calls the bans misguided. 'I think it’s laughable and insulting in the same breath,' she told VOA. 'K-12 teachers don’t teach critical race theory. It’s not in the state standards or our curricula and, to be honest, we don’t even have enough time to eat our lunches or meet all our students’ needs, let alone create new material.' What is critical race theory? While Jewett says laws banning critical race theory in public schools are political stunts, she also calls accurate accounts of American history essential. 'Our country has many uncomfortable and violent truths such as slavery, colonization, segregation, and mass incarceration,' she said. 'It is important for our students to understand why things in the current day are the way they are and how history informs that. But that is not critical race theory.' To understand what critical race theory is, Stanford Law professor Banks says you need to go back to the U.S. Supreme Court’s landmark 1954 decision in Brown v. Board of Education. 'The decision said that racial segregation of our public schools was unconstitutional,' he told VOA, 'but more than a decade later, civil rights leaders noticed nothing had changed. Black students were still going to different schools of a lower quality than their white peers.' Banks says critical race theory was developed to help understand why — even when Americans passed laws to create equality — inequality seemed to prevail. Civil rights lawyers including Derrick Bell, whose thought was vital to the development of critical race theory, concluded that racial bias is inherent in Western society’s legal and social institutions, as the race with the most political power had material reasons to protect that power at the expense of other races. Well-developed among legal scholars in the 1970s, the theory was largely unknown to the public. 'Critical race theory was so obscure it wasn’t even something taught at most law schools,' Banks says. 'It wasn’t in practice in corporate law or even civil rights law, but more like a framework or approach some academics might use to understand race-based issues. 'But that all changed after George Floyd was killed.' Bogeyman in the mainstream Banks says critical race theory grew to prominence largely as the target of Republican reaction to the Black Lives Matter movement that rose from the 2020 death of George Floyd at the hands of a white police officer in Minnesota. Critical race theory 'was a good target because it embodies three things that tend to give many Americans a lot of anxiety,' Banks said. The idea that 'being critical of this country isn’t considered part of ‘the American spirit;’ [that] we have strains of anti-intellectuals that make theories repulsive; and we don’t feel comfortable talking about our racist past as if it’s unresolved.' A 2023 poll by the Black Education Research Center at Columbia University found that 85% of respondents agreed that public school students should learn about the history of racism and slavery in the United States and its impact on events today. That consensus evaporates when it comes to the government’s role in righting past wrongs. 'Of course, I think students should be learning about how our government has been prejudiced in the past in dealing with minorities through policies like slavery or not allowing mixed marriages,' explained Rebecca Urrutia, a Republican voter in Tolland, Connecticut. 'I also think we need to teach about revisiting our laws to change any that are still unfair today. 'But I don’t think it makes sense to be teaching things like critical race theory to our kids,' she added. 'If teachers are trying to convince white students that they have an inherent tendency toward privilege and discrimination against Black people, then I think this perpetuates the very cycle they claim they are trying to escape. Instead, teach our true history and our progress so we can learn from our mistakes and successes.' Some Democratic voters view attacks on critical race theory as part of an effort to discredit movements that would promote the interests of minorities in the United States. 'They’re trying to turn critical race theory into a political bogeyman, and the result is getting closer and closer to censorship,' says California Democrat Evante Daniels. 'These anti-CRT laws are so unclear that schools become unsure what they can and can’t teach. Are LGBTQ clubs and ethnic studies okay? How about culturally relevant teaching? What happens when teachers are afraid to effectively teach about our past because they don’t know if they’re breaking a purposely ambiguous law?' Banks of Stanford Law has similar fears. 'I actually understand if a parent has a concern about their second grader learning about things like white privilege,' he said. 'That’s a valid concern. But if a teacher doesn’t know what is and isn’t allowed, they operate from fear and leave important parts of lessons out. The result, unfortunately for our kids and our country, is an impoverished education.'	https://www.voanews.com/a/americans-confront-racial-past-in-debate-over-critical-race-theory/7869758.html	2024-11-19T13:00:23-08:00	
Judge strikes down Wyoming abortion ban, including explicit ban on pills	CHEYENNE, Wyoming — A state judge on Monday struck down Wyoming's overall ban on abortion and its first-in-the-nation explicit prohibition on the use of medication to end pregnancy. Since 2022, Teton County District Judge Melissa Owens has ruled consistently three times to block the laws while they were disputed in court. The decision marks another victory for abortion rights advocates after voters in seven states passed measures in support of access. One Wyoming law that Owens said violated women's rights under the state constitution bans abortion except to protect a pregnant woman's life or in cases involving rape and incest. The other made Wyoming the only state to explicitly ban abortion pills, though other states have instituted de facto bans on the medication by broadly prohibiting abortion. The laws were challenged by four women, including two obstetricians, and two nonprofit organizations. One of the groups, Wellspring Health Access, opened as the state's first full-service abortion clinic in years in April 2023 following an arson attack in 2022. 'This is a wonderful day for the citizens of Wyoming — and women everywhere who should have control over their own bodies,' Wellspring Health Access President Julie Burkhart said in a statement. The recent elections saw voters in Missouri clear the way to undo one of the nation's most restrictive abortion bans in a series of victories for abortion rights advocates. Florida, Nebraska and South Dakota, meanwhile, defeated similar constitutional amendments, leaving bans in place. Abortion rights amendments also passed in Arizona, Colorado, Maryland and Montana. Nevada voters also approved an amendment in support of abortion rights, but they'll need to pass it again in 2026 for it to take effect. Another that bans discrimination on the basis of 'pregnancy outcomes' prevailed in New York. The abortion landscape underwent a seismic shift in 2022 when the U.S. Supreme Court overturned Roe v. Wade, a ruling that ended a nationwide right to abortion and cleared the way for bans to take effect in most Republican-controlled states. Currently, 13 states are enforcing bans on abortion at all stages of pregnancy, with limited exceptions, and four have bans that kick in at or about six weeks into pregnancy — often before women realize they're pregnant. Nearly every ban has been challenged with a lawsuit. Courts have blocked enforcement of some restrictions, including bans throughout pregnancy in Utah and Wyoming. Judges struck down bans in Georgia and North Dakota in September 2024. Georgia's Supreme Court ruled the next month that the ban there can be enforced while it considers the case. In the Wyoming case, the women and nonprofits who challenged the laws argued that the bans stood to harm their health, well-being and livelihoods, claims disputed by attorneys for the state. They also argued the bans violated a 2012 state constitutional amendment saying competent Wyoming residents have a right to make their own health care decisions. As she had done with previous rulings, Owens found merit in both arguments. The abortion bans 'will undermine the integrity of the medical profession by hamstringing the ability of physicians to provide evidence-based medicine to their patients,' Owens ruled. The abortion laws impede the fundamental right of women to make health care decisions for an entire class of people — those who are pregnant — in violation of the constitutional amendment, Owens ruled.	https://www.voanews.com/a/judge-strikes-down-wyoming-abortion-ban-including-explicit-ban-on-pills/7869744.html	2024-11-19T12:42:16-08:00	
Trump plans to nominate billionaire Wall Street banker for commerce secretary	U.S. President-elect Donald Trump plans to nominate Wall Street financier Howard Lutnick as commerce secretary in his new administration, Trump announced on Tuesday. The 63-year-old billionaire has been co-chair of Trump's transition team, helping to consider and vet numerous people to assume top-level government jobs after Trump takes office on January 20. Lutnick has been an outspoken Trump supporter in recent months. The CEO and chairman of the Cantor Fitzgerald global financial services firm, Lutnick was reported to be in contention to become Treasury secretary, another top job Trump has yet to fill. But Trump associates say Lutnick fell out of favor for the Treasury job amid conflicts with another leading candidate, investor Scott Bessent. If nominated to become commerce secretary and confirmed by the Senate, as would be likely, Lutnick could play a leading role in implementing the president's economic and trade policies. Trump has proposed widespread increases in tariffs on imported goods, an effort to boost American manufacturing of the same products, but one that in the near term threatens to increase prices for American consumers and disrupt the global economy. The Commerce Department oversees an array of federal business policies, including on semiconductors, cybersecurity and patents, and helps promote new businesses and economic growth in the United States, the world's biggest economy. Lutnick has donated to both Democrats and Republicans in the past. He also once appeared on Trump's NBC reality TV show 'The Apprentice' before Trump was first elected president in 2016. The Cantor Fitzgerald firm that Lutnick heads lost more employees — 658 out of 960 — than any other business in the September 11, 2001, al-Qaida terrorist attack on the twin towers of the World Trade Center in New York. Another 46 contractors and visitors who were in the Cantor Fitzgerald offices that day were killed when the towers collapsed. Lutnick's brother Gary was among those killed when hijackers flew commercial jetliners into the skyscrapers, hitting the North Tower just below where Cantor Fitzgerald occupied floors 101 to 105. Howard Lutnick would have been there as well but was taking his son Kyle to his first day of kindergarten. Back at the site, Howard Lutnick survived the collapse of the South Tower by taking cover under a nearby car. He later created the Cantor Fitzgerald Relief Fund to assist families of victims of the attacks and natural disasters.	https://www.voanews.com/a/trump-plans-to-nominate-billionaire-wall-street-banker-for-commerce-secretary/7869674.html	2024-11-19T12:16:38-08:00	
California reports possible bird flu case in child	California's public health department reported a possible case of bird flu in a child with mild respiratory symptoms on Tuesday, but said there was no evidence of human-to-human transmission of the virus and that the child's family members tested negative. California officials said they have sent test specimens from the child to the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention for confirmation. A CDC spokesperson said the agency is aware of the presumptive positive case of H5 avian influenza, is collaborating with the state's investigation, and will provide further updates promptly. The agency has said the risk to the general public remains low. Although human infections in the United States have been rare, bird flu has infected 53 people since April, according to the CDC, most recently a person in Oregon last week tied to a bird flu outbreak in a commercial poultry operation in the state. In Canada, officials earlier this month reported that a teen infected with bird flu in British Columbia was in critical condition. The child in California was in daycare with mild symptoms before the illness was reported, the state said. Local health officials have contacted potentially exposed caregivers and families to check for symptoms and offer preventive treatment and testing if they become symptomatic. The child and all close family members have been treated with preventive medication, the state said. The child had no known contact with an infected animal, but public health experts are investigating possible exposure to wild birds. 'It’s natural for people to be concerned, and we want to reinforce for parents, caregivers and families that based on the information and data we have, we don’t think the child was infectious,' said California health department director Dr. Tomas Aragon, adding, 'and no human-to-human spread of bird flu has been documented in any country for more than 15 years.' Most U.S. bird flu cases, including 26 in California, have occurred among farm workers working with poultry or dairy cows that were infected with the virus. Because bird flu viruses can mutate and gain the ability to spread more easily between people, California public health officials said they are monitoring animal and human infections carefully. The state urged residents to avoid contact with sick or dead wild birds and renewed the warning against consuming raw milk or raw milk products, which have not undergone pasteurization to inactivate the bird flu virus and other harmful pathogens.	https://www.voanews.com/a/california-reports-possible-bird-flu-case-in-child/7869685.html	2024-11-19T11:54:40-08:00	
Prosecutors oppose dismissing Trump's hush money conviction	NEW YORK — New York prosecutors oppose any effort to dismiss President-elect Donald Trump's hush money conviction, but they expressed some openness Tuesday to delaying sentencing until after his impending second term. In a court filing Tuesday, the Manhattan district attorney's office said Trump's forthcoming presidency isn't grounds for dropping a case that was already tried. But 'given the need to balance competing constitutional interests,' prosecutors said, 'consideration must be given' to potentially freezing the case until after he's out of office. The former and future president was convicted in May of falsifying business records to cover up a scheme to influence the 2016 election by paying hush money to suppress a story of extramarital sex. Trump denies the allegations. His sentencing had been set for November 26. But after Trump's election win this month, his lawyers urged Judge Juan M. Merchan to throw out the case. They wrote that it must be scrapped 'to facilitate the orderly transition of executive power — and in the interests of justice.' Merchan gave prosecutors until Tuesday to weigh in on how to proceed. Manhattan prosecutors said Tuesday they 'are mindful of the demands and obligations of the presidency' and realize that Trump's return to the White House 'will raise unprecedented legal questions.' 'We also deeply respect the fundamental role of the jury in our constitutional system,' they said. No decision has been made, and Merchan has not said when he will rule. Still, Trump spokesperson and incoming White House communications director Steven Cheung cast Tuesday's filing from prosecutors as 'a total and definitive victory for President Trump' in a case that he has long deplored as a 'witch hunt.' 'President Trump's legal team is moving to get it dismissed once and for all,' Cheung said in a statement. A dismissal would erase Trump's historic conviction, sparing him the cloud of a criminal record as well as a possible prison sentence. Merchan could also decide to delay the case for some other length of time, wait until a federal appeals court rules on Trump's parallel effort to get the case moved out of state court or choose some other option. Trump was convicted on 34 counts of falsifying business records to conceal a $130,000 hush money payment to porn actor Stormy Daniels to suppress her claim that they had sex a decade earlier. The payment was made shortly before the 2016 election. Trump says they did not have sex and denies any wrongdoing.	https://www.voanews.com/a/prosecutors-oppose-dismissing-trump-s-hush-money-conviction/7869671.html	2024-11-19T11:53:52-08:00	
Anti-corruption protesters in Botswana demand action from new government	Gaborone, Botswana — Botswana’s new leader, President Duma Boko, has promised zero tolerance for graft in his administration. The pledge comes as scores of Botswana residents join in youth-led anti-corruption protests, urging the government to prosecute former officials accused of looting public coffers. Activist Setlhomo Tshwanelang mobilized the protests over alleged corruption within state enterprises. He said more demonstrations are on the way and the new government must prosecute anyone who stole public funds. Montshwari Mogopane, an investigator for Botswana’s Directorate on Corruption and Economic Crime, said his office has seen an increase in the number of reported cases of corruption. 'Of course, we have a problem of corruption in the country. This is reflected by the number of cases we receive under investigations,' Mogopane said. 'The reports show an increase in the number of cases that we are receiving. There is that need to actually sharpen our swords and fight corruption.' President Boko said there will be an audit of the state coffers to see if any corruption occurred. His government has reported the country is broke. Boko told new members of Cabinet on Monday that under his administration, there will be no room for graft. 'There will be no corruption, firstly because I expect that you will uphold the highest standard, and secondly, more clinically, we will put very robust institutions and practices that will ensure that there is no corruption because we have to do it, so that even as we police ourselves, we must always know there are institutions and structures that are exerting influence and providing oversight in ensuring that we all stay on the straight and narrow,' he said. Boko took office on November 1, after his party, the Umbrella for Democratic Change, defeated the Botswana Democratic Party, which had ruled the country since independence in 1966. Boko's predecessor, Mokgweetsi Masisi, maintains he has not been involved in any illegal activity and will avail himself for questioning in case of any investigation against his former administration.	https://www.voanews.com/a/anti-corruption-protesters-in-botswana-demand-action-from-new-government/7869660.html	2024-11-19T11:42:41-08:00	
Iran slams new EU, UK sanctions as unjustified	TEHRAN, IRAN — Iran's Foreign Ministry on Tuesday slammed as unjustified the new sanctions by the European Union and United Kingdom against Tehran over its support for Russia's war on Ukraine. 'While the president of Ukraine has admitted that no Iranian ballistic missiles have been exported to Russia, the measures of the European Union and United Kingdom in applying sanctions against Iran cannot be justified,' ministry spokesperson Esmaeil Baghaei said in a statement. Later Tuesday, the Foreign Ministry summoned the ambassador of Hungary, which holds the rotating EU presidency, to protest the new sanctions. The European Union on Monday widened sanctions against Iran over its alleged support for Russia's war on Ukraine, including targeting the national seafaring company, vessels and ports used to transfer drones and missiles. Acting in parallel, the U.K. also announced fresh sanctions against Iran on Monday, freezing the assets of the Islamic Republic of Iran Shipping Line. The sanctions also included the national airline, Iran Air, for transporting ballistic missiles and military supplies to Russia for use in Ukraine. Iran has repeatedly rejected Western accusations that it has transferred missiles or drones to Moscow for use against Kiev. Ahead of the sanctions announcement, Foreign Minister Abbas Araghchi said Sunday the EU was using the 'nonexistent missile pretext' to target its shipping lines. 'There is no legal, logical or moral basis for such behavior. If anything, it will only compel what it ostensibly seeks to prevent,' Araghchi wrote on X. 'Freedom of navigation is a basic principle of the law of the sea. When selectively applied by some, such shortsightedness usually tends to boomerang,' Araghchi wrote. Iran's economy is reeling from biting U.S. sanctions following the unilateral withdrawal of Washington in 2018 from a landmark nuclear deal between Iran and world powers. Baghaei said the new sanctions against Iran, which 'affect the interests and fundamental rights of Iranians, are clear examples of systematic violations of human rights.' 'The Islamic Republic of Iran will use all of the capacities of cooperation with its partners to ensure its interests and national security,' he said.	https://www.voanews.com/a/iran-slams-new-eu-uk-sanctions-as-unjustified/7869647.html	2024-11-19T11:37:52-08:00

Qataris say no to popular elections for legislature	Qataris have voted away the right to elect their own legislators, ending a short-lived experiment with participatory democracy in a region where authoritarian leadership is the norm. At the same time, voters have enshrined the role of international mediator in the constitution of the Persian Gulf nation, which has hosted peace talks involving parties ranging from the Taliban to Hamas to Israel. In a referendum held earlier this month, voters approved a package of constitutional amendments that revoked an earlier change providing for two-thirds of the seats in the nation’s legislature, the Shura Council, to be filled through popular elections. The Qatar News Agency said more than 90% of voters favored the change. In the future, all members of the council, which approves state policies and budgets but has no say over defense, economic or investment policy, will be appointed by the state’s ruler, or emir. The emir, Sheikh Tamim bin Hamad Al Thani, celebrated the outcome with a posting on X. 'Qataris today celebrated the fruits of what the first ones planted in terms of unity, solidarity, and love for the homeland, and the values of unity and justice, which we will protect and preserve,' he said. But Zubair Iqbal, a nonresident scholar at the Middle East Institute and a former official at the International Monetary Fund, called the outcome 'unfortunate and inherently destructive.' He said that by replacing elected representation with appointed roles, Qatar risks aligning more closely with its authoritarian Gulf Cooperation Council neighbors. Iqbal added that the change could force emerging democratic movements underground and potentially increase repression for Qataris and expatriates. The right of Qataris to elect representatives to the Shura Council was first approved in a 2003 constitutional amendment, but no actual elections were held until 2021, when they were recognized approvingly by the United States and the European Union. But the process was divisive due to a provision that restricted voting to individuals whose families had lived in Qatar since at least 1930. The provision disenfranchised members of a large and influential Bedouin tribe called Al Murrah, whose members had migrated to Qatar from Saudi Arabia since then. There were also objections that the election process caused discord within tribes and even families, disrupting national unity. 'We are all one family in Qatar,' Tamim told the Shura Council in mid-October. 'The contest between candidates for membership in the Shura Council took place within families and tribes, and there are different views regarding the repercussions of such competition on our norms, traditions, as well as the conventional social institutions and their cohesion. 'The contest assumes an identity-based character that we are not equipped to handle, with potential complications over time that we would rather avoid.' Supporters of the amendment say it has also made it possible for naturalized citizens to be appointed to ministerial roles, describing that as a step toward greater inclusivity in political representation. Irene Postigo Sanchez, the associate program officer at the Stockholm-based International Institute for Democracy and Electoral Assistance, told VOA that Qatar’s decision to end Shura Council elections prioritizes political stability over democratic reform. 'This move aligns with a broader Gulf trend of focusing on order and minimizing divisions, which leaders fear could be worsened by more radical reforms,' she said. 'Regionally, Qatar’s choice also reflects a desire to avoid the instability seen in Kuwait’s legislature, where the emir suspended parliament earlier this year due to recurring internal gridlock.' Sanchez was more positive about a second provision in the constitutional amendment that codified Qatar’s role as a neutral arbiter of international disputes. Qatar has a long-standing role in international diplomacy, having served as a venue for U.S.-Taliban negotiations that led to the withdrawal of Western forces from Afghanistan and more recently for efforts to negotiate a cease-fire between Israel and Hamas. The country has also engaged in negotiations and mediation efforts reaching well beyond the Middle East. It has played a pivotal part in securing the release of detained Americans in Iran and Venezuela, and recently helped arrange the return of some Ukrainian children from Russia. Sanchez said the constitutional change not only reaffirms Qatar’s foreign policy but places new emphasis on its commitment to resolving regional and international conflicts through mediation and dialogue. 'By formalizing this approach, Qatar aims to strengthen its diplomatic positioning,' she said.	https://www.voanews.com/a/qataris-say-no-to-popular-elections-for-legislature/7869430.html	2024-11-19T09:25:25-08:00	
Zambia, Zimbabwe seek move to wind, solar to avert power shortages	VICTORIA FALLS, ZIMBABWE — Zimbabwe and Zambia are holding a summit this week in Victoria Falls to identify ways to attract investors for energy projects and development. The talks come as the neighbors experience their worst recorded drought, which is drying up the Kariba Dam reservoir and causing hourslong power cuts. Speaking at the inaugural Zimbabwe-Zambia Energy Projects Summit, officials from both countries said depending so heavily on hydropower leaves them vulnerable to lengthy lapses in electricity. Recently, power outages reached 20 hours. They say they want to increase investment in wind and solar energy generation. Zimbabwean Vice President Constantino Chiwenga said Zimbabwe and Zambia are well-positioned to benefit from solar and wind power. 'In particular, the potential for solar energy is highly promising,' Chiwenga said. 'Both Zimbabwe and Zambia enjoy abundant sunlight throughout the year. This is the only asset on this Earth we do not pay for. So, let’s use it.' With investments, he said, building large-scale solar farms could generate power not only for local consumption but also to export to neighboring countries. 'These initiatives will not only enhance our national energy security but also position both nations as key players in the regional energy market,' he said. Zimbabwe and Zambia have started exploring floating solar projects on Lake Kariba. The hydroelectric dam there was built during the colonial era, but an El Nino-induced drought has left the dam with about 2% of its water, resulting in hourslong power cuts in both countries. Zambian Energy Minister Makozo Chikote said that Zambia hopes to buoy its push into renewable energy with money from increased copper production. He announced a target of 3 million metric tons of copper to be produced annually in Zambia by 2035. 'We are at a critical juncture in our countries: energy and mining sectors,' he said. 'The demand for electricity and resources continues to grow, and it is imperative that we adopt strategies to meet the challenges head on.' Chikote referenced the current drought, which has left the reservoir at a historic low, saying, 'Overdependence on hydro has exposed the vulnerability of the energy in ... Zambia.' The countries are looking to the West for potential investors. Jobst von Kirchmann, European Union ambassador to Zimbabwe, said that investors want predictability in legislation and the courts, but especially in monetary policy. 'Zimbabwe is now running a monetary policy which is a multicurrency policy, but then if someone goes out and says, ‘We should abandon the dollar; we should go back to mono-currency,’ that’s a killer for investment,' he said. Some elements in Zimbabwe’s ruling ZANU-PF party have been calling for the abandonment of the dollar, which the country has been using since 2009, together with other currencies. John Humphrey, British trade commissioner for Africa, echoed the call for stability. 'When we are in the renewable sector, it’s not just about five or 10 years,' he said. 'Actually, you are looking at a much longer period. So, in order to be able to make those sorts of investments, you really have to feel like you are operating in a predictable and stable environment. 'Money is like water,' Humphrey said. 'It goes where it is easy, and if you put something in its way, it just flows somewhere else.' The meeting ends Wednesday.	https://www.voanews.com/a/zambia-zimbabwe-seek-move-to-wind-solar-to-avert-power-shortages/7869255.html	2024-11-19T08:11:14-08:00	
China, Pakistan to hold first anti-terror drills in 5 years amid rising attacks	Islamabad — China said Tuesday it will send troops to Pakistan later this month for the countries first joint counterterrorism military exercise in five years to enhance security cooperation with its South Asian neighbor and close ally. The announcement follows reports that Beijing is pushing Islamabad to permit its security personnel to safeguard thousands of Chinese nationals working in Pakistan from deadly terrorist attacks. It also comes amid a spike in terrorist attacks against Pakistani security forces attributed to or claimed by the outlawed Tehrik-i-Taliban Pakistan, commonly known as TTP. On Tuesday, China’s Defense Ministry said that the Pakistan-hosted 'Warrior-VIII exercise is set to begin in late November and will run until mid-December 'with the aim … to enhance the capability for conducting joint counterterrorism operations,' according to Chinese state media. The ministry said the exercise will involve troops from the Western Theater Command of China’s People's Liberation Army. 'The two sides will engage in multi-level and mixed training across various specialties and organize live troop drills in accordance with the actual combat process,' according to the state media report. China and Pakistan last conducted joint counterterrorism military drills in 2019. String of attacks Last month, a suicide car bombing just outside the airport in the southern Pakistani port city of Karachi killed two Chinese engineers. The victims were returning to work after a holiday in Thailand on a project under the China-Pakistan Economic Corridor, a multibillion-dollar extension of President Xi Jinping’s global Belt and Road Initiative. In March, a suicide car bomb attack in northern Pakistan killed five Chinese workers and their local driver. The repeated targeting of its nationals reportedly angered China, prompting it to urge Pakistan to negotiate a joint security management system to ensure the safety of Chinese citizens in the country. The Pakistani government has dismissed the alleged Chinese diplomatic pressure, however, as 'media speculation' and an attempt 'to create confusion' regarding Islamabad’s relationship with Beijing. 'Pakistan and China have a robust dialogue and cooperation on a range of issues, including counterterrorism and security of Chinese nationals in Pakistan,' Foreign Ministry spokesperson Mumtaz Baloch told reporters last Thursday at her weekly news conference. 'We will continue to work with our Chinese brothers for the safety and security of Chinese nationals, projects, and institutions in Pakistan,' she stated. Shaking ties Baloch added that attempts to undermine the mutual trust and cooperation between the two countries will not succeed, nor will the two countries 'allow any efforts or stories to derail the Pakistan-China strategic partnership.' Speaking at a seminar in Islamabad just days after the Karachi car bomb attack, Chinese Ambassador Jiang Zaidong publicly questioned the host government’s safety measures to deter threats to Chinese nationals. 'It is unacceptable for us to be attacked twice in only six months,' Jiang stated. He urged Islamabad to take 'effective remedial measures to prevent the recurrence of such terror acts and ensure that perpetrators are identified, caught, and punished.' Pakistan dismissed the Chinese envoy’s remarks as 'perplexing' and contrary to established diplomatic traditions between the neighbors. The Pakistani response was unprecedented, and Jiang’s public admonishment of Islamabad highlighted the strains arising from attacks on Chinese nationals that have resulted in the loss of at least 21 lives over the past five years. 'Afghan terror sanctuaries' The joint drills between Pakistani and Chinese troops come amid a dramatic surge in deadly militant attacks on security forces and civilians in Pakistan, which authorities say are being orchestrated from 'TTP sanctuaries' in neighboring Afghanistan. The country’s Islamist Taliban leaders reject the allegations. Yue Xiaoyong, China’s special envoy for Afghan affairs, visited Islamabad this week, where Pakistani officials reportedly shared with him evidence regarding TTP’s presence in Afghanistan and the threat it poses to regional stability. Neither Islamabad nor Beijing has commented on the media reports. A brief post-meeting Pakistani statement said the discussion centered on the Afghan situation, with both sides reaffirming 'the vital role of neighboring countries for a peaceful and stable Afghanistan.'	https://www.voanews.com/a/china-pakistan-to-hold-first-anti-terror-drills-in-5-years-amid-rising-attacks/7869287.html	2024-11-19T07:58:34-08:00	
Slow progress on climate finance fuels anger as COP29 winds down	London — As the COP29 climate summit in Baku, Azerbaijan enters its final days, there are growing frustrations over the apparent lack of progress toward securing a deal on climate finance, which is seen as a crucial step in reducing emissions and limiting global warming. Mukhtar Babayev, Azerbaijan’s COP29 president, called on delegates to show more urgency. 'People have told me that they are concerned about the state of the negotiations,' Babayev told delegates Monday. 'It's time for them to move faster. This week we will welcome ministers from around the world as the negotiations reach their final stage. 'Politicians have the power to reach a fair and ambitious deal. They must deliver on this responsibility. They must engage immediately and constructively,' he said. Climate finance Money is at the center of the COP29 negotiations — or, in COP terms, climate finance. Who will pay for poorer countries to adapt to climate change and transition away from fossil fuels — and how much will it cost? It’s hoped that the COP29 meeting will set an ambitious new funding target. Most estimates put the cost of climate finance in excess of $1 trillion every year. It’s reported that many richer nations are reluctant to agree to such an amount. The current target of $100 billion annually, agreed in 2009, was met only in 2022. 'Failed promises' Bolivia’s representative at COP29, Diego Balanza — who chairs a negotiating bloc of developing nations — accused richer nations of a decade of failed promises. 'Our countries are suffering the impacts of climate change due largely to the historical emissions of developed countries. For us as developing countries, our people's lives, their very survival and their livelihoods, are at stake,' Balanza told delegates in Baku. He added that most of the climate finance so far has been provided through loans, not grants, which 'has adverse implications for the macroeconomic stability of developing countries.' Slow pace Many observers have criticized the slow pace of negotiations in Baku. Mohamed Adow, director of the campaign group Power Shift Africa, accused the Azerbaijani hosts of a lack of direction. 'This has been one of the worst COPs — at least, one of the worst first weeks of COPs — that I have attended in the last 15 years,' Adow told VOA. 'There has been very limited progress on climate finance and even on the rules around carbon markets and how the world is going to cut emissions.' 'Theatrics' Simon Stiell, the United Nations Climate Change executive secretary, on Monday called on parties to 'cut the theatrics.' 'There is still a ton of work to do to ensure COP29 delivers. Parties need to be moving much faster towards landing zones. … I've been very blunt: climate finance is not charity. It is 100% in every nation's interest to protect their economies and people from rampant climate impacts. Parties must wrap up less contentious issues early in the week, so there is enough time for the major political decisions,' Stiell said. Emissions cuts An ambitious COP29 deal on climate finance is meant to unlock the crucial next stage of negotiations. Ahead of next year’s COP30 in Brazil, all countries are due to deliver action plans on reducing greenhouse gas emissions, so-called ‘nationally determined contributions,’ with the goal of limiting global warming to 1.5°C above pre-industrial levels, a key target of the 2016 Paris Agreement on climate change. On the current trajectory, scientists estimate the world is heading for a likely catastrophic 2.7°C of warming by the end of the century, which is predicted to cause widespread extreme weather and sea level rise. Trump shadow Adow, the director of Power Shift Africa, fears the COP29 negotiations are being overshadowed by the recent U.S. presidential election win for Donald Trump. Trump pulled the United States out of the Paris Agreement on climate change during his first term. His successor, Joe Biden, re-entered the deal on his first day in office. 'I think the cloud hovering over these talks is the known unknown, around the election of Donald Trump and what the Trump administration is going to do. So, you have the rich world, that is actually hiding behind Trump — and not wanting to respond to the calls that we've had from the developing countries on the US$1.3 trillion that they require for climate finance,' Adow told VOA. The COP29 talks are due to close on Friday. The deadline could be extended if a deal is in sight.	https://www.voanews.com/a/slow-progress-on-climate-finance-fuels-anger-as-cop29-winds-down/7869040.html	2024-11-19T07:28:43-08:00

US defense chief says alliance with Philippines will transcend administrations	MANILA, Philippines — U.S. Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin on Tuesday condemned China's dangerous actions against the Philippines and renewed a warning that the United States would defend its treaty ally if Filipino forces come under an armed attack in the increasingly volatile waters. During a visit to the Philippine province of Palawan next to the disputed South China Sea, Austin was asked if the strong U.S. military support to the Philippines would continue under incoming President Donald Trump, including $500 million in new military funding. Austin expressed the belief that the strong alliance 'will transcend' changes of administration. 'We stand with the Philippines, and we condemn dangerous actions by the PRC against lawful Philippine operations in the South China Sea,' he said, using the acronym of China's official name. He added: 'The behavior of PRC has been concerning. They've used dangerous and escalatory measures to enforce their expansive South China Sea maritime claims.' China has also had recent territorial spats with smaller coastal states, including Vietnam, Malaysia and Indonesia, over the key global trade and security route. Brunei and Taiwan are also involved in long-unresolved disputes. The outgoing Biden administration has taken steps to strengthen an arc of military alliances across the Indo-Pacific region to better counter China, including in any future confrontation over Taiwan or in the South China Sea, which Beijing has claimed almost in its entirety. That has dovetailed with Philippine President Ferdinand Marcos Jr.'s thrust to strengthen his country's external defenses, given an alarming escalation of territorial confrontations between Chinese and Filipinos forces in the South China Sea. There has been intense speculation over how Trump would steer U.S. military engagements in Asia. Marcos told reporters Tuesday that he congratulated Trump on his presidential election victory in a telephone call and renewed Philippine commitment to continue strengthening its alliance with the U.S. 'I expressed to him our continuing desire to strengthen that relationship between our two countries, which is a relationship that is as deep as can possibly be because it has been for a very long time,' Marcos said. Austin was speaking during a joint news conference with his Philippine counterpart, Gilberto Teodoro, in the military headquarters in Palawan. They were given a demonstration of an unmanned vessel the U.S. has funded for use by the Philippine Navy for intelligence-gathering and defense surveillance. Austin 'reaffirmed the ironclad U.S. commitment to the Philippines' and reiterated that the allies' Mutual Defense Treaty covers both countries' armed forces, public vessels and aircraft…'anywhere in the South China Sea.' He also reaffirmed his department's 'commitment to bolstering the Philippines' defense capabilities and capacity to resist coercion,' according to a joint statement. Austin and Teodoro signed an agreement on Monday to secure from possible leakages the exchange of highly confidential military intelligence and technology in key weapons the U.S. would provide to Manila. The Department of National Defense in Manila said the agreement aims to ensure the security of classified military information exchanges and would 'allow the Philippines access to higher capabilities and big-ticket items from the United States.' Neither side provided more details or released a copy of the agreement. Two Philippine security officials, however, have told The Associated Press that such an agreement, similar to those Washington has signed with other allied countries, would allow the U.S. to provide the Philippines with higher-level intelligence and more sophisticated weapons, including missile systems. It would also provide the Philippine military access to U.S. satellite and drone surveillance systems with an assurance that such intelligence and details about sophisticated weapons would be kept secure to prevent leaks, the two officials said on condition of anonymity as they were not authorized to discuss the sensitive issue publicly. China's Foreign Ministry spokesperson Lin Jian said in Beijing on Monday that no military agreement 'should target any third party … nor should it undermine regional peace or exacerbate regional tensions.'	https://www.voanews.com/a/us-defense-chief-says-alliance-with-philippines-will-transcend-administrations/7869164.html	2024-11-19T06:29:00-08:00	
Students hurt in China primary school crash as nerves fray over recent attacks	BEIJING — A driver in an SUV plowed into students and pedestrians outside a primary school in southern China on Tuesday, leaving several people injured, state media said, as worries spread over a spate of violent attacks in the country over the past week. CCTV and other state media reported the SUV hit people outside a primary school in Changde city in Hunan province as students were coming in for the day. Many were injured, CCTV reported and police said they were sent to the hospital 'as soon as possible,' with none having sustained life-threatening injuries. Police did not provide a detailed number of those hurt. The police also said a 39-year-old male was arrested in connection with the incident, although it did not explain in the brief statement how the incident occurred, saying only that investigations were continuing. Reuters was unable to connect by phone to emergency services for Changde to seek comment. The incident happened just over a week after a driver rammed his vehicle into a crowd at a sports center in Zhuhai in southern China, killing 35 people and severely injuring 43 in the deadliest mass attack in China in a decade. Short video clips circulating on Chinese social media on Tuesday showed young children running into the Changde school compound, shouting, 'Help.' One clip shows a compact, white SUV stopped beyond the school entrance. At least five people, including a student with a backpack, were lying on the path taken by the vehicle on the narrow street in front of the school, the videos show. Someone can be heard shouting, 'Call the police' as a man is surrounded by a crowd and apparently beaten with sticks and rods. A separate clip shows a man handcuffed and being held down on wet cement by a figure in uniform. A woman's voice says the person drove to the school by himself and crashed there. Reuters was able to verify the location where the videos were shot matched the reported location for the crash at a primary school for children between about 6 and 12 years old. 'Why are such incidents happening more and more frequently lately, hit-and-runs, and always involving students? What has happened to society now?,' said one commentator on social media platform Weibo. China's top prosecutors met on Tuesday to discuss sentencing for 'major vicious and extreme crimes,' as well as those that endanger public security, a statement from the Supreme People's Procuratorate said on its official Weibo social media account. 'The hand of 'strictness' can never be loosened,' said Ying Yong, procurator-general, in the post, which was among the top five trending topics on the social media platform. 'We must be resolute and determined and punish crimes severely and quickly in accordance with the law to provide a strong deterrent.' 'Revenge against society' Police blamed last week's Zhuhai deaths on a male driver angry at his divorce settlement. Days later, a former student went on a stabbing rampage at a vocational college in eastern China's Wuxi, killing eight people. In both the Zhuhai and Wuxi cases, little information has been released by police, although from brief statements made public, it appears the two men lashed out with fatal violence against unrelated bystanders after suffering an economic loss. The lack of detailed disclosures by authorities has stirred discussion on Chinese social media, much of it quickly censored, about a rise in economic and societal pressure in the country and the mental health resources available to deal with it. Including the Wuxi attack, there have been at least seven high-profile knife attacks this year across China. China's official crime statistics show rates of violent crime much lower than the global average. But Qu Weiguo, a Fudan University professor, said the recent cases of 'indiscriminate revenge against society' in China had some common features: disadvantaged suspects, many with mental health issues, who believed that they had been treated unfairly and who felt they had no other way to be heard. 'It is important to establish a social safety net and a psychological counseling mechanism, but in order to minimize such cases, the most effective way is to open public channels that can monitor and expose the use of power,' Qu posted on the Chinese social media platform Weibo. The short essay was removed by censors on Sunday afternoon. Trending online discussion topics over the past year have put a focus on diminished optimism in China for a turnaround in jobs, income and opportunity. One of those - 'the garbage time of history' - took off in the summer as a shorthand for economic despair. In recent weeks, Chinese officials have rolled out a raft of stimulus measures to revive the economy. Last week's car attack also prompted an intervention by President Xi Jinping, who urged local police to 'strengthen their control of risks' by identifying people at risk of lashing out.	https://www.voanews.com/a/students-hurt-in-china-primary-school-crash-as-nerves-fray-over-recent-attacks-/7868996.html	2024-11-19T04:04:00-08:00	
Lebanon reviewing Hezbollah-Israel cease-fire agreement	A U.S. diplomat arrived Tuesday in Beirut to meet with Lebanese officials about a possible cease-fire agreement – reportedly approved by Hezbollah – that would end fighting between Israel and the Iran-backed group. Amos Hochstein was meeting with Lebanon’s Parliament Speaker Nabih Berri, a Hezbollah ally who is mediating for the militants. Both the Lebanese government and Hezbollah have agreed to a proposal that was submitted last week and made some comments on the content, Ali Hassan Khalil, an aide to Berri, told Reuters on Monday. But Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said Israel would continue to conduct military operations against Hezbollah even if a cease-fire is reached. 'The most important thing is not [the deal that] will be laid on paper,' Netanyahu told parliament. 'We will be forced to ensure our security in the north [of Israel] and to systematically carry out operations against Hezbollah's attacks... even after a cease-fire,' to keep the group from rebuilding, he said. Netanyahu also said there was no evidence Hezbollah would respect a cease-fire. The draft agreement would remove Israeli ground forces from Lebanon and push Hezbollah forces away from the Israeli border. More Lebanese troops and U.N. peacekeepers would be sent to the buffer zone in southern Lebanon as part of the deal, the Associated Press reported. Hochstein’s arrival came hours after an Israeli strike in central Beirut killed five people and wounded 31 others, according to the health ministry. It was the third Israeli strike in the heart of Beirut in two days. On Monday, Israel's military said Hezbollah fired around 100 projectiles into northern Israel, with some intercepted by air defenses. On Tuesday, Hezbollah said it fired rockets at the northern Israeli town of Kiryat Shmona. Hezbollah began its campaign after its ally Hamas attacked Israel on October 7, 2023. About 1,200 Israelis were killed, and 250 were taken hostage. About 100 of the hostages have yet to be released, although a third of them are believed to be dead. Following the attack, Israel began a campaign to eliminate Hamas in Gaza, leading to the deaths of about 44,000 people, according to the Hamas-led Gaza health ministry. Since the fighting with Hezbollah began, more than 3,500 people in Lebanon have been killed, according to authorities. Most of the fatalities have occurred since late September. But Hamas and Hezbollah have been designated as terrorist organizations by the United States. Houthi attacks Another Hamas ally, the Houthi group in Yemen, began attacking shipping in the Red Sea corridor a year ago. On November 19, 2023, the ship Galaxy Leader, a car carrier, was seized in a Houthi helicopter attack. The ship and its crew of 25 are still being held by the rebels. The Houthis went on to launch attacks against more than 90 commercial vessels in the Red Sea over the past year, sinking two vessels and killing four sailors. Some material in this report came from The Associated Press, Reuters and Agence France-Presse.	https://www.voanews.com/a/lebanon-reviewing-hezbollah-israel-cease-fire-agreement-/7868978.html	2024-11-19T03:37:36-08:00	
Russia broadens conditions for using nuclear weapons	As the war in Ukraine entered its 1,000th day Tuesday, Russian President Vladimir Putin signed a revised nuclear doctrine stating that a conventional attack on Russia by any nation supported by a nuclear power is considered a joint attack and could trigger a nuclear response. The proclamation came a day after U.S. President Joe Biden authorized Ukraine to use long-range weapons from the U.S. to attack military targets in Russia. When Russian government spokesman Dmitry Peskov was asked if the revised doctrine was issued in response to the U.S. authorization, he said it was put forth 'in a timely manner' and that Putin wanted it updated to be 'in line with the current situation,' the Associated Press reported. The doctrine states nuclear weapons could be used in case of a massive air attack involving ballistic and cruise missiles, aircraft, drones and other flying vehicles. It says an attack against Russia by a nonnuclear power with the 'participation or support of a nuclear power' will be seen as their 'joint attack on the Russian Federation.' It doesn’t specify whether such an attack would definitely be met with a nuclear response. Peskov the aim of the updated policy was to make potential enemies understand the inevitability of retaliation for an attack on Russia or its allies. It also states that Russia could use nuclear weapons if another country attacks ally Belarus. 1,000 days of fighting Both Russia and Ukraine issued statements about the 1,000th day of the war, both vowing that they would continue fighting against each other. The Kremlin said Western support for Kyiv would have no impact on the military campaign. 'The military operation against Kyiv continues,' Peskov said, adding that Western aid 'cannot affect the outcome of our operation. It continues, and will be completed.' Ukraine, meanwhile, said it would continue to resist the Russian invasion. 'Ukraine will never submit to the occupiers, and the Russian military will be punished for violating international law,' the foreign ministry said in a statement. Attack on Russian weapons depot There was no word if long-range U.S. weapons were used in Ukraine’s strike against a large weapons depot near the Russian town of Karachev in the Bryansk region more than 110 miles from the border with Ukraine. Reuters reported that Ukraine often uses domestically produced drones to hit targets deep inside Russia, and in an announcement on Tuesday, the military did not specify which weapons had been used for the strike. 'The destruction of ammunition depots will continue for the army of the Russian occupiers in order to stop the armed aggression of the Russian Federation against Ukraine,' the Ukrainian military said on the Telegram messaging app. An overnight Russian drone attack in the northeastern Sumy region killed eight people, including one child, Ukrainian officials said on Tuesday. The attack on a residential building in the border town of Hlukhiv also wounded 12 people, including two children, Ukraine's national police force said on Telegram. Two high-rise buildings and a hospital were damaged, and more people could be in the rubble. Ukraine's air force said on Tuesday it shot down 51 out of 87 drones launched by Russia overnight. Tear gas detected near front line Also on Tuesday, Ukraine urged action after the international chemical weapons watchdog said banned CS riot control gas, also known as tear gas, had been found in Ukrainian soil samples from the Dnipropetrovsk region. Russia has not reacted to the report by the Organization for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons (OPCW), which did not assign blame for the chemical. The Chemical Weapons Convention strictly bans the use of riot control agents including CS outside riot control situations when it is used as 'a method of warfare,' Agence France-Presse reported. CS gas causes irritation to the lungs, skin and eyes. Both sides have accused each other of using chemical weapons in the conflict, and Ukraine’s Western allies have claimed Moscow has employed banned weapons. 'Russia's use of banned chemicals on the battlefield once again demonstrates Russia's chronic disregard for international law,' a statement from Ukraine’s foreign ministry said. OPCW stressed however that the report did 'not seek to identify the source or origin of the toxic chemical.' Some material in this report came from The Associated Press, Reuters and Agence France-Presse.	https://www.voanews.com/a/russia-broadens-conditions-for-using-nuclear-weapons-/7868964.html	2024-11-19T03:22:36-08:00	
Lithuania steps up surveillance at sea following damage to undersea cable	VILNIUS, Lithuania — Lithuania's Navy said on Tuesday it had increased monitoring of its waters after an undersea communications cable connecting the country with Sweden had been damaged. An assessment is now being carried out along with allies, a spokesperson for the Lithuanian armed forces told Reuters. The cable was one of two fiber-optic cables in the Baltic Sea which were severed in recent days, raising suspicions of sabotage by bad actors, countries and companies involved said on Monday. A spokesperson for Arelion, the owner and operator of the communications cable, told Reuters on Tuesday that the link between Lithuania and Sweden was 'fully out' but that the reason remained unclear.	https://www.voanews.com/a/lithuania-steps-up-surveillance-at-sea-following-damage-to-undersea-cable/7868963.html	2024-11-19T03:00:32-08:00	
Opposition leader wins Somaliland presidential contest	The Somaliland electoral commission announced Tuesday that opposition leader Abdirahman Mohamed Abdullahi 'Irro' defeated incumbent Muse Bihi Abdi for the presidency of the breakaway region located on the Horn of Africa. Independent observers described the election as peaceful. Irro, candidate for the Waddani (National) party captured 63.92% of the vote, compared with Bihi’s 34.81%. A third candidate, Faysal Ali Warabe, received 0.74% of the votes. The election was originally scheduled to take place in 2022 but was delayed due to political differences. Bihi, who defeated Irro in the last election in 2017, promised during the campaign that he would respect the results of the election. Irro ran on a platform of change, promising to create a brighter future for the people of Somaliland, including more work and job opportunities for women. Somaliland in 1991 declared its independence from Somalia, which views it as a northern breakaway region, not a separate nation. Its location near Djibouti puts it close to the only permanent U.S. military base in Africa and the first overseas base for China. Both Bihi and Irro said they hope the incoming administration of U.S. President-elect Donald Trump will review policy toward Somaliland. The U.S. and Somaliland do not have diplomatic relations. The U.S. recognizes the sovereignty and territorial integrity of Somalia within its 1960 borders. Irro recently posted messages of congratulations to Trump after his victory. 'We Somalilanders are thrilled with your bold policies towards Somaliland and look forward to strengthening the #Somaliland-US Partnership, as the President Aspirant, I look forward to promoting and contributing to a more stable, peaceful, and prosperous East Africa and the Red Sea,' Irro said. The International Election Observation Mission (IEOM) to Somaliland’s presidential elections said the elections took place in a 'mostly calm and peaceful environment where registered voters were able to exercise their right to vote during the day.' IEOM said it did not observe any serious irregularities or electoral malpractice, although observers noticed procedural and administrative inconsistencies that could be addressed by better training. The mission said it 'identified a number of issues that electoral authorities could address including making sure that the secrecy of the vote is upheld in future elections and that the voter register is updated more regularly and closer to the holding of elections to ensure it is up-to-date.' 'In addition, voters need to be better informed about voting procedures,' the mission added in an assessment of the election. Who is the new president? Abdirahman Irro, as he is commonly referred to, was born on April 29, 1955, in Hargeisa, Somalia. After completing his secondary school education at Sheikh high school near Burao town, he moved to Mogadishu for higher education. He has a diploma from the Somali Institute of Development Administration and Management, and SIDAM/California State University and he earned an MBA from SIDAM/New York State University, according to the Waddani party’s website. He speaks Somali, English, Arabic, Russian and Finnish, the party said. In 1981 he was employed by Somalia’s Ministry of Foreign Affairs as a diplomat. During his time there, he worked at the Somali embassy in Moscow, before moving to Finland to live with his family. He started leading Somaliland community organizations in Finland before he returned to Somaliland in 1999 to join politics. He was elected to the Somaliland Parliament in 2005, and became the speaker for the first democratically elected Parliament, a position he held for 12 years. In 2012, he co-founded the Waddani political party and was chosen as its first chairman as well as the presidential candidate for the 2017 election. Following parliamentary elections in 2021, Waddani become the majority party in parliament. According to human rights lawyer and analyst Guleid Ahmed Jama, the election shows the strength of Somaliland’s democracy. 'After two years of political controversy and election delays that resulted in political violence, the successful completion of the electoral process is good news,' he said. 'However, it does not solve the many problems Somaliland is facing. There are big tasks ahead of the president-elect. I believe a government of national unity can salvage Somaliland and unite the divided and polarized people. The president-elect should not treat this as a win-lose scenario. He should come up with a plan to unite the people.'	https://www.voanews.com/a/opposition-leader-wins-somaliland-presidential-contest/7868957.html	2024-11-19T02:43:07-08:00	
Mass rally opposes proposed New Zealand treaty reform	SYDNEY — A nine-day march to protest race relations laws in New Zealand ended Tuesday with a rally of more than 40,000 perople in the capital, Wellington. Introduced last week by New Zealand's center-right government, the Treaty Principles Bill, would enshrine a narrower legal interpretation of the 1840 Treaty of Waitangi. The right-leaning government says a bill - or a proposed law reform - would allow political and constitutional questions raised by the Treaty of Waitangi to be decided by lawmakers instead of the courts. However, some insist the measure would damage the rights of Indigenous Maori. Emmy Rakete is a lecturer at the University of Auckland’s School of Human Sciences. She told Radio New Zealand’s Morning Report program that there is great anger at the proposals. 'This is, kind of, the live wire underneath this country - the fundamental contradiction between dispossessor and dispossessed and colonizer and colonized, which has, kind of, been ignited again,' she said. 'People are here in huge numbers. It is really beautiful to see, actually.' The Treaty of Waitangi was signed by the British monarchy and more than 500 Maori chiefs, and it laid down how the two parties agreed to govern New Zealand. The controversy over the Treaty Principles Bill is how the document is interpreted. David Seymour, the leader of the libertarian ACT Party, a junior partner in the governing coalition, introduced the reform to Parliament last week. He believes the treaty discriminates against non-Indigenous citizens. Seymour told lawmakers its guiding principles need to be clarified. 'There was one big problem,' he said. 'Nowhere in the Treaty of Waitangi Act and at no time since, has this Parliament said what those principles actually are. The democratically-elected body of this Parliament has been silent.' New Zealand’s Prime Minister Christopher Luxon has described the bill as 'divisive' - despite being part of the governing coalition alongside David Seymour’s minor political party. New Zealand is a Pacific nation of just over 5 million people. Indigenous Maori make up about 20% of the population, but suffer high rates of imprisonment and ill-health.	https://www.voanews.com/a/mass-rally-opposes-proposed-new-zealand-treaty-reform-/7868937.html	2024-11-19T01:28:36-08:00	
Hong Kong imprisons pro-democracy activists in landmark national security case	Taipei, Taiwan — Hong Kong’s High Court on Tuesday sentenced 45 pro-democracy activists to up to 10 years in jail under subversion charges, marking an end to the largest national security case in Hong Kong under a sweeping law imposed by Beijing. The defendants were accused of conspiracy to commit subversion for taking part in an unofficial primary election aimed at selecting opposition candidates to run in the 2020 legislative council election. Authorities said the activists were planning to paralyze the Hong Kong government and force the city’s leader to resign by aiming to win a legislative majority and use that to block government budgets. The 45 defendants were given prison sentences between four years and two months, and 10 years. Legal scholar Benny Tai, viewed as the mastermind of the primary election by the government, received the longest sentence. In addition to Tai, other prominent activists involved in the case were also given lengthy prison sentences. Journalist-turned-activist Gwyneth Ho was sentenced to seven years in prison, and prominent Hong Kong activist Joshua Wong was sentenced to four years and eight months in prison. Analysts say Tuesday’s sentencing reflects the rapid disappearance of basic rights and freedom in Hong Kong since the imposition of the national security law in 2020. 'Today’s harsh sentences against dozens of prominent democracy activists reflect just how fast Hong Kong’s civil liberties and judicial independence have nosedived in the past four years since the Chinese government imposed the draconian National Security Law on the city,' said Maya Wang, associate China director at Human Rights Watch. Some former pro-democracy politicians in Hong Kong said the case has already closed off space for substantive political discussion and public participation before Tuesday’s sentencing. 'Since their arrest in 2021, there are no more protests and there is no more public discussion about anything in Hong Kong,' Debby Chan, a former pro-democracy district councilor, told VOA by phone. Experts say the case will further restrain Hong Kong’s civil society, as it shows there is no longer room for meaningful political participation in the city. 'The outcome would set a precedence for future attempts to organize political activities in Hong Kong and it also shows that authorities can arrest and try large numbers of participants at the same time,' Patrick Poon, a visiting researcher at the University of Tokyo, told VOA by phone. A more Chinese-style judicial system Foreign governments have criticized the trial as politically motivated and urged Hong Kong authorities to release the activists as they were penalized for taking part in a peaceful political activity. However, Chinese and Hong Kong authorities have repeatedly characterized the national security law as a means to restore order following large-scale pro-democracy protests in 2019. They also said the activists were treated according to local law. Poon said several defendants in the case were repeatedly denied bail and endured years of pre-trial detention before court proceedings of the case finally began, actions that show Hong Kong authorities are adopting judicial practices that are often used in China. 'The lengthy pre-trial detention and denial of bail application are all common practices in China’s judicial system, so I think this case shows that Hong Kong is becoming more similar to China in that regard,' he told VOA. According to data collected by the Georgetown Center for Asian Law, 173 individuals have been arrested under national security-related charges and 94 individuals have been charged with national security-related crimes since the law was implemented in July 2020. Some defendants are reportedly suffering from chronic health issues and others were not allowed to visit sick relatives. 'One defendant tried to apply for parole to visit his sick parents multiple times but the correctional services department rejected his applications. In the end, both of his parents passed away,' Sunny Cheung, an associate fellow for China studies at the Jamestown Foundation and participant in the 2020 primary, told VOA by phone. Despite the hardship over the last few years, Chan said Tuesday’s sentencing marks the end of a stage. 'The sentences mean we now have a date to look forward to and we finally know when all of this suffering will end,' she told VOA. Poon said since Hong Kong has incorporated some Chinese practices into its judicial system, it’s important to see whether Hong Kong authorities would deprive the detainees or their family members of basic rights in the future. 'One thing I don’t want to see is the authorities blocking relatives from visiting the defendants, but since Hong Kong’s judicial system has become very similar to the Chinese system, it’s really hard to say whether this would happen in Hong Kong or not,' he said. As family and friends await the activists’ release, years from now, Chan said she will try to position herself in a Hong Kong society where pro-democracy organizations no longer exist. 'The pro-democracy people are still there, but there are no organizations to gather these people,' she told VOA.	https://www.voanews.com/a/hong-kong-imprisons-pro-democracy-activists-in-landmark-national-security-case-/7868919.html	2024-11-18T23:46:58-08:00

Numerous children injured by a vehicle at a school gate in central China	Taipei, Taiwan — Numerous children were injured by a vehicle at the gate of an elementary school in central China's Hunan province on Tuesday morning, reports said. Students were arriving for classes around 8 a.m. at Yong'an Elementary School in the city of Changde when the incident occurred. Few details were immediately available, and it wasn't clear whether the vehicle had lost control or whether it was a deliberate attack. The official Xinhua News Agency said several adults were also injured and identified the vehicle as a small white SUV. It said the driver was subdued by parents and security guards, and some of the injured were sent to the hospital immediately, with the total casualty count still unknown. Footage posted on Chinese social media showed the injured lying on the road while terrified students ran past the gate and inside the schoolhouse. Comments on Chinese internet sites reflected anger and frustration with recurring incidents of violence against citizens by those venting anger at society. 'No matter what the reason is, innocent children should not be harmed,' said one comment on the popular Weibo social media site. 'Timely resolve conflicts, prevent such incidents and severely punish the perpetrators,' said another. While China has much lower rates of violence than many countries — personal gun ownership there is illegal — knifings and the use of homemade explosives still occur. Chinese schools have been subject to numerous attacks by people armed with knives or using vehicles as weapons. A stabbing attack at a vocational school in the eastern Chinese city of Wuxi on Saturday left eight people dead and 17 others injured. That came shortly after a man drove his car into people at a sports facility in the southern city of Zhuhai, leaving 35 people dead and 43 others injured. In September, three people were killed in a knife attack in a Shanghai supermarket, and 15 others were injured. Police said at the time that the suspect had personal financial disputes and came to Shanghai to 'vent his anger.' The same month, a Japanese schoolboy died after being stabbed on his way to school in the southern city of Shenzhen. The Chinese government generally censors internet content it deems overly sensitive or political, and some images of the school incident were quickly taken down. Most Western social media sites and search engines like Google are blocked in China, limiting available content even while some people use tools like VPNs and send news through Chinese social media before the censors have time to catch it.	https://www.voanews.com/a/numerous-children-injured-by-a-vehicle-at-a-school-gate-in-central-china/7868874.html	2024-11-18T21:29:16-08:00	
Arthur Frommer, travel guide innovator, has died at 95	NEW YORK — Arthur Frommer, whose 'Europe on 5 Dollars a Day' guidebooks revolutionized leisure travel by convincing average Americans to take budget vacations abroad, has died. He was 95. Frommer died from complications of pneumonia, his daughter Pauline Frommer said Monday. 'My father opened up the world to so many people,' she said. 'He believed deeply that travel could be an enlightening activity and one that did not require a big budget.' Frommer began writing about travel while serving in the U.S. Army in Europe in the 1950s. When a guidebook he wrote for American soldiers overseas sold out, he launched what became one of the travel industry's best-known brands, self-publishing 'Europe on 5 Dollars a Day' in 1957. 'It struck a chord and became an immediate best-seller,' he recalled in an interview with The Associated Press in 2007, on the 50th anniversary of the book's debut. The Frommer's brand, led today by his daughter Pauline, remains one of the best-known names in the travel industry, with guidebooks to destinations around the world, an influential social media presence, podcasts and a radio show. Frommer's philosophy — stay in inns and budget hotels instead of five-star hotels, sightsee on your own using public transportation, eat with locals in small cafes instead of fancy restaurants — changed the way Americans traveled in the mid- to late 20th century. He said budget travel was preferable to luxury travel 'because it leads to a more authentic experience.' That message encouraged average people, not just the wealthy, to vacation abroad. It didn't hurt that his books hit the market as the rise of jet travel made getting to Europe easier than crossing the Atlantic by ship. The books became so popular that there was a time when you couldn't visit a place like the Eiffel Tower without spotting Frommer's guidebooks in the hands of every other American tourist. Frommer's advice also became so standard that it's hard to remember how radical it seemed in the days before discount flights and backpacks. 'It was really pioneering stuff,' Tony Wheeler, founder of the Lonely Planet guidebook company, said in an interview in 2013. Before Frommer, Wheeler said, you could find guidebooks 'that would tell you everything about the church or the temple ruin. But the idea that you wanted to eat somewhere and find a hotel or get from A to B -- well, I've got a huge amount of respect for Arthur.' 'Arthur did for travel what Consumer Reports did for everything else,' said Pat Carrier, former owner of The Globe Corner, a travel bookstore in Cambridge, Massachusetts. The final editions of Frommer's groundbreaking series were titled 'Europe from $95 a Day.' The concept no longer made sense when hotels could not be had for less than $100 a night, so the series was discontinued in 2007. But the Frommer publishing empire did not disappear, despite a series of sales that started when Frommer sold the guidebook company to Simon & Schuster. It was later acquired by Wiley Publishing, which in turn sold it to Google in 2012. Google quietly shut the guidebooks down, but Arthur Frommer — in a David vs. Goliath triumph — got his brand back from Google. In November 2013 with his daughter Pauline, he relaunched the print series with dozens of new guidebook titles. 'I never dreamed at my age I'd be working this hard,' he told the AP at the time, age 84. Frommer also remained a well-known figure in 21st century travel, opinionated to the end of his career, speaking out on his blog and radio show. He hated mega-cruise ships and railed against travel websites where consumers put up their own reviews, saying they were too easily manipulated with phony postings. And he coined the phrase 'Trump Slump' in a widely quoted column that predicted a slump in tourism to the U.S. after Donald Trump was elected president. Frommer was born in Lynchburg, Virginia, and grew up during the Great Depression in Jefferson City, Missouri, the child of a Polish father and Austrian mother. 'My father had one job after another, one company after another that went bankrupt,' he recalled. The family moved to New York when he was a teenager. He worked as an office boy at Newsweek, went to New York University and was drafted upon graduating from Yale Law School in 1953. Because he spoke French and Russian, he was sent to work in Army intelligence at a U.S. base in Germany, where the Cold War was heating up. His first glimpse of Europe was from the window of a military transport plane. Whenever he had a weekend leave or a three-day pass, he'd hop a train to Paris or hitch a ride to England on an Air Force flight. Eventually he wrote 'The GI's Guide to Traveling in Europe,' and a few weeks before his Army stint was up, he had 5,000 copies printed by a typesetter in a German village. They were priced at 50 cents apiece, distributed by the Army newspaper, Stars & Stripes. Shortly after he returned to New York to practice law at the firm Paul, Weiss, Rifkind, Wharton & Garrison, he received a cable from Europe. 'The book was sold out, would I arrange a reprint?' he said. Soon after he spent his month's vacation from the law firm doing a civilian version of the guide. 'In 30 days I went to 15 different cities, getting up at 4 a.m., running up and down the streets, trying to find good cheap hotels and restaurants,' he recalled. The resulting book, the very first 'Europe on 5 Dollars a Day,' was much more than a list. It was written with a wide-eyed wonder that verged on poetry: 'Venice is a fantastic dream,' Frommer wrote. 'Try to arrive at night when the wonders of the city can steal upon you piecemeal and slow. ... Out of the dark, there appear little clusters of candy-striped mooring poles; a gondola approaches with a lighted lantern hung from its prow.' Eventually Frommer gave up law to write the guides full-time. Daughter Pauline joined him with his first wife, Hope Arthur, on their trips starting in 1965, when she was 4 months old. 'They used to joke that the book should be called 'Europe on Five Diapers a Day,'' Pauline Frommer said. In the 1960s, when inflation forced Frommer to change the title of the book to 'Europe on 5 and 10 Dollars a Day,' he said 'it was as if someone had plunged a knife into my head.' Asked to summarize the impact of his books in a 2017 Associated Press interview, he said that in the 1950s, 'most Americans had been taught that foreign travel was a once-in-a-lifetime experience, especially travel to Europe. They were taught that they were going to a war-torn country where it was risky to stay in any hotel other than a five-star hotel. It was risky to go into anything but a top-notch restaurant. … And I knew that all these warnings were a lot of nonsense.' He added: 'We were pioneers in also suggesting that a different type of American should travel, that you didn't have to be well-heeled.' To the end of his life, he said he avoided traveling first class. 'I fly economy class and I try to experience the same form of travel, the same experience that the average American and the average citizen of the world encounters,' he said. As Frommer aged, his daughter Pauline gradually became the force behind the company, promoting the brand, managing the business and even writing some of the content based on her own travels. Her relationship with her father was both tender and respectful, and she summed it up this way in a 2012 email to AP: 'It's wonderful to have a working partner whose mind is a steel trap, and who doesn't just have smarts, but wisdom. His opinions, whether or not you agree with them, come from his social values. He's a man who puts ethics at the center of his life, and weaves them into everything he does.' In addition to Pauline, Frommer's survivors include his second wife, Roberta Brodfeld, and four grandchildren.	https://www.voanews.com/a/arthur-frommer-travel-guide-innovator-has-died-at-95/7868870.html	2024-11-18T21:17:22-08:00	
Urban mosquito sparks malaria surge in East Africa	NAIROBI, KENYA — The spread of a mosquito in East Africa that thrives in urban areas and is immune to insecticide is fueling a surge in malaria that could reverse decades of progress against the disease, experts say. Africa accounted for about 95% of the 249 million malaria cases and 608,000 deaths worldwide in 2022, according to the most recent data from the World Health Organization (WHO), which said children under 5 accounted for 80% of deaths in the region. But the emergence of an invasive species of mosquito on the continent could massively increase those numbers. Anopheles stephensi is native to parts of South Asia and the Middle East but was spotted for the first time in the tiny Horn of Africa state of Djibouti in 2012. Djibouti had all but eradicated malaria only to see it make a slow but steady return over the following years, hitting more than 70,000 cases in 2020. Then stephensi arrived in neighboring Ethiopia and WHO says it is key to an 'unprecedented surge,' from 4.1 million malaria cases and 527 deaths last year to 7.3 million cases and 1,157 deaths between January 1 and October 20, 2024. Unlike other species which are seasonal and prefer rural areas, stephensi thrives year-round in urban settings, breeding in man-made water storage tanks, roof gutters or even air conditioning units. It appears to be highly resistant to insecticides, and bites earlier in the evening than other carriers. That means bed nets -- up to now the prime weapon against malaria -- may be much less effective. 'The invasion and spread of Anopheles stephensi has the potential to change the malaria landscape in Africa and reverse decades of progress we've made towards malaria control,' Meera Venkatesan, malaria division chief for USAID, told AFP. More research is needed The fear is that stephensi will infest dense cities like Mombasa on Kenya's Indian Ocean coast and Sudan's capital Khartoum, with one 2020 study warning it could eventually reach 126 million city-dwellers across Africa. Only last month, Egypt was declared malaria-free by WHO after a century-long battle against the disease -- a status that could be threatened by stephensi's arrival. Much remains unknown, however. Stephensi was confirmed as present in Kenya in late 2022, but has so far stayed in hotter, dryer areas without reaching the high-altitude capital, Nairobi. 'We don't yet fully understand the biology and behavior of this mosquito,' Charles Mbogo, president of the Pan-African Mosquito Control Association, told AFP. 'Possibly it is climate-driven and requires high temperatures, but much more research is needed.' He called for increased funding for capturing and testing mosquitos, and for educating the public on prevention measures such as covering water receptacles. Multiplying threats The spread of stephensi could dovetail with other worrying trends, including increased evidence of drug resistant malaria recorded in Uganda, Rwanda, Tanzania and Eritrea. 'The arrival of resistance is imminent,' said Dorothy Achu, WHO's head of tropical and vector-borne diseases in Africa. WHO is working with countries to diversify treatment programmes to delay resistance, she said. A new malaria variant is also evading tests used to diagnose the disease. 'The increased transmission that stephensi is driving could potentially help accelerate the spread of other threats, such as drug resistance or another mutation in the parasite that leads it to be less detectable by our most widely-used diagnostics,' said Venkatesan at USAID. Another added challenge is the lack of coordination between African governments. Achu said WHO is working on 'a more continental approach'. But Mbogo in Kenya said 'more political will' was needed. 'We share information as scientists with colleagues in neighbouring countries,' he said. 'But we need to reach the higher level. We need cross-border collaborations, data-sharing.'	https://www.voanews.com/a/urban-mosquito-sparks-malaria-surge-in-east-africa-/7868872.html	2024-11-18T21:12:54-08:00	
US House panel to consider releasing report on Trump's attorney general nominee	The U.S. House of Representatives Ethics Committee is set to meet Wednesday to decide whether to release its investigative report on former Representative Matt Gaetz, who was accused of sexual misconduct and illicit drug use before he was picked by President-elect Donald Trump to be attorney general in his new administration. Several U.S. senators, Democrats and Republicans alike, are demanding that the report be released so they can consider the scope of Gaetz’s background as they undertake their constitutionally mandated role of confirming or rejecting a new president’s Cabinet nominees. Last Wednesday, Trump named Gaetz, 42, a Republican congressman from Florida for eight years, to become the country’s top law enforcement official. Hours later, Gaetz resigned from Congress, even though he had just been reelected to a fifth term. His resignation ended the House Ethics Committee’s investigation, which had been nearing a conclusion. But it remained uncertain whether the panel would divulge what conclusions it had reached. The committee, with five Democrats and five Republicans, had been looking into allegations that Gaetz had a sexual relationship with a 17-year-old girl and used drugs illicitly. Gaetz has denied the allegations. The Justice Department, which Gaetz hopes to lead, investigated the case but declined last year to bring any charges. House Speaker Mike Johnson, who leads the narrow Republican majority in the chamber, has contended that no ethics report should be made public because Gaetz is no longer a member of Congress. However, there have been instances where that has occurred in the past. Johnson told CNN on Sunday that senators reviewing the Gaetz nomination as the country’s top law enforcement official will 'have a vigorous review and vetting process,' but that they did not need to see the House Ethics Committee’s report. Some senators have suggested they could move to subpoena it if it is not turned over to them voluntarily. Republican Senator Markwayne Mullin on Sunday told NBC's 'Meet the Press' that the panel should share its report with the Senate. 'The Senate should have access to that,' Mullin said. 'Should it be released to the public or not? That I guess will be part of the negotiations.' Gaetz is one of several Trump appointees to his Cabinet who do not have the credentials normally seen in candidates for high-level government jobs. Over the weekend, a lawyer for another Trump choice, Pete Hegseth, a 44-year-old Fox News host named to be defense secretary, revealed that Hegseth several years ago paid an undisclosed amount to a woman who accused him of sexual assault in 2017 to avert the threat of what he viewed as a baseless lawsuit becoming public. Trump has stood by his Cabinet nominees, refusing to withdraw their nominations. But the controversies surrounding Gaetz, Hegseth and others could threaten their confirmations by the Senate to be in Trump’s Cabinet. The president-elect also has sought — with little success so far — to get the Senate, in Republican control come January when he takes office, to agree to recess at times so he could name and install his Cabinet members without the need for contentious and time-consuming confirmation hearings.	https://www.voanews.com/a/us-house-panel-to-consider-releasing-report-on-trump-s-attorney-general-nominee-/7868504.html	2024-11-18T19:35:13-08:00	
Trump picks former lawmaker Sean Duffy to be transportation secretary	WASHINGTON — U.S. President-elect Donald Trump said on Monday that he is nominating former Wisconsin Representative Sean Duffy, now a Fox News host, to be transportation secretary. If confirmed, Duffy will oversee aviation, automotive, rail, transit and other transportation policies at the department with about a $110 billion budget as well as significant funding that remains under the Biden administration's 2021 $1 trillion infrastructure law and EV charging stations. Trump has vowed to reverse the Biden administration's vehicle emissions rules. He has said he plans to begin the process of undoing the Biden administration's stringent emissions regulations finalized earlier this year as soon as he takes office. The rules cut tailpipe emissions limits by 50% from 2026 levels by 2032 and prod automakers to build more EVs. Duffy will face a number of major transportation issues. U.S. traffic deaths have fallen this year but still remain sharply above pre-COVID levels. The fatality rate remains higher this year than in any pre-pandemic year since 2008. He will face pressure to ease rules for self-driving cars sought by Tesla and other automakers. Trump said Duffy will prioritize 'Excellence, Competence, Competitiveness and Beauty when rebuilding America’s highways, tunnels, bridges and airports. He will ensure our ports and dams serve our Economy without compromising our National Security.' Duffy will oversee the continuing enhanced oversight of Boeing. The Federal Aviation Administration, which is part of USDOT, capped production at 38 737 MAX planes per month in January after a door panel missing four key bolts flew off an Alaska Airlines 737 MAX 9 in midair that month, exposing serious safety issues at Boeing. If confirmed, Duffy will also decide whether to continue the Biden administration's aviation passenger rights push and whether to approve more airline joint ventures. He will also be in charge of oversight of companies run by Elon Musk, who has been closely involved in Trump's transition. USDOT is investigating Tesla Autopilot, while the FAA has proposed to fine SpaceX for violating space license rules. Musk has called for the resignation of FAA Administrator Mike Whitaker. A persistent shortage of controllers has delayed flights and, at many facilities, while a series of near miss incidents involving passenger jets have raised safety concerns. Congress also has been considering significant rail safety reforms in the aftermath of the February 2023 derailment of a Norfolk Southern train in East Palestine, Ohio.	https://www.voanews.com/a/trump-picks-former-lawmaker-sean-duffy-to-be-transportation-secretary/7868849.html	2024-11-18T19:17:31-08:00	
Central African Republic applauds extension of peacekeepers' mandate	Yaounde, Cameroon — Political parties and civil society groups in the Central African Republic are welcoming the U.N. Security Council's decision to extend the mandate of the Multidimensional Integrated Stabilization Mission, or MINUSCA. Civil society groups say the U.N. peacekeeping troops will protect civilians from rebels during parliamentary and local elections that have now been rescheduled for April 6. Blandine Ikom, a member of the C.A.R’s Coalition of Civil Society Groups, said she expected U.N. troops to help the nation make sure that local and parliamentary elections in 2025 and a presidential election expected in 2026 are held in peace to end more than a decade of chaos and political tensions. She said a return to democracy and local governance would restore peace and stability in the troubled state. The success of the polls is not assured. Officials first scheduled the polls for October, postponed them to December, then changed the date again to April 6. The government said rebel groups and opposition political parties were planning to disrupt the elections unless electoral laws and the 2023 constitution were revised. The opposition said the laws favor the party of President Faustin-Archange Touadera. Last week, the U.N. Security Council extended the MINUSCA mandate through November 15, 2025. The council said MINUSCA would protect civilians, support C.A.R government officials, deploy forces for the preservation of territorial integrity and support an ongoing peace process. Florence Marchal, MINUSCA spokesperson, said the force was also tasked with making sure all qualified C.A.R. civilians are registered on voter lists. 'The first step is to update the voter registration lists, and we are very keen on supporting this step because the same voter lists will be used for local elections, presidential elections and legislative elections,' Marchal told VOA by phone from Bangui, the C.A.R. capital. 'Especially, we need to have more women on the voter lists. We have launched a specific project to support the registration of women on voter lists.' Marchal said MINUSCA aims to have at least 50 percent of C.A.R. women registered to vote. The mission is assisting civilians who do not have a required birth certificate to obtain the document, Marchal said. MINUSCA said it had developed what it called an integrated security plan with C.A.R military and police to ensure the safety of election officials, civilians and material during the April 6 polls and to lay the groundwork for presidential elections the next year. Army General Zephirin Mamadou, the C.A.R.’s military chief of staff, said Monday on state TV that the extension of the U.N. peacekeepers' mandate was another diplomatic victory for Touadera, who wants all civilians to live in peace and to have their goods protected from rebels who want to destabilize the C.A.R. Mamadou said the government troops he commands were galvanized by the extension and looked forward to collaborating with U.N. troops. MINUSCA was created in 2014 to address the Central African Republic’s long-running security, humanitarian and political crisis.

Russia vetoes UN cease-fire resolution for Sudan	Russia vetoed a United Nation resolution Monday calling for an immediate cease-fire between Sudan’s warring parties and the delivery of humanitarian aid to millions of Sudanese. Russia was the only Security Council member that voted against the cease-fire resolution. China, Russia’s ally, supported the resolution, drafted by the United Kingdom and Sierra Leone. Russian Deputy U.N. Ambassador Dmitry Polyanskiy told the council that Moscow vetoed the resolution because Sudan’s government should be 'solely' responsible for what happens in Sudan. U.S. Ambassador Linda Thomas-Greenfield said, 'It is shocking that Russia has vetoed an effort to save lives, though perhaps it shouldn't be.' She added, 'For months, Russia has obstructed and obfuscated, standing in the way of council action to address the catastrophic situation in Sudan and playing ... both sides of the conflict, to advance its own political objectives at the expense of Sudanese lives.' British Foreign Minister David Lammy said, 'One country stood in the way of the council speaking with one voice. One country is the blocker. One country is the enemy of peace. This Russian veto is a disgrace, and it shows to the world yet again, Russia's true colors.' Polyanskiy accused the Security Council of operating under a double standard, pointing to the council’s failure to rein in Israel with what he said are violations of humanitarian law in Gaza. War broke out between Sudan’s military and the paramilitary Rapid Support Forces in April 2023, in the capital, Khartoum, just before the country was set to transition to civilian rule. The violence has spread to other regions around the country. Eleven million people in Sudan have been displaced and half of the country's population, an estimated 25 million people, are struggling with crisis-level food insecurity, according to the United Nations. Famine was confirmed in August in the northern part of Sudan’s Darfur region. Some information in this report came from the Associated Press and Reuters.	https://www.voanews.com/a/russia-vetoes-un-cease-fire-resolution-for-sudan/7868843.html	2024-11-18T18:41:43-08:00

‘Department of Government Efficiency’ faces a daunting task	When President-elect Donald Trump takes office for the second time in January, two of his highest-profile supporters will be handed the keys to a new operation designed to slash government spending and improve its performance. The Department of Government Efficiency, which, despite its name, will likely be an advisory committee rather than an actual department, will be co-chaired by Tesla and SpaceX founder Elon Musk, and wealthy former Republican presidential contender Vivek Ramaswamy. The operation’s name, which can be reduced to the acronym DOGE, pronounced like 'dohj,' appears to be a product of Musk’s sense of humor. The world’s richest man, Musk has long been a proponent of a fringe cryptocurrency known as Dogecoin. Musk and Ramaswamy have set July 4, 2026 — the 250th anniversary of the signing of the Declaration of Independence — as the target date for completing their work, which is expected to reach into all corners of the sprawling U.S. government in search of spending to cut and bureaucracy to eliminate. Big promises In a statement announcing the creation of DOGE, Trump said it 'will pave the way for my administration to dismantle government bureaucracy, slash excess regulations, cut wasteful expenditures, and restructure federal agencies.' Musk has publicly speculated that it should be possible to identify some $2 trillion in potential cuts to the federal budget. That would represent nearly one-third of the $6.1 trillion the federal government spent in fiscal year 2023 and could not be accomplished without drastic reductions in government services and programs. Ramaswamy has indicated that such cuts are precisely what he and Musk will be suggesting. In an appearance on Fox News this Sunday, he was asked if they intend to shut down entire government departments. He replied, 'We expect mass reductions. We expect certain agencies to be deleted outright. We expect mass reductions in force in areas of the federal government that are bloated. We expect massive cuts, among federal contractors and others, who are overbilling the federal government.' He added, 'I think people will be surprised by how quickly we're able to move with some of those changes.' First since Reagan Organizations that press for closer oversight of federal spending were cautiously optimistic about the creation of DOGE. Tom Schatz, president of Citizens Against Government Waste, told VOA that DOGE will be 'the first significant and comprehensive private sector review of the federal government' since President Ronald Reagan created the Grace Commission, a committee to recommend improvements to government efficiency, in 1982. How impactful DOGE will ultimately be, Schatz said, will depend on a number of factors outside the commission’s control. 'It all depends on what President Trump does with the recommendations,' Schatz said. 'Recommendations have to be implemented, either through executive orders or legislation … but it takes leadership, and it takes really Congress, in many cases, to carry out the recommendations.' In a statement released after Trump announced the creation of DOGE, Maya MacGuineas, president of the Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget, praised the idea behind the effort, but warned that it would take bipartisan cooperation to see real changes implemented. 'Importantly, the process will need to be as bipartisan as possible in order to help with the deliverability and implementation of ideas,' MacGuineas said. 'The recommendations will need congressional buy-in, further emphasizing the need for this to be an effort reaching across the aisle and leaving all options on the table to address our fiscal imbalances.' Massive budget The commission overseen by Musk and Ramaswamy will be applying its scrutiny to a federal budget in which much of the government’s outlays are dedicated to what is known as 'mandatory' spending. Mandatory spending is made up of payments that the government is obligated by law to make, and in 2023 that accounted for $3.8 trillion of the $6.1 trillion budget. The largest single line item was $1.3 trillion paid out by Social Security, the federal program that provides income to retirees, according to the Congressional Budget Office. The government spent another $448 billion on income support payments for other Americans, including the unemployed and low-income parents. Spending on Medicare, the health care program for older Americans was $839 billion, while spending on Medicaid, which supports health care for low-income Americans was $616 billion. A second major category of spending is considered 'discretionary.' These are payments that Congress authorizes with each budget cycle, and they accounted for $1.7 trillion in spending in 2023. Discretionary spending funds the day-to-day operation of the federal government, with nearly half — $805 billion in 2023 — going to the defense budget. The remaining $917 billion funds the major government departments, Congress and the White House, and other functions of the government. A final major category, interest on the federal debt, exists in a gray area between mandatory and discretionary spending. While the government can theoretically choose not to service its debt, the decision to do so could be catastrophic for the U.S. and global economies. Debt service accounted for $659 billion in spending in 2023. Structure unclear It remains unclear exactly how DOGE will be structured. If it is established by an executive order, it could be subject to the Federal Advisory Committee Act. That law requires certain steps be taken to ensure transparency and has rules regarding conflicts of interest. The latter could be problematic for Musk, whose various companies have billions of dollars' worth of contracts with the federal government. However, if DOGE is constituted as a wholly private enterprise, whose leaders just happen to have the ear of the president, those rules would not apply.	https://www.voanews.com/a/department-of-government-efficiency-faces-a-daunting-task/7868816.html	2024-11-18T17:40:36-08:00	
Youths at UN climate talks push through anger to fight for hope	BAKU, Azerbaijan — Young people who attend the U.N. climate talks have a lot to be angry about. They've lost loved ones and months of school. They've lost homes and family farms and connections to their families' native lands. They haven't lost hope, though. Not yet. 'It has become so tiring for me to be just a poster child,' said Marinel Ubaldo, who by age 16 had watched two back-to-back supersized typhoons destroy entire communities in her native Philippines. Missing a chunk of high school in the aftermath, because there was no school to go back to, was a wake-up call. Now 27, COP29 will be her sixth time attending the summit where leaders negotiate the future she will inherit. 'I guess I'm very pessimistic, but I’m going to be positive that this COP could actually bring more clarity,' she said. Her pessimism isn't unwarranted. Fewer leaders were in attendance this year, with a backdrop of uncertainty as political will on climate unravels in major countries like the U.S. and Germany. While many passionate youths want to protest, this will be the third straight COP in an authoritarian country with tighter controls on protests and speech. And for many of the young people hardest hit by climate extremes, it's simply difficult and expensive to get to the conference. 'We have this constant challenge of having sometimes the youth forums with spaces at the margins of the decision-maker spaces,' said Felipe Paullier, assistant secretary-general for youth affairs in the U.N. youth office. That's why the U.N. has been working to institutionalize the role of youth in the climate talks, he said. And climate change has a disproportionate impact on children around the world. Their growing bodies have a harder time handling extreme heat, which also causes an uptick in premature births and childhood malnutrition, said Kitty van der Heijden, UNICEF assistant secretary-general. 'We are simply not doing good enough for children in this world. We are failing children,' she said. All that means young people are feeling the burden of speaking up about climate change more than ever. And many of those who come to COP, and even some of the ones who don't, said they feel tired — weighed down by the knowledge that year after year, they show up to speak and don't have a lot to show for it. This was the third year in a row that Earth's projected warming hasn't improved. 'I think for a lot of young people from extremely climate vulnerable nations, it actually it doesn’t feel like much of a choice' to speak out about climate change, said Fathimath Raaia Shareef, 20, of the Maldives. Shareef's grandmother migrated south to the small island nation's capital, so she has never had the opportunity to see what her family's home island was like. Growing up, after she found out about sea level rise, she had recurring nightmares about her island sinking. She would wake up crying. 'How am I supposed to focus on anything else when my island, when my home country is at risk?' she asked. It's that focus that brings many young people to the table even as they question their faith in the possibility that international negotiations can achieve real change. Here at his fourth COP, Francisco Vera Manzanares, 15, of Colombia called the U.N. summit a necessary but 'very difficult space' to be in. He thinks slow pace of change from countries around the world creates a 'credibility crisis' in the institutions that are most needed to keep the goals that require global cooperation within reach. 'People listen to children. But, let's say, it’s different [to] listen than hear,' he said. That's why he hopes more adults will help children meaningfully advocate for themselves in a crisis where they have the most to lose — and the most to save. 'It's our rights. It's our future. It's our present,' he said.	https://www.voanews.com/a/youths-at-un-climate-talks-push-through-anger-to-fight-for-hope/7868815.html	2024-11-18T17:37:35-08:00	
Russia increases arms trade with UN-embargoed nations to feed Ukraine war	Russia has been buying artillery shells and missiles from North Korea, buying drones and ballistic missiles from Iran and strengthening ties with the Taliban in Afghanistan to sustain its war in Ukraine. All three governments are under U.N. embargoes that prohibit arms trade and financial dealings with the countries to curtail weapons proliferation and human rights abuses. Russia, a permanent member of the U.N. Security Council, has also provided diplomatic support to Iran and North Korea, including by vetoing sanctions. Iran Iran has supplied Moscow with more than 2,000 Shahed-136/131 kamikaze drones and 18 Mohajer-6 drones since Russia's full-scale military invasion of Ukraine in February 2022. Russia extensively used the Iranian drones to attack Ukraine’s critical infrastructure and civilian targets, and to deplete Kyiv’s air defense systems. Ukraine said in September that Russia had deployed more than 8,060 Iranian-designed drones since the beginning of the full-fledged war. This number includes both Iranian-made drones and drones manufactured in a factory in the Russian republic of Tatarstan using Iranian parts and technology. Additionally, Iran has helped replenish Russia’s munitions, providing hundreds of ballistic missiles in 2024. Russia has reportedly pledged to supply Iran with Su-35 fighter jets and advanced air defense systems. Some Russian technology, such as the Yak-130 aircraft for training Su-35 pilots, has already reached Iran, though the extent remains unclear. Iran also provides propaganda support to Russia aligning the top government officials’ rhetoric and the news media language with the Kremlin’s Ukraine narratives. For example, Iranian Supreme Leader Ali Khamenei described on multiple occasions Russia’s aggression as a 'defensive act' against an imperialistic West and NATO. U.N. sanctions on Iran, led by the U.S. and supported by the European Union, target Tehran’s nuclear program, arms trade and financial systems. The restrictions are designed to curb Iran’s destabilizing activities in the region and beyond. Russia’s engagement in arms trade not only contravenes restrictions on arms exports but also boosts Iran’s military industry. North Korea Since September 2023, North Korea has reportedly supplied Russia with up to 5 million artillery shells, a substantial figure given Russia’s annual production capacity of only 2 million to 3 million shells. Russia also deployed in Ukraine North Korean KN-23/24 ballistic missiles, though their failure rate is reportedly high. Apart from weapons trade, Russia supports North Korea diplomatically - for example, in international forums and by opposing U.N. sanctions on its oil imports and nuclear industry. In March, Russia vetoed a resolution renewing the U.N. Panel of Experts monitoring sanctions on North Korea. In June, North Korea and Russia signed a strategic partnership treaty committing to provide full military and other support if either faces an armed invasion or war. Russia’s importing of weapons and ammunition from North Korea violates U.N. Security Council sanctions prohibiting arms trade with Pyongyang. These sanctions were established to curtail North Korea's weapons programs and have been reinforced with additional measures targeting its cyber activities and ship-to-ship transfers. The Taliban The Russian government designated the Taliban as a terrorist group in 2003 and banned its activities in Russia. In May 2024, Russia's foreign and justice ministries proposed to Russian President Vladimir Putin to remove the Taliban from the government’s list of terrorist organizations, where it remains to this day. However, since the Taliban took power in Afghanistan in August 2021 following the U.S. withdrawal, the Kremlin has been gradually developing ties with the group. Since 2022, Taliban delegations have attended every International Economic Forum held in Russia’s 'northern capital,' St. Petersburg. Moscow aims to strengthen economic partnership with the Taliban, envisioning Afghanistan as a transit hub for exporting natural gas to India and goods to Pakistani ports. However, this requires building a gas pipeline and extending a railroad from Mazar-i-Sharif, the regional hub of northern Afghanistan. Russia’s developing economic ties with the Taliban can potentially violate international frameworks that sanction the Taliban as a terrorist organization and undermine measures aimed at isolating the group because of its human rights abuses and historical links to terrorism. No country formally recognized the Taliban as Afghanistan's legitimate government, but China and the United Arab Emirates have accepted Taliban-appointed ambassadors.	https://www.voanews.com/a/russia-increases-arms-trade-with-un-embargoed-nations-to-feed-ukraine-war/7868778.html	2024-11-18T17:06:11-08:00	
UN Security Council calls for urgent aid to Gaza	State Department — Members of the United Nations Security Council, including the United States and the United Kingdom, urged an immediate increase in aid to Palestinian civilians in Gaza, warning that the humanitarian situation there is worsening. Meanwhile, the United States warned Turkey on Monday against hosting Hamas leadership, saying there can be 'no more business as usual' with what the U.S. designates as a terrorist organization. Several media reports indicate that senior members of Hamas' leadership outside of Gaza have been in Turkey in recent days after being asked to leave Qatar. State Department spokesperson Matthew Miller said he was not in a position to dispute these reports, leaving it to the relevant governments to address the whereabouts of Hamas leaders. 'We don't believe the leaders of a vicious terrorist organization should be living comfortably anywhere, and that certainly includes in a major city in one of our key partners,' Miller told reporters during a briefing on Monday. At the United Nations, British Foreign Secretary David Lammy called for a 'huge rise in aid' to Gaza, where the displacement of most of the 2.3 million residents has exacerbated the humanitarian crisis. In a social media post on X, the United Kingdom’s U.N. headquarters said '400 days into this war, there is no excuse for Israeli restrictions making it harder than ever to get aid into Gaza. There is no excuse for Hamas still holding hostages. This war must end — to open a path to a lasting peace with a two-state solution at its core.' U.S. officials said they are closely monitoring Israel's actions to improve the conditions for Palestinian civilians while engaging with Israeli leaders 'every single day.' 'As we press for an end to the war, Israel must also urgently take additional steps to alleviate the catastrophic humanitarian situation in Gaza,' U.S. Ambassador to the United Nations Linda Thomas-Greenfield said on Monday. Bombardment in Lebanon Late Monday, Israeli airstrikes hit a neighborhood in the heart of Lebanon's capital, targeting an area near Lebanon’s parliament, several embassies and the U.N. headquarters, as the U.S. pressed ahead with diplomatic efforts to end the fighting. Meanwhile, Israel's strikes on Sunday prompted the Education Ministry to shut schools and higher education institutions in the Beirut area for two days. Hezbollah spokesperson Mohammad Afif was among four people killed in the Ras al-Nabaa district, Hezbollah and the Israeli military said. Israel has rarely hit senior Hezbollah personnel who do not have clear military roles, and its airstrikes have mostly targeted Beirut's southern suburbs, where the group has its heaviest presence, Reuters reported. Israel Defense Forces issued a statement about the 'precise, intelligence-based strike' that killed Afif. The IDF said that Afif, a key figure in Hezbollah's military operations, was in contact with senior officials and directly involved in advancing and executing Hezbollah’s terrorist activities against Israel. On Monday, the United Nations cultural and scientific agency, UNESCO, granted provisional enhanced protection to 34 cultural properties in Lebanon, including the World Heritage sites of Baalbek and Tyre, following recent Israeli strikes near these sites. Deaths in Gaza An Israeli strike in a tent sheltering displaced people in Gaza’s Khan Younis killed two children and their parents overnight, Palestinian officials said Monday. The dead children were ages 7 and 9, and a 10-year-old child was also wounded, civil defense officials said. On Sunday, Gaza's civil defense agency said 34 people were killed, including children, and dozens were missing after an Israeli airstrike hit a five-story residential building in Beit Lahia. 'The chances of rescuing more wounded are decreasing because of the continuous shooting and artillery shelling,' civil defense spokesman Mahmud Bassal told Agence France-Presse. The war in Gaza began with the October 7, 2023, Hamas attack on southern Israel, during which the militants killed about 1,200 people and took 250 hostages. Hamas is still holding about 100 hostages, with a third of them believed to be dead. Israel’s counteroffensive has killed nearly 44,000 Palestinians, with women and children more than half the verified total, according to the Gaza Health Ministry. After months of rocket fire and airstrikes between Hezbollah and Israel, the fighting expanded in Lebanon in mid-September. More than 3,200 Lebanese have been killed, most of them in the past six weeks. Both Hezbollah and Hamas have been designated as terrorist organizations by the United States. Information from The Associated Press, Reuters and Agence France-Presse was used in this report.	https://www.voanews.com/a/un-security-council-calls-for-urgent-aid-to-gaza/7868524.html	2024-11-18T16:53:36-08:00	
US Sudan envoy meets army chief Burhan on first visit	dubai/washington — The U.S. special envoy to Sudan traveled to the African country for the first time on Monday to seek an increase in the flow of aid to millions of people in need and an end to a devastating war. Tom Perriello, who was named Washington's envoy for Sudan in February, traveled to Port Sudan on the Red Sea coast, the de facto capital for the army-led government. It marked the first visit to the country by a senior U.S. official since the war between the Sudanese Armed Forces and the paramilitary Rapid Support Forces (RSF) broke out in April 2023 and the U.S. embassy was evacuated. 'We feel an enormous amount of urgency to end this crisis and to ensure that we can ... help to get food and medicine and life-saving support to the 20 million people plus that are in need,' a State Department official said before the trip. The U.N. says more than 25 million people — half of Sudan's population — need aid as famine has taken hold in one region and more than 11 million people have fled their homes. Perriello met with Sudan's army chief Abdel Fattah al-Burhan as well as humanitarian, government and tribal leaders, a statement by the country's sovereign council said. In a meeting the council said was 'lengthy, comprehensive, and frank,' the two men discussed ways to deliver humanitarian aid and a political process to end the war. 'The U.S. envoy presented several suggestions which the head of the sovereign council agreed to,' the statement said. U.S.-mediated talks in Geneva earlier this year failed to achieve progress toward a cease-fire as the army refused to attend, but did secure promises from the warring parties to improve aid access. The war erupted more than a year ago amid a power struggle between the army and the RSF ahead of a planned transition to civilian rule. Perriello discussed 'the need to cease fighting, enable unhindered humanitarian access, including through localized pauses in the fighting to allow for the delivery of emergency relief supplies, and commit to a civilian government,' a State Department statement said. While the U.S. would continue to pursue a more comprehensive cease-fire and negotiations, 'right now, I think there's a really key opportunity to build on the expansion of humanitarian aid,' the State Department official said, highlighting the need for relief corridors to the most battle-ravaged areas including al-Fashir, Sennar and parts of the capital Khartoum. Sudan's sovereign council said last week it would extend a temporary opening of the Adre border crossing with Chad, which aid agencies say is a vital corridor for food and other supplies to areas of the Darfur and Kordofan regions at risk of famine. The State Department official said Washington was concerned that the number of foreign actors beginning to engage in the conflict was growing, adding that there has been an increased number of mercenary fighters from the Sahel arriving to fight with the RSF as well as other actors, including Russia and Iran, playing a role with the army. The visit came as the RSF continues revenge attacks in eastern El Gezira state and a campaign to take over the army's last Darfur stronghold, al-Fashir. In a news conference in Nairobi, an RSF representative said they were still open to peace but doubted the army's willingness. 'They do not listen to any language but that of the rifle, and so we will continue to talk to them in the language they understand,' said Brigadier General Omar Hamdan.	https://www.voanews.com/a/us-sudan-envoy-meets-army-chief-burhan-on-first-visit-/7868525.html	2024-11-18T16:04:53-08:00	
UN to resume Haiti aid flights	PORT-AU-PRINCE, haiti — The U.N. Humanitarian Air Service will restart flights within Haiti on Wednesday, according to a statement from the U.N. World Food Program, which manages the service. The U.N. paused flights to Haiti's capital last Tuesday, a day after gangs struck three commercial planes with gunfire, prompting the U.S. aviation regulator to ban U.S. airlines from flying to the conflict-ravaged Caribbean nation for 30 days. 'UNHAS provides passenger and light cargo transport in Haiti for the entire humanitarian community, including local and international NGOs,' WFP said in a statement, adding that the suspension had not affected food supplies. Haiti's government helicopter also resumed services Monday, transporting three new government ministers. A cabinet shake-up last week resulted in the ouster of the prime minister and the replacement of many of his top ministers. Even as the flights restarted, armed violence continued in parts of Port-au-Prince, such as Lower Delmas. The majority of Port-au-Prince is under the control of armed gangs who have been making gains in recent weeks while a long-delayed, partly deployed U.N.-backed mission to reclaim territories and ensure aid deliveries continues to be stalled. On Sunday, the U.N.'s International Organization for Migration estimated that more than 20,000 people had been displaced across the capital in just four days, marking the largest mass displacement in over a year. 'The isolation of Port-au-Prince is amplifying an already dire humanitarian situation,' the IOM Haiti chief, Gregoire Goodstein, said in a statement, adding that only 20% of the capital was accessible to humanitarian workers. 'Our ability to deliver aid is stretched to its limits. Without immediate international support, the suffering will worsen exponentially,' he said. UNICEF Haiti chief Geeta Narayan said over half of the 20,000 displaced were children, who were facing the 'compounded impacts of malnutrition, cholera outbreaks, severe psychological distress and, all too often, tragic loss of life.' The IOM estimated that as of early September over 700,000 people had been internally displaced in the country, while the IPC, a benchmark index of food insecurity, has reported worsening shortages with 6,000 people facing famine-level hunger.	https://www.voanews.com/a/un-to-resume-haiti-aid-flights/7868522.html	2024-11-18T15:49:01-08:00	
Greece to repay chunk of bailout debt early	Athens, Greece — Greece will make an early repayment of 5 billion euros ($5.3 billion) in bailout-era debt in 2025, Prime Minister Kyriakos Mitsotakis told a banking conference in Athens on Monday, describing the move as a signal of the country's fiscal recovery. 'This ... underscores our confidence in public finances and reflects our commitment to fiscal discipline,' Mitsotakis said. Finance Ministry officials say they plan to reduce debt through primary surpluses, loan repayments and combating tax evasion. Greece has rebounded from a 10-year financial crisis that forced it to borrow tens of billions of euros from its European Union partners and the International Monetary Fund. But Mitsotakis' center-right government, elected for a second term in 2023, is struggling to address a cost of living crisis that has sapped Greeks' spending power. Despite the lack of any substantial challenge from opposition parties, the high cost of living has nibbled away at the government's approval ratings and triggered union anger. The country's two main private and public sector unions have called a general strike for Wednesday that will keep island ferries in port and disrupt other forms of transport and public services. A protest march will be held in central Athens on Wednesday morning. The GSEE main private sector union Monday accused the government of 'refusing to take any meaningful measures that would secure workers dignified living conditions.' 'The cost of living is sky-high and our salaries rock-bottom, (while) high housing costs have left young people in a tragic position,' GSEE chairman Yiannis Panagopoulos said. According to EU forecasts, Greece's economy is expected to grow 2.1% in 2024 and maintain a broadly similar course over the following two years. Unemployment, now below 10%, is expected to keep declining, while inflation is projected at 3% this year.	https://www.voanews.com/a/greece-to-repay-chunk-of-bailout-debt-early/7868510.html	2024-11-18T15:22:36-08:00	
45 pro-democracy activists face wide range of sentences in Hong Kong	hong kong — Dozens of prominent Hong Kong pro-democracy activists are scheduled to be sentenced Tuesday in the largest case brought under a national security law that critics say crushed political activism in the semiautonomous Chinese city. The convictions of the 45 activists under the Beijing-imposed law are widely seen as part of a crackdown by China that destroyed hopes for a more democratic Hong Kong. The potential sentences range from a few years to life in prison. The activists were among 47 people charged with conspiracy to commit subversion in 2021 for their involvement in an unofficial primary election to pick opposition candidates. They were accused of agreeing to veto government-proposed budgets indiscriminately after securing a legislative majority to force a dissolution of the legislature and then the ouster of the city's leader. Three government-approved judges ruled that the plan to achieve political change through the unofficial primary in 2020 would have undermined the government’s authority and created a constitutional crisis. Thirty-one of the activists pleaded guilty and 14 others were found guilty in May following a trial. Two were acquitted. Those who entered guilty pleas have a better chance of shorter prison terms. Some of the convicted activists have sought lesser sentences by expressing remorse and apologizing. Others have remained defiant. Here are profiles of some of them. Benny Tai Riding on a wave of anti-government protests in 2019, Benny Tai, a former law professor at the University of Hong Kong, co-organized the primary election that drew 610,000 voters — over 13% of the city’s registered electorate. The primary was aimed at selecting pro-democracy candidates who would then run in the official election. The judges said Tai stated that acquiring a legislative majority was a 'constitutional weapon of mass destruction' that would allow the pro-democracy camp to veto government budgets. Under the city’s Basic Law, or mini-constitution, the city leader can dissolve the legislature if a budget cannot be passed. But the leader must step down if the budget is again blocked by the next legislature. The judges said Tai aimed to 'undermine, destroy or overthrow the existing political system and structure' of Hong Kong. Tai pleaded guilty to the charge. In seeking a shorter sentence, his lawyer said Tai always supported nonviolence and believed his actions were legal. Tai was not always viewed as a threat by authorities. He was a member of a consultative committee that helped collect views on the drafting of the Basic Law before the former British colony returned to Chinese rule in 1997. In 2001, the government awarded him a medal of honor for promoting civic education, though it was withdrawn in 2022. Tai is perhaps best known as a co-founder of the city’s 2014 Occupy Movement, during which demonstrators occupied streets and stopped traffic in some areas for nearly 80 days, demanding direct elections for the city’s leader. Joshua Wong Joshua Wong rose to fame in Hong Kong in 2012 as a high school student leading protests against the introduction of national education in the city’s schools. Two years later, he became world famous as a leader of the Occupy Movement. In 2016, Wong co-founded a political party named Demosisto with fellow young activists Nathan Law and Agnes Chow. In the 2019 pro-democracy movement, Wong helped seek overseas support for the protests. His activism led Beijing to label him an advocate of Hong Kong's independence who 'begged for interference' by foreign forces. Demosisto disbanded when Beijing imposed the security law in 2020. Wong won in the primary election, but the government postponed the official election, citing public health risks during the COVID-19 pandemic. Wong has pleaded guilty and asked for a lesser sentence. His lawyer said he hoped 'he could part with his history and would be able to reform himself' after completing his sentence. Wu Chi-wai Wu Chi-wai is the former chair of Hong Kong's biggest pro-democracy party, the Democratic Party, which some activists saw as too moderate. In 2006, the government awarded Wu a medal of honor for community service. Wu entered a guilty plea, with his lawyer saying he has been in public service for over 30 years and that he and his party did not seek indiscriminate vetoing of budgets. Three former government officials wrote letters seeking a reduced sentence for him. Wu's parents passed away during his detention and he could only briefly attend their funerals. Gordon Ng Gordon Ng, a dual citizen of Australia and Hong Kong, was initially named an organizer of the primary by prosecutors, an accusation Ng denied. He pleaded not guilty. The judges acknowledged in their verdict that Ng did not organize the plan and was not a candidate. However, they pointed to his campaign urging voters to support primary winners through social media posts and a front-page advertisement in the now-shuttered pro-democracy Apple Daily newspaper, founded by Jimmy Lai. In seeking a lesser sentence, Ng said his support for the primary was linked to his belief that it could address the differences within the pro-democracy camp, which had long been plagued by infighting. He said he never asked candidates to promise to veto budgets.	https://www.voanews.com/a/pro-democracy-activists-face-wide-range-of-sentences-in-hong-kong/7868509.html	2024-11-18T15:21:02-08:00	
US House panel to consider releasing report on Trump's attorney general nominee	The U.S. House of Representatives Ethics Committee is set to meet Wednesday to decide whether to release its investigative report on former Representative Matt Gaetz, who was accused of sexual misconduct and illicit drug use before he was picked by President-elect Donald Trump to be attorney general in his new administration. Several U.S. senators, Democrats and Republicans alike, are demanding that the report be released so they can consider the scope of Gaetz’s background as they undertake their constitutionally mandated role of confirming or rejecting a new president’s Cabinet nominees. Last Wednesday, Trump named Gaetz, 42, a Republican congressman from Florida for eight years, to become the country’s top law enforcement official. Hours later, Gaetz resigned from Congress, even though he had just been reelected to a fifth term. His resignation ended the House Ethics Committee’s investigation, which had been nearing a conclusion. But it remained uncertain whether the panel would divulge what conclusions it had reached. The committee, with five Democrats and five Republicans, had been looking into allegations that Gaetz had a sexual relationship with a 17-year-old girl and used drugs illicitly. Gaetz has denied the allegations. The Justice Department, which Gaetz hopes to lead, investigated the case but declined last year to bring any charges. House Speaker Mike Johnson, who leads the narrow Republican majority in the chamber, has contended that no ethics report should be made public because Gaetz is no longer a member of Congress. However, there have been instances where that has occurred in the past. Johnson told CNN on Sunday that senators reviewing the Gaetz nomination as the country’s top law enforcement official will 'have a vigorous review and vetting process,' but that they did not need to see the House Ethics Committee’s report. Some senators have suggested they could move to subpoena it if it is not turned over to them voluntarily. Republican Senator Markwayne Mullin on Sunday told NBC's 'Meet the Press' that the panel should share its report with the Senate. 'The Senate should have access to that,' Mullin said. 'Should it be released to the public or not? That I guess will be part of the negotiations.' Gaetz is one of several Trump appointees to his Cabinet who do not have the credentials normally seen in candidates for high-level government jobs. Over the weekend, a lawyer for another Trump choice, Pete Hegseth, a 44-year-old Fox News host named to be defense secretary, revealed that Hegseth several years ago paid an undisclosed amount to a woman who accused him of sexual assault in 2017 to avert the threat of what he viewed as a baseless lawsuit becoming public. Trump has stood by his Cabinet nominees, refusing to withdraw their nominations. But the controversies surrounding Gaetz, Hegseth and others could threaten their confirmations by the Senate to be in Trump’s Cabinet. The president-elect also has sought — with little success so far — to get the Senate, in Republican control come January when he takes office, to agree to recess at times so he could name and install his Cabinet members without the need for contentious and time-consuming confirmation hearings.	https://www.voanews.com/a/7868504.html	2024-11-18T15:18:49-08:00	
Militants kill 8 Pakistani soldiers, abduct 7 police officers	Islamabad — Authorities in northwestern Pakistan reported Monday that militants ambushed a military convoy near the border with Afghanistan and killed at least eight soldiers. The attack occurred in Khyber, a volatile border district in the province of Khyber Pakhtunkhwa, targeting soldiers returning to their base after a counterinsurgency operation. The ambush left at least three soldiers injured, one of whom is in 'serious' condition, multiple security officials said. They spoke anonymously to VOA because they were not authorized to discuss the details with the media. The ensuing clashes reportedly also left several assailants dead. The Pakistan military’s media wing did not immediately comment on the deadly attack or the reported casualties that followed. Separately, dozens of heavily armed men stormed a security outpost in the province’s militancy-hit Bannu district Monday evening, taking seven armed police officers hostage. Police officials in the area reported that an operation to track down the assailants and rescue the abducted personnel was under way. Several districts in the Pakistani border province, including Khyber and Bannu, routinely experience attacks on security forces, which are mostly attributed to or claimed by the Tehrik-i-Taliban Pakistan, or TTP, an outlawed militant group. TTP-led militants in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa and ethnic Baloch separatists in Pakistan’s southwestern Balochistan, which borders Afghanistan, have lately intensified their attacks. The militant violence has killed more than 1,100 Pakistani security forces and civilians nationwide so far this year, according to data reported by the Islamabad-based, independent Center for Research and Security Studies. TTP is declared a terrorist group by the United Nations, while the Baloch Liberation Army, which is believed to be the largest insurgent group in Balochistan, is designated as a foreign terrorist organization by the United States. BLA claimed responsibility for two attacks last week, including a railway station suicide bombing, that collectively killed at least 34 soldiers. Pakistani leaders have persistently complained that TTP and Baloch insurgents orchestrate cross-border terrorism from Afghan bases, charges the neighboring country’s de facto Taliban authorities deny. A U.S. government watchdog, the Special Inspector General for Afghanistan Reconstruction, or SIGAR, reported this month that 'it remains unclear whether the Taliban have the will and capability to fully eliminate terrorist safe havens or control the flow of foreign terrorist fighters in and through Afghanistan.' SIGAR referenced U.N. findings in its quarterly report to the U.S. Congress on November 7, stating that al-Qaida operates eight training camps in Afghanistan, supplying the TTP with Afghan fighters and offering training facilities. This prompted the U.N. sanctions monitoring team to warn that 'greater collaboration among al-Qaida affiliates and TTP could transform the latter into an 'extra-regional threat,' the report stated.	https://www.voanews.com/a/militants-kill-8-pakistani-soldiers-abduct-7-police-officers/7868502.html	2024-11-18T15:17:08-08:00	
Canada foiled Iran plot to assassinate former minister	Ottawa, Canada — Canadian authorities recently foiled an alleged Iranian plot to assassinate Irwin Cotler, a former justice minister who has been a strong critic of Tehran, Cotler's organization said Monday. The 84-year-old was justice minister and attorney general from 2003 to 2006. He retired from politics in 2015 but has remained active with many associations that campaign for human rights around the world. The Globe and Mail newspaper reported that he was informed on October 26 that he faced an imminent threat — within 48 hours — of assassination from Iranian agents. Authorities tracked two suspects in the plot, the paper said, citing an unnamed source. In an email to AFP, the Raoul Wallenberg Center for Human Rights, where Cotler is international chair, confirmed The Globe and Mail report. Cotler 'has no knowledge or details regarding any arrests made,' said Brandon Golfman, an organization spokesperson. A spokesperson for Public Safety Minister Dominic LeBlanc declined to comment, telling AFP: 'We cannot comment on, nor confirm specific RCMP [Royal Canadian Mounted Police] operations due to security reasons.' Another senior government minister, Francois-Philippe Champagne, called the plot 'very concerning.' Jean-Yves Duclos, the government's senior minister in Quebec province, where Cotler lives, said it was likely 'very difficult for (Cotler), in particular, and his family and friends to hear' about it. The House of Commons, meanwhile, passed a unanimous motion praising Cotler's work in defense of human rights and 'condemning the death threats against him orchestrated by agents of a foreign regime.' Cotler had already been receiving police protection for more than a year after the Oct. 7, 2023, attack in Israel by Hamas gunmen. Cotler, who is Jewish and a strong backer of Israel, has advocated globally to have Iran's Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps listed as a terrorist entity. His name reportedly also came up in an FBI probe of a 2022 Iranian murder-for-hire operation in New York that targeted American human-rights activist Masih Alinejad. Ottawa, which severed diplomatic ties with Iran more than a decade ago, listed the Revolutionary Guard as a banned terrorist group in June. It said at the time that Iranian authorities displayed a consistent 'disregard for human rights both inside and outside of Iran, as well as a willingness to destabilize the international rules-based order.' As a lawyer, Cotler also represented Iranian political prisoners and dissidents. His daughter, Michal Cotler-Wunsh, is an Israeli politician and diplomat who previously served as a member of Israel's parliament.	https://www.voanews.com/a/canada-foiled-iran-plot-to-assassinate-former-minister-/7868507.html	2024-11-18T15:16:12-08:00	
Zimbabwe urged to put money into cancer treatment services	Cancer patients and advocates are urging authorities in Zimbabwe to ensure cancer centers have lifesaving equipment needed to properly treat patients.

Nigeria celebrates Miss Universe success amid citizenship controversy	abuja, nigeria — Nigerians are celebrating the success of Chidimma Adetshina at the Miss Universe contest in Mexico Saturday. Adetshina fell just short of the title, being named first runner up, but was still crowned Miss Universe Africa and Oceania. Another Nigerian beauty queen, Stephanie Kingsley, spent Saturday glued to her social media feed as she monitored the pageant. She said her heart pounded with anxiety as Adetshina, 23, progressed to the top five and later emerged as the first runner up, only behind Miss Denmark, Victoria Kjaer Theilvig. 'I was talking to my friend in the U.K.,' Kingsley said. 'We were on the phone for almost two hours; we were just screaming. We had goosebumps throughout. As a pageant girl, I'm really proud and grateful. It opens doors for us. You know it's been a struggle.' Adetshina won support from millions of Nigerians after a citizenship dispute forced her to step down from the Miss Universe South Africa race in early August. Adetshina was born to a Nigerian father and a South African mother with Mozambican roots. She said she was concerned for her safety and the well-being of her family after she was targeted in xenophobic online attacks. Shortly after stepping down, Nigeria’s pageant organizers invited her to represent her father's country. Kingsley said Adetshina showed extraordinary strength and courage. 'She's a really strong person mentally because I don't even want to think about how she would have tried so hard to maintain sanity,' Kingsley said. 'She was able to achieve this groundbreaking record for Nigeria, that we, the pageant girls, have been hungry for since 2001.' In 2001, Nigerian model Agbani Darego won the Miss World pageant. Adetshina is the first Nigerian and West African to place so highly in Miss Universe contest. On Sunday, the Nigerians in Diaspora Commission praised Adetshina for her fortitude. Smart Courage, a Nigerian who runs an agency that trains beauty queens for the runway, said discrimination among Africans is a serious issue. 'The aim of pageantry is to help work on social issues especially those that affect women,' Courage said. 'Every time we say, ‘Black Lives Matter’ but we also have an internal issue where Africans do not see other Africans as being ‘African enough’ and that is a conversation we need to start having. Because if we do not rectify such problems within the African community, it's going to be very difficult to say you're speaking up for Black people around the country.' South Africa’s Home Affairs department is still investigating Adetshina’s mother for alleged citizenship fraud. Adetshina is not accused of wrongdoing as she was a baby in 2001, when authorities allege her mother committed identity theft to register their citizenship. Neither Adetshina nor her mother has commented on the allegations.	https://www.voanews.com/a/nigeria-celebrates-miss-universe-success-amid-citizenship-controversy-/7868443.html	2024-11-18T13:48:33-08:00	
China's Xi highlights 'Global South' measures at G20	Washington — Chinese President Xi Jinping announced a range of measures to boost global development in his remarks Monday at G20 Summit meetings in Rio de Janeiro — highlighting Beijing’s support for its global infrastructure project, the Belt and Road, and a joint technology initiative to support so-called 'Global South' nations. Xi said the 'Open Science International Cooperation Initiative' would be spearheaded by China, Brazil, South Africa and the African Union to ensure that technological advances benefit less developed, underdeveloped and developing nations. 'China supports the G20 in carrying out practical cooperation for the benefit of the Global South,' Xi said, according to state news agency Xinhua. He also said China expects imports from developing countries to top $8 trillion between now and 2030. The Global South generally refers to countries listed as 'developing' by the United Nations but also includes China and several wealthy Gulf states. In recent years, China and Russia have stepped up their use of the grouping to highlight efforts to support the developing world and grow the political, military and economic influence. Beyond advocating for the Global South, China is also using the G20 summit to bolster its bilateral ties, meeting with the leaders from Britain and Australia on Monday, as well as host Brazil. Xi’s meeting on Monday with British Prime Minister Keir Starmer was a first for the two countries since 2018. Both sides were enthusiastic about building positive relations, despite a growing range of differences from security to human rights concerns. During his meeting with Xi, Starmer said he wants relations between the two countries to be 'consistent, durable and respectful.' He also stressed that Britain is 'committed to the rule of law.' Ties between Britain and China have been strained in recent years over a range of issues, including the case of Hong Kong media tycoon and British national Jimmy Lai, who is currently on trial in the port city, a former British colony. Starmer raised Lai’s case directly during his meeting with Xi on Monday. According to the Xinhua News Agency, Xi told Starmer that the two countries have the potential for more cooperation and 'should open up new prospects for China-U.K. ties.' During his meeting with Australian Prime Minister Anthony Albanese, Xi lauded what he called the 'positive progress' in ties, according to Chinese state media. Much like Beijing’s relations with Britain, ties between Australia and China have been strained in recent years. After the G20 summit, Xi will pay a state visit to Brazil in honor of the 50th anniversary of diplomatic ties between the two countries.	https://www.voanews.com/a/china-s-xi-highlights-global-south-measures-at-g20/7868441.html	2024-11-18T13:47:52-08:00	
As China cracks down on bookstores at home, Chinese-language booksellers flourish overseas	Washington — Yu Miao smiles as he stands among the 10,000 books crowded on rows of bamboo shelves in his newly reopened bookstore. It’s in Washington’s vibrant Dupont Circle neighborhood, far from its last location in Shanghai, where the Chinese government forced him out of business six years ago. 'There is no pressure from the authorities here,' said Yu, the owner of JF Books, Washington’s only Chinese bookseller. 'I want to live without fear.' Independent bookstores have become a new battleground in China, swept up in the ruling Communist Party’s crackdown on dissent and free expression. The Associated Press found that at least a dozen bookstores in the world’s second-largest economy have been shuttered or targeted for closure in the last few months alone, squeezing the already tight space for press freedom. One bookstore owner was arrested over four months ago. The crackdown has had a chilling effect on China’s publishing industry. Bookstores are common in China, but many are state-owned. Independent bookstores are governed by an intricate set of rules with strict controls now being more aggressively policed, according to bookstore owners. Printing shops and street vendors are also facing more rigorous government inspections by the National Office Against Pornography and Illegal Publication. The office did not respond to interview requests from The Associated Press. China's Ministry of Foreign Affairs, in a statement to AP, said it was not aware of a crackdown on bookstores. Yu isn't alone in taking his business out of the country. Chinese bookstores have popped up in Japan, France, Netherlands and elsewhere in the U.S. in recent years, as a result of both stricter controls in China and growing Chinese communities abroad. It’s not just the books' contents that are making Chinese authorities wary. In many communities, bookstores are cultural centers where critical thinking is encouraged, and conversations can veer into politics and other topics not welcomed by the authorities. The bookstore owner who was arrested was Yuan Di, also called Yanyou, the founder of Jiazazhi, an artistic bookstore in Shanghai and Ningbo on China’s eastern coast. He was taken away by police in June, according to Zhou Youlieguo, who closed his own bookstore in Shanghai in September. Yuan's arrest was also confirmed by two other people who declined to be named for fear of retribution. The charge against Yuan is unclear. An official in Ningbo's Bureau of Culture, Radio Television and Tourism, which oversees bookstores, declined comment, noting the case is under investigation. The Ningbo police didn’t respond to an interview request. Michael Berry, director of UCLA's Center for Chinese Studies, said a sluggish Chinese economy may be driving the government to exert greater control. 'The government might be feeling that this is a time to be more cautious and control this kind of discourse in terms of what people are consuming and reading to try to put a damper on any potential unrest and kind of nip it in the bud,' Berry said. These bookstore owners face dual pressures, Berry added. One is the political clampdown; the other is the global movement, especially among young people, toward digital media and away from print publications. Wang Yingxing sold secondhand books in Ningbo for almost two decades before being ordered to close in August. Local officials informed Wang he lacked a publication business license even though he wasn’t eligible to obtain one as a second-hand seller. Faded outlines marked the spot where a sign for Fatty Wang’s Bookstore once hung. Spray-painted black letters on the bookstore’s window read: 'Temporarily closed.' 'We’re promoting culture, I’m not doing anything wrong, right? I’m just selling some books and promoting culture,' Wang said, tying a bundle of books together with brown wrapper and white nylon string. 'Then why won’t you leave me alone?' Wang added. Half a dozen other people heaved boxes of books into the back of a van. The books, Wang said, were being sold to cafe and bar owners who wanted to burnish little libraries for their patrons. Some would be sent to a warehouse in Anhui. The rest, he said, were to be sent to a recycling station to be pulped and destroyed. Bookstores are not the only target. Central authorities have also cracked down on other places such as printing shops, internet bars, gaming rooms and street vendors. Strict inspections have taken place all over the country, according to Chinese authorities. Authorities in Shanghai inspected printing places and bookstores, looking for 'printing, copying or selling illegal publications,' according to a government document. This shows the authorities are not just barring the sale of some publications, but tracing them back to the printing process. They found some printing stores did not 'register the copy content as required' and demanded they fix the problem quickly. In Shaoyang, a city in China’s south, authorities said they will be 'cracking down on harmful publications in accordance with the law.' The Communist Party has various powers to control which books are available. Any publication without a China Standard Book Number is considered illegal, including self-published books and those imported without special licenses. Books can be banned even after they are published if restrictions are later tightened — often for unclear reasons — or if the writers say something upsetting to the Chinese authorities. Yet despite these restrictions and the crackdown on existing booksellers, more bookstores are opening. Recent figures are unavailable, but a survey by Bookdao, a media company that focuses on the book industry, shows more than twice as many bookstores opened than closed in China in 2020. Liu Suli, who has been running All Sages Books in Beijing for over three decades, says there are many idealists in the industry. 'Everyone who reads has a dream of having a bookstore,' Liu says, despite the challenges. In many cases, those dreams are being fulfilled outside China. Yu and other Chinese booksellers around the world stock their shelves with books from Hong Kong, Taiwan and mainland China, as well as books published locally. Zhang Jieping, founder of Nowhere, a bookstore in Taiwan and Thailand, said there's a growing demand for books from migrants who left China after the COVID-19 pandemic. 'They don’t just want to speak fluent English or Japanese to fit in, they want cultural autonomy,' Zhang said. 'They want more community spaces. Not necessarily a bookstore, but in any format — a gallery, or a restaurant.' Li Yijia is a 22-year-old student who arrived in Washington from Beijing in August. One Sunday morning, she wandered through JF Books where she found titles in Chinese and English. She said a Chinese bookstore feels like 'another world in a bubble' which helps her critical thinking by allowing her to read books in both languages. 'It also relieves homesickness, like a Chinese restaurant,' Li added. The closure of the bookstores leads the owners to different paths. Some ended up in jail, some went looking for jobs to feed their families. Some started a journey to leave censorship behind. Since he closed his Shanghai bookstore, Zhou, 39, has moved to Los Angeles, but hasn't decided what his next step will be. He said his fully licensed independent bookstore, which sold art books and self-published works by artists and translators, was fined thousands of dollars and he was interrogated over a dozen times during the past four years. He's seen colleagues jailed for selling 'illegal publications.' All the self-published book artists and editors he worked with asked him to take down their work after warnings by local authorities. Zhou said he could not handle further harassment. He said it was as if he were 'smuggling drugs instead of selling books.' The existence of his bookstore, Zhou said, was 'a rebellion and a resistance,' which is not there anymore.	https://www.voanews.com/a/as-china-cracks-down-on-bookstores-at-home-chinese-language-booksellers-flourish-overseas/7868426.html	2024-11-18T13:40:44-08:00	
8 killed as super typhoon strikes Philippines	MANILA — At least eight people were killed as Super Typhoon Man-Yi hit the Philippine archipelago over the weekend, unleashing fierce winds and strong rains that triggered landslides and storm surges, authorities said. Man-Yi, the sixth storm to hit the country in a span of one month, made landfall in the eastern province of Catanduanes on Saturday, but weakened as it moved across the main Luzon island and was later downgraded to a typhoon as it exited the landmass Monday. A family of seven, including an eight-year-old girl, died after a landslide in a northern provincial town in Nueva Vizcaya buried their home, the disaster office in the area said. In Daet town in Camarines Norte province, a 72-year-old man was killed in a vehicular accident caused by hanging cables due to the storm's strong winds, the provincial disaster office said. 'One casualty is one casualty too many. So, that is unfortunate,' President Ferdinand Marcos Jr. told reporters, referring to the death in Camarines Norte. 'We will now carry on with the rescue of those isolated areas and the continuing relief for those who have been displaced.' On average, about 20 tropical storms strike the Philippines each year, bringing heavy rain, strong winds, flooding, and landslides. Man-Yi is approaching Vietnam with maximum sustained winds of 110 kilometers per hour (68.4 mph) and gusts of up to 135 kph (84 mph). In rice-producing Nueva Ecija province in northern Luzon, farmlands and villages were flooded, worrying farmers such as Danilo Dagdagan due to the impact on crops and livelihood. 'The floodwater from the typhoon and the surrounding provinces gushed here because the elevation of the land here is lower,' Dagdagan told Reuters inside the living room of his flooded home. 'It makes our lives difficult, it's hard for us especially for those without sufficient food.' International aid has poured in to assist the Philippines in its relief operations, including from the U.S. Visiting U.S. Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin said he has authorized U.S. forces to provide direct support to respond to the super typhoon. 'We've also secured another million dollars in urgent humanitarian aid, and that will help surge aid to the Philippine people.' In October, Tropical Storm Trami and Typhoon Kong-rey triggered floods and landslides that killed 162 people, with 22 still missing, government figures show.	https://www.voanews.com/a/killed-as-super-typhoon-strikes-philippines/7868411.html	2024-11-18T13:18:32-08:00	
Ecuador declares national emergency as wildfires, drought intensify	quito, ecuador — Ecuador's government declared a 60-day national emergency due to raging forest fires made worse by severe drought conditions, the country's risk management secretariat announced in a statement Monday. Declaring a national emergency allows the government to free up funds to tackle the multi-faceted crisis, including wildfires in several provinces. The South American country faces 17 active wildfires and another five that have been controlled, the secretariat added. In the most affected provinces, Azuy and Loja, the flames have consumed more than 10,000 hectares. Eight firefighting helicopters were combating fires, the statement said. That includes at least three that were sent by Peru and Italy. One of the worst fires was in the Cajas National Park.The South American country has been rationing electricity due to the drought. The emergency decree comes as Ecuador struggles with an energy crisis that has led to power outages of up to 14 hours a day in recent months. Low water levels due to the drought have caused the reservoirs for the hydroelectric plants — that normally provide for 70% of national demand — to fall to critical levels, leaving the country to face an 'unprecedented crisis,' according to Ecuador's Energy Minister Ines Manzano.	https://www.voanews.com/a/ecuador-declares-national-emergency-as-wildfires-drought-intensify/7868413.html	2024-11-18T13:17:44-08:00	
Jury selection begins in human smuggling case after deaths of Indian family at Canada-US border	fergus falls, minnesota — Nearly three years after a couple from India and their two young children froze to death while trying to cross the border from Canada into the U.S., two men went on trial Monday on human smuggling charges, accused of being part of a criminal network that stretched around the world. Prosecutors say Indian national Harshkumar Ramanlal Patel, 29, ran part of the scheme and recruited Steve Shand, 50, of Florida, to shuttle migrants across the border. Both men have pleaded not guilty in federal court in Minnesota. They're standing trial before U.S. District Judge John Tunheim, with proceedings expected to last about five days. They each face four counts related to human smuggling. On January 19, 2022, Shand was allegedly waiting in a truck for 11 migrants, including the family of four from the village of Dingucha in Gujarat state. Prosecutors say 39-year-old Jagdish Patel; his wife, Vaishaliben, who was in her mid-30s; the couple's 11-year-old daughter, Vihangi; and 3-year-old son, Dharmik, died after spending hours wandering fields in blizzard conditions as the wind chill reached minus 36 degrees Fahrenheit (minus 38 Celsius). Prosecutors say when Jagdish Patel's body was found, he was holding Dharmik, who was wrapped in a blanket. Before jury selection began Monday morning, defense attorneys objected to prosecutors’ plan to show seven photos of the frozen bodies of Jagdish Patel and his family, including close-up images of the children. Shand's attorney, Aaron Morrison, said the heart-wrenching images could cause 'extreme prejudice to the jury' and asked for the photos to be removed as evidence. Prosecutors argued the photos were necessary to show the family was not adequately prepared by Shand and Harshkumar Patel for the frigid conditions. Tunheim allowed the images to remain evidence. Patel is a common Indian surname and the victims were not related to Harshkumar Patel. Federal prosecutors say Harshkumar Patel and Shand were part of an operation that scouted clients in India, got them Canadian student visas, arranged transportation and smuggled them into the U.S., mostly through Washington state or Minnesota. The U.S. Border Patrol arrested more than 14,000 Indians on the Canadian border in the year ending this Sept. 30. By 2022, the Pew Research Center estimates more than 725,000 Indians were living illegally in the U.S., behind only Mexicans and El Salvadorans. Harshkumar Patel’s attorney, Thomas Leinenweber, told The Associated Press that his client came to America to escape poverty and build a better life for himself and now 'stands unjustly accused of participating in this horrible crime. He has faith in the justice system of his adopted country and believes that the truth will come out at the trial.' Attorneys for Shand did not return messages. Court documents filed by prosecutors show Patel was in the U.S. illegally after being refused a U.S. visa at least five times, and that he recruited Shand at a casino near their homes in Deltona, Florida, just north of Orlando. Over a five-week period, court documents say, Patel and Shand often communicated about the bitter cold as they smuggled five groups of Indians over a quiet stretch of border. One night in December 2021, Shand messaged Patel that it was 'cold as hell' while waiting to pick up one group, the documents say. 'They going to be alive when they get here?' he allegedly wrote. During the last trip in January, Shand had messaged Patel, saying: 'Make sure everyone is dressed for the blizzard conditions, please,' according to prosecutors. Prosecutors say Shand told investigators that Patel paid him about $25,000 for the five trips. Jagdish Patel grew up in Dingucha. He and his family lived with his parents. The couple were schoolteachers, according to local news reports. Satveer Chaudhary is a Minneapolis-based immigration attorney who has helped migrants exploited by motel owners, many of them Gujaratis. He said smugglers and shady business interests promised many migrants an American dream that doesn’t exist when they arrive. 'The promises of the almighty dollar lead many people to take unwarranted risks with their own dignity, and as we’re finding out here, their own lives,' Chaudhary said.	https://www.voanews.com/a/jury-selection-begins-in-human-smuggling-case-after-deaths-of-indian-family-at-canada-us-border-/7868376.html	2024-11-18T12:59:33-08:00	
Biden seeks nearly $100 billion in emergency aid after Hurricanes Helene, Milton	WASHINGTON — President Joe Biden is requesting nearly $100 billion in emergency disaster aid after Hurricanes Helene and Milton, and other natural disasters, telling lawmakers that the money is 'urgently needed.' The letter Monday to House Speaker Mike Johnson comes as lawmakers meet during a lame-duck session to finish key priorities before making way for a new Congress and the incoming Trump administration. Biden said he has met firsthand with those harmed by the storms and he heard what residents and businesses needed from the federal government. 'Additional resources are critical to continue to support these communities,' Biden said. The largest share of the money, about $40 billion, would go to the main disaster relief fund at the Federal Emergency Management Agency. Biden said the fund would face a shortfall this budget year without additional money. He said that would not only affect the agency's ability to provide lifesaving assistance to survivors, but also would slow recovery efforts from prior disasters. An additional $24 billion would help farmers that have experienced crop or livestock losses, and $12 billion would go toward community development block grants administered by the Department of Housing and Urban Development. Some $8 billion more would help rebuild and repair highways and bridges in more than 40 states and territories. The administration is also seeking $4 billion for long-term water system upgrades to mitigate future damage from natural disasters. Several other agencies would also receive emergency funds if Congress agrees to the request. Lawmakers were expecting a hefty number from the administration. Johnson, a Republican from Louisiana, said Congress will evaluate the request and 'we'll make sure we deliver for the hurricane victims and the people that have suffered from that.' The Senate Appropriations Committee is expected to hear Wednesday from the heads of several of the government agencies that would receive funding through Biden's request. It's possible that emergency aid could be attached to any spending bill designed to keep federal agencies operating after current funding expires Dec. 20. Biden noted that Congress had provided more than $90 billion in aid after Hurricane Katrina nearly two decades ago, and more than $50 billion after Hurricane Sandy in 2013. He urged Congress to take 'immediate action.' 'Just as the Congress acted then, it is our sworn duty now to deliver the necessary resources to ensure that everyone in communities reeling from Hurricanes Helene and Milton — and those still recovering from previous disasters — have the Federal resources they need and deserve,' Biden wrote.	https://www.voanews.com/a/biden-seeks-nearly-100-billion-in-emergency-aid-after-hurricanes-helene-milton/7868385.html	2024-11-18T12:47:59-08:00	
Teenage Buddhist lama marks last birthday in US before joining monastery in Himalayas	ISANTI, Minn. — The young Buddhist lama sat on a throne near an altar decorated with flowers, fruits and golden statues of the Buddha, watching the celebrations of his 18th birthday in silence, with a faint smile. Jalue Dorje knew it would be the last big party before he joins a monastery in the Himalayan foothills -- thousands of kilometers from his home in a Minneapolis suburb, where he grew up like a typical American teen playing football and listening to rap music. But this was not an ordinary coming-of-age celebration. It was an enthronement ceremony for an aspiring spiritual leader who from an early age was recognized by the Dalai Lama and other Tibetan Buddhist leaders as a reincarnated lama. From the stage, he saw it all: The young women in white long bearded masks who danced, jumping acrobatically and twirling colorful sticks to wish him luck in a tradition reserved for dignitaries. The banging of drums. The procession of hundreds – from children to elderly -- who lined up to bow to him and present him with a 'khata' -- the white Tibetan ceremonial scarves that symbolize auspiciousness. From a throne reserved for lamas, he smelled the aroma of Tibetan dishes prepared by his mother over sleepless nights. He heard the monks with shaved heads, in maroon and gold robes like his own, chant sacred mantras. Behind them, his shaggy-haired high school football teammates sang 'Happy Birthday' before he cut the first slice of cake. One of his buddies gave him shaker bottles for hydrating during training at the gym; another, a gift card to eat at Chipotle Mexican Grill. 'I was in awe!' Dorje recalled later. 'Usually, I'd be at the monk section looking up to whomever was celebrating. But that night it was for me.' Watching Monday Night Football and memorizing ancient Buddhist prayers Since the Dalai Lama's recognition, Dorje has spent much of his life training to become a monk, memorizing sacred scriptures, practicing calligraphy and learning the teachings of Buddha. After graduation in 2025, he'll head to northern India to join the Mindrolling Monastery, more than 11,500 kilometers from his home in Columbia Heights. Following several years of contemplation and ascetism, he hopes to return to America to teach in the Minnesota Buddhist community. His goal is 'to become a leader of peace,' following the example of the Dalai Lama, Nelson Mandela and Gandhi. 'There's going to be a lot of sacrifice involved,' Dorje said. But he's not new to sacrifices. He remembered all the early mornings reciting ancient prayers and memorizing Buddhist scriptures, often rewarded by his dad with Pokémon cards. 'As a child, even on the weekend, you're like: 'Why don't I get to sleep more? Why can't I get up and watch cartoons like other kids.' But my dad always told me that it's like planting a seed,' he said, 'and one day it's going to sprout.' It all began with the process of identifying a lama, which is based on spiritual signs and visions. Dorje was about four months old when he was identified by Kyabje Trulshik Rinpoche, a venerated master of Tibetan Buddhism and leader of the Nyingma lineage. He was later confirmed by several lamas as the eighth Terchen Taksham Rinpoche — the first one was born in 1655. After the Dalai Lama recognized him at age 2, Dorje's parents took him to meet the spiritual leader of Tibetan Buddhism when he visited Wisconsin in 2010. The Dalai Lama cut a lock of Dorje's hair in a ceremony and advised his parents to let their son stay in the U.S. to perfect his English before sending him to a monastery. Dorje is fluent in English and Tibetan. He grew up reading the manga graphic novel series 'Buddha,' and is an avid sports fan. He roots for the Timberwolves in basketball, Real Madrid in soccer, and the Atlanta Falcons in football. He even keeps a rookie card of wide receiver Drake London pasted to the back of his phone, which he carried wrapped in his robes during his party. On the football field, playing as a left guard, his teammates praised his positivity, often reminding them to have fun and keep losses in perspective. 'It's someone to look up to,' said Griffin Hogg, 20, a former player who took Dorje under his wing. He said they learned from each other and credits Dorje with helping him find his spirituality. 'I'm more of a relaxed person after getting to know him and understanding his own journey.' While Dorje tries to never miss Monday Night Football, he's always there to help with any event hosted by the local Tibetan community, one of the largest in the United States. 'He has one foot in the normal high school life. And he has one foot in this amazing Tibetan culture that we have in the state of Minnesota,' said Kate Thomas, one of his tutors and the teachings coordinator at Minneapolis' Bodhicitta Sangha Heart of Enlightenment Institute. 'You can see that he's comfortable playing a role of sitting on a throne, of participating and being honored as a respected person in his community, as a religious figure. And yet, as soon as he has the opportunity, he wants to go and hang out with his high school buddies,' she said. 'That's testimony to his flexibility, his openness of mind.' Listening to rap and making Tibetans proud For years, he has followed the same routine. He wakes up to recite sacred texts and then attends school, followed by football practice. He returns home for tutoring about Tibetan history and Buddhism. Then he might practice calligraphy or run on a treadmill while listening to BossMan Dlow, Rod Wave and other rappers. Although he was officially enthroned in 2019 in India, an estimated 1,000 people gathered at the Tibetan American Foundation of Minnesota for his recent ceremony. 'He unites us – Jalue is always here for us,' said Zenden Ugen, 21, a family friend and neighbor who performed Tibetan dances at the event. 'I wish him the best in life because being born and not being able to choose your life must be very hard,' Ugen said. 'But he has a responsibility and him being able to take on that responsibility, I'm very inspired by him. I just hope he keeps being who he is.' Dorje's proud uncle, Tashi Lama, saw him grow up and become a Buddhist master. 'He's somebody who's going to be a leader, who's going to teach compassion and peace and love and harmony among living beings,' he said about his nephew, often referred to as 'Rinpoche' -- a Tibetan word that means 'precious one.'	https://www.voanews.com/a/teenage-buddhist-lama-celebrates-last-birthday-in-us-before-joining-monastery-in-himalayas/7868372.html	2024-11-18T12:47:06-08:00	
Cracks in G20 consensus over Ukraine as US ramps up aid	RIO DE JANEIRO — With just two months remaining in President Joe Biden’s administration, the U.S. is ramping up financial, military and diplomatic support for Kyiv’s effort to defend itself against Russian aggression. At the G20 summit in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil, where Biden and leaders of 20 of the world’s largest economies are meeting, U.S. officials are pushing for the 'strongest possible' language on Ukraine, deputy national security adviser John Finer told VOA during a briefing Monday. Western diplomats have renewed their push for stronger criticism on Moscow following Russia’s weekend airstrike, its largest on Ukrainian territory in months. They’ve also warned on increased Russian war efforts that could have a destabilizing effect beyond Europe. Earlier this month, the U.S. and Ukraine announced that North Korea has sent more than 10,000 troops to help Moscow reclaim territory seized by Ukraine in Russia’s Kursk region. The final joint leaders’ statement is still being negotiated but a draft seen by VOA and other versions circulating on social media suggest it will only include broad language underscoring U.N. principles and the need to respect peace in Ukraine and Gaza. Finer acknowledges that finding a consensus on global conflicts is elusive given the diversity of the G20. In addition to mostly like-minded countries of the G7, the G20 also includes Russia, China and nations of the Global South. 'We'll see where it lands,' he said. Ever since the G20 2022 summit in Bali, held months after Moscow’s invasion of Ukraine, the global grouping has faced challenges hammering out a response to the conflict. Long-range missiles authorized The U.S. is also authorizing Kyiv to use American-supplied long-range missiles to strike inside Russia and is surging U.S. military assistance to Kyiv, according to media reports quoting officials who spoke on condition of anonymity. Finer declined to confirm but said it is 'consistent' with the U.S. approach of tailoring its response to meet developments on the ground to 'allow the Ukrainians to continue to defend their territory and their sovereignty.' On Monday, Kremlin spokesperson Dmitry Peskov said that if true, authorization for Kyiv to strike inside Russia with U.S. long-range missiles, 'will mark a qualitatively new round of tensions and level of Washington's involvement in the Ukraine conflict.' Last week in Brussels, U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken sought to reassure European allies that Biden is 'committed to making sure that every dollar we have at our disposal will be pushed out the door between now and January 20,' the date of President-elect Donald Trump’s inauguration. Trump has been critical of using American taxpayer’s money to help Kyiv. Without providing details, Trump often boasts he can swiftly end the war, even before he takes office — a statement that many in Europe fear would mean forcing Ukraine to capitulate. Earlier this month, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy said he wants a 'just end' to the war and that a swift end 'means losses.' On Saturday he told Ukrainian public radio that under the Trump administration, 'the war will end faster.' 'This is their approach, the promise to their country,' he said. 'And for them, it is also very important.' Climate change, poverty alleviation G20 host Brazil has worked to keep the focus of talks away from global conflicts and more on issues raised at the ongoing U.N. conference on climate change in Azerbaijan, and on accelerating efforts to reduce global hunger and poverty — an initiative championed by summit host President Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva. Lula’s approach to resist pressures from the G7 and the rest of the G20 on Ukraine and Gaza reflects Brazil’s strategy of 'multi-alignment' in an increasingly fragmented global landscape, said Bruna Santos, director at the Wilson Center’s Brazil Institute. However, 'neutrality risks alienating all sides in an increasingly polarized world,' Santos told VOA. Aside from divisions on global conflicts, negotiators in Rio have been struggling to find consensus on shared language on climate financing, said diplomatic sources who spoke with VOA on condition of anonymity to discuss ongoing negotiations. Western nations have been pushing for China and wealthy Middle Eastern countries to join them in contributing to global funds for climate change mitigation — a proposal resisted by Brazil and other member countries of the Global South. Another Lula proposal, a 2% tax on the super-rich that Brazil says can potentially generate up to $250 billion per year to help the world’s poor, has also met new resistance. Argentinian right-wing President Javier Milei rejected the proposal after visiting Trump at his Florida residence, the first foreign leader to visit the president-elect.	https://www.voanews.com/a/cracks-in-g20-consensus-over-ukraine-as-us-ramps-up-aid/7868375.html	2024-11-18T12:25:30-08:00	
US sanctions group that builds illegal West Bank settlements, with close ties to Israeli government	Washington — The U.S. on Monday imposed sanctions on organizations and firms involved in illegal settlement development in the occupied West Bank, including a well-established decades-old group that has close ties with Israeli leadership. Treasury sanctioned Amana, the largest organization involved in illegal settlement development in the West Bank, and its subsidiary Binyanei Bar Amana Ltd. Already sanctioned by Britain and Canada, Amana is one of the major funders and supporters of unauthorized settlements in the Israeli-occupied West Bank. Peace Now, a settlement tracking group, says its assets are valued at around 600 million Israeli shekels, or about $160 million, and that it has a yearly budget stretching into tens of millions of shekels. Amana, which is based in the West Bank and has no known connection to the U.S. appliance maker, over the past few years has underwritten loans, signed contracts, bought equipment and funded infrastructure projects for new settlements, according to Peace Now. The settlements, small farming outposts, have become some of the primary drivers of violence and displacement of Palestinians living in the West Bank. Additionally, the State Department imposed diplomatic sanctions on Eyal Hari Yehuda Co., which provides construction logistics to sanctioned groups, as well as company owner Itamar Yehuda Levi. The co-founder of the already sanctioned nonprofit group Hashomer Yosh, Shabtai Koshlevsky, and Israeli citizen Zohar Sabah, who has perpetrated acts of violence on Palestinians, also were hit with sanctions. The penalties come as settlers in the territory celebrate the incoming Trump administration, believing it will likely take a more favorable approach to the settlements. During his first term, Trump took unprecedented steps to support Israel's territorial claims, including recognizing Jerusalem as its capital and moving the U.S. Embassy there, and recognizing Israel's annexation of the Golan Heights. Treasury's Deputy Secretary Wally Adeyemo said the U.S. 'remains committed to holding accountable those who seek to facilitate these destabilizing activities, which threaten the stability of the West Bank, Israel, and the wider region.' Among other things, the sanctions deny the people and firms access to any property or financial assets held in the U.S. and prevent U.S. companies and citizens from doing business with them. In February, President Joe Biden issued an executive order that targets Israeli settlers in the West Bank who have been accused of attacking Palestinians and Israeli peace activists in the occupied territory. That order is used to justify the financial penalties against the companies and men. In response, Texans for Israel, a Christian nonprofit, Israeli nonprofit Regavim and others in August sued the Biden administration in Amarillo, Texas, over its sanctions against Israeli extremists in the West Bank. Eitay Mack, a human rights lawyer who has spent years campaigning for the sanctions on violent West Bank settlers, said the sanctions on Amana were 'an earthquake for the settlement project and especially the shepherds farms.' He called on the U.S. to extend the sanctions now to firebrand Israeli Finance Minister Bezalel Smotrich and National Security Minister Itamar Ben-Gvir, also a far-right settler in Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's Cabinet. Amana's leadership has appeared at pro-settlement events alongside Cabinet members. Peace Now says the group's secretary-general, Zeev Hever, was greeted by Smotrich at a June conference where Smotrich laid out his plans for the West Bank. Violence against Palestinians and their displacement have only picked up since the Israel-Hamas war began on Oct. 7, 2023. Around 8,000 Palestinians have been displaced in the West Bank during that time and over 700 killed, according to the U.N. Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs and Palestinian health officials. The Associated Press previously reported that the sanctions measures have had minimal impact, instead emboldening settlers as attacks and land-grabs escalate, according to Palestinians in the West Bank, local rights groups and sanctioned Israelis who spoke to AP. Additionally, Smotrich has previously vowed to intervene on sanctioned settlers' behalf. Israel captured the West Bank along with east Jerusalem and the Gaza Strip in the 1967 Mideast war. The Palestinians want those territories for their hoped-for future state. Settlement growth and construction have been promoted by successive Israeli governments stretching back decades, but it has exploded under Netanyahu's far-right coalition, which has settlers in key Cabinet posts. There are now well over 100 settlements and 500,000 Israeli settlers sprawling across the territory from north to south — a reality, rights groups say, dimming any hopes for an eventual two-state solution. State Department spokesman Matthew Miller said 'we once again call on the Government of Israel to take action and hold accountable those responsible for or complicit in violence, forced displacement, and the dispossession of private land. The United States will continue to promote accountability for those who further destabilize conditions in the West Bank and support extremist violence in the region.'	https://www.voanews.com/a/us-sanctions-group-that-builds-illegal-west-bank-settlements-with-close-ties-to-israeli-government/7868246.html	2024-11-18T11:52:05-08:00	
Protesters in Georgia's capital set up tent camp, demand new elections	tbilisi, georgia — Demonstrators in Georgia's capital have set up tents on a central thoroughfare and vowed Monday to stay around the clock to demand new parliamentary elections in the country. The October 26 election kept the governing Georgian Dream party in power, but opponents say the vote was rigged with Russia's assistance. Many Georgians viewed the election as a referendum on the country's effort to join the European Union. Several large protests have been held since then. President Salome Zourabichvili, who has rejected the official results, declared on Monday that she would appeal the vote results to the Constitutional Court. Zourabichvili, who holds a mostly ceremonial position, has said Georgia has fallen victim to pressure from Moscow against joining the EU. Critics have accused Georgian Dream, established by Bidzina Ivanishvili, a shadowy billionaire who made his fortune in Russia, of becoming increasingly authoritarian and tilted toward Moscow. The party recently pushed through laws similar to those used by the Kremlin to crack down on freedom of speech and LGBTQ+ rights. On Sunday, demonstrators closed an avenue leading into the center of Tbilisi. Nika Melia, leader of Coalition for Change, one of the opposition groups, voiced hope that the protests around the clock will mark 'the beginning of the intense, strong protest movement that will finish with the fall of Ivanishvili's regime.' The EU suspended Georgia's membership application process indefinitely in June after the country's parliament passed a law requiring organizations that receive more than 20% of their funding from abroad to register as 'pursuing the interest of a foreign power,' similar to a Russian law used to discredit organizations critical of the government. The Central Election Commission said Georgian Dream won about 54% of the vote in October. Its leaders have rejected opposition claims of vote fraud. European election observers said the election took place in a 'divisive' atmosphere marked by instances of bribery, double voting and physical violence.	https://www.voanews.com/a/protesters-in-georgia-s-capital-set-up-tent-camp-demand-new-elections/7868259.html	2024-11-18T11:49:54-08:00

Poland urges polio vaccinations for children after virus detected in sewage in Warsaw	warsaw, poland — Poland's health authorities on Monday urged polio vaccinations for children after the virus was detected in Warsaw's sewage during regular tests this month. The state Main Sanitary Inspectorate in a statement said the presence of the virus does not necessarily mean people have been sick, but those who have not been vaccinated against polio could be at risk. The vaccinations are free in Poland for people under 19. New measures also include more intensive testing of Warsaw's sewage, renewing the vaccination stocks and updating the list of children still unvaccinated. Polio is most often spread by contact with waste from an infected person or, less frequently, through contaminated water or food. The polio virus mostly affects children under 5. Most people infected don't have symptoms, but in severe cases, polio can invade the nervous system and cause paralysis within hours, according to the World Health Organization. It estimates that 1 in 200 polio cases results in permanent paralysis, usually of the legs. Poland's inspectorate said about 86% of the country's 3-year-olds have been vaccinated against polio and that vaccinating at least 95% of children can prevent the spread of the virus. Poland has seen the rise of anti-vaccination movements among some parents, which has worried health officials. The statement said Poland's last case of polio was in 1984.	https://www.voanews.com/a/poland-urges-polio-vaccinations-for-children-after-virus-detected-in-sewage-in-warsaw/7868170.html	2024-11-18T11:08:55-08:00	
For Ukraine, US approval of long-range missiles marks strategic shift	Warsaw — Many in Ukraine see the Biden administration’s decision to allow Ukraine to use U.S.-supplied long-range missiles to strike targets inside Russian territory as a turning point in the war but welcome it with a mix of gratitude and frustration. 'Strikes are not made with words,' President Volodymyr Zelenskyy said in his nightly address. 'The missiles will speak for themselves.' His tone reflects the high stakes involved in this decision, which comes as Ukraine braces for intensified Russian offensives following the reported deployment of 12,000 North Korean troops to bolster Moscow’s efforts. Ukrainian officials and analysts see the U.S. authorization as a crucial move, allowing Ukraine to target key military installations in Russia, particularly in the Kursk region, where new threats are emerging. However, Andriy Zagorodnyuk, former Minister of Defense (2019–2020) and adviser to the government, said the delay in granting such permissions has cost Ukraine dearly. 'Ukraine has been asking for this for years, not months,' Zagorodnyuk told VOA. 'The administration’s fear of escalation led to an overcautious approach. This reactive, piecemeal strategy — responding to Russian provocations rather than implementing a comprehensive plan — has not brought us closer to resolving the war. Instead, it has allowed Russia to escalate further.' Critical stage The decision follows an escalation of Russian missile and drone attacks on Ukraine’s civilian infrastructure, yet the timing raises questions about the long-term strategy of Western allies. Mark Voyger, director of the master's program in Global Management at American University Kyiv, emphasized the operational and psychological importance of the decision. 'Operationally, these missiles can target Russian storage facilities, command centers, and even North Korean troops preparing for offensive actions,' Voyger explained. 'Better late than never, the time for inaction and ... psychological [self-constraint] due to some presumed fear of escalation is over.' Voyger highlighted the risks of delay. 'This decision should have been made earlier to save lives and give Ukraine a stronger hand on the battlefield. The reactive approach only emboldens Russia to escalate further.' Zagorodnyuk echoed these sentiments, warning that the U.S. policy of incremental aid has hindered Ukraine’s ability to gain the upper hand. 'This piecemeal strategy, like doing little steps, step by step, as a reaction [to] some escalation from Russia's side, is, first of all, escalatory itself. And secondly, [it] is not bringing us to any resolution of the war. Because we [are] essentially supporting Russia escalating the war.' Russian reaction Moscow condemned the U.S. decision as an escalation of U.S. involvement in the war and warned of serious consequences. 'If such a decision was really formulated and brought to the attention of the Kyiv regime, then, of course, this is a qualitatively new round of tension and a qualitatively new situation in terms of the involvement of the United States in this conflict,' Kremlin spokesperson Dmitry Peskov told Russian media. Russian state media have amplified narratives accusing the U.S. of directly fueling the conflict, potentially laying the groundwork for further rhetorical or military escalations. US leadership transition The approaching U.S. transfer of power adds another layer of uncertainty. There are fears in Kyiv that Washington’s critical support will be reversed, following President-elect Donald Trump’s campaign promises to end the war quickly with no clear outline of a strategy. 'Unlike [U.S. President Joe] Biden, Trump immediately announced his ultimate goal to stop the war. The question is — how is he going to do that?' Zagorodnyuk said. While Ukrainians would welcome an end to the war, 'some people suggest all kinds of concessions from Ukraine,' which he said, 'is not going to stop the war.' In a VOA interview, Voyger added that the Biden administration’s timing of this decision might reflect concerns about securing support for Ukraine before a potential political shift. 'If a new administration pulls back on military aid or restricts Ukraine’s ability to strike, it could significantly weaken Ukraine’s position on the battlefield and at the negotiating table,' he said. Stopping the war Both analysts agree that stopping the war needs a robust and proactive Western strategy. This includes providing Ukraine with sufficient long-range missiles, expanding the scope of permissible targets, and ensuring consistent support regardless of political changes in Washington. 'The West needs to empower Ukraine to not just defend itself, but to achieve the operational success that forces Russia to reconsider its aggression,' Voyger said. Zagorodnyuk agrees the only way to force Russian President Vladimir Putin into serious negotiations is to put him in a position where he risks losing not just on the battlefield but also his hold on power. 'The ideal situation for Ukraine would be that NATO allies, and first of all the United States, would provide us with the means to reach the effect [of] Putin [and Russia] losing its operations. 'Ukraine can successfully do a series of counteroffensive operations [that] would bring Putin to a situation where he would understand that unless he stops the war, he would be losing tremendously, and that would impact his regime and his power.'	https://www.voanews.com/a/for-ukraine-us-approval-of-long-range-missiles-marks-strategic-shift/7868197.html	2024-11-18T11:07:37-08:00

Kremlin says Biden's missile decision escalates tensions in war with Ukraine	The Kremlin accused U.S. President Joe Biden on Monday of escalating hostility over Moscow’s nearly three-year-long war on Ukraine with his marked policy shift to allow Kyiv to use Washington-supplied, long-range missiles to strike inside Russia. The decision by Biden, who is leaving office in two months, marks a 'new spiral of tensions and a qualitatively new situation from the point of view of the U.S.'s engagement in the conflict,' Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov said. Russian President Vladimir Putin did not comment publicly, but Peskov referred journalists to a Putin statement in September, in which he said allowing Ukraine to target Russia would significantly raise the stakes in the conflict. It would change 'the very nature of the conflict dramatically,' Putin said at the time. 'This will mean that NATO countries — the United States and European countries — are at war with Russia.' Peskov claimed that Western countries supplying long-range weapons also provide targeting services to Kyiv. 'This fundamentally changes the modality of their involvement in the conflict,' Peskov said. Until now, the United States had allowed Ukraine to deploy shorter-range American weapons, like the High Mobility Artillery Rocket Systems the U.S. donated in the first months of the war, to hit Russian targets over the border from Ukraine's Kharkiv region. The range of these rockets was around 80 kilometers, but the Biden decision will allow the use of Army Tactical Missile System, or ATACMS, rockets that can reach targets at a distance of up to about 300 kilometers. Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy had lobbied Washington for months to be allowed to use the longer-range rockets against military targets deep inside Russia, contending they were needed to hit rocket arsenals and other weaponry being stored by Russia before their use targeting Ukraine’s cities and electrical grids. Biden, until now, had resisted allowing use of the longer-range missiles for fear it would escalate the war and tensions with the U.S.-led NATO military alliance. But North Korea’s deployment of troops to fight alongside Moscow’s forces alarmed Washington. The U.S. says the new missiles could first be used against Russian and North Korean forces trying to retake the Kursk region in southern Russia, which Ukraine captured in a surprise attack in August and still holds. ATACMS are long-range guided missiles produced by U.S. aerospace and defense company Lockheed Martin. The missiles carry a 227-kilogram fragmentation warhead and are tough to intercept due to their high speed. The rockets are fitted with a specialized GPS and carry cluster munitions. When the clusters open in the air, hundreds of bomblets are released rather than a single warhead. Whether the Biden decision to supply the missiles -- and how many – remains in place when President-elect Donald Trump takes office January 20 is uncertain. Trump has expressed skepticism about continued U.S. support for Ukraine, declining during a September political debate to say that he wanted Ukraine to win the war. Trump has claimed he would broker an end to the war before he takes office but not said how he would accomplish that. The president-elect has not commented publicly on the Biden decision to supply Ukraine with the longer-range missiles, but his son, Donald Trump Jr., quickly criticized it. 'The Military Industrial Complex seems to want to make sure they get World War 3 going before my father has a chance to create peace and save lives,' he said on social media. Biden’s policy shift came as a Russian ballistic missile with cluster munitions on Sunday evening struck a residential area of Sumy, a city in northern Ukraine, killing 11 people, including two children, and injuring 84 others. On Monday, another Russian missile attack started fires in two apartment blocks in Odesa, in southern Ukraine. At least eight people were killed and 18 were injured, including a child, regional Gov. Oleh Kiper said. The Sumy attack on Sunday followed a massive Russian bombardment of Ukraine’s power infrastructure earlier in the day. Zelenskyy said Ukraine and its allies should focus on 'really forcing Russia to end the war.' 'Today marked one of the largest and most dangerous Russian attacks in the entire war - 210 drones and missiles launched simultaneously – including hypersonic and aeroballistic ones,' Zelenskyy said in his nightly address. Some information in this report came from The Associated Press and Agence France-Presse.	https://www.voanews.com/a/kremlin-says-biden-s-missile-decision-escalates-tensions-in-war-with-ukraine/7868041.html	2024-11-18T09:39:37-08:00	
Pro-democracy publisher Lai's trial to resume this week in Hong Kong	Washington — After a monthslong delay, the national security trial of pro-democracy publisher Jimmy Lai is due to resume Wednesday in Hong Kong amid continued calls for his immediate release. Founder of the now-shuttered Apple Daily newspaper, Lai has been held in solitary confinement since late 2020. His trial began in December 2023 and was initially estimated to last about 80 days. Lai, 76, is expected to take the stand for the first time once the trial restarts. Lai’s son Sebastien has been a staunch advocate for his father’s release. A top concern for Sebastien is the severe toll that years of solitary confinement have taken on his father. 'Given his age, given the fact that he is in the conditions that he’s in, there’s a danger to his life, and he could — it breaks my heart to say this — but he could pass away at any moment,' he told VOA in September. The trial, which rights groups have decried as bogus, has been adjourned since July. Lai, a British national, is standing trial on charges of collusion with foreign forces and sedition, which he rejects. The charges are widely viewed as politically motivated, but if convicted, Lai faces life in prison. Caoilfhionn Gallagher KC, head of Lai’s international legal team, said she expects the trial to continue into 2025. 'In any case, that would be very serious. But when you’re dealing with an elderly, diabetic prisoner, it’s a travesty,' Gallagher told VOA in September. Last week, the United Nations Working Group on Arbitrary Detention determined that Lai is unlawfully and arbitrarily detained in Hong Kong and has called for his immediate release. And in September, Lai’s international legal team made an urgent appeal to the United Nations special rapporteur on torture, alleging that Lai was being denied specialized medical care for diabetes. Last month, a Hong Kong government spokesperson rejected what they described as 'unreasonable smears' that Lai is not receiving adequate medical care and said Hong Kong is 'underpinned by the rule of law.' Hong Kong authorities have also previously denied that Lai’s trial is unfair. The journalist’s plight has come to symbolize the rapid deterioration of press freedom and the broader impact on civil liberties in Hong Kong following the implementation in 2020 of Beijing’s harsh national security law. Lai’s case resonates with many Hong Kongers, multiple rights experts told VOA, because the one-time billionaire had the means to flee Hong Kong and avoid prison, but he instead chose to stay and fight for freedom. 'He’s doing it for the spirit of freedom, for the city, for the future of Hong Kong people — not for himself at all,' Yaqiu Wang, China research director at Freedom House, told VOA. Although the United Kingdom has called for Lai’s release, the British government has faced criticism from rights groups and activists who say it isn’t doing enough to advocate on behalf of Lai. On Monday, British Prime Minister Keir Starmer raised concerns about Lai in a meeting with Chinese President Xi Jinping during the G20 Summit in Rio de Janeiro. 'We are concerned by reports of Jimmy Lai’s deterioration,' Starmer said at the beginning of the meeting. And earlier this month, British Foreign Secretary David Lammy met with Sebastien Lai. 'We will continue to press for his immediate release and for consular access,' Lammy said in a later statement about the senior Lai. Lai’s trial is set to resume one day after dozens of prominent Hong Kong pro-democracy activists are sentenced in the largest case under the national security law. On Tuesday, 45 activists are scheduled to be sentenced under the harsh law. The activists were among 47 people charged with conspiracy to commit subversion in 2021 for their involvement in an unofficial primary election to select opposition candidates. Although Lai’s trial appears to be far from over, Sebastien Lai says he tries to remain optimistic. 'I’m sure I’ll see my father again,' Sebastien said, 'and I won’t stop until he is free.'	https://www.voanews.com/a/pro-democracy-publisher-lai-s-trial-to-resume-this-week-in-hong-kong/7868035.html	2024-11-18T09:17:07-08:00

UK sanctions Iran Air and IRISL over military transfers to Russia	London — Britain on Monday imposed sanctions against Iran's national airline and shipping carrier, measures it said were taken in response to Iran's transfer of ballistic missiles to Russia. The state-owned Iran Air and Islamic Republic of Iran Shipping Lines (IRISL) will face an asset freeze for their role in supplying weapons to Russia for use on the battlefield against Ukraine, Britain said. 'Iran’s attempts to undermine global security are dangerous and unacceptable,' British Foreign Secretary David Lammy said. 'We reiterate our call on Iran to cease its support for Russia's illegal war in Ukraine.' The sanctions will further restrict Iran Air's direct commercial air services to and from the U.K. Britain also sanctioned the Russian cargo ship PORT OLYA-3 for its role in transporting military supplies to Russia, it said.	https://www.voanews.com/a/uk-sanctions-iran-air-and-irisl-over-military-transfers-to-russia-/7867818.html	2024-11-18T06:49:21-08:00

India's capital chokes as air pollution levels hit 50 times the safe limit	NEW DELHI — Authorities in India's capital shut schools, halted construction and banned non-essential trucks from entering the city on Monday after air pollution shot up to its worst level this season. Residents of New Delhi woke up to thick, toxic smog enveloping the city of some 33 million as the air quality became increasingly hazardous. It rose further into the severe category, according to SAFAR, the country's main environmental agency, which measures tiny particulate matter in the air that can enter deep into the lungs. The deadly haze covered monuments and high-rise buildings in the capital, with visibility so low that airlines warned of delays. In several areas of the city, pollution levels were more than 50 times higher than the World Health Organization's recommended safe limit. Forecasts say the poor air quality will continue into the week. Air pollution in northern India rises every year, particularly in winter, as farmers burn crop residue in agricultural areas. The burning coincides with colder temperatures, which trap the smoke in the air. The smoke is then blown into cities, where auto emissions add to the pollution. Emissions from industries and the burning of coal to produce electricity are also linked to the pollution, which has been steadily ticking up in recent weeks. Starting Monday, authorities began enforcing stage 4 of a graded response action plan, or GRAP 4, based on the severity of the air pollution. Earlier stages of the plan were already in place, and stage 4 includes stricter curbs. Classes for all grades except 10 and 12 will be held online and no trucks will be allowed to enter the city except for those carrying essential items. Some older, diesel guzzling vehicles have been banned inside the city, and all construction activities have been halted. Authorities also urged children, the elderly and others with chronic diseases or respiratory issues to avoid going outside as much as possible. Over the weekend, farmers in neighboring Uttar Pradesh state burned their fields, releasing plumes of gray smoke that winds likely carried into New Delhi and other nearby areas. Despite the poisonous air, many in the capital continued their usual routines, including morning walks in the city's beloved Lodhi Garden. 'Everyone has a sore throat,' said Sanjay Goel, a 51-year-old shopkeeper in New Delhi. 'They should ban crop residue burning ... it's just smoke everywhere.' The worsening air quality in the capital also sparked outrage from residents on social media. Many complained of headaches and hacking coughs, describing the city as 'apocalyptic' and a 'gas chamber.' Others urged officials to solve the public health crisis once and for all. Several studies have estimated more than a million Indians die each year from pollution-related diseases. Authorities have invoked similar measures in the past and have at times deployed water sprinklers and anti-smog guns in an attempt to control the haze. But critics say there needs to be a long-term solution that drastically reduces pollution itself, instead of actions that aim to mitigate the effects after it has already plagued the region.	https://www.voanews.com/a/india-s-capital-chokes-as-air-pollution-levels-hit-50-times-the-safe-limit-/7867692.html	2024-11-18T05:39:23-08:00	
Sudanese who escaped from war-torn Tuti island speak of hunger, disease	OMDURMAN, Sudan — Muhammad Awad and his family are among dozens who escaped Sudan's Tuti island earlier this year amid a siege by the Rapid Support Forces, finding refuge at a shelter after surviving for months on scant food and the risk of disease. The island in the middle of the Nile serves as a microcosm for the devastation unleashed by a war that began in April 2023. More than 61,000 people are estimated to have died in Khartoum state during the first 14 months of Sudan’s war, significantly more than previously recorded, according to a new report. Activists report that the RSF charged people large sums to evacuate them. 'There is no good food, and there's a lot of diseases, there is no sleep, no safety,' Awad said, holding one of his children at the shelter for displaced residents in Omdurman, an army-controlled refuge. The island is one of 14 places across Sudan at risk of famine, according to experts. Dengue fever has ravaged Tuti, a close-knit farming community. Sarah Siraj, a mother who left with her two children, said six or seven people were dying daily, and that she was only able to have her children treated for dengue, a mosquito-borne disease, once she reached Omdurman. Charity kitchens have been forced to close in Tuti and elsewhere in the capital Khartoum due to lack of funding and supplies, and high prices. Rabeea Abdel Gader, a nutrition guide, has been treating newly arrived families at a city shelter. 'We ask the mother about what they eat.... Sometimes the mother responds with her tears. She cannot reply because of their conditions,' she said. The RSF did not respond to a request for comment by Reuters.	https://www.voanews.com/a/sudanese-who-escaped-from-war-torn-tuti-island-speak-of-hunger-disease-/7867619.html	2024-11-18T04:32:08-08:00	
Chile's 'seed guardians' grow and protect forgotten food varieties	SAN VICENTE DE TAGUA TAGUA, Chile — An emerging group of farmers and growers in Chile, known as seed guardians, aim to protect the traditional crops of their ancestors, keeping them safe from industrial agriculture and genetic modification. The guardians collect, trade and plant hundreds of seeds to preserve forgotten varieties of tomatoes, corn and other vegetables that were historically farmed by the indigenous Mapuche people. One such guardian, Ana Yanez, said the varieties the guardians aim to save are dwindling due to changing environments or farmers opting for higher-yield varieties. 'We are rescuing the seeds and knowledge of our ancestors,' said Delfin Toro, another guardian. 'How they harvested, how they sowed, the dynamics of the moon, when to plant, when to harvest.' The guardians are finding clients at high-end restaurants. Pablo Caceres, a seed guardian and chef at Vik Winery's Pavilion restaurant in the Millahue Valley in central Chile, said he normally finds no more than five varieties of tomatoes at markets and fairs. 'This year we'll have 26 varieties of tomatoes and we think that there are more than 200,' Caceres said. This diversification could also help crops adapt to new terrain and areas affected by a changing climate. Ricardo Pertuze, an agronomist at the University of Chile, said new varieties are needed when climate change makes a crop's current location unsuitable. The genetic diversity the guardians are collecting are essential to find those varieties, Pertuze said. Wilson Hugo, an official at the U.N. Food and Agriculture Organization, said the trend of safeguarding traditional seeds exists in other nations such as India, China, sub-Saharan Africa, as well as in countries of the former Soviet Union. 'We have to congratulate them and support them and that's probably not enough,' Hugo said. 'We need more of them. We need to do more of this kind of work.'	https://www.voanews.com/a/chile-s-seed-guardians-grow-and-protect-forgotten-food-varieties-/7867602.html	2024-11-18T04:11:33-08:00	
Spirit Airlines files for bankruptcy as financial losses pile up and debt payments loom	Spirit Airlines said Monday that it has filed for bankruptcy protection and will attempt to reboot as it struggles to recover from the pandemic-caused swoon in travel and a failed attempt to sell the airline to JetBlue. Spirit, the biggest U.S. budget airline, has lost more than $2.5 billion since the start of 2020 and faces looming debt payments totaling more than $1 billion over the next year. Spirit said it expects to operate as normal as it works its way through a prearranged Chapter 11 bankruptcy process and that customers can continue to book and fly without interruption. Shares of Miramar, Florida-based Spirit dropped 25% on Friday, after The Wall Street Journal reported that the airline was discussing terms of a possible bankruptcy filing with its bondholders. It was just the latest in a series of blows that have sent the stock crashing down by 97% since late 2018 — when Spirit was still making money. CEO Ted Christie confirmed in August that Spirit was talking to advisers of its bondholders about the upcoming debt maturities. He called the discussions a priority, and said the airline was trying to get the best deal it could as quickly as possible. 'The chatter in the market about Spirit is notable, but we are not distracted,' he told investors during an earnings call. 'We are focused on refinancing our debt, improving our overall liquidity position, deploying our new reimagined product into the market, and growing our loyalty programs.' People are still flying on Spirit Airlines. They’re just not paying as much. In the first six months of this year, Spirit passengers flew 2% more than they did in the same period last year. However, they are paying 10% less per mile, and revenue per mile from fares is down nearly 20%, contributing to Spirit’s red ink. It’s not a new trend. Spirit failed to return to profitability when the coronavirus pandemic eased and travel rebounded. There are several reasons behind the slump. Spirit’s costs, especially for labor, have risen. The biggest U.S. airlines have snagged some of Spirit’s budget-conscious customers by offering their own brand of bare-bones tickets. And fares for U.S. leisure travel — Spirit’s core business — have sagged because of a glut of new flights. The premium end of the air-travel market has surged while Spirit’s traditional no-frills end has stagnated. So this summer, Spirit decided to sell bundled fares that include a bigger seat, priority boarding, free bags, internet service and snacks and drinks. That is a huge change from Spirit’s longtime strategy of luring customers with rock-bottom fares and forcing them to pay extra for things such as bringing a carry-on bag or ordering a soda. In a highly unusual move, Spirit plans to cut its October-through-December schedule by nearly 20%, compared with the same period last year, which analysts say should help prop up fares. But that will help rivals more than it will boost Spirit. Analysts from Deutsche Bank and Raymond James say that Frontier, JetBlue and Southwest would benefit the most because of their overlap with Spirit on many routes. Spirit has also been plagued by required repairs to Pratt & Whitney engines, which is forcing the airline to ground dozens of its Airbus jets. Spirit has cited the recall as it furloughed pilots. The aircraft fleet is relatively young, which has made Spirit an attractive takeover target. Frontier Airlines tried to merge with Spirit in 2022 but was outbid by JetBlue. However, the Justice Department sued to block the $3.8 billion deal, saying it would drive up prices for Spirit customers who depend on low fares, and a federal judge agreed in January. JetBlue and Spirit dropped their merger two months later. U.S. airline bankruptcies were common in the 1990s and 2000s, as airlines struggled with fierce competition, high labor costs and sudden spikes in the price of jet fuel. PanAm, TWA, Northwest, Continental, United and Delta were swept up. Some liquidated, while others used favorable laws to renegotiate debts such as aircraft leases and keep flying. The last bankruptcy by a major U.S. carrier ended when American Airlines emerged from Chapter 11 protection and simultaneously merged with US Airways in December 2013.	https://www.voanews.com/a/spirit-airlines-files-for-bankruptcy-as-financial-losses-pile-up-and-debt-payments-loom/7867592.html	2024-11-18T04:01:36-08:00	
South Africa's Ramaphosa calls for safe recovery of illegal miners stuck underground	JOHANNESBURG — South Africa's President Cyril Ramaphosa said on Monday lives should not be put at risk in a standoff between police and hundreds of illegal miners stuck underground in a disused mine shaft and the miners should be recovered safely. The police have blocked miners' supplies of food and water to force them out and arrest them for illegally entering the abandoned mine in North West province in search of leftover gold — an issue that has plagued South Africa for decades. More than 1,000 illegal miners have resurfaced in recent weeks but police said last week that hundreds could still be underground. Local residents and human rights groups have criticized authorities for blocking their supplies. In a weekly newsletter, Ramaphosa said the situation was precarious and could potentially turn volatile. 'The Stilfontein mine is a crime scene where the offense of illegal mining is being committed. It is standard police practice everywhere to secure a crime scene and to block off escape routes that enable criminals to evade arrest,' he said. Ramaphosa urged the police to respect the miners' rights and not put their lives at risk and said his government would work with the mining industry on the issue of illegal mining. 'The police will carry out their duties and responsibilities to bring the illegal miners to the surface safely,' he said. Illegal mining has thrived in South Africa through small-time pilfering and organized criminal networks, costing the economy billions of rands in lost income and royalties. It was unclear if those still in the mine were unwilling or unable to get out. Public broadcaster SABC said that volunteers had brought 12 miners to the surface since last Wednesday.	https://www.voanews.com/a/south-africa-s-ramaphosa-calls-for-safe-recovery-of-illegal-miners-stuck-underground-/7867584.html	2024-11-18T03:49:28-08:00	
Dutch minister: Chinese trade with Russia 'directly affecting' EU security	AMSTERDAM — The Netherlands' foreign minister, whose ministry oversees export restrictions on top computer chip equipment maker ASML, said on Monday that China-Russia trade was 'directly affecting' European security. NATO views China as a 'decisive enabler' of Russia in its war against Ukraine, given that Chinese firms are selling goods that end up as components in Russian weapons, including drones, Caspar Veldkamp said before a meeting with European Union foreign ministers in Brussels. 'I raised this twice with the Chinese Foreign Minister Wang Yi and I think as Europeans we should all do this, because this is something that China should be realizing: it is directly affecting European security,' Veldkamp said. In cooperation with the United States, the Dutch government has rolled out a series of progressively tighter export restrictions preventing ASML from shipping its most advanced technology to Chinese chipmakers. ASML dominates the market for lithography tools, which are essential for making the circuitry of computer chips. Despite the restrictions, China has still been the largest market for ASML and other top U.S. and Japanese equipment makers over the past year and a half, as Chinese firms expand capacity to make older chips not covered by restrictions, but still adequate for many military purposes. ASML tool sales to Chinese firms reached a record $2.94 billion in the third quarter, though the company forecasts a decline in 2025. Veldkamp said he would discuss what to do about Chinese support for Russia with other EU foreign ministers on Monday. 'We are discussing anything regarding foreign assistance to Russia in its war in Ukraine, be it Iran, be it North Korea, be it China,' he said.	https://www.voanews.com/a/dutch-minister-chinese-trade-with-russia-directly-affecting-eu-security/7867576.html	2024-11-18T03:38:43-08:00	
Beirut schools closed after deadly airstrikes	Beirut schools were closed Monday after six people — including the media relations chief for Iran-backed Hezbollah in Lebanon — were killed in airstrikes in the central part of the city a day earlier. The strikes prompted the education ministry to shut schools and higher education institutions in the Beirut area for two days. Hezbollah spokesperson Mohammad Afif was among four people killed in the Ras al-Nabaa district, Hezbollah and the Israeli military said. Israel has rarely hit senior Hezbollah personnel who do not have clear military roles, and its air strikes have mostly targeted Beirut's southern suburbs where the group has its heaviest presence, Reuters reported. Israel Defense Forces issued a statement about the 'precise, intelligence-based strike' that killed Afif. 'Since the beginning of the war, Afif wielded significant influence over Hezbollah's military operations. He was in contact with senior officials and directly involved in advancing and executing Hezbollah’s terrorist activities against Israel,' IDF said. 'Moreover, Afif directed Hezbollah operatives to gather footage from the field, to be used for Hezbollah's propaganda and psychological terror.' A second strike in central Beirut killed two people and wounded 22 in Mar Elias. 'Israeli warplanes launched a strike on the Mar Elias area,' the official National News Agency said of the densely packed district that also houses people displaced by the conflict. Eleven other people were killed in southern Lebanon Sunday, Agence France-Presse reported. Deaths in Gaza An Israeli strike in a tent sheltering displaced people in Gaza’s Khan Younis killed two children and their parents overnight, Palestinian officials said Monday. The dead children were aged 7 and 9, and a 10-year-old child was also wounded, Civil Defense officials said. On Sunday, Gaza's civil defense agency said 34 people were killed, including children, and dozens were missing after an Israeli air strike hit a five-story residential building in Beit Lahia. 'The chances of rescuing more wounded are decreasing because of the continuous shooting and artillery shelling,' civil defense spokesman Mahmud Bassal told AFP. The war in Gaza began with the Oct. 7, 2023, Hamas attack on southern Israel, during which the militants killed about 1,200 people and took 250 hostage. Hamas is still holding about 100 hostages, with a third of them believed to be dead. Israel’s counteroffensive has killed nearly 44,000 Palestinians, with women and children more than half the verified total, according to the Gaza health ministry. After months of rocket fire and airstrikes between Hezbollah and Israel, the fighting expanded in Lebanon mid-September. More than 3,200 Lebanese have been killed, most of them in the past six weeks. Both Hezbollah and Hamas have been designated as terrorist organizations by the United States.

Russian attack kills 11, injures 89	A Russian attack on Ukraine’s northeast city of Sumy killed 11 people and injured at least 89, Ukrainian officials said. 'Sunday evening for the city of Sumy became hell, a tragedy that Russia brought to our land,' military administrator Volodymyr Artyukh said in a post on the Telegram messaging channel. Sumy regional prosecutors said the attack damaged 90 apartments, 28 cars, two educational institutions and 13 buildings. The attack followed a massive Russian bombardment of Ukraine’s power infrastructure earlier in the day, as well as news reports that the United States granted clearance for Ukraine to use long-range U.S. weapons to hit military targets in Russia. Ukraine President Volodymyr Zelenskyy said the country and its allies should focus on 'really forcing Russia to end the war.' 'Today marked one of the largest and most dangerous Russian attacks in the entire war - 210 drones and missiles launched simultaneously – including hypersonic and aeroballistic ones,' Zelenskyy said in his nightly address. Zelenskyy has long been lobbying for permission to use the Army Tactical Missile System, known by its initials ATACMS, to hit targets inside Russia. He said in his address that negotiating with Russian President Vladimir Putin is not an effective strategy to end the war. 'This is the answer to all those who wanted to achieve something with Putin through conversations, phone calls, hugs – appeasement. Today, this ‘dove of peace’ sent us yet another barrage of ‘Kinzhal’ and ‘Kalibr’ missiles. That’s his diplomacy. His language is treachery,' Zelenskyy said. Long-range capabilities President Joe Biden authorized Ukraine to use U.S.-supplied missiles to strike deeper inside Russia, easing limitations on the longer range weapons as Russia deploys up to 12,000 North Korean troops to reinforce its war, according to a U.S. official and three other people familiar with the matter, the Associated Press reported. In recent weeks, Putin has positioned troops – including those from North Korea - along the northern border of Ukraine in a push to regain territory. Biden had been opposed to any escalation of the war in Ukraine, and Putin has said Moscow could provide long-range weapons for others to hit Western targets if NATO allies allow Ukraine to use their arms to attack Russian territory. But Zelenskyy has argued that the restriction on long-range weapons has hampered Ukraine’s defense against Russian attacks. Long-range capabilities, he said, are a key component of Ukraine’s victory plan. 'Today, there’s a lot of talk in the media about us receiving permission for respective actions. But strikes are not carried out with words. Such things are not announced. Missiles will speak for themselves,' Zelensky said. 'They certainly will.' Russia downs 59 drones Meanwhile, Russia shot down 59 Ukranian drones overnight, according to the Russian defense ministry. 'During the past night, attempts by the Kyiv regime to carry out terrorist UAV attacks against targets on the territory of the Russian Federation were thwarted,' the ministry said in a statement. The ministry said most of the drones were shot down across three regions bordering Ukraine: 45 in Bryansk, six in Kursk and three in Belgorod, Agence France-Presse reported. Three drones were intercepted in the region of Tula, south of the capital, while two others were downed over the Moscow region. Ukraine's air force said on Monday that it shot down eight out of 11 Russian drones during an overnight attack.

Philippines, United States sign military intelligence-sharing deal	Manila, Philippines — The Philippines and the United States signed on Monday a military intelligence-sharing deal in a further deepening of defense ties between the two nations facing common security challenges in the region. Visiting U.S. Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin signed the agreement with his Philippine counterpart, Gilberto Teodoro, at Manila's military headquarters where both officials also broke ground for a combined coordination center that will facilitate collaboration between their armed forces. Called the General Security of Military Information Agreement or GSOMIA, the pact allows both countries to share classified military information securely. 'Not only will this allow the Philippines access to higher capabilities and big-ticket items from the United States, it will also open opportunities to pursue similar agreements with like-minded nations,' said Philippines' defense ministry spokesperson Arsenio Andolong. Security engagements between the United States and the Philippines have deepened under President Joe Biden and his Philippine counterpart Ferdinand Marcos Jr., with both leaders keen to counter what they see as China's aggressive policies in the South China Sea and near Taiwan. The two countries have a mutual defense treaty dating back to 1951, which could be invoked if either side came under attack, including in the South China Sea. 'I want to start by underscoring our ironclad commitment to the Philippines,' Austin said during the groundbreaking ceremony for the coordination center. Austin said the coordination center should enable real-time information sharing between the two defense treaty allies and boost interoperability. ‘’It will be a place where our forces can work side by side to respond to regional challenges,' Austin said. The Philippines has expressed confidence the alliance will remain strong under incoming U.S. president-elect Donald Trump. Both the Philippines and the United States face increasingly aggressive actions from China in the South China Sea, a conduit for more than $3 trillion in annual ship-borne commerce, which it claims almost entirely as its own. In 2016, the Permanent Court of Arbitration in the Hague said China's claims had no legal basis, siding with the Philippines, which brought the case. But China has rejected the ruling, leading to a series of sea and air confrontations with the Philippines that have turned the highly strategic South China Sea into a potential flashpoint between Washington and Beijing. 'The United States' presence in the Indo Pacific region is essential for maintaining peace and stability in this region,' Teodoro said during the inauguration, echoing previous remarks made by Marcos.	https://www.voanews.com/a/philippines-united-states-sign-military-intelligence-sharing-deal/7867513.html	2024-11-18T01:08:17-08:00	
Plastic waste chokes Congo dam, causing widespread power cuts	BUKAVU, Democratic Republic of Congo — A tide of plastic waste flowing into a major hydroelectric dam in eastern Congo is causing regular power cuts in several major cities, creating a challenge that local authorities are trying to solve. The Ruzizi dam located at the south end of Lake Kivu, which borders Rwanda, supplies the city of Bukavu and others with electricity and the power outages are hurting local businesses. The problem is linked to the growing use of plastics coupled with a lack of waste collection in the region. Heavy rainfall causes waste to flow down from the mountainous terrain to the lake, where it collects and blocks the machinery. 'This waste effectively blocks the water. Water has difficulty entering the forced conduits to provide the pressure and speed required for the machines,' Ljovy Mulemangabo, provincial director of national power company SNEL, told Reuters. Each day cleaners attempt to extract the plastic bottles, jerry cans and other debris that causes the dam's machinery to shut down for hours. Despite their efforts, the plastic accumulates and causes outages. Didier Kabi, the provincial minister of environment and green economy, is among those working to find a solution. He told Reuters in an interview that requiring households to join a waste collection organization could help stop plastic from accumulating in the lake. 'This will enable us to see to what extent everyone needs to collect their own waste at household level,' he said. Surface-level cleaning isn't enough as the waste accumulates to a depth of 14 meters, with divers required to clean the river bed to prevent turbine blockages. Alex Mbilizi, a metalworker in Bukavu, said the lack of power was causing problems. 'Our bosses are pressing us because of delays in completing their orders, and we don't know what to do,' he said.	https://www.voanews.com/a/plastic-waste-chokes-congo-dam-causing-widespread-power-cuts/7867505.html	2024-11-18T00:51:10-08:00

UK to put Sudan resolution to vote by UN Security Council	LONDON — Britain will seek backing from other United Nations Security Council members on Monday for its demand that Sudan's warring parties stop hostilities and allow deliveries of aid, the British foreign ministry said. With London holding the rotating presidency of the council, British foreign minister David Lammy is due to chair a vote on a UK/Sierra Leone-proposed draft resolution, which also calls for the protection of civilians. Lammy will say 'the UK will never let Sudan be forgotten' and announce a doubling of Britain's aid to $285 million, according to a statement from his ministry. A power struggle between the Sudanese army and the paramilitary Rapid Support Forces broke out in April 2023 ahead of a planned transition to civilian rule, killing thousands and triggering the world's largest displacement crisis. The ministry said Lammy would also criticize restrictions by Israel on humanitarian aid in Gaza and call for an immediate ceasefire along with the release of all hostages. On the war in Ukraine, he was due to say that Britain 'will keep standing with Ukraine until reality dawns in Moscow.' He was due to speak to media with Ukrainian Foreign Minister Andrii Sybiha.	https://www.voanews.com/a/uk-to-put-sudan-resolution-to-vote-by-un-security-council/7867450.html	2024-11-17T20:07:48-08:00	
World Bank helps Malawi’s poorest tackle climate shocks	The World Bank is helping Malawi's vulnerable communities address the impact of the climate-related disasters, such as cyclones and drought, that the country has been facing since 2022.

2 killed, 10 wounded in shootings near New Orleans parade route	NEW ORLEANS — Two people were killed and 10 others were wounded in two separate shootings along a New Orleans parade route and celebration attended by thousands on Sunday, authorities said. There were no immediate arrests. Officers responding to reports of gunfire shortly after 3:30 p.m. on an avenue in the city's St. Roch neighborhood found eight victims with gunshot wounds, according to a news release from the New Orleans Police Department. All eight were taken to hospitals in unknown condition. Police later said a ninth wounded person arrived at a hospital via a private car. About 45 minutes later, police received another report of gunfire as revelers were crossing the Almonaster Avenue Bridge, just over .8 km to the north. One person died at the scene and another died at a hospital, police said. A third victim was driven to a hospital in a private vehicle and is in stable condition, police said. No arrests were announced and no suspect information was released. The St. Roch neighborhood is outside the city's French Quarter that is popular with tourists, located several blocks northeast of the quarter. Thousands had gathered for the annual outing of the Nine Times Social Aid & Pleasure Club in the 9th Ward, organizer Oscar Brown told NOLA.com. 'It is a wonderful event, and we want to keep it a wonderful event,' Kirkpatrick said. The Almonaster Bridge was closed in both directions during the investigation. Police Superintendent Anne Kirkpatrick said detectives didn't immediately know if the incidents were related. 'They were ... different kinds of approaches,' she said of the shootings, which occurred in the area where a 'second line,' a celebration following a parade, was taking place. It was the second major shooting in the South since gunfire marred a homecoming weekend at Tuskegee University in Alabama on Nov. 10, leaving one person dead and injuring 16 others, a dozen of them by gunfire, authorities said.	https://www.voanews.com/a/killed-10-wounded-in-shootings-near-new-orleans-parade-route/7867440.html	2024-11-17T19:11:12-08:00	
Gabon votes yes on new constitution a year after the military seized power	LIBREVILLE, Gabon — Voters in Gabon overwhelmingly approved a new constitution, authorities said Sunday, more than one year after mutinous soldiers overthrew the country's longtime president and seized power in the oil-rich Central African nation. Over 91% of voters approved the new constitution in a referendum held on Saturday, Gabon's Interior Minister Hermann Immongault said in a statement read on state television. Turnout was an estimated 53.5%, he added. The final results will be announced by the Constitutional Court, the interior minister said. The draft constitution, which proposes sweeping changes that could prevent dynastic rule and transfer of power, needed more than 50% of the votes cast to be adopted. In 2023, soldiers toppled President Ali Bongo Ondimba and put him under house arrest, accusing him of irresponsible governance and massive embezzlement that risked leading the country into chaos. The junta released Ondimba a week later on humanitarian grounds, allowing him travel abroad for medical treatment. The soldiers proclaimed their Republican Guard chief, Gen. Brice Clotaire Oligui Nguema, as president of a transitional committee to lead the country. Oligui is a cousin of Bongo. Bongo had served two terms since coming to power in 2009 after the death of his father, who ruled the country for 41 years. His rule was marked by widespread discontent with his reign. A coup attempt in 2019 failed. The draft constitution imposes a seven-year term, renewable only once, instead of the current charter that allows for five-year terms renewable without limit. It also says family members cannot succeed a president and abolishes the position of prime minister. The former French colony is a member of OPEC, but its oil wealth is concentrated in the hands of a few — and nearly 40% of Gabonese aged 15 to 24 were out of work in 2020, according to the World Bank. Its oil export revenue was $6 billion in 2022, according to the U.S. Energy Information Administration.	https://www.voanews.com/a/gabon-votes-yes-on-new-constitution-a-year-after-the-military-seized-power/7867404.html	2024-11-17T16:54:43-08:00	
More logging is proposed to help curb wildfires in the US Pacific Northwest	U.S. officials would allow increased logging on federal lands across the Pacific Northwest in the name of fighting wildfires and boosting rural economies under proposed changes to a sweeping forest management plan that's been in place for three decades. The U.S. Forest Service proposal, released Friday, would overhaul the Northwest Forest Plan that governs about 99,000 square kilometers in Oregon, Washington and California. The plan was adopted in 1994 under President Bill Clinton amid pressure to curb destructive logging practices that resulted in widespread clearcuts and destroyed habitat used by spotted owls. Timber harvests dropped dramatically in subsequent years, spurring political backlash. But federal officials now say worsening wildfires due to climate change mean forests must be more actively managed to increase their resiliency. Increased logging also would provide a more predictable supply of trees for timber companies, officials said, helping rural economies that have suffered after lumber mills shut down and forestry jobs disappeared. The proposal could increase annual timber harvests by at least 33% and potentially more than 200%, according to a draft environmental study. The number of timber-related jobs would increase accordingly. Harvest volumes from the 17 national forests covered by the Northwest Forest Plan averaged about 445 million board feet annually over the past decade, according to government figures. Cutting more trees would help reduce wildfire risk and make communities safer, the study concluded. That would be accomplished in part by allowing cuts in some areas with stands of trees up to 120 years old — up from the current age threshold of 80 years. The change could help foster conditions conducive to growing larger, old growth trees that are more resistant to fire, by removing younger trees, officials said. A separate pending proposal from President Joe Biden's administration aims to increase protections nationwide for old growth trees, which play a significant role in storing climate change-inducing carbon dioxide. 'Much has changed in society and science since the Northwest Forest Plan was created,' Jacque Buchanan, regional forester for the Forest Service's Pacific Northwest Region, said in a statement. He said the proposal would help the agency adapt to shifting conditions, as global warming increases the frequency of droughts and other extreme weather events. The proposed plan also calls for closer cooperation between the Forest Service and Native American tribes to tap into tribal knowledge about forest management. Tribes were excluded when the 1994 plan was crafted. Environmentalists greeted the proposal with skepticism. The group Oregon Wild said it was 'deeply troubling' that the Forest Service would release the proposal just ahead of a change in presidential administrations. 'It appears that the Forest Service wants to abandon the fundamental purpose of the Northwest Forest Plan–protecting fish and wildlife and the mature and old-growth forests they need to survive,' John Persell, an attorney for the group, said in a statement. During former President Donald Trump's first term, administration officials sought to open millions of acres of West Coast forest to new logging by stripping habitat protections for the imperiled spotted owl. The move was opposed by government biologists and reversed under Biden. A draft environmental study examined several potential alternatives, including leaving the existing plan's components in place or changing them to either reduce or increase logging. A timber industry representative who co-chaired an advisory committee on the Northwest Forest Plan said the proposed plan resulted from discussions involving committee members, the Forest Service and others. 'We want to see a modern approach to federal forest stewardship that protects us from catastrophic wildfires, reduces toxic smoke, meaningfully engages tribes, and delivers for our rural communities and workers,' said Travis Joseph, president of the American Forest Resource Council. The publishing of the proposal begins a 120-day public comment period. The Forest Service's environmental review is expected to be completed by next fall and a final decision is due in early 2026.	https://www.voanews.com/a/more-logging-is-proposed-to-help-curb-wildfires-in-the-us-pacific-northwest/7867400.html	2024-11-17T16:47:21-08:00	
Union workers picket for 3rd day at Las Vegas casino with no talks slated	Las Vegas, Nevada — Picketing continued Sunday outside a hotel-casino near the Las Vegas Strip that remained open with no talks scheduled between management and union members striking for a new contract. Workers are seeking a pay raise and benefits comparable to pacts reached last year at other resorts. The walkout by the Culinary Workers Union laborers at Virgin Hotels Las Vegas comes a week before the second annual Las Vegas Grand Prix is due to draw hundreds of thousands of fans for Formula 1 racing on the Strip and nearby streets. It's the first open-ended strike since 2002 for the largest labor union in Nevada, which has about 60,000 members. No new negotiations were scheduled, said union spokesperson Bethany Khan and Terri Maruca, media representative for Virgin Hotels, owner of the 1,500-room property. Maruca said the company has fielded applications from more than 600 prospective contract and temporary workers since Friday. The union pays striking workers $500 per week for at least five days for picketing shifts. Guest room attendants, cocktail and food servers, porters, bellmen, cooks, bartenders and laundry workers are among those carrying picket signs at the property, where workers also staged a 48-hour job action last May to call for Virgin Hotels to agree to a new five-year deal with expanded benefits and increased wages. Other casinos on and off the Strip reached deadline agreements with the union just before the Formula 1 race a year ago, with contracts containing salary increases of about 32% over five years for tens of thousands of workers at properties including the Bellagio, Paris Las Vegas, MGM Grand and Caesars Palace. In a statement on Sunday, Virgin Hotels called those contracts 'economically unsustainable' and said it wants a 'reasonable agreement' for its 1,710 employees. It has accused union leaders of refusing to engage in 'meaningful negotiations.' Culinary Union members last went on strike in 2002 for 10 days at the Golden Gate hotel-casino in downtown Las Vegas.	https://www.voanews.com/a/union-workers-picket-for-3rd-day-at-las-vegas-casino-with-no-talks-slated/7867399.html	2024-11-17T16:46:29-08:00	
Wildfire threat continues in much of US Northeast as dry conditions persist	Firefighters in New York said Sunday that a voluntary evacuation overnight helped them protect more than 160 homes from a stubborn wildfire near the New Jersey border as officials in much of the Northeast coped with hundreds of brush fires in tinder-dry and windy conditions. Communities in New England dealt with a similar surge in late fall fires, and many parts of the Northeast remained under red flag alerts this weekend. Across the country, California made good progress against a 83-square-kilometer fire in Ventura County that has destroyed more than 245 structures, most of them houses. The Mountain fire was 95% contained. Windy conditions renewed a wildfire Saturday that escaped a containment line and prompted emergency officials to enact the voluntary evacuation plan affecting about 165 houses in Warwick, New York, near the New Jersey border. No structures were in danger as of Sunday afternoon as firefighters worked to tame the Jennings Creek blaze, New York Parks Department spokesman Jeff Wernick said. The voluntary evacuation will remain in place at least until Monday, Wernick said. The wildfire had burned close to 20 square kilometers across the two states as of Friday and was burning primarily in New York's Sterling Forest State Park, where the visitor center, the lakefront area at Greenwood Lake and a historic furnace area remained open. Woodland activities including hunting were halted, Wernick said. It was 90% contained on the Passaic County, New Jersey, side of the border, and about 88% contained in Orange County, New York, where a state of emergency was extended on Sunday, officials said. New York Army National Guard and state police helicopters dropped water on the blaze to support ground crews' efforts. 'Residents in the voluntary evacuation area are asked to continue sheltering so that crews can effectively suppress the fire,' according to a statement posted on Facebook by village officials in Greenwood Lake, New York, where schools will be closed on Monday. 'There is currently no threat to structures but crews are actively working to ensure structure protection.' The blaze claimed the life of an 18-year-old New York parks employee who died when a tree fell on him as he helped fight the fire in Sterling Forest on Nov. 9. The fire's cause remains under investigation. New York City's Fire Department is creating its first-ever brush fire task force to respond to what officials say is a historic increase in brush fires throughout the city's five boroughs, Commissioner Robert S. Tucker announced Sunday. From Nov. 1 to Nov. 14, the FDNY responded to 271 brush fires, marking the highest two-week period in New York's history. The task force will be made up of fire marshals, fire inspectors and tactical drone units in an effort to ensure rapid responses to brush fires and to help with investigations to determine their cause. 'Due to a significant lack of rainfall, the threat of fast-spreading brush fires fueled by dry vegetation and windy conditions have resulted in an historic increase of brush fires throughout New York City,' Tucker said in a statement. In Massachusetts, which typically has about 15 wildland fires every October, there have been about 200 this year. State officials said more fires were expected because of weather conditions and dry surface fuels. The National Weather Service in Boston warned Sunday that elevated fire risk continued across southern New England, given gusty winds and dry conditions. In Connecticut, a portion of Interstate 84 in Plainville was closed briefly Sunday because of a brush fire. A volunteer firefighter in Haddam, Connecticut, was injured Saturday while fighting a fast-spreading brush fire sparked by downed power lines. The firefighter was treated at a hospital and released, according to a Facebook post by the Haddam Volunteer Fire Company. Much-needed rain was predicted for Thursday in the region. In southern New Hampshire, the fire danger risk was 'very high,' state officials said. The Maine Forest Service said the southern part of the state also faced high fire danger. Most of the state was abnormally dry or facing moderate drought conditions. Some relief could be in sight in New York. The National Weather Service in Albany said Sunday that most of the region could see a 'widespread soaking rain' of 0.5 to 1.5 inches beginning Wednesday night.	https://www.voanews.com/a/wildfire-threat-continues-in-much-of-us-northeast-as-dry-conditions-persist/7867395.html	2024-11-17T16:38:16-08:00

In heart of Amazon, US President Joe Biden marks climate 'legacy'	Rio de Janeiro — U.S. President Joe Biden began a historic Brazil trip Sunday, becoming the first sitting American president to visit the Amazon rainforest to mark what the White House calls his 'legacy' on fighting climate change, couching it in economic terms of the race between countries in 'harnessing the clean energy revolution.' Biden landed in Manaus, capital of the state of Amazonas, doorway to the world's largest jungle. Biden announced that under his administration, the United States has surpassed the goal of providing $11 billion per year in international climate financing in 2024 -- a key component in the fight against climate change lobbied by countries of the Global South. 'The fight to protect our planet is literally a fight for humanity for generations to come. It may be the only existential threat to all our nations and to all humanity,' Biden said. The remarks were delivered amid the backdrop of lush green vegetation at a nature reserve and 'living museum' in Manaus that celebrates the Amazon rainforest and its biodiversity. During his brief Manaus visit -- sandwiched between the Asia Pacific Economic Forum meeting in Lima, Peru, and the summit of the 20 largest economies, the G20, in Rio de Janeiro -- Biden announced U.S. investments in several climate initiatives, including $50 million for the Amazon Fund. He met with Indigenous leaders and toured the Amazon jungle via helicopter. During the flight, Biden saw the confluence of the Rio Negro and the Amazon River, and the ravages of shore erosion and fire damage to the jungle, according to the White House. The majority of fires in the Amazon are linked to deforestation. In the past four years, the administration has 'created a bold new playbook that has turned tackling the climate crisis into an enormous economic opportunity – both at home and abroad,' the White House said. Scaling back climate efforts Several diplomatic sources at APEC and the G20, who spoke with VOA under condition of anonymity to discuss a diplomatically sensitive matter, expressed concern that U.S. efforts will be dramatically scaled back under the incoming administration. President-elect Donald Trump will be inaugurated in January. During his earlier administration, Trump sent shockwaves among climate activists when he withdrew the U.S. from the Paris Climate Accord, the world’s main multilateral forum to mitigate climate change. He has repeatedly called climate change a 'hoax.' Acknowledging the two months he has left in office, Biden said he is leaving his successor and the country a 'strong foundation to build on, if they choose to do so.' 'It's true, some may seek to want to deny or delay the clean energy revolution that's under way in America, but nobody, nobody can reverse it,' Biden said, underscoring that the push toward clean energy has bipartisan support and that other countries are harnessing it for their economic progress. 'The question now is, which government will stand in the way, and which will seize the enormous economic opportunity,' he said, in what may be a reference to the future of U.S.-China rivalry on clean energy under his successor. Biden’s remarks came a day after a meeting in Lima with Chinese President Xi Jinping, likely their last meeting while Biden is in office. China is currently the world's leader in electric vehicles, or EVs, accounting for more than half of global production and exports. Trump, meanwhile, is reportedly trying to roll back the $7,500 EV purchase tax credit for American consumers, part of the Inflation Reduction Act of 2022, Biden’s signature legislation on clean energy and climate change. Celso Amorim, chief adviser to the president of the Federal Republic of Brazil, said he will not prejudge the incoming Trump administration. 'I judge actions, so we’ll see later how these actions evolve,' he told VOA Saturday, ahead of the G20 summit that Brazil is hosting. 'For now, Biden has been a good partner for Brazil, for President [Luis Inacio] Lula [da Silva].' Beginning Monday in Rio, Biden will focus on workers’ rights and clean economic growth and attend the launch of the Global Alliance Against Hunger and Poverty. It is Lula’s initiative aimed at accelerating global efforts in the fight against hunger and poverty by 2030. Asked about Biden’s message to world leaders concerned about the durability of U.S. commitments on various issues, including climate change and poverty reduction, White House press secretary Karine Jean-Pierre said Biden is 'focusing on the moment' and continuing progress achieved in the past four years for the remainder of his term. A senior administration official briefing reporters after Biden’s Amazon visit left open the possibility that the incoming administration may continue the fight against climate change. 'Maybe he'll come down here and see the forest and see the damage being done from the drought and other things and change his mind about climate change,' the official said, referring to Trump.	https://www.voanews.com/a/in-heart-of-amazon-us-president-joe-biden-marks-climate-legacy/7867145.html	2024-11-17T15:57:46-08:00	
Two Trump Cabinet nominees embroiled in sex controversies	Two of U.S. President-elect Donald Trump’s key nominations – Fox News host Pete Hegseth for defense secretary and former lawmaker Matt Gaetz as attorney general -- have become embroiled in sex controversies that could threaten their Senate confirmations to serve in Trump’s Cabinet. Hegseth, 44, paid an undisclosed amount to a woman who accused him of sexual assault in 2017 to avert the threat of what he viewed as a baseless claim becoming public, his lawyer, Tim Parlatore, told U.S. news media this weekend. Gaetz, 42, resigned abruptly last week from the House of Representatives near the end of his fourth two-year term, just days before the House Ethics Committee was nearing conclusion of an investigation into whether he had had sex with a 17-year-old girl and engaged in illicit drug use. Some lawmakers have described Gaetz showing nude cellphone pictures of his sexual conquests in the House chamber. Gaetz has denied the allegations and federal authorities had earlier this year decided not to bring charges. Hegseth’s lawyer, Parlatore, described Hegseth’s hotel sexual encounter with the woman after a Republican women’s event in Monterey, California, in 2017 as consensual. Local police, after an investigation, did not file any charges. Parlatore told The Washington Post that Hegseth settled the woman’s claim a few years later because he believed the filing of her threatened lawsuit 'would result in his immediate termination from Fox,' where he was the popular host of a weekend talk show. 'He was falsely accused, and my position is that he was the victim of blackmail,' Parlatore told The Associated Press, calling it a case of 'successful extortion.' The woman’s name has not been made public, and U.S. news media do not usually disclose the names of alleged sexual assault victims without their consent. Parlatore’s statements to news outlets came after a woman who said she is a friend of the accuser sent a detailed memo to the Trump transition several days ago detailing the Hegseth incident with his accuser. The accuser alleged that Hegseth had raped her after drinking at a hotel bar. Trump so far has stood by Hegseth, an unconventional selection as the Pentagon chief. Some Democratic and Republican lawmakers have raised concerns about Hegseth’s lack of a managerial background, either at the Defense Department or at a business. The Pentagon chief would oversee more than 2 million U.S. troops and a civilian work force of nearly 800,000 people. In addition, some critics have raised concerns about a large tattoo on Hegseth’s upper right chest, which he characterizes as a Christian symbol, a 'Jerusalem cross,' but what his critics say is a white nationalist symbol. Hegseth told one interviewer that he was removed by superiors from a National Guard detail handling security for President Joe Biden’s inauguration in 2021 for fear that he was 'an extremist' because of the tattoo. When the allegations against Hegseth first emerged, Trump spokesman Steven Cheung contended that Hegseth 'has vigorously denied any and all accusations. We look forward to his confirmation as United States Secretary of Defense so he can get started on Day One to Make America Safe and Great Again.' Even though voters in his Florida district had just reelected him to a fifth term, Gaetz resigned from his office Wednesday, ending the investigation. Several U.S. senators, Republicans and Democrats alike, are seeking access to the House Ethics Committee findings in the Gaetz investigation as they carry out their constitutionally mandated 'advice and consent' role in reviewing Cabinet nominees made by an incoming president. House Speaker Mike Johnson, the leader of the narrow Republican majority in the chamber, is balking at the release of what he told CNN’s 'State of the Union' show was a report in 'rough draft form.' Johnson contended that no ethics report should be made public because Gaetz is no longer a member of Congress, although there have been instances where that has occurred in the past. He said senators reviewing the Gaetz nomination as the country’s top law enforcement official will 'have a vigorous review and vetting process' but that they did not need to see the House Ethics Committee’s report. Some senators have suggested they could move to subpoena it if it is not turned over to them voluntarily. Trump has also stood by Gaetz’s nomination, but the president-elect also has sought – with little success so far – to get the Senate, in Republican control come January when he takes office, to agree to recess at times so he can name and install his Cabinet members without the need for contentious and time-consuming confirmation hearings.	https://www.voanews.com/a/two-trump-cabinet-nominees-embroiled-in-sex-controversies/7867143.html	2024-11-17T15:46:16-08:00	
Russia grinds deeper into Ukraine as grueling war nears 1,000 days	Kyiv, Ukraine — When Russian tanks rolled into Ukraine in February 2022, the conventional wisdom was that the capital, Kyiv, would soon fall and the rest of the country wouldn’t last long against a much larger enemy. Instead, it was that narrative that quickly collapsed. The Ukrainian army proved it could slow the advance of Russia’s forces and, if not drive them out completely, then – with enough support from the West – at least forestall defeat. But nearly three years later, the outlook is again grim. Russia is expending huge amounts of weaponry and human life to make small-but-steady territorial gains to the nearly one-fifth of Ukraine it already controls. Ukraine, meanwhile, is struggling to minimize losses, maintain morale and convince allies that, with more military aid, it can turn the tide. As this brutal war of attrition grinds toward its 1,000th day, neither side seems eager to negotiate. President-elect Donald Trump has said he could quickly end the war, although it is unclear how or in whose favor he might tip the scales. This backdrop appears to be driving Russia’s strategy in eastern Ukraine, according to Phillips O’Brien, a professor of strategic studies at the University of St. Andrews, Scotland. Trump could try to force an end to the war by halting the supply of weapons to Ukraine, he said. 'If Trump cuts aid to Ukraine and a cease-fire leads to a frozen conflict, Russia wants to secure as much territory as it can now,' O’Brien said. For Ukraine, the key to any cease-fire would be guarantees from the West that it won't allow Russia to re-invade in the future. Otherwise, O'Brien said, 'A cease-fire is a recipe for constant instability in Europe.' Russia is advancing slowly but steadily in eastern Ukraine In the war's first year, Ukraine lost huge amounts of territory — but it also achieved notable victories. It resisted a much larger adversary with superior air power to survive as an independent country, and it reclaimed some land through gutsy counteroffensives, giving the underdog — and its wealthy allies — the confidence to stay in the fight. In the second year, which was punctuated by Ukraine's devastating loss of Bakhmut and its failed counteroffensive, the armies essentially fought to a standstill along a 1,000 kilometer front line. Toward the end of that year, the U.S. Congress delayed the approval of a $61 billion package of aid for weapons, and economic and humanitarian assistance. With Ukraine's ammunition dwindling, its outlook deteriorated significantly as the war’s third year began. In February 2024, the town of Avdiivka fell after months of airstrikes by Russia, which used highly destructive Soviet-era bombs retrofitted with navigation systems. The fall of Avdiivka created a major breach in Ukraine’s defenses. When Russia later mounted an assault on the northeastern city of Kharkiv, Ukrainian troops were stretched further. A bright spot for Ukraine came in August, when it launched a surprise incursion into Russia. It took — and still holds — hundreds of square kilometers in the Kursk region. While this could be an important chip in any cease-fire negotiations, it hasn't stopped Russian forces from taking more land in Ukraine's east. 'The Russians have paid a very high price to keep advancing, but they’re willing to pay that price in lives to gain a few more meters of territory each day,' said Justin Crump, head of the British strategic advisory firm Sibylline. Tens of thousands of soldiers from both countries have been killed since the start of the war in 2022, according to estimates, and the U.N. says at least 11,700 Ukrainian civilians have been killed. While the amount of land Russia has gained in 2024 — about 2,455 square kilometers — is equal to less than 1% of Ukraine’s pre-war territory, it is having a psychological impact. With Ukraine in retreat, 'we’ve now returned to a period reminiscent of the (war's) first months,' said Mykola Bielieskov, an analyst at CBA Initiatives Center in Kyiv. 'This strengthens Russia’s position — not so much militarily, but in terms of morale.' A war of attrition requires both sides to seek outside resources To keep its war machine going, Russia — like Ukraine — has turned to allies for help. Iran supplies Russia with drones and possibly missiles, and North Korea has sent ammunition — and even troops, who have been deployed to Russia's Kursk region. Russian President Vladimir Putin claimed this year that 700,000 of his troops are fighting in Ukraine. Analysts say Putin would need a much larger force to accelerate Russia’s advance, but that he is unlikely to mobilize more troops because it could stoke internal discontent. Ukraine’s foothold in Kursk is another complicating factor for Putin, and it could be used as a bargaining chip in any future cease-fire negotiations. Captain Yevhen Karas, a Ukrainian commander in Kursk, said the fighting inside Russia is highly dynamic, but he believes it will prove effective in diverting Russia's attention and resources. 'Even a creeping, retreating front exhausts the enemy significantly,' Karas said. Ukraine has asked the West for longer range missiles and its blessing to fire at air bases deep inside Russia. But its allies have so far resisted, wary of escalating tensions with a nuclear-armed Russia. The U.S. has provided more than $64 billion in military aid to Ukraine since the war began 1,000 days ago. Soldiers worry about what would happen without sustained American support. 'Bravery, heroism, and spirit alone are not enough,' said a Ukrainian soldier in the eastern Donetsk region who spoke on condition of anonymity, in line with military rules. The soldier estimated that where he is stationed, Russian infantry outnumber Ukrainian troops 10 to 1. As the war drags on and the death toll rises, it has become increasingly difficult for Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy to keep replacing troops. The U.S. will play a vital role in determining the war's next direction What direction the war takes next will depend in large part on how the incoming Trump administration plays its hand. Trump, who has touted his good relationship with President Vladimir Putin and called the Russian leader 'pretty smart' for invading Ukraine, has repeatedly criticized American backing of Ukraine. During his only campaign debate with Vice President Kamala Harris, Trump twice refused to directly answer a question about whether he wanted Ukraine to win — raising concerns that Kyiv could be forced to accept unfavorable terms in any negotiations. Without security guarantees from the West, Ukraine could find itself vulnerable to future Russian aggression. Analysts say a cease-fire based on the current state of the battlefield would set a dangerous precedent, implying that Europe's borders are up for grabs through military action — something that hasn’t happened since World War II. 'This would also have a lot of traction in countries like China, India, and elsewhere,' said Richard Connolly, a Russia expert at the Royal United Services Institute in London. 'They could present that as a strategic defeat not only for Ukraine, but also for the West.' As another winter of war approaches, Ukrainian soldiers say they remain resolute.

Protesters in separatist Georgian region occupy government buildings, call for leader's ouster	Tbilisi, Georgia — Opposition protesters in Georgia's breakaway province of Abkhazia on Sunday refused to cede control of key government buildings seized during rallies earlier in the week during which at least 14 people were injured in clashes with police. Demonstrators stormed the buildings Friday to protest new measures allowing Russians to buy property in the seaside region. Protesters on Sunday continued to demand the ouster of self-styled Abkhazian President Aslan Bzhania, and one prominent politician vowed that the opposition would form a rival government if he refuses to step down. 'If our demands for the president's resignation are not met, we will have to form a temporary government to ensure the normal functioning of state bodies,' Temur Gulia told his supporters, according to local agencies. Bzhania, who is backed by Russia, signaled Sunday that he was prepared to step aside temporarily and hold early elections, even as he continued to slam the demonstrations as 'an attempted coup d'etat.' Opponents of the property agreement say it will drive up prices of apartments and boost Moscow's dominance in the region. On Saturday, Bzhania announced that he would only agree to a snap election if demonstrators vacated the region's parliament building. But crowds that gathered in the Abkhazian capital, Sukhumi, rejected the deal and opposition leaders said they would only accept Bzhania's unconditional resignation. Meanwhile, protesters on Sunday began dismantling the security barriers around the government complex in Sukhumi. One prominent opposition figure called the metal barriers a symbol of the authorities being out of touch. 'This barrier shows that the government has decided to fence itself off from its people,' Adgur Ardzinba said, according to local media. Most of Abkhazia broke away from Georgia in fighting that ended in 1993, and Georgia lost control of the rest of the territory in the short war with Russia in 2008. Russia recognizes Abkhazia as an independent country, but many Abkhazians are concerned that the region of about 245,000 people is a client state of Moscow. Abkhazia's mountains and Black Sea beaches make it a popular destination for Russian tourists and the demand for holiday homes could be strong. At least 14 people were injured Friday when opposition protesters clashed with police, Russian state agencies reported. Lawmakers had gathered at the region's parliament building to discuss ratifying measures allowing Russian citizens to buy property in the breakaway state. However, the session was postponed as demonstrators broke down the gate to the building's grounds with a truck and streamed inside. Some threw rocks at police, who responded with tear gas. The arrest of five opposition figures at a similar demonstration Monday set off widespread protests the next day in which bridges leading to Sukhumi were blocked.	https://www.voanews.com/a/protesters-in-separatist-georgian-region-occupy-government-buildings-call-for-leader-s-ouster/7867113.html	2024-11-17T13:35:59-08:00	
Trump’s Cabinet picks will shake status quo, House speaker says	Some of U.S. President-elect Donald Trump’s Cabinet picks are being described as 'controversial' in both Democratic and Republican circles. Republican House Speaker Mike Johnson reminded critics Sunday that the American people voted to shake up the status quo, and that’s what these new Cabinet officials, if confirmed, will be tasked with doing. VOA’s Veronica Balderas Iglesias has the story.

New global carbon trade rules adopted at UN climate summit expand inclusion, draw ire	Baku, Azerbaiijan — A new set of global carbon credit trade market standards has been agreed to during the United Nations Climate Change Conference in Baku, Azerbaijan, or COP29, following years of deadlock. Some analysts say that under the guidelines, a bigger number of entities could join a more regulated voluntary carbon credit trading system to reduce emissions. Known as Article 6.4, delegates agreed on the rules for establishing a system that allows trade in carbon credit between individual countries and companies, under the supervision of a centralized U.N. body. These include how to validate, verify and issue credits. Another option, known as Article 6.2, allows countries to set their own terms to trade carbon credits bilaterally. Countries weren’t able to agree on the standards for either option before COP29. Under the Paris Agreement to limit global warming to 2 degrees Celsius compared to pre-industrial levels by the end of the century, countries have committed to green goals, including slashing carbon emissions. The new deal could 'reduce the cost of implementing national climate plans by $250 billion per year by enabling cooperation across borders,' the COP29 presidency said in a statement, which hailed the outcome as a 'game-changing tool to direct resources to the developing world.' Controversial move The agreement is more a recognition from countries of the new rules, but negotiations are still ongoing and details are still being worked out so they are not fixed, according to Je-liang Liou, researcher at the Chung-Hua Institute for Economic Research in Taiwan. 'In the previous COP, the supervisory body usually drafted a bill for countries to discuss and decide if they approve it or not. But this year, the body of Article 6.4 approved their own draft before COP29 started so it became more of a situation for countries to give their votes,' Liou explained to VOA. The hasty process drew ire from some countries’ negotiators, including Tuvalu’s. It said that 'adopting decisions without prior consultations by the governing bodies does not reflect the Paris Agreement’s party-driven process,' according to the International Institute for Sustainable Development. Some climate advocates also said the agreement isn’t a success, as regulations have been an issue for voluntary carbon credit trading in the past. 'We should be very concerned in the Global South, especially if we don’t have sufficient safeguards in place to protect against the possibility of land grabs, human rights abuses, threats to subsistence and forest-based livelihoods, gender and indigenous interests,' Tara Nair van Ryneveld, climate policy coordinator at the Southern African Faith Communities’ Environment Institute, or SAFCEI, told VOA News. She cautioned against carbon credit trading as part of 'false solutions' that distract from work to be done on phasing out fossil fuels. Last year, Human Rights Watch found that the carbon offsetting projects that Cambodia’s government agreed to, the Southern Cardamom REDD+ Project, violated the rights of the indigenous Chong people. Authorities reportedly made decisions on incorporating villages into a national park two years before consulting the community. Rights abuses aside, amid the prospect of companies joining in for carbon trading, voluntary carbon offsetting projects from companies were revealed to be ineffective in serving their purpose, according to a 2023 investigation from The Guardian newspaper and trade watchdog Corporate Accountability. Nearly four in five of the top carbon offset projects are considered 'worthless' as they can’t guarantee cutting greenhouse gases, the report found. Despite the criticisms, Article 6.4 can be a 'push toward stronger regulation and accountability' and bolster transparency in climate finance, according to Luca Taschini, director of the Centre for Business, Climate Change and Sustainability at the University of Edinburgh. Expanded inclusion For non-U.N. member regions like Taiwan that have long been excluded from discussions and the country-to-country trading system, the expanded system under Article 6.4 can be positive news, Liou said. This allows companies to invest in projects, potentially allowing its participation, he added. 'Taiwan isn’t eligible for bilateral carbon credit trading because it’s not a U.N. member party, so it wasn’t able to join in directly to purchase credits from developing countries and fulfill our climate commitment, but Article 6.4, compared to Article 6.2, allows Taiwan a higher chance to trade carbon credits internationally,' he elaborated. Liou said the expanded carbon credit system - if set up and starts next year - can boost governments’ climate ambitions, amid nations’ looming submission deadline for a new climate plan by February 2025. Self-ruled Taiwan imports almost all of its energy from other countries. Under its climate goal to source 15 percent of its power from renewables by 2025 and reaching net-zero in 2050, slashing emissions in the medium term can be challenging and carbon trade can be beneficial for the island, according to Liou. Taschini said that Article 6 allows countries to invest in actions beyond their borders and raise global ambition. 'This is because, even if all NDCs [national determined contributions] are met, we will still fall short of our climate goals,' he explained. The year’s largest climate conference is set to end November 22.

Reports: Biden for the first time OKs Ukraine's use of US-supplied long-range missiles in Russia	Washington — President Joe Biden has for the first time authorized the use of U.S.-supplied long-range missiles by Ukraine to strike inside Russia, according to people familiar with the matter. The decision is a major U.S. policy shift and comes as Biden is about to leave office and President-elect Donald Trump has pledged to limit American support for Ukraine and end the war as soon as possible. The weapons are likely to be used in response to North Korea's decision to send thousands of troops to Russia in support of Russian President Vladimir Putin's invasion of Ukraine, according to one of the people. The people were not authorized to discuss the matter publicly and spoke on condition of anonymity.	https://www.voanews.com/a/reports-biden-for-the-first-time-oks-ukraine-s-use-of-us-supplied-long-range-missiles-in-russia-/7867055.html	2024-11-17T11:00:04-08:00

Biden becomes first sitting US president to visit Amazon rainforest	MANAUS, Brazil — Joe Biden on Sunday became the first sitting American president to set foot in the Amazon rainforest, as the incoming Trump administration seems poised to scale back the U.S. commitment to combating climate change. The massive Amazon, which is about the size of Australia, stores huge amounts of the world's carbon dioxide, a greenhouse gas that drives climate change when it's released into the atmosphere. But development is rapidly depleting the world's largest tropical rainforest. Joined by Carlos Nobre, a Nobel-Prize winning scientist and expert on how climate change is impacting the Amazon, and Biden climate adviser John Podesta, Biden lifted in his helicopter over a stretch of the rainforest, for a good view of the shallowing of waterways, fire damage and a wildlife refuge. He was also getting a peek at where the Rio Negro and Amazon rivers meet. Biden will then meet local and indigenous leaders and visit an Amazonian museum as he looks to highlight his commitment to the preservation of the region. His administration announced plans last year for a $500 million contribution to the Amazon Fund, the most significant international cooperation effort to preserve the rainforest, primarily financed by Norway. So far, the U.S. government said it has provided $50 million, and the White House announced Sunday an additional $50 million contribution to the fund. 'It's significant for a sitting president to visit the Amazon. ... This shows a personal commitment from the president,' said Suely Araújo, former head of the Brazilian environmental protection agency and public policy coordinator with the nonprofit Climate Observatory. 'That said, we can't expect concrete results from this visit.' She doubts that a 'single penny' will go to the Amazon Fund once Donald Trump is back in the White House. The incoming Trump administration is highly unlikely to prioritize the Amazon or anything related to climate change. The Republican president-elect already said he would again pull out of the Paris agreement, a global pact forged to avert the threat of catastrophic climate change, after Biden recommitted to the agreement. Trump has cast climate change as a 'hoax' and said he will eliminate energy efficiency regulations by the Biden administration. Still, the Biden White House on Sunday announced a series of new efforts aimed at bolstering the Amazon and stemming the impact of climate change. Among the actions is the launch of a finance coalition that looks to spur at least $10 billion in public and private investment for land restoration and eco-friendly economic projects by 2030, and a $37.5 million loan to the organization Mombak Gestora de Recursos Ltda. to support the large-scale planting of native tree species on degraded grasslands in Brazil. Biden is also set to sign a U.S. proclamation designating Nov. 17 as International Conservation Day, and will highlight in remarks during the visit that the U.S. is on track to reach $11 billion in spending on international climate financing in 2024, a six-fold increase from when he started his term. The Amazon is home to Indigenous communities and 10% of Earth's biodiversity. It also regulates moisture across South America. About two-thirds of the Amazon lies within Brazil, and scientists say its devastation poses a catastrophic threat to the planet. The forest has been suffering two years of historic drought that have dried up waterways, isolated thousands of riverine communities and hindered riverine dwellers' ability to fish. It's also made way for wildfires that have burned an area larger than Switzerland and choked cities near and far with smoke. When Brazilian President Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva took office last year, he signaled a shift in environmental policy from his predecessor, far-right Jair Bolsonaro. Bolsonaro prioritized agribusiness expansion over forest protection and weakened environmental agencies, prompting deforestation to surge to a 15-year-high. Lula has pledged 'zero deforestation' by 2030, though his term runs through the end of 2026. Forest loss in Brazil's Amazon dropped by 30.6% in the 12 months through July from a year earlier, bringing deforestation to its lowest level in nine years, according to official data released last week. In that 12-month span, the Amazon lost 6,288 square kilometers (2,428 square miles), roughly the size of the U.S. state of Delaware. But that data fails to capture the surge of destruction this year, which will only be included in next year's reading. Despite the success in curbing Amazon deforestation, Lula's government has been criticized by environmentalists for backing projects that could harm the region, such as paving a highway that cuts from an old-growth area and could encourage logging, oil drilling near the mouth of the Amazon River and building a railway to transport soy to Amazonian ports. Biden is making the Amazon visit as part of a six-day trip to South America, the first to the continent of his presidency. He traveled from Lima, Peru, where he took part in the annual Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation summit and met with Chinese President Xi Jinping. After his stop in Manaus, he was heading to Rio de Janeiro for this year's Group of 20 leaders summit.	https://www.voanews.com/a/biden-becomes-first-sitting-us-president-to-visit-amazon-rainforest-/7867021.html	2024-11-17T09:57:17-08:00	
Indian, Nigerian leaders pledge stronger security ties and support for Global South	ABUJA, Nigeria — The leaders of Nigeria and India pledged stronger ties in maritime security and counterterrorism during a meeting on Sunday where they also agreed on more support for Global South nations. In his first visit to Nigeria, Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi was hosted by President Bola Tinubu in capital Abuja, where both spoke of a new chapter in their strategic partnerships in the areas of defense, energy, technology, trade and development. Modi has often touted India as the voice of the Global South, the group of countries primarily considered developing nations, including Nigeria, but which also includes China and several wealthy Persian Gulf states. 'Together we will also continue to highlight at the global level the priorities of the Global South and thanks to our joint efforts, we will achieve success as well in this,' said Modi. A joint statement said both leaders pledged greater collaboration in counterterrorism, maritime security and intelligence sharing to cope with growing threats in the Indian Ocean and the Gulf of Guinea, the area off the coast of West Africa that is one of the world's most dangerous for piracy. Nigeria is India's largest trading partner in Africa with total bilateral trade between estimated at $14.9 billion in 2022. There are also at least 60,000 Indian nationals and 200 Indian companies in Nigeria, authorities say. The Nigerian leader conferred on Modi the title of the Grand Commander of the Order of the Niger, Nigeria's second-highest national honor, describing Modi as a representation of a 'very strong commitment to democratic values and norms.' 'Nigeria values its excellent relationship with India and will work to broaden the same for the mutual benefits of our two friendly countries,' Tinubu said.	https://www.voanews.com/a/indian-nigerian-leaders-pledge-stronger-security-ties-and-support-for-global-south/7866941.html	2024-11-17T07:57:09-08:00	
Bangladesh will seek extradition of ex-premier Sheikh Hasina from India	DHAKA, Bangladesh — Bangladesh's interim leader and Nobel Peace laureate Muhammad Yunus said Sunday that his administration will seek the extradition of ousted Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina from India, where has been in exile since fleeing a mass uprising in August. In a televised address to the nation on his first 100 days in office, Yunus said that the interim government will try those responsible including Hasina for hundreds of deaths during the student-led uprising that ended her 15-year rule. Yunus took the helm on Aug. 8, three days after Hasina fled the country. He said that not only the deaths in the uprising but all other violations of human rights, including alleged enforced disappearances while Hasina was in power, would be investigated. Bangladesh has sought help from the global police organization Interpol in issuing a red notice for the arrest of Hasina and her associates. 'We will seek the return of the fallen autocrat Sheikh Hasina from India,' Yunus said. 'I have already discussed the issue with chief prosecutor of the International Criminal Court Karim Khan.' While Hasina and her close associates are facing numerous criminal charges at home, the Yunus-led government is also pushing for the ICC to take up the case. Yunus said his government's most important task was to hold a new election to hand over power to an elected government, but he did not spell out any timeframe. He said his administration would first bring about reforms in various sectors including in the electoral system. He promised that once the electoral reforms are completed, a roadmap for the new election would be unveiled. Yunus downplayed as 'exaggerated' reports of attacks on minorities, especially Hindus, many of whom complained that hard-line Islamists are becoming increasingly influential since Hasina's ouster.	https://www.voanews.com/a/bangladesh-will-seek-extradition-of-ex-premier-sheikh-hasina-from-india/7866918.html	2024-11-17T07:27:44-08:00	
Myanmar’s sweeping internet blackouts drive rebels, medics, scammers to satellite service	Bangkok, Thailand — Across war-torn Myanmar, rebel commanders, aid workers and cyber-scammers alike are turning to billionaire Elon Musk’s Starlink satellites to stay in touch with each other and with the outside world amid some of the most severe internet restrictions. Starlink is not licensed in Myanmar, and the military junta running much of the country has banned its use, yet orbiting satellites and smugglers on the ground still manage to meet some of the growing demand. For many, 'Starlink is now the only viable solution for instant internet,' an analyst for the Myanmar Internet Project, a local research and advocacy group, told VOA on condition that his name not be used for fear of retaliation from the junta. The group has counted more than 300 internet shutdowns across the country since the military seized power from an elected government in a 2021 coup that set off a grinding civil war with no end in sight. It says nearly a quarter of Myanmar’s 330 townships are now completely cut off. In its latest Freedom on the Net survey, rights group Freedom House gave Myanmar its worst score among the 72 countries it ranked for obstacles to internet access. That has left people across large swaths of Myanmar scrambling for alternative channels to get online, and for a growing number of them that means Starlink. A wholly owned subsidiary of Musk’s SpaceX aerospace firm, Starlink operates over 6,000 satellites providing internet access from low Earth orbit, by far the most of any satellite-based internet provider. Though the company does not officially serve Myanmar, 'spillover' bandwidth from satellites serving other countries allows Myanmar to tap in, the Myanmar Internet Project analyst said. The junta is meanwhile losing control over growing swathes of the country, making its ban on the service increasingly moot. With the help of smugglers and a porous border, Starlink units have been trickling in from neighboring Thailand. The Myanmar Internet Project estimates there are now well over 3,000 Starlink dishes up and running across the country. 'In some areas the regular phone calls even cannot be made, so … Starlink is the only viable option,' the analyst said. 'And for people on the ground, information is now life or death. You cannot know if the air strikes are coming to you, you cannot show the people what is happening and what you are facing in Myanmar if you don’t have internet.' The Free Burma Rangers, a humanitarian aid group that works mostly along Myanmar’s border with Thailand, was among the first to start using Starlink in the country. The group’s director, David Eubank, told VOA it now uses over 30 of the units and has donated about 20 more to local hospitals, clinics and schools. 'Starlink has enabled us to have a signal where we’ve never had one before, and in the areas of blackout [it has been] very effective,' Eubank said. 'It’s not just us,' he added. 'There’s clinics and hospitals and other humanitarian groups that rely on Starlink. It’s absolutely crucial, a life-saving and life-giving way to share information of all kinds — a way to give early warning, a way to get help in, and a way to tell a story, a way to communicate among loved ones, a way to escape. It’s the main thing.' Eubank recalled a case in Kayah state from June of a landmine victim whose wounds were beyond the skills of the Free Burma Rangers medic at the scene. 'So, using the Starlink we contacted our surgeon friend in Germany, who’d been working with us before, and showed photos and videos and worked back and forth through the Starlink, and the surgeon guided this … medic to make the procedures necessary to save what was left of the leg and save this young man’s life.' The satellite service has also become 'incredibly useful' to the many armed groups fighting the junta where there never was internet service or where mobile towers have been disabled or knocked out, Richard Horsey, senior adviser for the International Crisis Group, told VOA. 'Reliable internet access is very important for command and control of forces, for operational planning — for example, Google Maps and other providers of satellite imagery — and other purposes such as early warning of airstrikes,' he told said. Among the rebel groups making use of Starlink is the Karenni National Defense Force, a coalition of armed groups fighting the junta across Kayah. KNDF spokesman The Eh Soe told VOA that soldiers on the front lines still rely mostly on radio, partly due to the high power demands and the costs of Starlink units. While still the cheapest satellite option available, a base model that officially retails for $599 is now going for up to eight times that on Myanmar’s black market. Behind the front lines, though, The Eh Soe said some KNDF commanders are using Starlink to plan and coordinate, and to stay in touch with the outside world. Many of the country’s resistance groups rely on friends and family abroad to help fund their operations. The Eh Soe said the system is also being used to help run the opposition government being set up across the state to replace the junta by the Karenni Interim Executive Council, which includes KNDF commanders. 'Starlink is the only way you can use the internet … right now,' he said, 'and it is quite important to be connected.' Along with the rebels and humanitarians, some criminals are catching on as well. In a report on Southeast Asia’s cybercrime threat last month, the United States Institute of Peace, a U.S. government-funded think tank, said signals intelligence has shown compounds in Myanmar from which transnational crime syndicates are defrauding victims across the globe 'pivoting to Starlink satellite systems.' The United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime says it has found tens of online vendors in the region selling third-party Starlink units explicitly for cyber-fraud operations. While the satellite service is still the exception for internet access among the region’s cyber-scammers, it does appear to be gaining a following and will likely continue to, said Benedikt Hofmann, the UNODC’s deputy representative for Southeast Asia and the Pacific. 'Like other technologies, it is definitely becoming a more important tool for criminals to expand this business and shield their operations from external pressure,' he told VOA. He said that in turn may raise calls for Starlink to cut Myanmar off or spur neighboring countries to get tougher on smugglers. Authorities in Thailand have seized dozens of Starlink units on their way to Myanmar and made several arrests so far this year. The Myanmar Internet Project analyst says the growing demand may also overwhelm the available bandwidth at some point, slowing service to a crawl. SpaceX did not reply to VOA’s requests for comment.	https://www.voanews.com/a/myanmar-s-sweeping-internet-blackouts-drive-rebels-medics-scammers-to-satellite-service/7866870.html	2024-11-17T07:06:50-08:00	
Putin critics lead march in Berlin calling for democracy in Russia and end to war in Ukraine	Berlin — Prominent Russian opposition figures led a march of at least 1,000 people in central Berlin Sunday, criticizing Russian President Vladimir Putin and his war in Ukraine and calling for democracy in Russia. Behind a banner that read 'No Putin. No War,' the protesters were led by Yulia Navalnaya, the widow of top Putin critic Alexei Navalny, as well as Ilya Yashin and Vladimir Kara-Murza, who were freed from Russian detention in a high-profile prisoner exchange this summer. Shouting 'Russia without Putin' and other chants in Russian, the demonstrators held up signs with a wide array of messages on a red background, including 'Putin = War' and 'Putin is a murderer' in German. Some marched with the flags of Russia or Ukraine, as well as a white-blue-white flag used by some Russian opposition groups. Organizers said the march began near Potsdamer Platz and went through the Brandenburg Gate and Checkpoint Charlie and was expected to end outside the Russian Embassy. 'The march demands the immediate withdrawal of Russian troops from Ukraine, the trial of Vladimir Putin as a war criminal, and the release of all political prisoners in Russia,' the protesters said in a statement. Yashin, in a statement before the demonstration, said demonstrators were 'using the freedom we have here in Berlin to show the world: A peaceful, free, and civilized Russia exists.' Navalnaya, Yashin and Kara-Murza have all billed Sunday's rally as a show of unity at a time when recent rounds of acrimony have roiled the anti-war camp. Russia's exiled anti-war opposition has so far largely failed to speak with one voice and present a clear plan of action. The landmark East-West prisoner swap in August freed key dissidents and promised to reinvigorate a movement unmoored by the death in prison of Navalny, a charismatic anti-corruption campaigner and arch-Kremlin foe. Instead, tensions have spiked in recent months, as Navalny's allies and other prominent dissidents swapped accusations that appeared to dash any hopes of a united anti-Kremlin front. Many opposition-minded Russians have voiced deep frustration with the infighting, and with what some view as efforts by rivaling groups to discredit and wrest influence from one another.	https://www.voanews.com/a/putin-critics-lead-march-in-berlin-calling-for-democracy-in-russia-and-end-to-war-in-ukraine-/7866889.html	2024-11-17T07:05:14-08:00	
Meeting election pledges seen as challenge for Sri Lanka president despite parliamentary win	New Delhi — Sri Lanka’s Marxist leaning president has won a sweeping mandate to fulfill his pledges to combat corruption and implement pro-poor reforms, but he faces huge challenges in a country whose economy is still fragile, analysts say. Anura Kumara Dissanayake’s coalition, the National People’s Power, or NPP, party, secured an unprecedented two-thirds majority in the 225-member Parliament in snap elections held a year ahead of schedule. The parliamentary polls — held seven weeks after he emerged victorious in presidential voting — reinforced the remarkable shift in Sri Lankan politics, where mainstream parties that led the country for decades have been reduced to the margins as people put faith in a political outsider to bring about transformative change. Dissanayake’s coalition won 159 seats — a dramatic jump from the three seats his party held earlier. However, that commanding majority may still not be enough to steer Sri Lanka along the path he has promised. 'He is going to encounter bumps on all his agenda which is extremely ambitious. On the economy, there is no easy route to a more equitable and a faster-growing economy. In terms of good governance and anticorruption, they are going to run into a lot of vested interests in business, in politics, in the bureaucracy, in the police. It would not be easy for saints -- it is not going to be easy for this government,' Alan Keenan, senior Sri Lanka consultant at the International Crisis Group said. Dissanayake’s first task will be to ease the burden on millions from austerity measures imposed by a $2.9 billion bailout from the International Monetary Fund. The IMF deal brought the economy back from the brink of collapse, but the slashed subsidies and higher taxes imposed to stabilize government finances brought hardship to millions. 'They will have to provide relief to the people who have felt the tremendous rise in the cost of living. There are great expectations that this government will address that,' according to Devaka Gunawardena, research fellow at the Social Scientists Association in Colombo. 'But that will require some form of renegotiation of the IMF agreement. If they continue with the deal, then they will have to think of other alternative ways of stimulating the economy. This is where the new government will have to thread the needle now.' Dissanayake has said that he is committed to the IMF program and any changes would be undertaken in consultation with the fund. An IMF team is beginning a visit to Colombo Sunday to review the reform program. However, the room to maneuver is limited in a country that is still mired in debt. So far, the government has marginally reduced fuel prices and distributed subsidies to farmers and fishermen. Besides delivering such small benefits, it will be difficult to make any significant shifts or show major economic benefits to people in a country that has little money to spend, according to analysts. Little is also known about the dynamics of the NPP — the leftist coalition that Dissanayake put together ahead of the presidential polls. It consists of his Marxist party, Janatha Vimukthi Peramuna, professionals, trade unions, women and youth groups. Many of those elected will be first-time lawmakers new to politics. Having to appease various interests under this 'big-tent party' will be a challenge for the government, according to Rajni Gamage, a research fellow at the Institute of South Asian Studies at the National University of Singapore. 'The NPP government will have to strike a balance between the ... economic requirements of the IMF program and the more center-left oriented demands of trade unions and civil society groups who are part of the coalition,' she said. Another litmus test he faces is meeting his promise to transform the country’s political culture — people widely blamed misgovernance and graft by previous leaders for driving Sri Lanka, once ranked as a middle-income country, into bankruptcy. 'Thank you to all who voted for a renaissance,' Dissanayake said on social media platform X on Friday after the results were announced. For many of his voters, that renaissance involves ensuring accountability for alleged corruption and a government that is more in touch with the masses — Dissanayake is the son of a laborer, whereas past leaders came from elite political families. According to political analysts, this is a low-hanging fruit that could yield political dividends for the new government. 'If they can make progress in either achieving accountability for big corruption cases and tracking down the assets supposedly stolen and stacked away in foreign countries, or if they can show people that they do politics differently, they are not arrogant and do not just drive around in big SUV’s with lots of security guards, that will go a long way to satisfy people, even if they don’t see their lives improve materially or economically,' according to Keenan. However, he cautions that too may not be easy.

Cultural experts urge UN to shield war-torn Lebanon's heritage	Beirut — Hundreds of cultural professionals, including archeologists and academics, called on the United Nations to safeguard war-torn Lebanon's heritage in a petition published Sunday ahead of a crucial UNESCO meeting. Several Israeli strikes in recent weeks on Baalbek in the east and Tyre in the south — both strongholds of Iran-backed militant group Hezbollah — hit close to ancient Roman ruins designated as UNESCO World Heritage sites. The petition, signed by 300 prominent cultural figures, was sent to UNESCO chief Audrey Azoulay a day before a special session in Paris to consider listing Lebanese cultural sites under 'enhanced protection.' It urges UNESCO to protect Baalbek and other heritage sites by establishing 'no-target zones' around them, deploying international observers and enforcing measures from the 1954 Hague Convention on cultural heritage in conflict. 'Lebanon's cultural heritage at large is being endangered by recurrent assaults on ancient cities such as Baalbek, Tyre and Anjar, all UNESCO world heritage sites, as well as on other historic landmarks,' says the petition. It calls on influential states to push for an end to military action that causes destruction of damage to sites, as well as adding protections or introducing sanctions. Change Lebanon, the charity behind the petition, said signatories included museum curators, academics, archaeologists and writers in Britain, France, Italy and the United States. Hezbollah and Israel have been at war since late September, when Israel broadened its focus from fighting Hamas in the Gaza Strip to securing its northern border, even as the Gaza war continues. Enhanced protection status gives heritage sites 'high-level immunity from military attacks', according to UNESCO. 'Criminal prosecutions and sanctions, conducted by the competent authorities, may apply in cases where individuals do not respect the enhanced protection granted to a cultural property,' it said. In Baalbek, Israeli strikes on November 6 hit near the city's Roman temples, according to authorities, destroying a heritage house dating back to the French mandate and damaged the historic site. The region's governor said 'a missile fell in the car park' of a 1,000-year-old temple, the closest strike since the start of the war. The ruins host the prestigious Baalbek Festival each year, a landmark event founded in 1956 and now a fixture on the international cultural scene, featuring performances by music legends like Oum Kalthoum, Charles Aznavour and Ella Fitzgerald.	https://www.voanews.com/a/cultural-experts-urge-un-to-shield-war-torn-lebanon-s-heritage-/7866819.html	2024-11-17T05:16:22-08:00	
Pope Francis calls for investigation to determine if Israel's attacks in Gaza constitute 'genocide'	Rome — Pope Francis has called for an investigation to determine if Israel’s attacks in Gaza constitute genocide, according to excerpts released Sunday from an upcoming new book ahead of the pontiff's jubilee year. It's the first time that Francis has openly urged for an investigation of genocide allegations over Israel's actions in the Gaza Strip. In September, he said Israel's attacks in Gaza and Lebanon have been 'immoral' and disproportionate, and that its military has gone beyond the rules of war. The book, by Hernán Reyes Alcaide and based on interviews with the Pope, is entitled 'Hope never disappoints. Pilgrims towards a better world.' It will be released on Tuesday ahead of the pope's 2025 jubilee. Francis’ yearlong jubilee is expected to bring more than 30 million pilgrims to Rome to celebrate the Holy Year. 'According to some experts, what is happening in Gaza has the characteristics of a genocide,' the pope said in excerpts published Sunday by the Italian daily La Stampa. 'We should investigate carefully to determine whether it fits into the technical definition formulated by jurists and international bodies,' he added. Last year, Francis met separately with relatives of Israeli hostages in Gaza and Palestinians living through the war and set off a firestorm by using words that Vatican diplomats usually avoid: 'terrorism' and, according to the Palestinians, 'genocide.' Francis spoke at the time about the suffering of both Israelis and Palestinians after his meetings, which were arranged before the Israeli-Hamas hostage deal and a temporary halt in fighting was announced. The pontiff, who last week also met with a delegation of Israeli hostages who were released and their families pressing the campaign to bring the remaining captives home had editorial control over the upcoming book. The war started when the militant Hamas group attacked Israel on Oct. 7, 2023, killing 1,200 people and abducting 250 as hostages and taking them back to Gaza, where dozens still remain. Israel’s subsequent yearlong military campaign has killed more than 43,000 people, according to Gaza health officials, whose count doesn’t distinguish between civilians and fighters, though they say more than half of the dead are women and children. The Israel-Hamas conflict in Gaza has triggered several legal cases at international courts in The Hague involving requests for arrest warrants as well as accusations and denials of war crimes, crimes against humanity and genocide. In the new book, Francis also speaks about migration and the problem of integrating migrants in their host countries. 'Faced with this challenge, no country can be left alone and no one can think of addressing the issue in isolation through more restrictive and repressive laws, sometimes approved under the pressure of fear or in search of electoral advantages,' Francis said. 'On the contrary, just as we see that there is a globalization of indifference, we must respond with the globalization of charity and cooperation,' he added. Francis also mentioned the 'still open wound of the war in Ukraine has led thousands of people to abandon their homes, especially during the first months of the conflict.'	https://www.voanews.com/a/pope-francis-calls-for-investigation-to-determine-if-israel-s-attacks-in-gaza-constitute-genocide-/7866790.html	2024-11-17T04:19:03-08:00	
UN agency: Over 20,000 displaced by gang violence in Haiti	United Nations — More than 20,000 people have been displaced across Haiti's capital Port-au-Prince in four days, a U.N. agency said Saturday, as residents flee gang violence that has crippled the troubled Caribbean nation. 'The isolation of Port-au-Prince is amplifying an already dire humanitarian situation,' said Gregoire Goodstein, Haiti chief for the International Organization for Migration. 'Our ability to deliver aid is stretched to its limits. Without immediate international support, the suffering will worsen exponentially,' Goodstein added in a statement. The IOM said that around 17,000 of the roughly 20,000 people recently forced to relocate were already in temporary housing, with many having been displaced multiple times. 'Such a scale of displacement has not been observed since August 2023,' the migration agency said in a news release. Haiti saw Prime Minister Alix Didier Fils-Aime sworn in on Monday, replacing outgoing premier Garry Conille, who was appointed in May but became embroiled in a power struggle with the country's unelected transitional council. Violent crime in Port-au-Prince remains high, with well-armed gangs that control some 80 percent of the city routinely targeting civilians, even though a Kenyan-led international force has been deployed to help the outgunned Haitian police restore order. Gang-related violence has caused nearly 4,000 deaths this year, according to the UN human rights office. Haiti lost major links to the rest of the world this past week when the United States banned all civilian flights to the country for a month, after three jetliners approaching or departing Port-au-Prince were hit by gunfire.	https://www.voanews.com/a/un-agency-over-20-000-displaced-by-gang-violence-in-haiti/7866783.html	2024-11-17T04:00:16-08:00	
Senegal heads to polls as new leaders eye parliamentary win	Dakar — Senegal on Sunday voted in parliamentary elections, with the new leaders aiming for a resounding majority to see through the promise of ambitious reform that swept them to power eight months ago. President Bassirou Diomaye Faye secured victory in March pledging economic transformation, social justice and a fight against corruption — raising hopes among a largely youthful population facing high inflation and widespread unemployment. But an opposition-led parliament hampered the government's first months in power, leading Faye to dissolve the chamber in September and call snap elections as soon as the constitution allowed him to do so. 'I hope that [the ruling party] Pastef will win the elections to gain a majority so that they can better carry out their mandate,' said 56-year-old Pascal Goudiaby, who was among dozens waiting to cast their ballots at a polling station in the capital Dakar. 'The priority is unemployment, young people are facing so much unemployment,' he added. Faye appointed his firebrand mentor Ousmane Sonko as prime minister, after Sonko's own bid to run for president was blocked following a three-year deadly standoff with the former authorities. The pair promised a leftist pan-African agenda — vowing to diversify political and economic partnerships, review hydrocarbon and fishing contracts and re-establish Senegal's sovereignty, which they claimed had been sold abroad. The West African country's roughly 7.3 million registered voters will elect 165 MPs for five-year terms. Analysts say Senegalese voters have historically confirmed their presidential choice during parliamentary elections, and the Pastef party is the favorite to win. 'I think that whoever you gave your confidence to in the presidential election, you need to renew your confidence in him so that he can achieve what he started,' said 56-year-old voter Toure Aby. 'We want life to be less expensive for the Senegalese', she added. 'Everything's expensive: water, electricity, food.' 'No room for violence' Voters are continuing a long democratic tradition in Senegal, widely seen as a stable outlier in a coup-plagued region. Prime Minister Sonko cast his vote in the morning in the southern city of Ziguinchor, calling for calm. 'Democracy is expressed in peace and stability, and I believe that in a democracy there is no room for violence,' he said. Sonko spent three weeks on the campaign trail promising projects and investment in the regions he visited, while applauding patriotism and national sovereignty. Reminiscent of his years as a fiery opposition leader, he had called for vengeance after attacks against his supporters, but later urged restraint. Despite the heated tone, clashes were sporadic in the run-up to the vote. Though some agreements have been reached between coalitions, the opposition remains fragmented. Former president Macky Sall is leading an opposition grouping from abroad, breaking with the political restraint normally adopted by ex-leaders in Senegal. He left power in April after triggering one of the worst crises in decades with a last-minute postponement of the presidential election. Former prime minister and presidential runner-up Amadou Ba, and Dakar mayor Barthelemy Dias, are also heading coalitions. Bleak picture The opposition has accused the new government of inaction, amateurism and a desire to settle scores with the previous administration. Unemployment stands at more than 20 percent and scores continue to risk their lives every month in a bid to reach Europe by boat. The government said an audit of public finances revealed a wider budget deficit than previously announced, with the International Monetary Fund suspending an aid program pending the audit's review. Moody's downgraded Senegal's credit rating and placed the country under observation. Since taking office, the authorities have lowered the price of household goods such as rice, oil and sugar and launched a series of reviews. They have initiated justice system reform and presented an ambitious 25-year development plan aimed at transforming the economy and public policy. Polling stations close at 6:00 pm (1800 GMT). Reliable projections of the new parliament's makeup could be available from Monday morning.	https://www.voanews.com/a/senegal-heads-to-polls-as-new-leaders-eye-parliamentary-win-/7866774.html	2024-11-17T03:40:58-08:00	
Israeli strikes kill 12 in Gaza as arrests are made over flares fired at Netanyahu's home	TEL AVIV, Israel — Israeli strikes in the Gaza Strip overnight killed 12 people, Palestinian medical officials said Sunday. Israeli police meanwhile arrested three suspects after flares were fired at Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's private residence in the coastal city of Caesarea. In Lebanon, Israeli warplanes pounded the southern suburbs of Beirut after the military warned people to evacuate from at least seven buildings. The Hezbollah militant group has a strong presence in the area, known as the Dahiyeh, and the strikes came as Lebanese officials are considering a United States-brokered cease-fire proposal. Netanyahu and his family were not at the residence when two flares were fired at it overnight, and there were no injuries, authorities said. A drone launched by Hezbollah struck the residence last month, also when Netanyahu and his family were away. The police did not provide details about the suspects behind the flares, but officials pointed to domestic political critics of Netanyahu. Israel's largely ceremonial president, Isaac Herzog, condemned the incident and warned against 'an escalation of the violence in the public sphere.' Netanyahu has faced months of mass protests over his handling of the hostage crisis unleashed by Hamas' October 7, 2023 attack into Israel, which ignited the ongoing war in Gaza. In that attack, Hamas militants killed 1,200 people and captured about 250 hostages. Israel says it believes Hamas is still holding 101 hostages, including 35 the military says are dead. Israel’s counteroffensive in Gaza has killed more than 43,000 people, according to the territory's health ministry, which does not distinguish between combatants and civilians in its count. Hamas in Gaza and Hezbollah in Lebanon have been designated as terror groups by the United States, the U.K. and other Western countries. Critics blame Netanyahu for the security and intelligence failures that allowed the attack to happen and for not reaching a deal with Hamas to release scores of hostages still held inside Gaza. Israelis rallied again in Tel Aviv on Saturday night to demand a cease-fire deal to return them. Justice Minister Yariv Levin meanwhile seized on the flare attack to call for a revival of his plans to overhaul the Israeli judiciary, which had sparked months of mass protests before the war. 'The time has come to provide full support for the restoration of the justice system and the law enforcement systems, and to put an end to anarchy, rampage, refusal, and attempts to harm the Prime Minister,' he said in a statement. Supporters said the judiciary changes aim to strengthen democracy by circumscribing the authority of unelected judges and turning over more powers to elected officials. Opponents see the overhaul as a power grab by Netanyahu, who is on trial for corruption charges, and an assault on a key watchdog. Opposition Leader Yair Lapid said in a post on X that he 'strongly condemns' the firing of flares at Netanyahu's home while blasting Levin's proposal. 'Levin should go home with rest of this irresponsible government,' Lapid wrote. 'We will not let him turn Israel into an undemocratic state.' Overnight strikes in central Gaza kill 12 Israeli strikes killed six people in Nuseirat and another four in Bureij, two built-up refugee camps in central Gaza dating back to the 1948 war surrounding Israel's creation. Another two people were killed in a strike on Gaza's main north-south highway, according to the Al-Aqsa Martyrs Hospital in the central city of Deir al-Balah, which received all 12 bodies. Israeli warplanes pound southern Beirut The Israeli military posted evacuation warnings on X about an hour before the strikes on southern Beirut, which came early Sunday. Local media reported church bells ringing in and around the area to alert residents. There were no immediate reports of casualties. The Israeli military also renewed calls on Sunday for residents in over a dozen villages in southern Lebanon to flee as ground troops pushed farther north. Hezbollah began firing rockets, missiles and drones into Israel the day after Hamas' 2023 attack, drawing retaliatory airstrikes. The conflict steadily escalated and erupted into all-out war in September. Israeli forces invaded Lebanon on October 1. More than 3,400 people have been killed in Lebanon, according to the country's Health Ministry, and over 1.2 million driven from their homes. It is not known how many of the dead are Hezbollah fighters. On the Israeli side, Hezbollah's aerial attacks have killed at least 76 people, including 31 soldiers, and caused some 60,000 people to flee from communities in the north.	https://www.voanews.com/a/israeli-strikes-kill-12-in-gaza-as-arrests-are-made-over-flares-fired-at-netanyahu-s-home/7866747.html	2024-11-17T01:47:24-08:00	
A dancing Trump finds internet fame in China	TAIPEI, TAIWAN — Memes, inspirational quotes, and even dance videos have brought President-elect Donald Trump to a new height of fame on Chinese social media since his election. On Xiaohongshu, a media platform most similar to Instagram, the search term 'Trump' shows more than 200,000 posts on the topic and 880 million views, with recent top posts each accruing more than 72,000 views and thousands of comments. Videos of the president-elect dancing to the song YMCA by the band Village People have been circulating in Chinese cyberspace. Many commenters find the content funny, calling him a jokester or comedian, while others view it as inspirational, seeing the older soon-to-be two-time American president as a role model. Trump’s popularity stems from a kind of vitality and enthusiasm that he displayed throughout his campaign, analysts said, attracting many young Chinese who grew up looking up to more somber and rigid communist idols within their own country. Videos of Elon Musk at a pre-election Trump rally have also made an impression on Chinese social media platform users. On these posts, commenters describe him as 'a good kind of capitalist' and 'someone who will make America strong.' 'They need an idol' These impressions come amidst a general malaise facing the Chinese economy that has sparked the young Chinese people to ‘lie flat’, meaning to cease striving for a better life in face of a competitive job market and other pressures. One comment commonly posted under many Trump-related posts reads: 'He is 78 years old, was hit by a bullet in the ear and bled profusely, was convicted of a felony and nearly sent to jail, had appealed over 60 times but still continued to work hard to find a job and found the best job for himself. What excuse do you have for not working hard?' Liu, a writer from Jiangsu province, said Trump’s difficult path back to the presidency is precisely what inspires Chinese youth when compared to the traditional Communist Party heroes. Liu only gave his surname, because talking to foreign media is dangerous, he says. 'They need an idol who represents the possibility of individual success. Trump fits this image: he gets stronger with each setback, continually fights back, and still works hard even at an older age,' Liu said, adding that 'more importantly, young Chinese long for the kind of fair and just environment that has allowed Trump to succeed.' Trump stands in direct contrast to many revered Chinese figures, such as Xi Jinping, Mao Zedong, and communist soldier Lei Feng — a model hero in China. 'Their lives seem too hard and are not the kind of lives young people in China aspire to,' Liu said, adding that Trump stands for something different: the individualistic, opportunistic ‘American Dream’ 'Whether you can wear a gold bracelet before New Years is all up to you!' comments one user ‘Sleepy Orange’ under a campaign rally video, referencing gold as an important gift typically exchanged on the Chinese New Year. It is a symbol of wealth and prosperity. More than 2,000 people liked this comment. Liu said he also appreciates Trump’s straightforwardness, as he doesn’t preach lofty ideals and morals but is practical and realistic. Liu described Chinese authorities and their political slogans as 'vague and empty.' Popularity reflects dislike of Xi, says influencer Chen Weiyu, a Chinese media influencer living in the United States, told VOA that Trump’s popularity on Chinese social media represents a deep disdain toward Chinese leaders, calling people’s engagement with his content a form of 'deprogramming.' 'Rather than admiration for Trump himself, it's more about a rejection and opposition to Xi Jinping and the Chinese Communist Party. By expressing their liking for Trump, they are in fact expressing their dislike and opposition to Xi Jinping,' Chen said. She stressed that people at the bottom of society in China, struggling to survive in an economy controlled by communist elites, feel that no one is concerned about or advocating for them. In contrast, working-class individuals facing unemployment in the United States can use their votes to elect a leader who they believe will represent their interests and create a better policy environment for them. Chen also attributed the abundance of Trump content on Chinese platforms to the increasing prevalence of virtual private networks as a way of accessing information that is normally forbidden in China. However, Zhou 'Zuola' Shuguang, one of the first Chinese citizen journalists to relocate to Taiwan, said the popularity of Trump on Chinese social media may have the 'tacit approval' of the Chinese Communist Party. Beijing's censorship system is consistently strict about controlling content, so the fact that Trump-related content is able to spread widely on social media suggests that the CCP is intentionally allowing the content to be seen, Zhou told VOA. 'In other words, if Trump's content appears on Chinese social media, it means that Trump is not seen as a major threat by the CCP,' he said. While Trump-related content is getting clicks, not all of them are positive. 'It’s not a good thing for Trump to come back, God bless China' said a netizen in one comment. Others simply poke fun at the president-elect, the color of his hair and the way his makeup makes him look on stage. '60% of the tariffs will be given to China, how many free trade enterprises are going to be suppressed,' reads another comment liked by nearly 1,000 people.

Activists plant trees in Mali, but residents strip them for firewood, saying there's no choice	BAMAKO, Mali — After years of serving as Mali's minister of the environment, Aida M'bo now spends her time planting trees in a fight that many in the arid West African country acknowledge they are losing. 'Deforestation is an important issue in Mali,' she said, standing in front of the Zamblara forest. For decades it has been classified as protected, but like many forests in the vast Sahel, it could be wiped out. 'It is mainly due to the excessive wood-cutting,' M'bo said. Even some of her fellow tree-planters that day were to blame. Salimata Diabate, who took part in the ceremony last month, lives nearby and sells firewood from the forest in the Sikasso region, long considered Mali's breadbasket. While Diabate expressed concern about the threats to Mali's forests, she said people like her in the countryside have no choice but firewood for cooking. 'Things like cooking gas and solar panels are better, but it's too expensive for rural women,' she said. The loss of forests has become a pressing issue across Africa as the Sahara Desert continues to creep southward. Over the last three decades, nearly 20,000 square kilometers of forest have been lost in Mali, according to the environmental nonprofit Tree Aid. M'bo's nonprofit, Energia, is financially supported by the Great Green Wall, an initiative by African countries launched in 2007 that aims to plant trees in a nearly 8,047-kilometer line across the continent, creating a natural barrier to hold back the desert as climate change sweeps the sands south. But millions of the trees died as temperatures rose and rainfall diminished. As a result, only 4% of the Great Green Wall's original goal has been met, and an estimated $43 billion would be needed to achieve the rest. In Mali, the initiative is facing an additional challenge : the population's dependency on firewood. Lassana Coulibaly, who lives in the town of Senou near the capital, Bamako, spends his days chopping up and reselling wood he buys from people who cut it from a nearby forest. 'This how we make a living on a daily basis,' he said. He doesn't believe the forest will disappear. A 2019 study by the African Energy Commission found that 64% of Mali's total fuel consumption was of biomass, primarily firewood and charcoal for household use. Their sale remains legal. Despite being one of Africa's top gold producers, Mali ranks among the world's least developed nations, with almost half of its 23 million population living below the national poverty line. The problem is worse in rural areas, where subsistence farming — many people's only real option for survival — is threatened by armed conflict and climate change. The country has been plagued by an insurgency fought by armed groups, including some allied with al-Qaida and the Islamic State group, and two military coups since 2020. Mali is also among several countries in the Sahel that have experienced record-breaking floods this year, with more than 1,000 people killed and hundreds of thousands displaced across the region. Khady Camara, an environmental activist based in Senegal, said forests can help to weather the effects of climate change by absorbing water to prevent floods, and by absorbing carbon that would otherwise end up in the atmosphere as part of heat-trapping gas. 'We need to give more priority to our forests, but we also need to set up new forests and give priority to natural regeneration,' said Camara, whose organization Vacances Vertes has planted 150,000 trees in Senegal. She said the effects of climate change on the Sahel region can't be overstated, and the causes often come from far beyond the African continent. 'Africa produces only 3% of greenhouse gases. Ninety percent is from the West,' she said. 'If we continue like this, I'm saying to myself that this will be the disappearance of Africa, and of Africans.'	https://www.voanews.com/a/activists-plant-trees-in-mali-but-residents-strip-them-for-firewood-saying-there-s-no-choice-/7866034.html	2024-11-17T01:30:37-08:00	
Norway's Kon-Tiki Museum returns artifacts to Chile's remote Easter Island	COPENHAGEN, Denmark — Artifacts and human remains taken by a Norwegian explorer and anthropologist in the late 1940s are being returned by a museum in Oslo to Chile's remote territory of Easter Island in the mid-Pacific, the Kon-Tiki Museum said Wednesday. In 1947, explorer Thor Heyerdahl sailed on a log raft named Kon-Tiki from Peru to Polynesia in 101 days to prove his theory — that the South Sea Islands were settled by seafarers from South America. He brought 5,600 objects back from Easter Island, also known as Rapa Nui. This is the third time objects taken by him are being returned. Many have been stored and displayed at the Kon-Tiki Museum in Oslo, Norway's capital, and some were given back in 1986 and others 2006. The return has been a collaboration between the museum, Chile and Rapa Nui's local authorities. 'My grandfather would have been proud of what we are about to achieve,' said Liv Heyerdahl, head of the museum and the explorer's granddaughter. She told the Norwegian news agency NTB that the objects were brought to Norway 'with a promise that they would one day be returned.' Among those that are being returned this time around are human remains called Ivi Tepuna and sculpted stones. A nine-person delegation had traveled to Norway this week to collect the items. Four of them spent the night at the Oslo museum, alongside the remains as part of a ritual ceremony to take back the spirits of the remains. 'First one must awaken the spirits, and then speak to them in our original language. Food is then prepared to eat a meal with them, where the smell of the food goes to the spirits,' a member of the delegation, Laura Tarita Rapu Alarcón, told NTB. 'It is important that those who own the culture are involved in the process,' Liv Heyerdahl was quoted as saying by NTB. 'Of course these remains should be returned, and it feels right because they belong to the Rapa Nui.' In 2019, an agreement was signed in Santiago, Chile, during a visit by Norway's King Harald. However, the COVID-19 pandemic stopped all activities in 2020, the museum said. Harald met with the Rapa Nui delegation on Tuesday. A book about Thor Heyerdahl's voyage — he died in 2002 at the age of 87 — has become an international bestseller, and his film of the journey won an Academy Award for best documentary in 1951. Rapa Nui is best known for the hundreds of moai — monolithic human figures carved centuries ago by this remote Pacific island's Rapanui people. Covering about 164 square kilometers and home to about 7,700 people, half of them with Rapa Nui ancestry, Easter Island was formed at least 750,000 years ago by volcanic eruptions and is one of the world's most isolated inhabited islands. Located 3,700 kilometers from South America, Rapa Nui was declared a UNESCO World Heritage Site in 1995. In 2019, it was officially renamed 'Rapa Nui-Easter Island' from its previous name of just Easter Island.	https://www.voanews.com/a/norway-s-kon-tiki-museum-returns-artifacts-to-chile-s-remote-easter-island/7864742.html	2024-11-17T01:29:13-08:00	
Russia targets Ukraine's power grid in 'massive' missile strike, officials say	KYIV, Ukraine — Blasts rang out across Ukraine's capital, Kyiv, and other cities early on Sunday, as Russia staged its biggest missile attack since August and targeted power facilities with the winter setting in, officials said. Ukrainians have been bracing for a major attack on the hobbled power system for weeks, fearing crippling damage to the grid that would cause long blackouts and build psychological pressure at a critical moment in the war Russia launched in February 2022. 'Another massive attack on the power system is under way. The enemy is attacking electricity generation and transmission facilities throughout Ukraine,' Ukrainian Energy Minister German Galushchenko wrote on Facebook. Air defenses could be heard engaging drones over the capital in the night, and a series of powerful blasts rang out across the city center as the missile attack was under way in the morning. The scale of the damage was not immediately clear. Officials cut power supply to numerous city districts, including in Kyiv, the surrounding region and Dnipropetrovsk region, in what they said was a precaution to prevent a surge in case of damage. Authorities in the Volyn region in northwestern Ukraine said energy infrastructure had sustained damage but did not elaborate. Officials often withhold information on the state of the power system because of the war. In Mykolaiv in the south, two people were killed in the overnight drone attack, the regional governor said. Blasts shook the southeastern city of Zaporizhzhia and the Black Sea port of Odesa, Reuters witnesses said. More blasts were reported in the regions of Kryvyi Rih in the south and Rivne in the west. 'Russia launched one of the largest air attacks: drones and missiles against peaceful cities, sleeping civilians, critical infrastructure,' said Foreign Minister Andrii Sybiha. He described the strike as Moscow's 'true response' to leaders who had interacted with President Vladimir Putin, an apparent swipe at German Chancellor Olaf Scholz, who placed a phone call to the Russian leader on Friday for the first time since late 2022. NATO member Poland, which borders Ukraine to the west, said it had scrambled its air force within its airspace as a security precaution due to the Russian attack, which it said used cruise missiles, ballistic missiles and drones. Poland 'activated all available forces and resources at his disposal, the on-duty fighter pairs were scrambled, and the ground-based air defense and radar reconnaissance systems reached the highest state of readiness,' the operational command of its armed forces posted on X. Ukraine's air force urged residents to take cover, providing regular updates on the progress of Russian cruise, ballistic and hypersonic missiles it said were hurtling through Ukrainian air space. In Kyiv, the roof of a residential building caught fire due to falling debris and at least two people were hurt, city officials said on the Telegram messaging app. 'Emergency services were dispatched to the scene,' Kyiv's Mayor Vitali Klitschko said. Russia last conducted a major missile strike on Kyiv on August 26, when officials said it fired a salvo of more than 200 drones and missiles across the country in an attack that attack killed seven people.	https://www.voanews.com/a/russia-targets-ukraine-s-power-grid-in-massive-missile-strike-officials-say/7866742.html	2024-11-17T01:10:08-08:00	
Lion cub evacuated from war-torn Lebanon to South African sanctuary	beirut — When Sara first arrived at her rescuers' home, she was sick, tired, and was covered in ringworms and signs of abuse all over her little furry body. After spending two months in a small Beirut apartment with an animal rights group, the 4-and-half-month-old lion cub arrived Friday at a wildlife sanctuary in South Africa after a long journey on a yacht and planes, escaping both Israeli airstrikes and abusive owners. Sara is the fifth lion cub to be evacuated from Lebanon by rescue group Animals Lebanon since Hezbollah and Israel began exchanging fire a day after the October 7 attack in southern Israel by Hamas that ignited the war in Gaza last year. Animals Lebanon first discovered Sara on social media channels in July. Her owner, a Lebanese man in the ancient city of Baalbek, posted bombastic videos of himself parading with the cub on TikTok and Instagram. Under Lebanese law, it is prohibited to own wild and exotic animals. The lion cub was 'really just being used as showing off,' said Jason Mier, executive director of Animals Lebanon. In mid-September, the group finally retrieved her after filing a case with the police and judiciary, who interrogated her owner and forced him to give up the feline. Soon after that, Israel launched an offensive against the Lebanese militant group Hezbollah — after nearly a year of low-level conflict — and Baalbek came under heavy bombardment. Mier and his team were able to extract Sara from Baalbek weeks before Israel launched its aerial bombardment campaign on the ancient city, and move her to an apartment in Beirut's busy commercial Hamra district. She was supposed to fly to South Africa in October, but international airlines stopped flights to Lebanon as Israeli jets and drones hit sites close to the country's only airport. Hezbollah began firing rockets across the border into Israel in support of its ally, Hamas, on October 8, 2023, a day after Palestinian militants staged the deadly surprise incursion into southern Israel. Israel responded with shelling and airstrikes. Beginning in mid-September, Israel launched an intense aerial bombardment of much of Lebanon, followed by a ground invasion. Rescue saves trapped pets Before the conflict, Animals Lebanon was active in halting animal trafficking and the exotic pet trade, saving over two dozen big cats from imprisonment in lavish homes and sending them to wildlife sanctuaries. Since the war started, Animals Lebanon has also been rescuing pets that have been trapped in damaged apartments as hundreds of thousands of Lebanese fled bombardment — almost 1,000 over the past month alone. 'Lots are still in our care because the owners of these animals are still displaced,' Mier said. 'So we can't expect the person to take this animal back when he might be living on the street or in a school.' Before the conflict escalated, the rights group was able to move around the country more freely as the fighting largely remained in southern Lebanon along the border with Israel. But things became more difficult as airstrikes became more frequent and spread over wider swathes of the country. Unaware of the war around her, Sara thrived. She was fed a platter of raw meat daily and grew to 40 kilograms (88 pounds). She cuddled every morning with Mier's wife Maggie, also an animal rights activist. But the activists faced a major obstacle: How would they get her out of Lebanon? Donations fund her journey Animals Lebanon collected donations from supporters and rights groups around the world to put Sara on a small yacht to take her to Cyprus. From there, she flew to the United Arab Emirates before her long journey ended in Cape Town. Days before her evacuation Sara played in one of the bedrooms at Mier's apartment, with cushions and chew toys scattered. Thursday at dawn, she arrived to the port of Dbayeh, just north of Beirut. Mier and his team were relieved, but also struggling to hold back their tears at her departure. Mier anticipates Sara will be held for monitoring and disease-control, but soon will be part of a community of other lions. 'Then she'll be integrated with two recent lions that we've sent from Lebanon, so she'll make a nice group of three hopefully,' he said. 'That's where she will live out the rest of her life. That is the best option for her.'	https://www.voanews.com/a/hold-for-wknd-lion-cub-evacuated-from-war-torn-lebanon-to-south-african-sanctuary-/7866074.html	2024-11-17T00:00:11-08:00	
Chinese social media reels over woman's illegal surrogacy case	BEIJING/HONG KONG — A 22-year-old Chinese woman's account of how she was lured into the country's illegal surrogacy industry before suffering a miscarriage went viral on Chinese social media this week and raised heated debates over women's rights and social inequality. Surrogacy is banned in China, and authorities have vowed to severely crack down on illegal practices, including the buying and selling of sperm, egg and surrogacy services. The incident comes as Chinese authorities grapple with how to increase the country's birth rate as more young couples put off having children or opt to have none. China's population fell for a second consecutive year in 2023 and Beijing in October rallied local governments to direct resources towards fixing China's population crisis to create a 'birth-friendly' society. Zhang Jing, 22, told state-backed Phoenix TV magazine that she donated her eggs out of financial desperation and then agreed to 'rent out her uterus' to be impregnated for a total of 30,000 yuan ($4,152). If she 'successfully' delivered the baby, she would be paid a total of 240,000 yuan. At five months pregnant, she experienced severe complications and had to have an abortion. Zhang's story amassed more than 86 million views and 10,000 comments on Chinese social media platform Weibo, with the hashtag '#2000s-born Surrogate Miscarriage Girl Speaks Out#.' The majority of comments strongly opposed surrogacy. Some warned that legalizing surrogacy in China could lead to increased competition that would lower compensation and further devalue women. 'No woman could escape this if surrogacy were legalized,' one user wrote, while another said, 'Legalizing surrogacy would drive down prices and commodify women.' Zhang's story ignited calls for a more thorough crackdown on illegal surrogacy by authorities, with some commenters warning that allowing the black market to continue to operate could even normalize human organ trafficking. 'Life should not be traded as a commodity,' one user wrote. 'If this extends to the sale of organs, it will only get darker and darker, and women will have no future.' The incident comes a few weeks after a 28-year-old pregnant woman who acted as a surrogate in China's southwestern city of Chengdu was allegedly abandoned by her surrogacy agency.	https://www.voanews.com/a/chinese-social-media-reels-over-young-woman-s-illegal-surrogacy-case-/7864732.html	2024-11-16T23:58:16-08:00	
Theater festival offers solace in Burkina Faso, a nation torn by violence	OUGADOUGOU, Burkina Faso — The last three years have been tough for Fanta Charlotte Dabone, a mother of three from the conflict-battered West African country of Burkina Faso. She fled her village after it was attacked by extremists, leaving her husband and her farm behind. Since then, she has been moving from place to place, struggling to pay rent and to buy enough food for her children, including a 2-year-old toddler. But last month, she got to be a queen. Every day for a week, together with dozens of other Burkinabe men and women who have been displaced by extremist violence, she swirled, danced and chanted for almost two hours in front of captivated audiences at Recreatrales, an international theater festival held in Ouagadougou, the country's capital. 'I was so happy about it,' she said. 'I don't even know how to explain how it felt.' Burkina Faso, a landlocked nation of 23 million in Sahel, an arid strip of land south of the Sahara, used to be known for its bustling arts scene, including renowned film and theater festivals, and its sophisticated craftsmanship. But in recent years, the country has become the symbol of the security crisis in the region. It has been shaken by violence from extremist groups and the government forces fighting them, much of it spilling over the border with Mali, and by two ensuing military coups. The military junta, which took power by force in 2022, failed to provide the stability it promised. Instead, the situation deteriorated: According to conservative estimates, more than 60% of the country is now outside of government control, more than 2 million people have lost their homes and almost 6.5 million need humanitarian aid to survive. The country's leader, Capt. Ibrahim Traore, installed a system of de-facto censorship, where those critical of the regime disappear or get forcefully drafted into the army, and where even friends are afraid to discuss politics with each other. But against all odds, last month the Bougsemtenga district in the capital turned into a festival grounds to host Recreatrales for the 13th time. Bougsemtenga derives its name from 'bougtenga,' which means 'happiness district' in Moore, one of the local languages. True to its origins, this year its streets were transformed into a dreamy universe, resembling a crossover between a traditional village festival and 'Alice in Wonderland.' More than 150 African and European artists performed and over 4,500 theater lovers were able to escape the country's grim reality, if just for a little while. Improvised theater stages were constructed inside people's courtyards. The streets were decorated with colorful lights and abstract sculptures made by locals from plastic bottles and scraps of wax-printed fabrics. Residents put up hand decorated stands, selling beer and meat sticks to multinational crowds of theatergoers, ranging from Western diplomats to local mechanics. The ticket booth was a giant frog, its mouth wide open. Aristide Tarnagda, the festival's artistic director, said he was convinced that regardless of the insecurity engulfing the country, the festival had to take place as planned. Theater is an affirmation of 'the primacy of life over death,' Tarnagda said. He added that getting together to perform and watch theatrical productions is a form of resistance against adversity and violence. This is why this year's theme was 'Turning the face to the sun.' 'Humans are capable of love and freedom, but sometimes they forget it,' he said. 'The role of the theater is to remind them about it.' Held every two years, the festival is the culmination of the yearlong work that the organizers do with residents of the Bougsemtenga district, which was home to two theaters and a theater association even before the first Recreatrales in 2002. They run art workshops, including in writing, theater, dance and scenography, for young people from the district and from all of Africa, and organize mentoring sessions and business skills classes for local women. The goal is to get as many people as possible involved, said Odile Sankara, the festival's director. 'It's a working class district,' Sankara said. 'We want to encourage people to take an interest in art, to get a taste of it.' She added: 'Art is a powerful weapon to fight for more light, more humanity and more love,' especially while her country and the whole Sahel region were going through a security and humanitarian crisis. Claude Ilboudo, a 30-year-old from Bougsemtenga, has performed in the opening ceremonies of Recreatrales as a dancer since its first edition. He used to work as a glazier, and dancing was just his past time. But Ilboudo's life took a turn when five years ago he severely injured his right hand at work and could no longer do his job. It was then that Ilboudo discovered a passion for theater and started working for the Recreatrales association. 'Theater saved me,' he said. 'It made me discover what I could do.' This year, Ilboudo was part of the team that prepared the opening play with the internally displaced actors from scratch, including the concept, scenario and choreography. It was also the first time he personally interacted with people who had to flee their homes because of extremist violence. For internally displaced people, theater is not just a tool for therapy, helping them to process trauma, said Sankara, the artistic director. It's a way for a group that has been marginalized and isolated in Burkinabe society to be seen by others. During the play, Dabone, the displaced mother of three, stood at center stage with her toddler tied to her back and spit out a long, white paper strip. It symbolized all the haunting thoughts leaving her body, she said. But the question remains — for how long. 'Life is very difficult,' she said. 'But when I am on the stage, I feel joy. It's when I have to go back home that all these thoughts are coming back to my head.'	https://www.voanews.com/a/theater-festival-offers-solace-in-burkina-faso-a-nation-torn-by-violence/7863407.html	2024-11-16T23:57:28-08:00	
Spy satellite images leads to the site of a historic battle in Iraq	BEIRUT — Declassified 1970s-era U.S. spy satellite imagery has led a British-Iraqi archeological team to what they believe is the site of a seventh-century battle that became decisive in the spread of Islam throughout the region. The Battle of al-Qadisiyah was fought in Mesopotamia — in present-day Iraq — in the A.D. 630s between Arab Muslims and the army of the Sassanid Persian dynasty during a period of Muslim expansion. The Arab army prevailed and continued on its march into Persia, now Iran. A joint team of archeologists from the U.K.'s Durham University and the University of Al-Qadisiyah stumbled across the site while undertaking a remote sensing survey to map the Darb Zubaydah, a pilgrimage route from Iraq's Kufa to Mecca in Saudi Arabia built more than 1,000 years ago. The findings were published Tuesday in the journal Antiquity. While mapping the route, the team noticed that a site some 30 kilometers south of Kufa in Iraq's southern Najaf province — a desert area with scattered plots of agricultural land — had features that closely matched the description of the al-Qadisiyah battle site described in historic texts. William Deadman, a specialist in archaeological remote sensing at Durham University, said the Cold War era satellite images are a commonly used tools by archeologists working in the Middle East, because the older images often show features that have been destroyed or altered and would not show up on present-day satellite images. 'The Middle East has developed so much in the last 50 years, both agricultural expansion and urban expansion,' he said. Some of the distinguishing features at the al-Qadisiyah site, such as a distinctive trench, were 'much more pristine and clear' in the 1970s images, he said. A survey on the ground confirmed the findings and convinced the team that they had correctly identified the site. The key features were a deep trench, two fortresses and an ancient river that was reportedly once forded by elephant-mounted Persian troops, said Jaafar Jotheri, a professor of archeology at the University of Al-Qadisiyah who is part of the team that made the discovery. The survey team also found pottery shards consistent with the time period when the battle took place. Jotheri said that Iraqis of his generation, who grew up under the rule of Saddam Hussein, were all familiar with the battle in minute detail, down to the names of the generals on both sides. The battle at the time had political connotations — Iraq was engaged in a devastating war with Iran through much of the 1980s. Saddam pointed to the Battle of Qadisiyah as a harbinger of victory for Iraq. Like most children growing up in that era, Jotheri said he had watched a popular movie about the battle multiple times as it was on regular rotation on television. In the post-Saddam era, al-Qadisiyah has become something of a political litmus test. Iraqis' views of the battle vary depending on their feelings toward Iran, which has expanded its influence in the country since the 2003 U.S.-led invasion of Iraq that toppled Saddam. 'There is some political and religious context in this battle, because now, of course, we have religious differences, ethnic differences, political differences in Iraq and we read or we view everything based on our … differences,' Jotheri said. But he added, 'We all agree that it is a very important battle, a decisive one, and we all know about it.' The team plans to begin excavations at the site in the coming year, Jotheri said. The discovery comes as part of a broader project launched in 2015 to document endangered archaeological sites in the region. It also comes at the time of a resurgence of archeology in Iraq, a country often referred to as the 'cradle of civilization,' but where archeological exploration has been stunted by decades of conflict that halted excavations and led to the looting of tens of thousands of artifacts. In recent years, the digs have returned and thousands of stolen artifacts have been repatriated.	https://www.voanews.com/a/spy-satellite-images-leads-to-the-site-of-a-historic-battle-in-iraq/7863372.html	2024-11-16T23:56:09-08:00	
Thailand's baby pygmy hippo Moo Deng now has an official song in 4 languages	BANGKOK — In case you can't get enough of the little pygmy hippo Moo Deng from Thailand, there's now an official song featuring the internet's favorite baby animal — released in four languages for her global fans. The upbeat 50-second song Moodeng Moodeng, available in Thai, English, Chinese and Japanese versions, features simple lyrics like 'Moo Deng Moo Deng, boing boing boing/ Mommy Mommy, play with me.' Its music video consists of short clips of the baby hippo bouncing, playing with her keeper or hanging out with her mom, Jona. The catchy number was produced and written by well-known Thai composer Mueanphet Ammara, and released by one of Thailand's largest music companies, GMM Music. Moo Deng — the name literally means 'bouncy pork,' a type of meatball, in Thai — became a global phenomenon just a month after she was unveiled on Facebook by the Khao Kheow Open Zoo in Thailand's southern Chon Buri province. Fans say her name compliments her chaotic personality. Moo Deng likes to 'deng,' or bounce, and her giddy bouncing has appeared all over social media in countless memes. Her image has been used by sports teams and businesses. The hippo, now 4 months old, has drawn a huge number of visitors to the zoo, which is around a two-hour drive away from the capital of Bangkok. The zoo estimated it has received 3,000 to 5,000 visitors a day on average in the past few months, and it's selling clothes, bedding and other merchandise based on Moo Deng. Zoo director Narongwit Chodchoi has said the increasing income from Moo Deng will help its breeding programs for many endangered species like the pygmy hippopotamus, which is threatened by poaching and loss of habitat. The species is native to West Africa and there are only 2,000-3,000 of them left in the wild. The zoo sits on 800 hectares of land and is home to more than 2,000 animals. All four versions of the Moo Deng song are available on YouTube and streaming platforms including Spotify and Apple Music.	https://www.voanews.com/a/thailand-s-baby-pygmy-hippo-moo-deng-now-has-an-official-song-in-4-languages/7863359.html	2024-11-16T23:55:20-08:00	
Australia, US and Japan strengthen military cooperation	Sydney — Australia, Japan and the U.S. on Sunday committed to closer military cooperation in training their forces as the countries deepened their ties in a bid to counter China's military strength. Australia's minister of defense, Richard Marles, hosted U.S. Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin and Japan's Defense Minister Gen Nakatani on Sunday for the trilateral ministers' meeting -- the first to be held in Australia. Under the new agreement, Japan's Amphibious Rapid Deployment Brigade -- an elite marine unit -- will be deployed to Darwin to regularly work and train alongside Australian and U.S. forces. 'It is a very important statement to the region and to the world about the commitment that our three countries have in working with each other,' Marles said. 'This is going to build interoperability between our three countries.' Austin said the partnership would increase intelligence 'surveillance and reconnaissance activities' among the three countries, which will 'advance our goals for a secure and peaceful Indo Pacific.' The U.S. defense chief said he was proud of what his office had done to 'strengthen alliances' in the region and work with 'countries that share the vision of a free and open Indo Pacific.' Canberra has drawn ever nearer to longtime ally the United States, bolstering its military in an attempt to deter the might of a rising China. Besides rapidly developing its surface fleet, Australia plans to deploy stealthy nuclear-powered submarines in a tripartite deal with the United States and Britain known as AUKUS. Some fear U.S. President-elect Donald Trump could jettison or try to rewrite the pact, returning to his 'America first' style of foreign policy. But Australian officials said this month they have a 'great deal of confidence' that the pact will remain.	https://www.voanews.com/a/australia-us-and-japan-strengthen-military-cooperation/7866726.html	2024-11-16T23:18:53-08:00	
Debt-saddled Laos struggles to tame rampant inflation	Vientiane, Laos — Suffocating under a mountain of debt to China, communist Laos is struggling to tame rampant inflation, with food prices rising so sharply that a growing number of households are resorting to foraging. At a market in Vientiane, traders told AFP they have never known business to be so slow, as families have seen the value of their money collapse since COVID-19. While the pandemic and Russia's invasion of Ukraine sent prices around the world spiraling, Laos has found itself incapable of putting the brakes on inflation. Prices rocketed 23% in 2022 and 31% last year, while they are on course for 25% this year, according to the Asian Development Bank. Families in particular have been hit hard as the cost of basic staples such as rice, sugar, oil and chicken doubled last year. A growing number of households are so desperate for food that they are now having to forage to supplement their diets, according to a World Bank household survey earlier this year. At Vientiane's morning market, a gold trader said that where customers used to come to buy necklaces, rings and earrings for special occasions, now all anyone wants is to sell their valuables to raise cash. 'I sometimes sit all day and nobody buys my gold,' the 45-year-old told AFP last month, speaking on condition of anonymity because talking to foreign media in authoritarian, one-party Laos is risky. 'My shop used to be busy but now nobody buys gold -- they all come to sell it to get money.' After 15 years running his shop, the trader said he fears for the future of his business. 'Unsustainable' debt Despite three decades of consistent economic growth, Laos remains one of the poorest countries in Asia, with limited transport infrastructure and a low-skilled workforce mostly employed in agriculture. Life expectancy is just 69 years and the Asian Development Bank says that nearly 1 in 3 children under 5 is stunted because of malnutrition -- one of the highest rates globally. In recent years, the government has borrowed billions of dollars from neighbor China to fund a $6 billion high-speed railway and a series of major hydropower dams -- aiming to become the 'battery' of Southeast Asia. The World Bank warned in a report last week that public debt -- over $13 billion, or 108% of gross domestic product -- was 'unsustainable.' Servicing the debt is fueling inflation by driving down the value of the kip, which lost half its value against the dollar in 2022, and nearly a fifth in the first nine months of 2024. 'Given Laos' heavy reliance on imports, the kip's depreciation has driven up domestic consumer prices and inflation, squeezing domestic demand and slowing economic recovery,' Poh Lynn Ng, an economist with the ASEAN+3 Macroeconomic Research Office, told AFP. Interest payments totaling $1.7 billion are due in 2024 and an average of $1.3 billion for the next three years, further eroding Laos' foreign exchange reserves. AFP contacted the Laotian finance ministry for comment, but did not receive a response. Response 'too slow' The Bank of Lao PDR has raised interest rates and in August, the government launched a plan aiming to bring inflation below 20% by December. But Vivat Kittiphongkosol of the Joint Development Bank Laos said the government had been 'too slow' to react as problems unfolded. 'To kill this economic problem, you cannot utilize a single transaction and expect it to solve everything. You need to do a lot of things,' he told AFP. The World Bank says the government has brought some stability to its finances, but mainly through debt deferrals and limiting spending on health, education and welfare. Alex Kremer, the World Bank Country Manager for Laos, warned these austerity measures would have damaging long-term consequences. 'Continued underinvestment in human capital will damage the country's long-term productivity and its future ability to compete in regional markets,' he said. Instead, the World Bank has urged the government to boost revenue by cutting tax breaks -- and also to try to restructure its debt. Though small, Laos is too important to Beijing to be allowed to fail, JDB's Vivat said, both politically and as a key leg in the Belt and Road Initiative route that aims to connect southwest China ultimately to Singapore. A Chinese foreign ministry spokesperson told AFP Beijing was doing 'all it can to help Laos ease its debt burden.' But Laotians can expect more pain in the short term, with the ADB predicting inflation will stay above 20% until the end of next year at least.	https://www.voanews.com/a/debt-saddled-laos-struggles-to-tame-rampant-inflation/7866719.html	2024-11-16T22:03:42-08:00	
Trump in New York for UFC fight at Madison Square Garden	NEW YORK — U.S. President-elect Donald Trump celebrated his election victory on Saturday night by attending an Ultimate Fighting Championship event with billionaire friend Elon Musk and cheering fans at a heavily guarded Madison Square Garden in New York City. Known by some in the mixed martial arts world as the 'Combatant in Chief,' Trump counts UFC President Dana White as a close friend and considers fans of the sport part of his political base. Trump sat between White and Musk and paid rapt attention to the fights. He entered the arena to loud music and waved to the crowd, many of whom returned the gesture. Among those joining him were House of Representatives Speaker Mike Johnson, Tesla CEO Musk, a close Trump adviser, singer Kid Rock and Robert F. Kennedy Jr., whom he plans to nominate for secretary of health and human services. His visit to the storied Manhattan arena brought him back to the scene of a controversial campaign rally he held there on October 27, when a warm-up comedian mocked Puerto Rico as a 'floating island of garbage.' Saturday's headline event in the octagon at UFC 309 was a battle for the undisputed heavyweight championship of the world between Jon Jones and Stipe Miocic. A Trump aide posted a photo on social media showing Trump watching some of the undercard fights while seated on his plane next to Kennedy. A handful of visitors in Madison Square Garden, an arena with a seating capacity of nearly 20,000, wore red 'Make America Great Again' hats. One of them, Sean Allen, 22, traveled to the event from Monroe in upstate New York, where he lives and works for a county department. He said he had voted for Trump and borrowed his MAGA hat from a friend after learning that the Republican president-elect, who won a decisive victory on November 5 over Democratic Vice President Kamala Harris, might come to the fight. 'I’d never voted before. That was my first time voting,' Allen said, adding that he could have voted at the previous election but did not care about politics. 'When I woke up, I was like, 'OK, wow, Trump won big.'' Nicholas Defilippo, 39, another visitor in a MAGA hat, also put it on to express his support for Trump after voting for him. Defilippo lives in New Jersey and works in law enforcement. 'He’s the most courageous man on the planet,' he said of Trump. The president-elect's self-styled 'Trump Force One' plane left Palm Beach airport shortly after nightfall for the two-hour flight. It was only the second time Trump has left the Palm Beach, Florida, area since winning the presidential election on November 5. The 78-year-old Republican flew to Washington on Wednesday to meet with President Joe Biden at the White House and has otherwise been filling Cabinet positions for his incoming administration from his oceanfront Mar-a-Lago resort. A heavy security presence was in place around Madison Square Garden.	https://www.voanews.com/a/trump-in-new-york-for-ufc-fight-at-madison-square-garden/7866718.html	2024-11-16T21:36:38-08:00	
Josep Borrell wraps up tumultuous time as EU's top diplomat	Brussels — Josep Borrell took a deep breath as the train rumbled across Ukraine at the end of his final visit after five tumultuous years as the EU's foreign policy chief. 'I feel a certain nostalgia,' the 77-year-old Spaniard said, hunching forward to be heard over the noise of the tracks. 'We've been working closely with these people, who are great people, who are fighting for their survival,' he said. 'And who knows what's going to happen with them?' The job of EU top diplomat has often been seen as thankless — trying to coordinate the sometimes radically opposed positions of 27 countries, each jealously guarding their own foreign policy. But Borrell's tenure, wrapping up next month, has thrust him into the center of some of the most consequential events in recent world history. He has helped steer the bloc's response to the COVID pandemic, Russia's invasion of Ukraine and war in the Middle East. Ukraine war It was Moscow's all-out assault in February 2022 that upended European security and came to dominate his time at the helm. Borrell, a Socialist former Spanish foreign minister with more than 40 years of political experience, immediately pushed for the EU to pay for weapons deliveries to a country at war, a longstanding red line for the bloc. 'This was a breakthrough in the way we behaved.' Since then, the EU has spent billions more on arming Ukraine and Russia has been hit by repeated rounds of unprecedented sanctions despite regular obstacles from reluctant EU states such as Hungary. While the Ukraine crisis has revealed the EU's willingness to act, the war in Gaza by contrast has been the most painful episode for Borrell. Since Israel unleashed its devastating offensive after the October 7, 2023, attack by Hamas, the EU has had no influence to curb the suffering, with its member states deeply divided over the conflict. He said the refusal by member states supportive of Israel to do more has damaged the EU on the global stage. 'My biggest frustration is not being able to make it understood that a violation of international law is a violation of international law, whoever does it,' Borrell said. 'Break taboos' The EU's High Representative for Foreign Affairs is constrained by how far member states are willing to go, and a simple statement can take days of wrangling. Borrell has frequently angered EU capitals by going beyond their agreed positions. 'One has to break taboos,' he said. 'Agreed language most of the time says nothing. We agree on saying nothing.' Critics, and there are plenty in sharp-elbowed Brussels, say Borrell has not helped his case, with numerous gaffes and some tactical missteps. A low point of his tenure was a disastrous trip to Moscow in early 2021 when he was caught in a diplomatic ambush and failed to push back against Russia's foreign minister, Sergei Lavrov. But as Moscow's assault on Ukraine played out, he proved a fast learner, said Gabrielius Landsbergis, foreign minister of Lithuania, one of the Baltic states wary of nearby Russia. 'We witnessed a transformation from Russia-threat agnostic into Russia hawk — who could very well come from the Baltics,' he told AFP. 'All things pass' On Borrell’s final trip to Ukraine, he held talks with President Volodymyr Zelenskyy, visited a drone factory, and headed to a defensive position near Russia's border. 'It generates a lot of adrenaline,' he said, to explain how he has kept up with the pace. Despite the weight on his shoulders, he said there have been moments of joy. He pointed to the warm welcome he received on his final Ukraine visit, appreciation from some Palestinians and being able to help repatriate hundreds of thousands of Europeans during the pandemic. As he leaves the stage, the global situation looks perilous, with a new U.S. administration heralding challenges for Europe, Russia advancing in Ukraine and war raging in the Middle East. Borrell is to be replaced in the job by former Estonian Prime Minister Kaja Kallas, 47, who is expected to bring a more tightly controlled style. 'She will perform very well, and she will be very happy, and she will suffer less than me,' he said. 'I wish her the best.'	https://www.voanews.com/a/josep-borrell-wraps-up-tumultuous-time-as-eu-s-top-diplomat/7866717.html	2024-11-16T21:17:58-08:00	
Flash bombs fired at Netanyahu home land without injury, damage	CAIRO — Two flash bombs were fired toward Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's home in the northern Israeli town of Caesarea on Saturday and fell into the garden, police said. Neither Netanyahu nor his family were present and there was no damage reported, it added in a statement. Israeli Defense Minister Israel Katz said the incident crossed 'all red lines' in a post on X early on Sunday. 'It is not possible for the Prime Minister of Israel, who is threatened by Iran and its proxies who are trying to assassinate him, to be subject to the same threats from home,' Katz said. He also called on security and judicial agencies to take the necessary steps. Israel's President Isaac Herzog condemned the incident in a post on X and said an investigation was under way. 'The incitement against Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu crosses all boundaries. Throwing a flash bomb into his house tonight is crossing another red line,' Security Minister Itamar Ben-Gvir also said on X. In October, a drone was launched toward the premier's home in Caesarea, without causing any harm. To the north, Israeli forces have been trading fire with Lebanon's armed Hezbollah group since October 2023.

Bela Karolyi, controversial Olympic gymnasts coach, dies at 82	Bela Karolyi, the charismatic if polarizing gymnastics coach who turned young women into champions and the United States into an international power in the sport, has died. He was 82. USA Gymnastics said Karolyi died Friday. No cause of death was given. Karolyi and wife, Martha, trained multiple Olympic gold medalists and world champions in the U.S. and Romania, including Nadia Comaneci and Mary Lou Retton. 'A big impact and influence on my life,' Comaneci, who was just 14 when Karolyi coached her to gold for Romania at the 1976 Montreal Olympics, posted on Instagram. Yet Karolyi's strident methods sometimes came under fire, most pointedly during the height of the Larry Nassar scandal. When the disgraced former USA Gymnastics team doctor was effectively given a life sentence after pleading guilty to sexually assaulting gymnasts and other athletes with his hands under the guise of medical treatment, over a dozen former gymnasts came forward saying the Karolyis were part of a system that created an oppressive culture that allowed Nassar's behavior to run unchecked for years. While the Karolyis denied responsibility — telling CNN in 2018 they were unaware of Nassar's behavior — the revelations led to them receding from the spotlight. USA Gymnastics eventually exited an agreement to continue to train at the Karolyi Ranch north of Houston, though only after American star Simone Biles took the organization to task for having them train at a site where many experienced sexual abuse. The Karolyis receded from the spotlight in the aftermath after spending 30-plus years as a guiding force in American gymnastics, often basking in success while brushing with controversy in equal measure. The Karolyis defected from Romania to the United States in 1981. Three years later Bela helped guide Retton — all of 16 — to the Olympic all-around title at the 1984 Games in Los Angeles. At the 1996 Games in Atlanta, he memorably helped an injured Kerri Strug off the floor after Strug's vault secured the team gold for the Americans. Karolyi briefly became the national team coordinator for USA Gymnastics women's elite program in 1999 and incorporated a semi-centralized system that eventually turned the Americans into the sport's gold standard. It did not come without a cost. He was removed from the position after the 2000 Olympics when it became apparent his leadership style simply would not work, though he remained around the sport after Martha took over for her husband in 2001. While the Karolyis approach helped the U.S. become a superpower — an American woman has won each of the last six Olympic titles and the U.S. women earned the team gold at the 2012 and 2016 games under Martha Karolyi's leadership — their methods came under fire. Dominique Moceanu, part of the 'Magnificent 7' team that won gold in Atlanta, talked extensively about her corrosive relationship with the Karolyis following her retirement. In her 2012 memoir, Moceanu wrote Bela Karolyi verbally abused her in front of her teammates on multiple occasions. 'His harsh words and critical demeanor often weighed heavily on me,' Moceanu posted on X Saturday. 'While our relationship was fraught with difficulty, some of these moments of hardship helped me forge and define my own path.' Some of Karolyi's most famous students were always among his staunchest defenders. When Strug got married, she and Karolyi took a photo recreating their famous scene from the 1996 Olympics, when he carried her onto the medals podium after she vaulted on a badly sprained ankle. Being a gymnastics pied piper was never Karolyi's intent. Born in Clug, Hungary, (now Romania) on September 13, 1942, he wanted to be a teacher, getting into coaching in college simply so he could spend more time with Martha. After graduating, the couple moved to a small coal-mining town in Transylvania. Looking for a way to keep their students warm and entertained during the long, harsh winters, Karolyi dragged out some old mats and he and his wife taught the children gymnastics. The students showed off their skills to their parents, and the exhibitions soon caught the eye of the Romanian government, which hired the Karolyis to coach the women's national team at a time when the sport was done almost exclusively by adult women, not young girls. Karolyi changed all that, though, bringing a team to the Montreal Olympics with only one gymnast older than 14. It was in Montreal, of course, where the world got its first real glimpse of Karolyi. When a solemn, dark-haired sprite named Nadia Comaneci enchanted the world with the first perfect 10 in Olympic history, a feat she would duplicate six times, Karolyi was there to wrap her in one of his trademark bear hugs. Romania, which had won only three bronzes in Olympic gymnastics before 1976, left Montreal with seven medals, including Comaneci's golds in the all-around, balance beam and uneven bars, and the team silver. Comaneci became an international sensation, the first person to appear on the covers of Sports Illustrated, Time and Newsweek in the same week. Four years later, however, Karolyi was in disgrace. He was incensed by the judging at the Moscow Olympics, which he thought cost Comaneci a second all-around gold, and the Romanian government was horrified that he had embarrassed the Soviet hosts. 'Suddenly, from a position where we've been praised and considered the foremost athletes in the country, I was stigmatized,' he once said. 'I thought they could put me away for political misconduct.' When he and Martha took the Romanian team to New York for an exhibition in March 1981, they were tipped off that they were going to be punished upon their return. Despite not speaking any English and with their then-6-year-old daughter, Andrea, still in Romania, they decided to defect. 'We knew what kind of risks we were taking, because nobody was guaranteeing us anything,' Martha Karolyi once said. 'We started out with a suitcase and a little motel room. From there, it's gradually improved.' The couple made their way to California, where they learned English by watching television and Bela did odd jobs. A chance encounter with Olympic gold medalist Bart Conner — who would later marry Comaneci — at the Los Angeles airport a few months later led to the Karolyis' first coaching job in the United States. Within a year, their daughter had arrived in the U.S. and the Karolyis had their own gym in Houston. It soon became the center of American gymnastics, turning out eight national champions in 13 years. Three years after the Karolyis left Romania, Retton became the first American to win the Olympic all-around title, scoring a perfect 10 on vault to claim gold at the 1984 Games in Los Angeles. Retton also posted the highest score in the team competition as the Americans won the silver, their first team medal since 1948. Four years later, Phoebe Mills, another Karolyi gymnast, won a bronze on balance beam. It was the first individual medal for an American woman at a non-boycotted games. And in 1991, Kim Zmeskal — 'the little Kimbo,' as Bela Karolyi called her — became the first American to win the world all-around title. 'My biggest contribution was giving the kids the faith that they can be the best among the best,' Karolyi once said. 'I knew that if the Americans could understand they were not inferior ... then they can be groomed like international, highly visible athletes.' But as Karolyi's resume grew, so did the criticism. Other coaches were irritated by his brash personality and ability to always find his way into the spotlight. When Retton won gold, Karolyi leaped a barrier — he had an equipment manager's credential, not a coach's — so he could scoop Retton up in a hug — right in front of the TV cameras, of course. He could be a harsh taskmaster, calling his gymnasts names, taunting them for their weight and pushing them to their limits. Even those warm embraces weren't always quite what they seemed. 'A lot of those big bear hugs came with the whisper of 'Not so good,' in our ears,' Retton wrote. Yet Retton and Comaneci remained close with Karolyi, making appearances with him at gymnastics events or sitting with him at competitions. Zmeskal had her wedding at the Karolyi ranch. Karolyi briefly retired after the 1992 Games in Barcelona, where he led the Americans to their first team medal, a bronze, at a non-boycotted Olympics in 44 years. But he kept his gym and summer camps, and by 1994 was again coaching elite-level gymnasts after Zmeskal asked him to help in her attempt to make the Atlanta Games. Zmeskal didn't make the Atlanta squad. But two of Karolyi's other gymnasts, Strug and Moceanu, did, and it was Strug who provided one of the signature moments of the Olympics. The Americans went into their final event in team finals, vault, trying to hold off Russia for their first-ever title at an Olympics or world championships. Despite injuring her left ankle when she fell on her first vault attempt, Strug went ahead with her second attempt, believing — wrongly — the Americans needed her score to clinch the gold. With Karolyi shouting, 'You can do it!' Strug sprinted down the runway, soared high above the vault and landed on both feet — ensuring it was a clean vault — before pulling her left leg up. After saluting the judges, she fell to her knees and had to be carried off the podium. Tests would later show she had two torn ligaments in her ankle. As the rest of the Americans gathered on the podium to receive their gold medals, Karolyi carried Strug back into the arena, cradling her in his arms. But even that drew criticism. Many said Karolyi never should have encouraged Strug to vault on her injured ankle in the first place and then should have stayed out of the spotlight rather than carrying her to the podium. 'Bela is a very tough coach and he gets criticism for that,' Strug said at the time. 'But that's what it takes to become a champion. I don't think it's really right that everyone tries to find the faults of Bela. Anything in life, to be successful, you've got to work really hard.' The Karolyis retired again after the Atlanta Olympics. But after the U.S. women finished last in the medal round at the 1997 world championships, USA Gymnastics asked Bela Karolyi to come back. He agreed — but only if he could implement a semi-centralized training system. Rather than a patchwork system of individual coaches who had their own philosophies, Karolyi would oversee the entire U.S. program. Gymnasts could still train with their own coaches, but there would be regular national team camps to ensure they were meeting established training and performance standards. Though the idea was sound, Karolyi was not the right person to be in charge. Coaches who had been his equal chafed at his heavy-handedness, and were annoyed by his grandstanding. Gymnasts resented his bluster and demands. By the time the Americans left the Sydney Olympics, about the only thing everyone agreed on was that Karolyi needed to step away. He stepped aside and was replaced by his wife. Martha Karolyi's standards were just as high — if not higher — than her husband's, but on the surface, she was more willing to listen to other opinions. 'She's more diplomatic. Absolutely,' Bela Karolyi said before the 2012 Olympics. 'I'm wild. The opposite.'	https://www.voanews.com/a/bela-karolyi-controversial-olympic-gymnasts-coach-dies-at-82-/7866705.html	2024-11-16T19:50:57-08:00	
Early reports say a majority of voters in Gabon cast ballots to end military rule	Yaoundé, Cameroon — Early results indicate a majority of Gabon's 860,000 registered voters cast ballots in favor of a new constitution that could end military rule, according to state TV reports. The results of Saturday's constitutional referendum could end the transitional military government that ousted the Bongo family dynasty after nearly 60 years of rule. An official tally is expected later. Officials say the adoption of the new constitution is one of the major promises made by General Brice Clotaire Oligui Nguema after seizing power in what Gabon's military leaders call a bloodless August 30 coup that liberated the central African state from political bondage. Nguema seized power from Ali Bongo, who was declared the winner of Gabon's August 26 elections with more than 64% of the vote. Gabon’s military said the coup marked an end to the nearly 56-year Bongo dynasty, during which Omer Bongo Ondimba ruled Gabon for 42 years since 1967 and handed power to his son, Ali Bongo, in 2009. Gabon’s military said it deployed troops Saturday to towns and villages and reinforced a dusk-to-dawn curfew from midnight to 5 a.m. to make sure civilians were protected before, during and after the voting. Serge Zeng Ango is executive secretary of the National Union, a political party that campaigned for Gabon citizens to vote in favor of a new constitution during the referendum. Ango said the new constitution will put an end to any chance of another political dynasty where power was passed from father to son, as during the Bongo era. Unlike in the past when power was confiscated by a few people, said Ango, the new constitution is reassuring that ultimate power resides in civilians who can freely vote for their leaders and contribute to the development of their nation. He said those who voted in favor of Gabon's new constitution are happy that article 42 of the law states that at the end of the term of office, the president, his or her spouse and descendants cannot be candidates for succession. But opposition and civil society say the draft constitution should have prohibited military ruler General Nguema from running for president. They said military leaders prepared the constitution to grant excessive power to the president because they want Nguema to maintain his grip on power. Jean-Victor Mouanga Mbadinga is a former presidential aspirant and leader of the Movement for Social Emancipation of Gabon's civilians, one of Gabon's political parties. He said by suppressing the post of prime minister, the fundamental law of 173 articles transforms Gabon into a country where the president has too much power. He said it is unfortunate that Gabon is increasing the presidential term limit from 5 to 7 years, renewable once, when in the United States of America — a world democracy that the central African state should emulate — presidents serve for no longer than two elected 4-year terms. Mbadinga said it is abnormal for Gabon's constitution to give powers to the president to either dissolve parliament, which is the legislative arm of government, and to hire and fire a vice president at will. Gabon's opposition and civil society said they will challenge the outcome of the referendum in the courts but did not give further details. Gabon's government said Saturday's referendum was free, fair and transparent. Officials said the new constitution would protect individual liberties, unlike during the Bongo father and son era. International observers from the African Union and the Central African Economic and Monetary Community said that, except for voting that began late due to the late opening of polling stations, the elections were peaceful and transparent. Hundreds of voters turned out at polling stations starting at 6 a.m. local time, according to observers. Gabon's military leaders said final results of the constitutional referendum will be released by the constitutional court, but neither provided a specific time or date. After the publication of referendum results, Nguema said, Gabon will prepare its electoral laws in February, create an elections management body, and organize presidential, parliamentary and local elections in August 2025 to end a two-year transitional period. The military ruler has not said if Nguema will be a candidate or not, but the constitution in this referendum does not prevent him from running for president.	https://www.voanews.com/a/early-reports-say-a-majority-of-voters-in-gabon-cast-ballots-to-end-military-rule/7866697.html	2024-11-16T19:06:08-08:00	
Iran says 'limited opportunity' for nuclear diplomacy	Tehran, Iran — Iran's foreign minister said Saturday in an interview that an opportunity exists for nuclear negotiations with the West, but that it is 'limited.' Abbas Araghchi's comments come after the head of the U.N. nuclear watchdog, Rafael Grossi, visited the Islamic Republic for talks with high-ranking officials. 'There is still an opportunity for diplomacy, although this opportunity is not much, it is a limited opportunity,' Araghchi said of Iran's nuclear program in the interview with state television. The visit by the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) director general is seen as one of the last chances for diplomacy before U.S. President-elect Donald Trump returns to the White House in January. During his first term between 2017 and 2021, Trump imposed a policy known as 'maximum pressure' against Iran. This included Washington tearing up a deal on Iran's nuclear program that had been reached under his predecessor, Barack Obama in 2015. Trump reintroduced heavy sanctions, which the current U.S. administration of Joe Biden has maintained. The 2015 deal provided for an easing of international sanctions, in exchange for guarantees that Iran does not seek to acquire nuclear weapons — a charge Tehran has constantly denied it is pursuing. 'Our nuclear path in the next year will be a sensitive and complicated one, but we are prepared for any scenario and conditions,' Araghchi said Saturday. He said Iran will be ready for both 'confrontation' and 'cooperation,' whichever path the other side decides to follow. During his visit the IAEA chief held talks with Araghchi as well as with President Masoud Pezeshkian and Iran's nuclear chief Mohammad Eslami. Grossi also toured the key uranium enrichment plants of Natanz and Fordo in central Iran. His visit comes ahead of a meeting of the IAEA's board of governors later this month at which Britain, France and Germany could propose a new resolution critical of Iran. In his interview Saturday, Araghchi warned against such a measure. 'If a resolution is passed against us, it will face reciprocal actions by Iran. We will take new measures in our nuclear program that they will certainly not like.' Expectations have run high that Trump will take a harder line with Tehran when he takes office in January. However, The New York Times reported Thursday that Trump's tech billionaire ally Elon Musk had met the Iranian ambassador to the U.N. in a bid to defuse tensions. Araghchi in his interview Saturday denied that such a meeting had taken place. 'There has been no meeting between the representative of Iran and Elon Musk,' he said. 'Now is not the time for such meetings. It is not wise, and there is not a will for it.'	https://www.voanews.com/a/iran-says-limited-opportunity-for-nuclear-diplomacy-/7866700.html	2024-11-16T18:45:36-08:00

Mali: Civilian PM asks junta to discuss end of transition period	Bamako, Mali — Mali's civilian Prime Minister Choguel Kokalla Maiga called Saturday on the country's military leaders to discuss ending the so-called 'transition' period, in a rare criticism of the ruling junta. The country has been ruled by the military since successive coups in 2020 and 2021. In June 2022, the junta pledged to hold elections and hand power back to civilians by the end of March 2024, but then postponed the vote indefinitely. 'The Transition was supposed to end on March 26, 2024. But it was postponed indefinitely, unilaterally, without debate within the government,' Maiga told supporters of his M5-RFP movement, in a speech published on Facebook by local media. 'Even today, there is no debate on the issue. The prime minister is reduced to relying on press rumors or a haphazard interpretation of the actions of the minister of territorial administration and decentralization,' he added. 'The specter of confusion and confusion hangs over the transition, with, even if I have to repeat myself, the risks of serious challenges and risks of going backwards,' continued Maiga. However, he praised the armed forces and called for unity and 'respect for political authorities, the guarantor of strength and stability.' In May, the M5-RFP movement issued a statement openly criticizing Mali’s military leaders after they failed to meet a deadline to return power to civilians. An ally of Maiga who signed the statement was sentenced to a year in prison in July, before being released in September after his sentence was commuted. Eleven people who had criticized the junta's actions were arrested in June for 'conspiring against legal authorities.' Since 2012, Mali has been plunged into a political and security crisis, fueled by attacks by jihadi groups and other armed groups, as well as clashes with separatist forces in the north of the country.	https://www.voanews.com/a/mali-civilian-pm-asks-junta-to-discuss-end-of-transition-period/7866686.html	2024-11-16T17:44:15-08:00	
Health officials report first case of new form of mpox in US	NEW YORK — Health officials said Saturday they have confirmed the first U.S. case of a new form of mpox that was first seen in eastern Congo. The person had traveled to eastern Africa and was treated in Northern California upon return, according to the California Department of Public Health. Symptoms are improving and the risk to the public is low. The individual was isolating at home and health workers are reaching out to close contacts as a precaution, the state health department said. Mpox is a rare disease caused by infection with a virus that's in the same family as the one that causes smallpox. It is endemic in parts of Africa, where people have been infected through bites from rodents or small animals. Milder symptoms can include fever, chills and body aches. In more serious cases, people can develop lesions on the face, hands, chest and genitals. Earlier this year, scientists reported the emergence of a new form of mpox in Africa that was spread through close contact including through sex. It was widely transmitted in eastern and central Africa. But in cases that were identified in travelers outside of the continent, spread has been very limited, according to the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. More than 3,100 confirmed cases have been reported since late September, according to the World Health Organization. Most of them have been in three African countries — Burundi, Uganda, and the Democratic Republic of the Congo. Since then, cases of travelers with the new mpox form have been reported in Germany, India, Kenya, Sweden, Thailand, Zimbabwe, and the United Kingdom. Health officials earlier this month said the situation in Congo appears to be stabilizing. The Africa CDC has estimated Congo needs at least 3 million mpox vaccines to stop the spread, and another 7 million vaccines for the rest of Africa. The spread is mostly through sexual transmission as well as through close contact among children, pregnant women and other vulnerable groups. The current outbreak is different from the 2022 global outbreak of mpox where gay and bisexual men made up most of the cases.	https://www.voanews.com/a/health-officials-report-first-case-of-new-form-of-mpox-in-us/7866681.html	2024-11-16T17:33:09-08:00	
Trump chooses oil industry executive as energy secretary	U.S. President-elect Donald Trump has selected Chris Wright, the founder of an oilfield services company, to lead the Energy Department, as his new administration continues to take shape. The transition team officially announced the choice on Saturday afternoon. On Friday, Trump announced a new National Energy Council to be led by his Interior Department pick, former North Dakota Governor Doug Burgum. In this role, Burgum will direct a panel that crosses all executive branch agencies involved in energy permitting, production, generation, distribution, regulation and transportation, Trump said in a statement. As chairman of the National Energy Council, Burgum will have a seat on the National Security Council, the president-elect said. Wright, the CEO of Liberty Energy based in Denver, Colorado, has no political experience. He is an advocate for the oil and gas industry, including fracking. In 2019, he drank fracking liquid to show that it was not dangerous. According to a March 2024 report by the U.S. Energy Information Administration, the U.S. has produced more crude oil than any nation at any time, according to its International Energy Statistics, for the past six years in a row. Average monthly U.S. crude oil production established a monthly record high in December 2023 at more than 13.3 million barrels per day. Earlier announcements The Trump-Vance transition team announced Steven Cheung will return to the Trump White House as communications director. He held the same position for the Trump-Vance 2024 presidential campaign and served in the White House during Trump's first term as director of strategic response. On Friday evening, Trump announced that his campaign press secretary, Karoline Leavitt, would be his White House press secretary. She served as assistant press secretary in his previous term in office. Trump has swiftly named an array of political loyalists to key Cabinet positions. Most of them are likely to win quick Senate approval after confirmation hearings. Having won majorities in both the U.S. House of Representatives and the U.S. Senate, Republicans are set to take full control of the U.S. government by the third week in January. 'Republicans in the House and Senate have a mandate,' newly reelected House Speaker Mike Johnson said earlier this week. 'The American people want us to implement and deliver that 'America First' agenda.' Trump will be sworn in as the country's 47th president on January 20, two weeks after the new Congress has been seated. The 78-year-old Trump campaigned on a sweeping agenda that Democrats will be largely powerless to stop. Republicans will have a 53-47 edge in the Senate, and the tie-breaking vote of Vice President-elect JD Vance in the event of a 50-50 stalemate on any legislative proposal. Republicans have secured at least 218 seats in the 435-member House, pending the outcome of seven undecided elections for two-year terms. During his bid to win a second, nonconsecutive four-year term, Trump called for the massive deportation of millions of undocumented migrants living in the United States to their home countries, an extension and expansion of 2017 tax cuts that are set to expire at the end of 2025, further deregulation of businesses, a curb on climate controls, and prosecution of his political opponents. Senator John Thune of South Dakota, newly elected by his fellow Republicans as the Senate majority leader, said, 'This Republican team is united. We are on one team. We are excited to reclaim the majority and to get to work with our colleagues in the House to enact President Trump's agenda.' Trump also has called on Senate Republican leaders to allow him to make 'recess appointments,' which could occur when the chamber is not in session and would erase the need for time-consuming and often contentious confirmation hearings. Despite the likelihood that most of his nominees will be approved, Trump this week named four who immediately drew disparaging assessments from several Democrats and some Republicans for their perceived lack of credentials. They are former Representative Matt Gaetz as attorney general; former Democratic congresswoman turned Republican Tulsi Gabbard as director of national intelligence; former junior military officer and Fox News host Pete Hegseth as defense secretary; and former presidential candidate and anti-vaccine activist Robert F. Kennedy Jr. to lead the Health and Human Services Department. The blowback presages tough confirmation fights for the four in the Senate, which reviews the appointments of top-level officials and then votes to confirm them or, on occasion, reject them, forcing the White House to make another choice. The appointment of Gaetz, 42, could prove particularly problematic, with some senators openly questioning whether he can win a 51-vote majority to assume the government's top law enforcement position. A House ethics committee probe was in the final stages of investigating whether he engaged in sexual misconduct and illicit drug use when he announced his resignation from the chamber late Wednesday, ending the probe. The Justice Department that Gaetz hopes to lead had decided not to pursue criminal charges. Gaetz has denied all wrongdoing. Gabbard, 43, has been criticized for her lack of direct experience in intelligence and accused of disseminating pro-Russian disinformation. If confirmed, she would be tasked with overseeing 18 U.S. intelligence agencies. She won over Trump with her switch from being a one-time Democratic House member from Hawaii to changing parties and staunchly advocating for his election. Critics have assailed Hegseth, a 44-year-old decorated former military officer, as someone who lacks managerial experience in the business world. A weekend anchor on Fox News, he has voiced his opinions on military operations, including his opposition to women serving in combat roles. A descendant of the Kennedy family political dynasty, Kennedy, 70, for years has been one of the country's most prominent proponents of anti-vaccine views. He also opposed water fluoridation. On Thursday, Trump also selected former Securities and Exchange Commission Chairman Jay Clayton to be Manhattan's top federal prosecutor, and former Representative Doug Collins to be secretary of the Department of Veterans Affairs. Trump named one of his personal criminal defense attorneys, Todd Blanche, to be deputy attorney general, and another of his attorneys, D. John Sauer, to be solicitor general. The Associated Press provided some information for this report.	https://www.voanews.com/a/trump-chooses-oil-industry-executive-as-energy-secretary-/7866658.html	2024-11-16T16:48:30-08:00	
Ahead of his meeting with Biden, Xi champions free trade and multilateralism	LIMA, PERU — Chinese President Xi Jinping presented himself as a defender of 'multilateralism and an open economy,' Saturday at the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation Forum in Lima, Peru. In a speech just hours ahead of his meeting with U.S. President Joe Biden on the sidelines of APEC, Xi urged leaders to 'tear down the walls impeding the flow of trade, investment, technology and services.' Foreign diplomatic sources who spoke under the condition of anonymity told VOA they are concerned that the U.S. would turn more protectionist and isolationist under the incoming Trump administration. President-elect Donald Trump will be inaugurated in January. Under his first term as president, Trump withdrew from various multilateral agreements including the Trans-Pacific Partnership free trade pact and the Paris Climate Accord. He imposed punitive tariffs on China, largely kept in place by the Biden administration, and ramped up trade pressure with other U.S. trading partners including Europe and Japan. During his 2024 campaign, Trump vowed to place tariffs of up to 60% on all Chinese imports, and 10% to 20% on goods from the rest of the world. Xi's narrative on Beijing's role as global defender of free trade loomed over his summit with Biden. The meeting — held at the Chinese delegation's hotel in Lima rather than on neutral ground as is customary — is their last in-person engagement while Biden is in office and part of Biden's farewell tour on the world stage. The White House said that because the U.S. hosted China at the Woodside summit on the sidelines of the APEC meeting in California last year, Beijing chose the location this year. The leaders held their first meeting in 2022 in Bali, at a neutral venue on the sidelines of the G20 summit hosted by Indonesia. At the summit, Biden is set to reiterate his 'longstanding concern' over China's 'unfair trade policies and non-market economic practices' that hurt American workers, said a senior administration official who spoke ahead of the meeting under the condition of anonymity. The president also will be relaying to Xi his 'deep concern' over Beijing's support for Moscow's war against Ukraine and the deployment of North Korean troops to aid Russia, as well as Beijing's increased military activities around Taiwan and the South China Sea. Additionally, Biden is set to warn China over its alleged role in hacking private telecommunications providers used by U.S. government and presidential campaign officials, national security adviser Jake Sullivan told reporters Thursday aboard Air Force One en route to Lima. 'We have made clear over time that we will respond when we see actions taken, in terms of cyberattacks, cyber espionage, cyber intrusions,' Sullivan said. Complicated rivalry Biden has called Xi a 'dictator' in the past, while Xi has accused the U.S. of being the 'biggest source of chaos' in the world. But both leaders have emphasized the importance of stability, and in the past four years they largely have succeeded in managing the complicated rivalry. In their summit last year, Biden and Xi agreed to restart military-to-military communications, in part to manage potential tensions surrounding Taiwan and the South China Sea. At APEC, Xi championed a 'new impetus' toward an 'open Asia-Pacific economy' and supported the group's efforts to move faster toward achieving the Free Trade Area of the Asia-Pacific, a proposed regional free trade agreement between the 21 APEC member economies. China is a member of the Regional Comprehensive Economic Partnership, the largest regional free trade agreement involving 15 countries in Asia and the Pacific. The U.S. is not a member of RCEP. In 2021, Beijing applied for membership in the Comprehensive and Progressive Agreement for Trans-Pacific Partnership. The regional free trade pact initially began as the Trans-Pacific Partnership, promoted in 2015 by then-U.S. President Barack Obama. Trump withdrew the U.S. from TPP in 2017. Following Washington's departure, the TPP eventually became CPTPP – an 11-country bloc that now constitutes one of the largest free trade areas in the world. The Biden administration in 2022 launched the Indo-Pacific Economic Framework, which includes a dozen Indo-Pacific countries. There are no market access or tariff reduction provisions in the framework — trade incentives desired by countries in the region. IPEF is unlikely to continue in its current form under Trump, said Zack Cooper, senior fellow at the American Enterprise Institute. 'But the reality is that many countries in the region have been pretty disappointed by IPEF and so if they see it either go away or change, I don't think they'll be panicked about that possibility,' he told VOA. Sullivan pushes back Xi began his South American tour by inaugurating a mega port in Peru, a $1.3 billion investment by Beijing as it seeks to expand trade and influence on the continent. Sullivan pushed back against the narrative that Beijing has overtaken Washington as the world's main backer of development and infrastructure financing. 'Every time we fly to South America or Africa, the press writes the story: 'China is doing a lot; America is doing a little,'' he said in response to VOA's question. 'And then you look at the numbers behind it — the total stock of American investment in Latin America and the Caribbean — and you compare that to what China is doing. We are, across our private sector and now backed up by tools like the Development Finance Corporation, investing in a wide range of technology, infrastructure, energy, health, and other projects and are an incredibly important player,' he said, noting that the U.S. is investing heavily in Peru, $6.6 billion in 2023. From Lima, Biden heads to the G20 summit in Rio de Janeiro on Sunday, with a brief stop in the Brazilian Amazon to deliver remarks on climate change.	https://www.voanews.com/a/ahead-of-his-meeting-with-biden-xi-champions-free-trade-and-multilateralism/7866484.html	2024-11-16T15:09:42-08:00	
Strike by workers at casino near Las Vegas Strip enters second day	LAS VEGAS, NEVADA — A walkout by hundreds of hospitality workers at a casino near the Las Vegas Strip entered its second day with union members willing to undergo the financial hardships of being out of work as they wait for a new contract. The work stoppage launched Friday at Virgin Hotels Las Vegas is the first open-ended strike in 22 years for the Culinary Workers Union, the largest labor union in Nevada, with about 60,000 members. Union members were on the picket line again Saturday. Workers at the casino also walked off the job for 48 hours earlier this year as negotiations escalated, hoping to pressure Virgin Hotels to agree to a new five-year deal with increased wages and better benefits. The strike comes a year after casinos up and down the Strip narrowly avoided tens of thousands of hospitality workers walking off the job on the weekend the city was set to host its first Formula One race on the famous boulevard. But agreements were reached just before the union's deadline for a strike, giving workers a roughly 32% salary increase over the life of the contract, including a 10% bump in pay in the first year. After the breakthrough deals last November, the Culinary Union quickly reached similar agreements for the rest of its members at major hotel-casinos on the Strip, downtown and at off-Strip properties — except for Virgin Hotels. The contracts on the Strip alone cover more than 40,000 workers. While the union pays striking workers $500 per week for picketing shifts for at least five days, union members at the picket line Friday said that they were expecting financial pain while being out of work. Lee McNamara, a lead dining room cook, said he took a second job for about eight months to save money in anticipation of the strike. 'A strike is hurtful to everybody, but it was a last resort for us,' McNamara said. 'We didn't have anything else we could do. The company wasn't coming our way, and they weren't seeing it our way and they haven't really budged much.' Diana Monjaraz, who works in housekeeping, expects hard times until a new contract comes. 'You have to suffer a little bit to win sometimes,' Monjaraz said. 'You don't get things handed to you right away.' Both the union and Virgin Hotels said negotiations stalled because of disagreements over pay. 'Workers overwhelmingly have chosen a strong Culinary Union contract that guarantees their benefits as the way they want to be protected,' said Bethany Khan, a spokesperson for the union. 'Hundreds of workers are on strike themselves to win these protections.' Virgin Hotels Las Vegas said it was committed to protecting the jobs of workers by ensuring the continued operation of the property. It also said the union 'has bargained in bad faith — repeatedly refusing to engage in meaningful negotiations with Virgin Hotels Las Vegas.' Culinary Union members last went on strike in 2002 for 10 days at the Golden Gate hotel-casino in downtown Las Vegas.	https://www.voanews.com/a/strike-by-workers-at-casino-near-las-vegas-strip-enters-second-day-/7866472.html	2024-11-16T14:22:32-08:00	
Baloch insurgents kill 7 Pakistan troops	ISLAMABAD — Pakistani authorities reported Saturday that seven soldiers and six insurgents were killed in fierce clashes in the troubled southwestern Balochistan. The predawn violence erupted when the insurgents assaulted a security post in Kalat, a mountainous district in the sparsely populated province, according to a late-night Pakistan military statement. It stated that the clashes also injured four assailants but shared no further details. Multiple area security officials reported that at least 18 soldiers were also injured and admitted to hospitals, where some were said to be in critical condition. An outlawed militant group known as the Baloch Liberation Army claimed responsibility for the deadly attack. In a statement, Pakistani Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif condemned the 'terrorist' attack and 'honored the martyred soldiers,' his office said in Islamabad. Balochistan, the largest Pakistani province renowned for its abundant natural resources, has lately experienced a spike in deadly insurgent attacks. The BLA took credit for a suicide bombing last week that targeted a unit of Pakistani troops at the railway station in Quetta, the provincial capital. The powerful blast resulted in the deaths of 27 soldiers and injured many others as they were preparing to depart for a northwestern destination after completing a training session. BLA, listed as a global terrorist organization by the United States, also claimed responsibility for a suicide car bombing that killed two Chinese engineers in the southern Pakistani port city of Karachi last month. The insurgent group, along with several allies, has been waging deadly attacks on Pakistani security forces for years, saying they are fighting for the independence of the province, which shares the country's border with Afghanistan and Iran. Balochistan is home to the China-built and operated strategic Gwadar port on the Arabian Sea, which is at the heart of the multibillion-dollar China-Pakistan Economic Corridor. Both countries hail CPEC as a pivotal component of Beijing's global Belt and Road Initiative. The bilateral project has brought more than $25 billion in Chinese investments over the past decade, building Pakistani roads, power plants, and trade routes to enable China's access to international markets for its landlocked western regions through the Gwadar port. Islamabad and Beijing condemn Baloch insurgents, saying their violent campaign is aimed at disrupting development in impoverished Balochistan and Pakistan at large.	https://www.voanews.com/a/baloch-insurgents-kill-7-pakistan-troops/7866469.html	2024-11-16T13:58:09-08:00	
Indian family froze to death crossing Canada-US border	MINNEAPOLIS, MINNESOTA — On the last night of their lives, Jagdish Patel, his wife and their two young children tried to slip into the U.S. across a near-empty stretch of the Canadian border. Wind chills reached minus 36 Fahrenheit (minus 38 Celsius) that night in January 2022 as the family from India set out on foot to meet a waiting van. They walked amid vast farm fields and bulky snowdrifts, navigating in the black of an almost-moonless night. The driver, waiting in northern Minnesota, messaged his boss: 'Make sure everyone is dressed for the blizzard conditions, please.' Coordinating things in Canada, federal prosecutors say, was Harshkumar Patel, an experienced smuggler nicknamed 'Dirty Harry.' On the U.S. side was Steve Shand, the driver recently recruited by Patel at a casino near their Florida homes, prosecutors say. The two men, whose trial is scheduled to start Monday, are accused of being part of a sophisticated human smuggling operation feeding a fast-growing population of Indians living illegally in the U.S. Both have pleaded not guilty. Over the five weeks the two worked together, documents filed by prosecutors allege they spoke often about the bitter cold as they smuggled five groups of Indians over that quiet stretch of border. '16 degrees cold as hell,' Shand messaged during an earlier trip. 'They going to be alive when they get here?' On the last trip, on Jan. 19, 2022, Shand was to pick up 11 more Indian migrants, including the Patels. Only seven survived. Canadian authorities found the Patels later that morning, dead from the cold. In Jagdish Patel's frozen arms was the body of his 3-year-old son, Dharmik, wrapped in a blanket. Dreams of leaving India The narrow streets of Dingucha, a quiet village in the western Indian state of Gujarat, are spattered with ads to move overseas. 'Make your dream of going abroad come true,' one poster says, listing three tantalizing destinations: 'Canada. Australia. USA.' This is where the family's deadly journey began. Jagdish Patel, 39, grew up in Dingucha. He and his wife, Vaishaliben, who was in her mid-30s, lived with his parents, raising their 11-year-old daughter, Vihangi, and Dharmik. (Patel is a common Indian surname and they are unrelated to Harshkumar Patel.) The couple were schoolteachers, local news reports say. The family was fairly well off by local standards, living in a well-kept, two-story house with a front patio and a wide veranda. 'It wasn't a lavish life,' said Vaibhav Jha, a local reporter who spent days in the village. 'But there was no urgent need, no desperation.' Experts say illegal immigration from India is driven by everything from political repression to a dysfunctional American immigration system that can take years, if not decades, to navigate legally. But much is rooted in economics, and how even low-wage jobs in the West can ignite hopes for a better life. Those hopes have changed Dingucha. Today, so many villagers have gone overseas — legally and otherwise — that blocks of homes stand vacant and the social media feeds of those who remain are filled with old neighbors showing off houses and cars. That drives even more people to leave. 'There was so much pressure in the village, where people grew up aspiring to the good life,' Jha said. Smuggling networks were glad to help, charging fees that could reach $90,000 per person. In Dingucha, Jha said, many families afforded that by selling farmland. Satveer Chaudhary is a Minneapolis-based immigration attorney who has helped migrants exploited by motel owners, many of them Gujaratis. Smugglers with ties to the Gujarati business community have built an underground network, he said, bringing in workers willing to do low- or even no-wage jobs. 'Their own community has taken advantage of them,' Chaudhary said. Illegal immigration from India increases The pipeline of illegal immigration from India has long existed but has increased sharply along the U.S.-Canada border. The U.S. Border Patrol arrested more than 14,000 Indians on the Canadian border in the year ending September 30, which amounted to 60% of all arrests along that border and more than 10 times the number two years ago. By 2022, the Pew Research Center estimates there were more than 725,000 Indians living illegally in the U.S., behind only Mexicans and El Salvadorans. In India, investigating officer Dilip Thakor said media attention had led to the arrest of three men in the Patel case, but hundreds of such cases don't even reach the courts. With so many Indians trying to get to the U.S., the smuggling networks see no need to warn off customers. They 'tell people that it's very easy to cross into the U.S. They never tell them of the dangers involved,' Thakor said. U.S. prosecutors allege Patel and Shand were part of a sprawling operation, with people to scout for business in India, acquire Canadian student visas, arrange transportation and smuggle migrants into the U.S., mostly via the states of Washington or Minnesota. On Monday, at the federal courthouse in Fergus Falls, Minnesota, Patel, 29, and Shand, 50, will each face four counts related to human smuggling. Patel's attorney, Thomas Leinenweber, told The Associated Press his client came to America to escape poverty and build a better life and 'now stands unjustly accused of participating in this horrible crime.' Shand's attorney did not return calls seeking comment. Prosecutors say Shand told investigators that Patel paid him about $25,000 for the five trips. His final passengers, though, never made it.	https://www.voanews.com/a/indian-family-froze-to-death-crossing-canada-us-border-/7866437.html	2024-11-16T12:45:43-08:00	
8 dead, 17 hurt in China school knife attack	BEIJING — Eight people were killed and 17 others injured Saturday in a knife attack at a vocational school in eastern China, and the suspect — a former student — has been arrested, police said. The attack took place in the evening at the Wuxi Vocational Institute of Arts and Technology in the city of Yixing in Jiangsu province, police in Yixing said in a statement, confirming the toll. Police said the suspect was a 21-year-old former student at the school who was meant to graduate this year but had failed his exams. 'He returned to the school to express his anger and commit these murders,' police said, adding that the suspect had confessed. The statement said that the suspect was also likely motivated by 'dissatisfaction with internship compensation.' The police investigation into the attack is ongoing. Violent knife crime is not uncommon in China, where firearms are strictly controlled, but attacks with such a high death toll are relatively rare. Earlier this week, a 62-year-old man killed 35 people and injured more than 40 others when he rammed his small SUV into a crowd in the southern city of Zhuhai. There has been a spate of other attacks in recent months. In October, in Shanghai, a man killed three people and injured 15 others in a knife attack at a supermarket. And the month before, a Japanese schoolboy was fatally stabbed in the southern city of Shenzhen, which borders Hong Kong.	https://www.voanews.com/a/dead-17-hurt-in-china-school-knife-attack/7866406.html	2024-11-16T10:50:28-08:00	
Paper: TikTok parent ByteDance’s value at $300 billion amid US ban uncertainty	TikTok's Chinese parent company ByteDance is valuing itself at about $300 billion after a recent buyback offer, The Wall Street Journal reported Saturday, even as the tech giant's popular TikTok app faces the prospect of a looming ban in the United States. The TikTok parent in recent days told investors it was looking to buy back shares at about $180 a share, the newspaper said. ByteDance investors have viewed President-elect Donald Trump’s return to the White House as an overall positive for TikTok’s hopes in the U.S., as per the report. At a Bloomberg BusinessWeek interview in June, Trump said, 'I’m for TikTok because you need competition. If you don’t have TikTok, you have Facebook and Instagram.' Trump had previously called TikTok a national security threat but soon after he, too, joined the platform, which is used by about 170 million Americans. A law signed by U.S. President Joe Biden on April 24 gives ByteDance until January 19 to sell TikTok or face a ban. The White House has said it wants to see Chinese-based ownership ended on national-security grounds but not a ban on TikTok. TikTok and ByteDance sued in U.S. federal court in May, seeking to block the law signed by Biden. TikTok and ByteDance did not immediately respond to a Reuters request for comment.	https://www.voanews.com/a/paper-tiktok-parent-bytedance-s-value-at-300-billion-amid-us-ban-uncertainty/7866400.html	2024-11-16T10:43:58-08:00	
Russia's Gazprom stops flow of natural gas to Austria, utility says	VIENNA — Russia’s state-owned natural gas company Gazprom stopped supplies to Austria early Saturday, according to the Vienna-based utility OMV, after OMV said it would stop payments for the gas following an arbitration award. The official cutoff of supplies before dawn Saturday came after Austrian Chancellor Karl Nehammer on Friday held a hastily called news conference to emphasize that his country has a secure supply of alternative fuel for this winter. OMV said it would stop paying for Gazprom gas to its Austrian arm to offset a $242 million arbitration award it won from the International Chamber of Commerce over an earlier cutoff of gas to its German subsidiary. The Austrian utility said in an email that no gas delivery was made from 6 a.m. on Saturday. OMV said Wednesday it has sufficient stocks to provide gas to its customers in case of a potential disruption by Gazprom and said storage in Austria was more than 90% full. 'Once again Putin is using energy as a weapon,' EU Commission President Ursula von der Leyen wrote in a post on social media platform X. 'He is trying to blackmail Austria & Europe by cutting gas supplies. We are prepared for this and ready for the winter.' Russia cut off most natural gas supplies to Europe in 2022, citing disputes over payment in rubles, a move European leaders described as energy blackmail over their support for Ukraine against Russia’s invasion. European governments had to scramble to line up alternative supplies at higher prices, much of it liquefied natural gas brought by ship from the United States and Qatar. Austria gets the bulk of its natural gas from Russia, as much as 98% in December last year, according to Energy Minister Lenore Gewessler.	https://www.voanews.com/a/russia-s-gazprom-stops-flow-of-natural-gas-to-austria-utility-says/7866392.html	2024-11-16T10:34:30-08:00	
First batch of Boy Scout art raises over $3.7 million for abuse victims	DALLAS, TEXAS — The first batch of artwork from the Boy Scouts of America's collection raised over $3.7 million at auction Friday to help pay the compensation owed to those who were sexually abused while in scouting. The 25 works that sold are among over 300 from the Boy Scouts that Heritage Auctions in Dallas will be offering over the next few years. With the standard buyer's premium added to the final hammer price, the 25 works sold for over $4.6 million. Hoping to survive a barrage of sexual abuse claims, the Boy Scouts filed for bankruptcy in 2020. The $2.4 billion bankruptcy plan allowed the organization to continue operating while it compensated survivors. The plan went into effect last year. In addition to the art, other contributions to the survivors' settlement trust are coming from sources that include insurers and the sale of Boy Scout properties. Many of the works being sold are as interwoven into American life as the 114-year-old organization itself, having been featured on magazine covers, calendars and even used to sell war bonds. Friday's auction included five of the nearly 60 works by Norman Rockwell that are part of the collection. Rockwell's painting 'To Keep Myself Physically Strong' shows a Cub Scout standing on a chair to measure the chest of his older brother, a Boy Scout who has taped his fitness record to his bedroom wall. It sold for over $1.1 million, including the buyer's premium. J.C. Leyendecker’s painting 'Weapons for Liberty,' which depicts a Boy Scout clutching a sword in front of a flag-draped, shield-wielding depiction of Lady Liberty, sold for $312,500, including the buyer’s premium. It was featured on the cover of The Saturday Evening Post in 1918 and was adapted as a poster to sell World War I bonds. Barbara Houser, a retired bankruptcy judge overseeing the survivors’ settlement trust, has said over 82,000 people filed abuse claims during the bankruptcy case, and of those, over 64,000 have filled out a detailed questionnaire to assert their claims. Houser said in a news release Friday that she was grateful to those who participated in the auction, noting that the proceeds 'play an integral part in acknowledging decades of silent pain' that survivors suffered. The Boy Scouts announced this year that it is rebranding to Scouting America, a change intended to signal the organization’s commitment to inclusivity. The group now welcomes girls, as well as gay youth and leaders.	https://www.voanews.com/a/first-batch-of-boy-scout-art-raises-over-3-7-million-for-abuse-victims/7866386.html	2024-11-16T10:19:51-08:00	
Giuliani turns over luxury watches, Mercedes in defamation case	NEW YORK — Donald Trump ally and former New York Mayor Rudy Giuliani has relinquished dozens of watches and a Mercedes once owned by movie star Lauren Bacall to two former Georgia election workers who won a $148 million defamation judgment, his lawyer said. Joseph Cammarata said in a letter filed late Friday in Manhattan federal court that the trove of watches and a ring were delivered by FedEx to a bank in Atlanta, Georgia, in the morning. The 1980 Mercedes-Benz SL 500 was turned over at an address in Hialeah, Florida, and an undisclosed amount of funds from Giuliani’s Citibank accounts were also surrendered to the two women who won the judgment, according to the letter. But Cammarata argued that forcing Giuliani to relinquish his luxury vehicle was 'wholly improper' as the car should have been appraised first. If the value of the Mercedes turned out to be less than $5,500, then it should be exempt from the judgment under law, he argued in the letter. If it’s determined to be worth more than that, then it should be auctioned off, with some of the proceeds going to the two women: Ruby Freeman and her daughter, Wandrea 'Shaye' Moss. 'This is how the proper enforcement of these assets should work,' Cammarata wrote in bolded text. 'Just ordering the vehicle to be turned over to the Plaintiffs without any appraisal has taken away Defendant’s statutory and constitutional rights.' The letter also goes on to argue that some of Giuliani’s other possessions should also be exempt from the judgment under New York and Florida law. That includes all apparel — even a shirt signed by New York Yankees legend Joe DiMaggio that is part of the judgment — and all household furniture, as well as a refrigerator, radio receiver, television set, computer, cellphone, tableware and cooking utensils, the letter stated. Cammarata noted there are also legal exemptions for jewelry with a value under $1,325 — meaning his watches and other items should also get appraised — and for 'tools of trade,' including 'professional instruments, furniture and library' items that don’t exceed $4,075 in value. It's not immediately clear what else Giuliani surrendered to meet Friday's deadline. Aaron Nathan, a lawyer for the two women, declined to comment. Cammarata, in an email, didn't respond to follow-up questions but called Giuliani 'a victim of political persecution' and said this month's election demonstrated Americans were tired of 'witch-hunts, indictments, impeachments, prosecutions, convictions, civil cases and judgments.' 'The people of this great nation have spoken; my legal team and client intend to do the same,' Cammarata wrote. 'We will not relent.' The former mayor's $5 million Upper East Side apartment was among the other big-ticket items named in the judgment. On Thursday evening, Giuliani spokesperson Ted Goodman posted a video on social platform X from a FedEx store in Florida, where he showed at least 18 watches and a ring laid out on a table that he said were being turned over. 'This right here folks, this is the accumulation of 60 years of hard work,' Goodman said as the video panned over the array of black, brown, gold and silver-banded timepieces. 'Many of these watches hold great sentimental value, and he’s being forced to turn all these over under court order. 'What’s happening is wrong,' he continued. 'It’s shameful, and we must restore the integrity of the U.S. justice system.' Cammarata, in his Friday letter, asked to delay Giuliani’s January trial over the disposition of some of his assets so that he can attend President-elect Donald Trump’s inauguration. He also confirmed that he has stepped in as Giuliani’s new legal counsel after the previous attorneys asked the court’s permission this week to stop representing Giuliani, citing disagreements with him. Giuliani has claimed he was the victim of a 'political vendetta' and expects to win on appeal and get back all his possessions. 'This is a case of political persecution,' he said last week following an appearance in Manhattan federal court. 'There isn’t a person [who] doesn’t know the judgment is ridiculous.' Representatives for Freeman and Moss said last week that they visited Giuliani’s Manhattan apartment only to discover it was cleared out well before the October deadline. Giuliani was found liable for defamation for falsely accusing Freeman and Moss of ballot fraud as he pushed Trump’s unsubstantiated election fraud allegations during the 2020 campaign. The women said they faced death threats after Giuliani accused them of sneaking in ballots in suitcases, counting ballots multiple times and tampering with voting machines.	https://www.voanews.com/a/giuliani-turns-over-luxury-watches-mercedes-in-defamation-case/7866380.html	2024-11-16T10:09:28-08:00

G20 Social discusses goal of lifting 600 million people out of poverty by 2030	RIO DE JANEIRO — As Brazil prepares to welcome leaders from the world’s 20 largest economies for the Group of 20 summit, another event is taking place in Rio de Janeiro, one that brings global civil society to together for pivotal discussions. The Brazil G20 Social Summit, an initiative by the Brazilian government, marks the first event at which citizens from around the world, as well as nonprofits and community organizations, are invited to participate in a series of smaller conferences. One of the most talked-about initiatives is the launch of the Global Alliance Against Hunger — a group proposed by Brazil’s government to raise funds and implement policies aimed at reducing hunger worldwide. Wellington Dias, Brazil’s minister of Development and Social Assistance, Family and Combating Hunger, told VOA this initiative is open to any nation. He said the G20 addressing hunger and poverty is a significant challenge and a new development. Dias said the recent COVID pandemic and climate change created a problem for the world. 'It further disrupted the immigration process,' Dias said in an interview in Portuguese. 'We also began to face situations involving climate change and people referred to as climate refugees. Hence, the need to address this issue.' Brazil, Ghana, Zimbabwe, Kenya, Chile, Indonesia and the Dominican Republic have outlined their strategies. Countries supporting these efforts include Germany, France, the United Kingdom, Norway and Spain, as well as the European Union and organizations such as the World Bank, the Food and Agriculture Organization and the World Food Program. Proposed measures include expanding cash transfer programs to support 500 million people, providing school meals to an additional 150 million children and offering health services to 200 million women and children younger than 6. 'What we need to solve hunger is much less than what is allocated to wars [and conflicts]. … The goal here is to develop a solution tailored to each country’s needs. It’s not just about distributing food baskets but also about delivering a development plan,' Dias said. Brazilian officials said this financial commitment is expected to come from about 40 nation members of the alliance, 13 international organizations and financial institutions, 19 large philanthropic foundations, civil society organizations, nongovernmental organizations and other nonprofit organizations. Dias said the alliance is expected to reach its target of 100 countries in the coming months, with more than 50 nations preparing plans to join. However, he said to join the alliance, countries must present well-defined plans and proven projects that effectively reduce poverty. According to the United Nations, the relationship between food insecurity, migration and displacement is heavily influenced by factors such as conflict, climate change, natural disasters and poverty. Current projections show that by 2030, 622 million people will live below the World Bank’s extreme poverty line of $2.15 a day. The alliance’s mission is to lift at least 600 million people out of poverty by 2030. The G20 social proposals will be compiled into a final document to be presented at the G20 leaders’ summit on Monday and Tuesday, hosted by Brazil. The Brazilian government has prioritized the fight against world hunger, alongside addressing climate change and anti-corruption governance reform. South African Ambassador Nosipho Jezile told VOA: 'Brazil has inspired me and [other] leaders in the context of this global alliance against hunger and poverty. It’s quite a stretch goal in terms of dealing with the challenges in hand.' But she said nations know the problem and have evidence-based solutions. 'All we have to do is collaborate and make it happen. … It needs a lot of money, but of course, the reorientation of resources that are available to enable and deal with 500 million people that are in hunger and that’s what we have in this commitment,' she said. About 47,000 people attended the G20 Social Summit from Thursday to Saturday, engaging in discussions on inequality and climate change. 'So, beyond the immigration issue, I always argue that hunger and extreme poverty are not just problems for those experiencing them — they are problems for the middle class, for the wealthy, for rich countries, and for rich individuals. There will be no social peace in the world if we do not find a solution to this issue,' Dias told VOA.	https://www.voanews.com/a/g20-social-discusses-goal-of-lifting-600-million-people-out-of-poverty-by-2030/7866369.html	2024-11-16T09:48:05-08:00	
Super Typhoon Man-yi pounds Philippines	MANILA, PHILIPPINES — Super Typhoon Man-yi battered the Philippines on Saturday, with the national weather forecaster warning of a 'potentially catastrophic and life-threatening' impact as huge waves pounded the archipelago's coastline. More than 650,000 people fled their homes ahead of Man-yi, which is the sixth major storm to hit the country in the past month. Man-yi brought maximum wind speeds of 195 kilometers (121 miles) per hour as it made landfall on the sparsely populated island province of Catanduanes as a super typhoon, the weather service said, adding that gusts were reaching 325 kilometers (201 miles) an hour. A 'potentially catastrophic and life-threatening situation looms for [the] northeastern Bicol region as Super Typhoon 'Pepito' further intensifies,' the forecaster said hours before it made landfall, using the local name for the storm and referring to the southern part of the main island of Luzon. Waves up to 14 meters (46 feet) high pummeled the shore of Catanduanes, while Manila and other vulnerable coastal regions were at risk from storm surges reaching up to more than three meters over the next 48 hours, the forecaster said. The weather forecaster said winds walloping Catanduanes and northeastern Camarines Sur province — both in the typhoon-prone Bicol region — posed an 'extreme threat to life and property.' Power was shut down on Catanduanes ahead of the storm, with shelters and the command center using generators for electricity. 'We're hearing sounds of things falling and things breaking while here at the evacuation center,' Catanduanes provincial disaster operations chief Roberto Monterola told AFP after Man-yi made landfall. 'We are unable to check what they are as the winds are too strong. They could be tree branches breaking off and falling on rooftops,' Monterola said, adding there had been no reports of casualties. At least 163 people died in the five storms that pounded the Philippines in recent weeks, left thousands homeless and wiped out crops and livestock. Climate change is increasing the intensity of storms, leading to heavier rains, flash floods and stronger gusts. About 20 big storms and typhoons hit the Southeast Asian nation or its surrounding waters each year, killing scores of people, but it is rare for multiple such weather events to take place in a small window of time. Evacuations Man-yi could hit Luzon — the country's most-populous island and economic engine — as a super typhoon or typhoon on Sunday afternoon, crossing north of Manila and sweeping over the South China Sea on Monday. The government urged people Saturday to heed warnings to flee to safety. 'If preemptive evacuation is required, let us do so and not wait for the hour of peril before evacuating or seeking help, because if we did that, we will be putting in danger not only our lives but also those of our rescuers,' Interior Undersecretary Marlo Iringan said. In Albay province, Legazpi City grocer Myrna Perea sheltered with her husband and their three children in a school classroom alongside nine other families after they were ordered to leave their shanty. Conditions were hot and cramped — the family spent Friday night sleeping together on a mat under the classroom's single ceiling fan — but Perea said it was better to be safe. 'I think our house will be wrecked when we get back because it's made of light materials — just two gusts are required to knock it down,' Perea, 44, told AFP. 'Even if the house is destroyed, the important thing is we do not lose a family member.' Back to 'square one’ In Northern Samar province, disaster officer Rei Josiah Echano lamented that damage caused by typhoons was the root cause of poverty in the region. 'Whenever there's a typhoon like this, it brings us back to the medieval era, we go [back] to square one,' Echano told AFP, as the province prepared for the onslaught of Man-yi. The mayor of Naga city in Camarines Sur province imposed a curfew from midday Saturday in a bid to force residents indoors. All vessels — from fishing boats to oil tankers — were ordered to stay in port or return to shore. The volcanology agency also warned that heavy rain dumped by Man-yi could trigger flows of volcanic sediment, or lahars, from three volcanos, including Taal, south of Manila. Man-yi hit the Philippines late in the typhoon season — most cyclones develop between July and October. Earlier this month, four storms were clustered simultaneously in the Pacific basin, which the Japan Meteorological Agency told AFP on Saturday was the first time such an occurrence had been observed in November since its records began in 1951.	https://www.voanews.com/a/super-typhoon-man-yi-pounds-philippines/7866337.html	2024-11-16T09:01:10-08:00	
Tropical Storm Sara drenches Honduras’ northern coast	Tropical Storm Sara stalled over Honduras Saturday, drenching the northern coast of the Central American nation and swelling rivers. The area could see life-threatening flash flooding and mudslides through the weekend, according to the Miami-based U.S National Hurricane Center. Sustained rain fell overnight and continued into Saturday morning in the city of San Pedro Sula, where there were no immediate signs of serious flooding. People watched nervously as conditions brought back memories of the disastrous November 2020 hurricane season, when two powerful storms passed through the region, displacing hundreds of thousands of people and causing widespread damage. The weather system made landfall late Thursday about 165 kilometers west-northwest of Cabo Gracias a Dios, on the Honduras-Nicaragua border. The Hurricane Center expects the storm will move near the Bay Islands of Honduras on Saturday before approaching Belize. Sara is then expected to turn northwesterly toward Mexico’s Yucatan Peninsula, although forecasters said it probably will not reemerge into the Gulf after crossing the Yucatan. In November 2020, Eta and Iota passed through Honduras after initially making landfall in Nicaragua as powerful Category 4 hurricanes. Northern Honduras caught the worst of the storms with torrential rains and flooding that displaced hundreds of thousands. Eta alone was responsible for as much as 70 centimeters of rain along the northern coast.	https://www.voanews.com/a/tropical-storm-sara-drenches-honduras-northern-coast/7866321.html	2024-11-16T08:33:52-08:00	
Iranian press divided over envoy's reported meeting with Elon Musk	TEHRAN, IRAN — Iranian media were divided Saturday over a reported meeting between Tehran's ambassador to the United Nations and tech billionaire Elon Musk — unconfirmed by Iranian authorities — with some describing it as 'positive' while others called it 'treason.' The New York Times reported Friday that Musk, who is a close ally of President-elect Donald Trump, met earlier this week with Iranian Ambassador to the U.N. Amir Saeid Iravani. The Times cited anonymous Iranian sources describing the encounter as 'positive,' although neither the Trump transition team nor Iran's U.N. mission immediately confirmed the meeting. Iran's Foreign Ministry spokesperson on Saturday 'categorically' denied the Times report on the Musk meeting, state media reported. In an interview with state news agency IRNA, spokesperson Esmaeil Baghaei was reported as 'categorically denying such a meeting' and expressing 'surprise at the coverage of the American media in this regard.' However, Iranian media outlets, particularly those aligned with the reformist party that supports President Masoud Pezeshkian, largely described the meeting in positive terms. The Ham Mihan reformist daily noted that 'the strategy of the Iranian diplomatic team is on target and has elicited a reciprocal and positive response from the American side.' Sazandegi, another reformist outlet, interpreted the meeting as an indication of Iran engaging in 'secret diplomacy' with the United States. While it portrayed the meeting as a 'positive' development, it nevertheless stressed that it should not be exaggerated. Musk has been tapped as the co-chair of Trump's proposed Department of Government Efficiency. The Shargh newspaper from the same political camp suggested that the encounter reflects 'the result of Donald Trump's active diplomacy.' In contrast, the ultraconservative Kayhan daily criticized the reported meeting as 'naivety or treason' against Iran, slamming Trump for exiting the Iran nuclear deal. The paper said Trump 'must pay damages to Iran for violating the nuclear agreement,' which was signed in 2015 between Iran and Western powers. The deal gave Iran relief from economic sanctions in exchange for controls on its nuclear program, which Iran has consistently maintained is for peaceful purposes. The conservative Jomhouri-e Eslami newspaper stated that the interaction 'can be viewed as the beginning of a new path in Iran's foreign policy,' although it did not name Musk, instead describing him as Trump's representative. In the weeks leading up to Trump's reelection, Iranian officials signaled a willingness to resolve issues with the West. Iran and the United States cut diplomatic ties shortly after the 1979 Islamic revolution that toppled the U.S.-backed shah of Iran, Mohammad Reza Pahlavi. Since then, both countries have communicated through the Swiss embassy in Tehran and the Sultanate of Oman.	https://www.voanews.com/a/iranian-press-divided-over-envoy-s-reported-meeting-with-elon-musk/7866304.html	2024-11-16T08:03:30-08:00	
Gabon votes on new constitution after military seized power last year	Gabon is holding a referendum Saturday on whether to adopt a new constitution more than one year after mutinous soldiers overthrew the country's longtime president and seized power in the oil-rich Central African nation. Nearly 1 million people are expected to vote. The draft constitution, which proposes sweeping changes that could prevent dynastic rule and transfer of power, needs more than 50% of the votes cast to be adopted. In 2023, soldiers toppled President Ali Bongo Ondimba and put him under house arrest, accusing him of irresponsible governance and massive embezzlement that risked leading the country into chaos. The junta released Ondimba a week later on humanitarian grounds, allowing him to travel abroad for medical treatment. The soldiers proclaimed their republican guard chief, General Brice Clotaire Oligui Nguema, as president of a transitional committee to lead the country. Oligui is a cousin of Bongo. Bongo had served two terms since coming to power in 2009 after the death of his father, who ruled the country for 41 years. His rule was marked by widespread discontent with his reign. A coup attempt in 2019 failed. The draft constitution imposes a seven-year presidential term, renewable once, instead of the current charter that allows five-year terms renewable without limit. It also says family members cannot succeed a president and abolishes the position of prime minister. The former French colony is a member of OPEC, but its oil wealth is concentrated in the hands of a few — and nearly 40% of Gabonese ages 15 to 24 were out of work in 2020, according to the World Bank. Its oil export revenue was $6 billion in 2022, according to the U.S. Energy Information Administration. The polls will close at 6 p.m. Saturday. There is no legal deadline for when results should be announced.	https://www.voanews.com/a/gabon-votes-on-new-constitution-after-military-seized-power-last-year/7866284.html	2024-11-16T07:35:47-08:00	
Venezuela frees more prisoners arrested after election, rights group says	CARACAS, VENEZUELA — At least 10 people detained during protests over Venezuela's July presidential election have been released from prison, local rights group Foro Penal said on Saturday. 'Some political prisoners have been released since early in the morning,' said the group's director, Alfredo Romero, in a post on social media platform X. He noted that 10 people so far had been released from a prison known as Yare III, and an unspecified number of others from Las Crisalidas women's prison. The number was expected to rise during the day. According to Foro Penal, at least 1,800 people were arrested after the disputed presidential election on July 28, which kept President Nicolas Maduro in power despite heavily contested results. Maduro took office in 2013 and is set to begin his next six-year term in January. The election sparked deadly antigovernment protests. The opposition, rights groups and unions have accused Maduro's administration of cracking down on dissent. Maduro said last week that he would ask the attorney general's office to review any arrests in which authorities may have made mistakes. More than 80 teenagers were released from prison in September, Foro Penal previously said, after being arrested during the post-election protests. Attorney General Tarek Saab on Friday said he had asked to review at least 225 cases. He has said 28 people were killed and nearly 200 injured in the protests. Activists and relatives of some of those who were arrested said those people did not participate in the protests. They have also alleged that some prisoners have endured torture in detention.	https://www.voanews.com/a/venezuela-frees-more-prisoners-arrested-after-election-rights-group-says/7866257.html	2024-11-16T07:01:35-08:00	
Protesters in Georgia's separatist region refuse to give up government buildings	TBILISI, GEORGIA — Opposition protesters in Georgia's breakaway province of Abkhazia have refused to cede control of key government buildings that demonstrators stormed to protest new measures allowing Russians to buy property in the area. Abkhazian President Aslan Bzhania announced Saturday that he would step down and hold early elections if demonstrators vacated the region's parliament building. But crowds that gathered in the Abkhazian capital, Sukhumi, rejected the deal, and opposition leaders said they would accept only Bzhania's unconditional resignation. 'None of us have come here for the sake of seats [in parliament],' former Abkhazian Prime Minister Valery Bganba told the crowd in a video livestreamed on social media. 'We came here to save our people, our country.' At least 14 people were injured Friday when opposition protesters clashed with police, Russian state news outlet RIA Novosti reported. Lawmakers had gathered at the region’s parliament building to discuss ratifying measures allowing Russian citizens to buy property in the breakaway state. However, the session was postponed because demonstrators broke through the gate to the building’s grounds with a truck and streamed inside. Some threw rocks at police, who responded with tear gas. Most of Abkhazia broke away from Georgia in fighting that ended in 1993, and Georgia lost control of the rest of the territory in a short war with Russia in 2008. Russia recognizes Abkhazia as an independent country, but many Abkhazians are concerned that the region of about 245,000 people is a client state of Moscow. Opponents of the property agreement say it will drive up prices of apartments and boost Moscow’s dominance in the region. Abkhazia’s mountains and Black Sea beaches make it a popular destination for Russian tourists, and the demand for holiday homes could be strong. The arrest of five opposition figures at a similar demonstration Monday set off wide protests the next day in which bridges leading to Sukhumi were blocked.	https://www.voanews.com/a/protesters-in-georgia-s-separatist-region-refuse-to-give-up-government-buildings/7866246.html	2024-11-16T06:49:54-08:00	
Protesters gather at UN climate talks in ‘global day of action’	BAKU, AZERBAIJAN — Hundreds of activists formed a human chain outside one of the main plenary halls at the United Nations climate summit on what is traditionally their biggest protest day during the two-week talks. The demonstration in Baku, Azerbaijan, will be echoed at sites around the world in a global 'day of action' for climate justice that's become an annual event. Activists waved flags, snapped their fingers, hummed and mumbled chants, with many covering their mouths with the word 'Silenced.' Demonstrators held up signs calling for more money to be pledged for climate finance, which involves cash for transitioning to clean energy and adapting to climate change. It comes as negotiators at the venue try to hammer out a deal for exactly that — but progress has been slow, and observers say the direction of any agreement is still unclear. ‘Keep fighting’ Lidy Nacpil said protestors like her are 'not surprised' about how negotiations are going. But past wins — such as a loss and damage fund that gives developing nations cash after extreme weather events exacerbated by climate change — keep organizers going, said Nacpil, a coordinator with the Asian Peoples’ Movement on Debt and Development. 'The role we play is to increase the pressure,' she said of the action. 'We know we’re not going to get the results that the world needs in this round of negotiations, but at least to bring us many steps closer is our hope, is our aim. 'I think we have no option but to keep fighting. ... It’s the instinctive response that anyone, any living being, living creatures will have, which is to fight for life and fight for survival.' Tasneem Essop said she was inspired by the action, which was challenging to organize. 'To be able to pull off something where people feel their own power, exercise their own power and get inspired in this creative way, I’m super excited about this,' she said. Essop said she’s 'not very' optimistic about an outcome on finance but knows next week will be pivotal. 'We can’t end up with a bad deal for the peoples of the world, those who are already suffering the impacts of climate change, those who need to adapt to an increasing and escalating crisis,' she said. 'We fight until the end.' Climate cash Negotiators at COP29, as the talks are known, are working on a deal that might be worth hundreds of billions of dollars to poorer nations. Many are in the Global South and already suffering the costly impact of weather disasters fueled by climate change. Several experts have said $1 trillion or more annually is needed both to compensate for such damages and to pay for a clean-energy transition that most countries can't afford on their own. Samir Bejanov, deputy lead negotiator of this year's climate talks, said in a press conference that the climate finance talks were moving too slowly. 'I want to repeat our strong encouragement to all parties to make as much progress as possible,' he said. 'We need everyone to approach the task with urgency and determination.' Diego Pacheco, a negotiator from Bolivia, said the amount of money on the table for developing countries needs to be 'loud and clear.' 'No more speeches but real money,' he said. Observers also were disappointed at the pace of progress. 'This has been the worst first week of a COP in my 15 years of attending this summit,' said Mohamed Adow, of climate think tank Power Shift Africa. 'There’s no clarity on the climate finance goal, the quality of the finance or how it’s going to be made accessible to vulnerable countries. 'I sense a lot of frustration, especially among the developing country blocs here,' he said. Panama environment minister Juan Carlos Navarro agreed, telling The Associated Press he is 'not encouraged' by what he’s seeing at COP29 so far. 'What I see is a lot of talk and very little action,' he said, noting that Panama is among the group of countries least responsible for warming emissions but most vulnerable to the damage caused by climate change-fueled disasters.	https://www.voanews.com/a/protesters-gather-at-un-climate-talks-in-global-day-of-action-/7866231.html	2024-11-16T06:35:57-08:00	
Ireland's Jake Paul beats boxing legend Mike Tyson	ARLINGTON, TEXAS — Jake Paul beat boxing legend Mike Tyson by unanimous decision to win an intergenerational heavyweight battle in Texas on Friday that failed to live up to its enormous hype. The bout between the 27-year-old social media influencer-turned-prizefighter Paul and the 58-year-old former heavyweight champion Tyson was streamed live on Netflix and played out in front of a sold-out crowd at AT&T Stadium in Arlington. Those fans were left largely disappointed as Tyson showed his age and was never able to generate any offense against his younger opponent, landing just 18 punches to Paul's 78. 'First and foremost, Mike Tyson — it's an honor to be able to fight him,' said Paul. 'It was as tough and hard as I thought it would be.' Tyson, who wore a knee brace, never mounted much of a challenge after being wobbled by some left hands in the third round but did enough defensively to avoid taking any serious damage. He acknowledged after the contest to fighting through a leg injury. 'Yeah, but I can't use that as an excuse. If I did, I wouldn't be in here,' Tyson said. 'I knew he was a good fighter. He was prepared, I came to fight. I didn't prove nothing to anybody, only to myself. I'm not one of those guys that live to please the world. I'm just happy with what I can do.' Tyson, one of the most fearsome heavyweight champions during his heyday in the late 1980s and early 1990s, was in his first professional fight in nearly 20 years. He was noncommittal when asked if he would return to the ring again. 'I don't know. It depends on the situation,' he said. Paul (11-1) said he can now fight anyone he wants, possibly even Mexican Canelo Alvarez, after being the main attraction in the mega event that brought out a star-studded crowd and 72,300 fight fans. 'This is the biggest event, over 120 million people on Netflix,' he said. 'We crashed the site, the biggest U.S. boxing gate, $20 million, in U.S. history, and everyone is next on the list.' Taylor beats Serrano In the co-main event earlier in the evening, Ireland's Katie Taylor retained her super lightweight title by beating Puerto Rico's Amanda Serrano in a controversial unanimous decision after a violent affair. Serrano came forward throughout the fight, but their heads crashed together hard in the early stages, resulting in a deep cut over Serrano's right eye. The referee later took a point off Taylor for head butts. In the end all three judges scored it 95-94 for Taylor, who denied accusations from Serrano's corner that she was fighting dirty. Taylor won the pair's previous meeting, at New York's Madison Square Garden in April 2022, and said there would be a third meeting.	https://www.voanews.com/a/ireland-s-jake-paul-beats-boxing-legend-mike-tyson/7866152.html	2024-11-16T03:44:47-08:00	
Fire engulfs hospital ward in northern India, killing 10 newborns	LUCKNOW, India — A fire tore through a neonatal intensive care unit in a hospital in northern India, killing 10 newborn babies and injuring 16 others, authorities said. The fire occurred late Friday at a hospital in Jhansi city in India's Uttar Pradesh state. Officials said the blaze spread quickly through the ward, where 55 infants were being treated. Forty-five babies were rescued and are receiving medical care, said Bimal Kumar Dubey, a local official. It was not immediately clear what sparked the blaze. Brajesh Pathak, the deputy chief minister of the state, visited the hospital and met with families on Saturday. He pledged government support for the victims’ families and promised a thorough investigation. 'We will identify those responsible for this tragedy and take strict action. The government stands with families during this difficult time,' he said. When the firefighters arrived, the ward was engulfed in flames and plumes of smoke. Rescuers had to break through windows to reach the newborn babies. Eyewitnesses said the rescue operation began about 30 minutes after the fire erupted, delaying evacuation efforts. The accident has raised questions over the hospital’s safety measures. While fire alarms had been installed in the intensive care unit, parents and witnesses said they did not activate during the blaze. Hospital staff acted only after they saw signs of smoke and fire. 'If the safety alarm had worked, we could have acted sooner and saved more lives,' said Naresh Kumar, a parent who lost his baby. Akhtar Hussain, whose son was rescued and is receiving treatment in an adjacent ward, agreed that the tragedy could have been prevented if the hospital had better safety protocols. Fires are common in India, where building laws and safety norms are often flouted by builders and residents. Poor maintenance and lack of proper firefighting equipment in the country also leads to deaths.	https://www.voanews.com/a/fire-engulfs-hospital-ward-in-northern-india-killing-10-newborns/7866136.html	2024-11-16T02:39:41-08:00

Why is only limited aid getting to Palestinians inside Gaza?	jerusalem — The United States decided not to punish Israel over the dire humanitarian situation in the Gaza Strip after giving it an ultimatum to increase aid entering the territory. But the flow of food, medicine and other supplies to Palestinians is still at nearly its lowest level of the entire 13-month war. The White House last month gave Israel 30 days to improve conditions or risk losing military support. As the deadline expired Tuesday, leading international aid groups said Israel had fallen far short. But the U.S. State Department announced it would not take any punitive action, saying Israel has made limited progress. However, it called for more steps. Aid groups accuse the Israeli military of hindering and even blocking shipments in Gaza. Almost the entire population of around 2.3 million Palestinians relies on international aid for survival, and doctors and aid groups say malnutrition is rampant. Food security experts say famine may already be underway in hard-hit north Gaza. 'It's really frustrating because by almost every objective metric, all agencies say that the humanitarian situation has gotten worse in that time frame that the U.S. has specified,' Aseel Baidoun, a senior manager of the aid group Medical Aid for Palestinians, said Wednesday. 'Even though we have provided all the evidence that there is a risk of famine ... still the U.S. miraculously finds Israel not violating the humanitarian aid law.' Israel, which controls all crossings into Gaza, says it is committed to delivering humanitarian assistance and has scrambled to ramp up aid. COGAT, the military body in charge of aid passage, said it had taken a number of steps over the past month to increase the amount entering the territory, including opening a fifth crossing — into central Gaza — this week. Israel says the U.N. and international aid groups need to do a better job of distributing supplies. Where do aid levels stand? Aid into Gaza is typically measured in terms of truckloads of food and supplies entering the territory. The U.S. has demanded 350 trucks daily — still below the 500 a day that entered before the war. In October, aid entry plunged to its lowest level since the first month of the war. Israeli government figures show roughly 57 trucks a day entering on average. The average has risen to 100 a day so far in November, slightly lower than the same month last year. The U.N., however, says even less is entering. It reports receiving an average of 39 trucks daily since the beginning of October. This is largely because it says it cannot reach the main crossing point in the south to collect cargoes because of Israeli military restrictions and lawlessness. The U.N. says virtually no food or other aid has reached the northernmost part of Gaza since the beginning of October. That's when the Israeli military launched a major offensive against Hamas fighters in the area of Jabaliya, Beit Lahiya and Beit Hanoun, cutting them off. Israel says October's drop in aid was because it closed crossings into Gaza during the Jewish high holidays. It said it couldn't allow deliveries to the far north in October because of the fighting. Under international pressure, COGAT allowed two deliveries to the far north this month. But little of it got through. Last week, the World Food Program said troops on the ground ordered its trucks to unload their cargo before reaching their destination. In another planned shipment on Monday, the WFP could deliver only three out of 14 trucks because of delays in getting movement permits from the troops. When it tried to deliver the rest the next day, it said the military denied permission. Denial of passage and entry One reason for the large difference between Israel's and the U.N.'s count of aid trucks entering Gaza: Hundreds of truckloads are piled up on the Gaza side of the main crossing in the south, uncollected by the U.N. for distribution. Israel accuses UNRWA, the U.N. agency for Palestinian refugees, of not doing enough to retrieve the cargoes. The U.N. and aid groups say they often cannot reach the crossing because the Israeli military doesn't always coordinate safe passage amid military operations in the area and widespread lawlessness. 'If we are not provided a safe passage to go and collect [the aid], it's not possible for us to have it. And it will not reach the people who need it,' said Louise Wateridge, an UNRWA spokesperson. UNRWA has been the main agency procuring and distributing aid in Gaza, and a feud between Israel and the agency led Israel to take steps toward banning it last month. Israel says Hamas has infiltrated UNRWA, a charge the agency denies. Aid groups also accuse the Israeli army of blocking aid trucks from reaching areas where fighting is most intense, including northern Gaza. During October, the U.N. Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs said that Israeli authorities rejected roughly 43% of all humanitarian movement requests and impeded a further 16%. Israeli authorities have also prohibited some vehicles and goods from entering the enclave, aid groups say, often without explanation. Rachel Morris, of the aid group Mercy Corps, said trucks carrying the group's tent supplies have been turned away more than five times. Israel says it denies entry to supplies that could be weaponized by Hamas. 'I witnessed during my visit to Gaza last week the deliberate starvation of almost 2 million civilians, whilst the bombardment continues,' said Jan Egeland, secretary-general of the Norwegian Refugee Council, a major relief provider. 'There is barely any aid crossing into Gaza.' Lawlessness along aid routes Theft is also stymying distribution. The military and aid agencies both acknowledge that criminal gangs – often based in local families – are robbing trucks. An Israeli official, speaking on the condition of anonymity under military briefing guidelines, estimated that on some days, up to 30% to 40% of aid supplies are stolen by criminals or Hamas. COGAT spokesperson Shani Sasson said that the Israeli army has tried to secure part of the route and find alternate routes for drivers but can't accompany each aid truck and the criminal groups are always moving. Baidoun, with MAP, said that drivers sometimes have to pay fees to move their aid from the crossing into Gaza. He said that the Israeli military was 'failing to provide an enabling environment to bring in sufficient humanitarian goods to Gaza.'	https://www.voanews.com/a/why-is-only-limited-aid-getting-to-palestinians-inside-gaza-/7866060.html	2024-11-16T01:08:08-08:00	
Japan's sake brewers hope UNESCO heritage listing can boost rice wine's appeal	OME, Japan — Deep in a dark warehouse the sake sleeps, stored in rows of giant tanks, each holding more than 10,000 liters of the Japanese rice wine that is the product of brewing techniques dating back more than 1,000 years. Junichiro Ozawa, the 18th-generation head of Ozawa Brewery, founded in 1702, hopes sake-brewing will win recognition as a UNESCO Intangible Cultural Heritage, when the decision is made next month. 'We always think about the people who're enjoying our sake when we make it. I'm now so excited, imagining the faces of all the people around the world,' he told reporters Wednesday during a tour of his brewery on the pastoral outskirts of Tokyo. Sake, the drink of choice for the nobility in 'The Tale of Genji' — Japan's most celebrated work of literature — has been widening its appeal, boosted by the growing international popularity of Japanese cuisine. Sake exports from Japan total more than 41 billion yen ($265 million) a year, with the biggest destinations being the U.S. and China, according to the Japan Sake and Shochu Makers Association. That's up from about 22 billion yen in 2018. But exports still make up a tiny fraction of overall sake production in Japan. Brazil, Mexico and Southeast Asia, as well as France and the rest of Europe, all places where Japanese restaurants are gaining popularity, are starting to take a liking to sake. What's key to sake-making, which takes about two months, including fermentation and pressing, are the rice and the water. For a product to be categorized Japanese sake, the rice must be Japanese. The relatively soft quality of freshwater in Japan, like the supplies provided by the two wells at Ozawa Brewery, is also critical. Among Ozawa's sake is the full-bodied aromatic Junmai Daiginjo, one of the top offerings, with 15% alcohol content and costing about 3,630 yen ($23) for a 720-milliliter bottle. Karakuti Nigorizake is unrefined sake, murky and not clear like usual sake, with 17% alcohol content and a rugged no-nonsense taste. It sells for 2,420 yen ($16) for a 1,800 milliliter bottle. The religious connotations of sake are evident at the brewery. The big cedar-leaves ball hanging under the eaves is a symbol of a shrine for the god of sake-making. In Japan, sake is used to purify and to celebrate. Sips from a cup signify the sealing of a marriage. 'Sake is not just an alcoholic beverage. It is Japanese culture itself,' said Hitoshi Utsunomiya, director of the Japan Sake and Shochu Makers Association. The UNESCO Intangible Cultural Heritage designation is given to not just historical monuments but also practices passed down generations, such as oral traditions, performing arts, rituals and festivals. It's not meant to be used for commercial purposes. But sake officials make no secret of their hope that it will boost global sales, helping the tradition stay alive amid competition from beer, wine and other modern beverages. Among previous Intangible Cultural Heritage inclusions are Kabuki theater and Gagaku court music from Japan, as well as Sona, which are drawings on sand in Angola; the Chinese zither called guqin and Cremonese violin craftsmanship from Italy. Washoku, or Japanese cuisine, won the honors in 2013. One reason for sake's growing popularity around the world is that its smooth flavor goes well with varieties of food, including sushi, spicy Asian and Western dishes, says Max Del Vita, a certified sake sommelier and co-founder of The Sake Company, an import and distribution retailer in Singapore. 'These brewers are cultural stewards, passing down techniques through generations and blending ancient practices with quiet innovation,' he told The Associated Press. 'Sake is more than a drink. It is a living embodiment of Japan's seasonal rhythms, community values and artistic heritage.'	https://www.voanews.com/a/japan-s-sake-brewers-hope-unesco-heritage-listing-can-boost-rice-wine-s-appeal/7864746.html	2024-11-16T01:00:00-08:00	
Food aid can cut hardships from climate change; should more be done?	CHIPINGE, Zimbabwe — Gertrude Siduna appears to have little appetite for corn farming season. Rather than prepare her land in Zimbabwe's arid southeastern Chipinge district for the crop that has fed her family for generations — and bitter about repeated droughts that have decimated yields — she turns her thoughts to the prices for chilies and techniques for growing them. 'I pick my chilies from the fields and take them to the processing center close to my home. It's simple,' said Siduna, 49. She's received about $400 from the drought-resistant crop and plans to grow more. 'Chilies are far better than corn.' Siduna has been growing chilies for a year since being trained under a climate-smart agriculture program funded by the U.S. Agency for International Development. The program was designed to strengthen small-scale farmers' resilience to climate change-induced droughts, many requiring food assistance from the government or international donors. But as climate change worsens droughts and floods worldwide, government agencies and local operators have found that aid efforts can still be made more effective and financially sustainable. Experts say rich nations like the United States, which have been the biggest contributors of planet-warming emissions historically, have a responsibility to fund humanitarian aid in the countries that are experiencing its effects first and most severely. The U.S. is the world's largest international donor of food aid, reaching over 60 million people in about 70 countries annually with direct contributions of food or via programs to help farmers adapt to extreme weather. USAID plans to mobilize $150 billion for climate-related initiatives, according to the agency's climate strategy report. In Zimbabwe, around 7.7 million people — almost half the country's population — require food assistance, according to government and U.N. figures. Frequent droughts are decimating people's ability to feed themselves, a phenomenon worsened by climate change. Switching crops Water-guzzling white corn has been the staple crop of choice for rural farmers in Zimbabwe since its introduction to much of sub-Saharan Africa by the Portuguese in the 17th century. But with the threat of drought, some, like Siduna, now think it may be better to buy the staple than grow it. 'I don't lack corn meal. I just use my earnings from chilies to buy it from the local shops,' she said. Unlike corn or other crops that she has typically grown, chilies do well in the hotter, drier conditions. And, because they end up in stores in the United States, they offer cash rewards. 'You have to continuously pray for the rain if you grow corn,' said the mother of three. 'The crop just can't stand heat. But chilies can. One is assured of a harvest, and the market is readily available.' Other crops such as millets, which are cereals tolerant of poor soils, drought and harsh growing conditions, are also gaining traction under climate resilience programs. In Chiredzi, southeast Zimbabwe, Kenias Chikamhi, 54, describes growing corn as 'a gamble ... whereas with millets you have a good chance of at least getting something.' Millet was the country's staple before the introduction of maize. But not all the corn is gone yet. Zimbabwe's agriculture ministry says it plans to increase land under maize to 1.8 million hectares (4.4 million acres) by using farming techniques such as digging holes into dry land and mulching to cover the growing crops as well as by planting drought-resilient varieties that can better cope with the lack of rain. The country harvested about 700,000 tons of corn this year, 70% down from the season before and far short of the 2 million tons required annually for humans and livestock. Solar-powered irrigation Farming techniques are also changing. Another of USAID's initiatives has seen a community garden in Mutandahwe village, where Siduna lives, irrigated by three small solar panels. The panels pump water from a borehole into storage tanks that are connected to the garden taps by pipes, turning the 1-hectare plot of vegetables like onions, leaf cabbage and cowpeas into an island of lush green. Solar-powered community gardens have been spreading across the district and much of the country's dry areas. 'We were struggling walking long distances to fetch water from rivers, and right now the rivers are dry,' said Muchaneta Mutowa, secretary of the plot. The plot is shared by 60 members, all growing vegetables they can eat and sell. 'We now have easy access to reliable water that flows from the taps [and] we don't pay for the sun,' she said. And money from the sale of vegetables goes a long way to pay for family basics such as school fees. Members pay a dollar each into a savings pot that can be used for low-interest loans or minor repair expenses 'so that we are not always reliant on the donor,' said Mutohwa. Increasing effectiveness Because USAID's investments can be so consequential for receiving countries, it's important they're done right, said Lora Iannotti, a professor who studies global maternal and youth nutrition at the Brown School at Washington University in St. Louis. Richer countries like the U.S. have tended to use direct donations of surplus staple and commodity crops like corn and wheat as a way to benefit their own farmers, according to Iannotti's research. Iannotti has seen advances in food aid with dietary variety in mind but thinks there's room for improvement. Undernourishment became more prevalent after the COVID-19 pandemic, and climate change is making hunger a more pressing issue than ever, with crises that resemble 'stuff from 100 years ago,' she said. Daniel Maxwell, a professor of food security at Tufts University, thinks countries providing aid also need strategies to address problems 'causing the hunger in the first place,' whether that's climate change, war or other factors. He also thinks countries need a more balanced approach, including projects promoting health, protection from violence or nutrition. USAID and the U.S. Department of Agriculture haven't yet explained how food aid efforts might be changed or altered by the incoming U.S. administration, but the delay on renewing farm legislation does hold up USDA programming, including food aid projects, in a variety of ways, said Alexis Taylor, undersecretary of trade and foreign agricultural affairs at USDA. The U.S. Government Accountability Office, the investigative arm of Congress, released reports finding that USAID and its partner agencies needed to improve the ways they measured the outcomes of their programs. USAID says they worked with the GAO to address its recommendations. The GAO has closed six of the eight recommendations, indicating satisfactory response; the others were to be resolved this fall, a spokesperson for USAID said. 'We are committing a lot of U.S. taxpayer dollars,' said Chelsa Kenney, the GAO's director for international affairs issues. 'It's important that we're good stewards of those taxpayer dollars to ensure that the kind of programming that we are providing to these countries is really making a difference.'	https://www.voanews.com/a/food-aid-can-cut-hardships-from-climate-change-should-more-be-done-/7864741.html	2024-11-16T01:00:00-08:00	
Strike hits south Beirut after Israeli evacuation call: AFPTV	Beirut — A strike hit the southern suburbs of the Lebanese capital of Beirut on Saturday, AFPTV footage showed, shortly after the Israeli army issued a new call to evacuate the area. Since Tuesday, Israel has carried out several strikes on the city's southern suburbs, a stronghold of Hezbollah. AFPTV video showed three plumes of smoke rising over the buildings in the area on Saturday morning. Shortly before the attack, Israeli military spokesperson Avichay Adraee posted on X a call for residents of the Haret Hreik suburb to evacuate. 'You are close to facilities and interests belonging to Hezbollah, against which the Israeli military will be acting with force in the near future,' the post said in Arabic, identifying specific buildings and telling residents to move at least 500 meters away. Lebanon's state-run National News Agency (NNA) said 'the enemy' carried out three air raids, including one near Haret Hreik. 'The first strike near Haret Hreik destroyed buildings and caused damage in the area,' it said. Repeated Israeli air strikes on south Beirut have led to a mass exodus of civilians from the area, although some return during the day to check on their homes and businesses. In southern Lebanon, Israel carried out several strikes on Friday night and early Saturday, according to NNA. Overnight, Hezbollah also claimed two rocket attacks targeting the headquarters of an infantry battalion in northern Israel. Since September 23, Israel has ramped up its air campaign in Lebanon, later sending in ground troops following almost a year of limited, cross-border exchanges begun by Hezbollah over the Gaza war. On October 7, 2023, Hamas militants killed 1,200 people and captured about 250 hostages, sparking the war in Gaza. Israel says it believes Hamas is still holding 101 hostages, including 35 the military says are dead. Israel’s counteroffensive in Gaza has killed more than 43,000 people, according to the territory's health ministry, which does not distinguish between combatants and civilians in its count. Hamas in Gaza and Hezbollah in Lebanon have been designated as terror groups by the United States, the U.K. and other Western countries. Lebanese authorities say that more than 3,440 people have been killed since October last year, when Hezbollah and Israel began trading fire. The conflict has cost Lebanon more than $5 billion in economic losses, with actual structural damage amounting to billions more, the World Bank said on Thursday.	https://www.voanews.com/a/strike-hits-south-beirut-after-israeli-evacuation-call-afptv/7866109.html	2024-11-16T00:36:53-08:00	
Monkey business drops in Thai city after community clamps down on critters	LOPBURI, Thailand — Marauding monkeys won't face slingshots anymore in the historic Thai city of Lopburi, where they have been rounded up and sterilized after turning rampant over the past four years. Before COVID-19 shut Lopburi, some of its 58,000 residents casually fed the 3,000 long-tailed macaques that lived alongside and even threw an annual fruit banquet for them, drawing tourists to 'Monkey City,' a three-hour drive north of Bangkok. The macaques, believed to bring good fortune, also inhabit nearby forests and have long been a part of the city's history. But after Lopburi came out of the pandemic lockdown in mid-2022, its residents found that the monkeys, without people feeding them, had become unruly. Troops of macaques had taken over buildings, often confronting residents, stealing food and causing accidents. Gangs of monkeys also fought in brawls, shocking locals. Some residents resorted to caging themselves within their homes. 'Their method is robbery — by all means,' said Wisarut Somngam, a local researcher with Ecoexist Society, a non-governmental organization, where he is studying the situation. 'They were ready to snatch anything off your hands, any bags they suspect contain food or items like mobile phones.' Small children, elderly women and even policemen carried around slingshots to try and scare away the macaques. Reuters journalists made half a dozen trips to Lopburi this year, including during the height of the monkeys' aggression in early 2024. As complaints mounted after February, authorities armed with slingshots and traps sprang into action to catch the primates that had wreaked havoc and even scared some residents into putting up metal bars at their homes for protection. 'We have to cage ourselves inside, we have no freedom even on the premises of our own homes,' said Jirat Buapromart, 54. 'They are ready to steal anything they can from us.' Authorities capture 1,600 monkeys By May, authorities stepped up the push against the monkeys, including boosting sterilization efforts that began during the pandemic. 'Our goal is to neuter all the monkeys, 100% of them,' local veterinarian Patarapol Maneeorn from the government wildlife department said in September. The monkeys would then be put into a designated area where they will be looked after, he said. Five months after the start of the government's campaign, Lopburi's primate pandemonium has finally come under control, with around 1,600 monkeys in captivity. Some animal rights groups agree with authorities on neutering the monkeys, but not putting them in cages. 'The monkeys are suffering because currently they're in a cage that is not designed for them,' said Edwin Wiek, founder of Wildlife Friends Foundation Thailand. 'It's not proper for them.' Wiek pressed the government to increase funding to the Department of National Parks, Wildlife and Plant Conservation, which has personnel trained in animal care and treatment. Monkeys still draw tourists For some residents, the return of calm on the streets of Lopburi is a relief. 'Things have become a little easier because most of the monkeys were captured. Life is easier,' said clock maker Chalit Nithiwkram, 64. Business was also improving, he said: 'If there were monkeys, no customers would dare to come by and park their cars here.' For others, Lopburi and its monkeys are inseparable. 'Monkeys are part of Lopburi's identity,' said Supaporn Reanprayoorn, 38, who runs a store near a temple where monkeys often gathered. She sometimes gave them snacks. 'Let tourists take pictures with them — just a hundred or two.'	https://www.voanews.com/a/7864740.html	2024-11-16T00:00:00-08:00	
Clean energy could create millions of tons of waste in India	KENCHANAHALLI, India — On the edges of a dense forest in southern India, six women in a small garage are busy stitching cloth bags, pants, hospital gowns and office uniforms with automated sewing machines. About four years ago, power cuts constantly interrupted their work. Heavy rain disrupted transmission lines and air conditioners pumping in extreme heat exhausted the grid. But now a small black box in a corner of the garage, not much larger than an office printer, keeps their operations running. The battery pack, made from used electric vehicle batteries, keeps their sewing machines and lights on even when the main power is off. 'This battery is a godsend for us,' said H. Gauri, one of the women. 'Before the battery came, we'd have to stitch manually when there was no electricity which is exhausting. That is not a concern anymore and we're able to finish all our orders on time.' While the group is successful, initiatives like it in India are still few and far between. As the country gets more electric vehicles, solar panels and wind turbines, all aimed at reducing the country's dependency on planet-warming fossil fuels, energy experts say that India will need to find ways to repurpose the batteries, panels and blades at the end of their lifespans or risk creating millions of tons of waste. If the country comes up with a comprehensive strategy to recycle components, it would both reduce waste and lead to fewer imports of the critical minerals needed for clean power in the future. Currently, many panels, batteries and other clean energy parts end up in landfills. But others are processed by unlicensed waste recyclers, and some newer businesses and organizations are coming up with ways to recycle the valuable components. Old EV car batteries can power rural livelihoods The six tailors in Kenchanahalli say their lives have completely changed since the battery smoothed over power cuts. Gauri, 32, said the steady income from the tailoring work has helped build a new home for her and her three children. She said it has also brought her more independence. 'Earlier, my husband was not happy about me working long hours or going to nearby towns to get tailoring orders,' she said. 'However, after seeing how much I was earning, he has taken a step back. It's not only me, this job has changed everything for all the women in this room.' The lithium-ion batteries can provide backup power for up to six hours. They were provided by battery refurbishing and energy storage company Nunam and set up at the campus of the Swami Vivekananda Youth Movement, a nongovernmental organization that works to help poor and Indigenous communities in remote regions of Karnataka. These relatively small electricity needs are perfect ways to reuse electric vehicle batteries, said Prithvi Raj Narendra, an engineer at Nunam. 'The way EVs use these batteries is like asking it to run. Using it to power small machines and streetlights is like asking it to walk,' he said. In the four years since the tailoring operation was set up, Nunam's orders have exponentially increased. Their two dozen employees in Bengaluru's electronic city neighborhood are busier than ever designing and packaging battery packs from used EV batteries from cars and three-wheelers. Narendra said the company aims to produce one gigawatt-hour of power — enough to power 1 million homes for a year — by the end of this decade for homes and small businesses across India, especially those without consistent sources of electricity. With a surge in solar, planning can minimize waste India is the world's most populous nation and among the biggest emitters of planet-warming gases. Like the rest of the world, a major part of transitioning away from dirty fossil fuels for electricity comes in the form of solar panels. Solar panels typically last between 20 and 30 years. Some estimates say that 100 kilotons of solar power-related waste is already produced every year in India and this number could grow to 340 kilotons by 2030. 'The issue is not very large right now, but it will become so as the installed base of solar panels becomes larger,' said Adarsh Das, who's worked in India's solar power sector for the past 30 years. The country has set an ambitious target of producing 500 gigawatts of clean power by the end of this decade and is also aiming to become a global hub for manufacturing clean power components like solar cells, panels and wind turbines. The Indian government has included solar, wind and EV components in its electronic waste regulations, and has called for producers to recycle components, but there's little clarity about how they should do that. U.S.-based renewable energy company First Solar owns a solar manufacturing site in Chennai, India, and has already included solar panel recycling in their business model. In the future, new panels will be made from old recycled components. Sujoy Ghosh, their managing director for India, said the government's waste regulations show it's thinking in the right direction, but the 'devil is in the details.' Rules around how solar panels should be recycled, and how companies can profit from setting up recycling facilities, are needed, he said. Anjali Taneja, a senior policy specialist at the Indian think-tank Centre for Study of Science, Technology and Policy, thinks recycling can definitely be profitable for Indian solar producers. But without a clear recycling plan, Taneja worries that the country 'could become one of the largest waste generators.' Creating a national effort to recycle raw materials India currently imports over 95% of lithium-ion batteries as well as large amounts of nickel, cobalt and other rare earth minerals that are needed for clean power and EV batteries, government reports say. Experts estimate that nearly 90% of those materials can be recovered to make new solar power panels, batteries and wind turbines within India. The ability to recycle critical minerals is 'a huge opportunity for India,' said Akansha Tyagi of the New Delhi-based Council on Energy, Environment and Water. 'Many strategies can be put in place to design products better, use them better over their lifetime, repair them before you recycle and eventually responsibly recycle.' The next step, Tyagi said, is to create a comprehensive policy for creating a circular economy — an economic model that aims to maximize the use of anything that is manufactured and create as little waste as possible. Industry stakeholders agree. Deepali Sinha Khetriwal, who runs a coworking space for electronic waste recyclers just outside New Delhi, said there is tremendous potential for creating jobs in the clean energy sector if recycling is taken up more seriously. 'You need skilled and semi-skilled people,' she said. 'The resource recovery industry is such a great job creator.' Khetriwal added that her hope is to see more recyclers like her across the country, creating national momentum for clean energy recycling. 'While our setup is still small, what we're trying to do can be replicated,' she said. 'We're excited about what the future holds if as a country we plan ahead.'	https://www.voanews.com/a/clean-energy-could-create-millions-of-tons-of-waste-in-india/7866056.html	2024-11-16T00:00:00-08:00	
Experts: Indonesia’s $10 billion deal with China could undermine sovereignty, increase political tensions	Jakarta — Maritime security and international law experts are concerned that a $10 billion deal concluded this week between China and Indonesia could not only undermine Indonesia’s sovereignty in the North Natuna Sea but also spur illegal fishing and increase political tensions among ASEAN nations. 'Indonesia could be subjugated economically by China, potentially leading to military power in the South China Sea region,' said Merisa Dwi Juanita, the founder of Bara Maritim, an independent institution for maritime security research. Recently inaugurated Indonesian President Prabowo Subianto began his first foreign tour by visiting China on November 8. He held a series of high-level talks and met with President Xi Jinping in Beijing’s Great Hall of the People, where both expressed their commitment to long-standing bilateral relations. 'I would like to reiterate our commitment to enhance this relationship and to work together for the mutual benefit of our two peoples and for the prosperity, peace and stability of all of Asia,' Prabowo said during the meeting. However, the joint statement that followed the visit alarmed analysts who view it as a departure from Indonesia’s long-standing South China Sea policy. Maritime security and international law experts who talked to VOA say the statement implicitly recognizes Beijing’s 'nine-dash line' designating its expansive territorial claims in the strategic waterway and could anger Indonesia’s neighbors within ASEAN. The Philippines, Malaysia, Brunei and Vietnam all are claimants in the dispute with China. $10 billion deal On his Beijing visit, Prabowo attended the Indonesia-China Business Forum, which saw the signing of business agreements between the Indonesian and Chinese private sectors said to be worth some $10 billion. These provide for the joint development of fisheries, oil and gas exploration and maritime safety. They also call for cooperation in the management of ocean resources and sustainable mineral extraction practices. By implicitly recognizing Beijing’s claim to territory that falls within Indonesia’s Exclusive Economic Zone, Indonesia 'has assented to something that is illegal under international law,' wrote Aristyo Darmawan, an international law professor at Universitas Indonesia, in an op-ed in The Interpreter. 'Even worse, Indonesia is willing to share its sovereign rights to explore and exploit fisheries and oil with the country that is making this claim.' He went on to say that since 2017, China has put forward several joint development proposals in the South China Sea, including the creation of a Spratly Resource Management Authority – with membership not just from parties to the territorial dispute, but also Indonesia. Indonesia is not a formal claimant in the South China Sea territorial dispute. Nevertheless, it rejects China’s claim to the waters around Natuna Island, which lie inside China’s self-drawn nine-dash line but fall within Indonesia’s EEZ and continental shelf. In order to create a joint development in a disputed area, Darmawan concluded, China would need to have a legitimate claim under the U.N. Convention on the law of the Sea (UNCLOS). Merisa said the China-Indonesia maritime agreement could also spur illegal fishing. 'There are growing doubts about law enforcement on Illegal, Unreported, and Unregulated fishing by Chinese fishermen. The substantial losses caused by IUU fishing could increase if Indonesia maintains the overlapping claims narrative. This could undermine the efforts by local fishermen and the Maritime Security Agency (Bakamla) to protect Indonesia’s maritime resources. Consequently, Indonesia would face even greater losses if this policy continues,' Merisa added. Merisa suggests Indonesia should strengthen its defenses by enforcing the law and better protecting local fishermen against aggressive Chinese coast guard actions. Regional implications An Indonesian Foreign Ministry statement following the agreement maintained that the deal is consistent with the 2002 Declaration on the Conduct of Parties in the South China Sea, signed by ASEAN and China. It said the parties will follow the maritime laws and regulations of each country, including maritime treaties, boundaries, marine spatial planning and fisheries management. The Foreign Ministry said the two countries 'agreed to form maritime cooperation. It is hoped that this collaboration can become a model for efforts to maintain peace and friendship in the region.' However, the statement by the Indonesian Foreign Ministry stressed that the agreement does not acknowledge the Chinese claim represented by its nine-dash line, which has been rejected by an international tribunal and is not supported by UNCLOS. Thus, the ministry said, this cooperation has no impact on Indonesia's sovereignty, sovereign rights or jurisdiction in the North Natuna Sea. Indonesia believes the cooperation will encourage the completion of a long-sought code of conduct for the South China Sea, which could create stability in the region. However, Aristyo said that the agreement exposes the disunity among ASEAN countries in their negotiations with Beijing and could cause them to feel betrayed by Indonesia’s implied recognition of the nine-dash line claim, which the others have firmly and jointly rejected. In addition, Indonesia’s seeming recognition of China’s overlapping claim contradicts a 2022 Indonesia-Vietnam EEZ agreement, which took 12 years to negotiate. Due to uncertainty caused by the joint statement with China, the ratification of the agreement with Vietnam could be set back. According to Reuters on Monday, Beijing did not immediately respond to a request for comment on Indonesia’s statement. Aristyo sees the joint statement as a huge win for Beijing. Indonesia had sovereign rights in its EEZ and continental shelf, but the joint development proposal would likely see Indonesia surrender those rights to a Joint Intergovernmental Steering Committee, he said. He suggests that Jakarta would be better off to focus on developing the Natuna Islands on its own, rather than joining with China.	https://www.voanews.com/a/experts-indonesia-s-10-billion-deal-with-china-could-undermine-sovereignty-increase-political-tensions/7866078.html	2024-11-15T23:30:00-08:00	
China's underground raves include street techno, quotes from Chairman Mao	CHANGCHUN, China — Crouch through the small metal door and walk down the dark tunnel, and even before you step into the abandoned air raid shelter, the air reverberates with pounding techno beats. Young Chinese holding booze and cigarettes shake and sway in a red-lit passageway, below a big screen rolling through quotations from Chairman Mao. This is an underground rave in China, part of a subculture growing in hidden corners of the nation's cities, even as its political and cultural mainstream grow increasingly controlled, staid and predictable. For Chinese ravers, these gatherings — often called 'ye di,' or 'wild dances' — not only offer a rare space for unfettered fun, but signal resistance to the narrowly prescribed future a rigid society expects for them. By day, Xing Long works in the office of a state-owned company in Changchun, an industrial city in China's northeastern rust belt region. By night, he's a DJ and underground rave organizer, a side gig that offers an escape from the humdrum of reviewing corporate contracts. 'My job cannot make me feel I fulfilled my values,' he said. 'Going to work is like executing a prewritten program.' Chinese young people face intense pressure and high expectations from the society around them. In recent years, facing bleak economic prospects, Chinese youth culture has been swept by a series of viral slang terms to describe frustration and hopelessness: ' 996 ' — the brutal 9 a.m. to 9 p.m., six days a week work schedule many companies ask of employees. 'Involution' — an endless treadmill of pointless competition that fresh graduates face. ' Lying flat' — the growing trend among young people of giving up all ambition and aiming to do as little as possible. Techno dance parties are an escape from all that for people like Xing. Every time he walks into a rave, the 31-year-old said, his brain 'jolts awake like a bang.' Xing first learned about techno music from a documentary made by the American media company Vice. 'My eyes brightened up when I heard it,' he said. 'I should've listened to this kind of music earlier.' Xing began going to raves in Shenzhen, a southern city with a population of 17 million, but when he moved home in 2021 he realized no one else was organizing them. 'I want this city to have an underground techno music scene,' he said. 'I want to listen to it myself, so I want to make it happen.' Xing said that the underground techno scene fascinated him because it's 'real' even if not perfect, bad, not in the right order, or broken. 'It's not a beautiful thing that was deliberately produced into a mold to present to the mainstream.' In recent years, space for culture and creativity has been shrinking in China as the authorities have ramped up censorship of concerts, shows, and other cultural events. Comedians have been silenced after joking about topics considered politically sensitive. A growing number of independent bookstores and creative spaces have shut down under pressure, while state-sanctioned media promotes uplifting, often saccharine narratives. Yet underground raves are free from all those limitations because they sprout in gray zones. Hidden from public view, they skirt formal approval processes, neither supported nor suppressed by the state. Feng Zhe, 27, a rave organizer in Shenyang, a northeastern city about 400 miles from Beijing, said raves are about 'refusing to be disciplined by society.' 'This is probably not how the world functions nowadays,' he said, adding that societies want to make people follow their rules and be useful but 'underground culture is useless.' 'Most people are going to be repressed,' Feng said. But for most rave organizers, the real meaning of underground rave culture is simply having fun. Loong Wu, a 26-year-old art student, started organizing raves in 2021 during COVID-19 lockdowns out of boredom. 'My original intention was just to break through the boredom,' she said. 'When you are truly enjoying it, you don't think about meanings.' On one recent Saturday night, civil servants, students, an ex-firefighter, girls with dyed hair, and a man with a full-face mask and goggles filed into a bar tucked behind a flower shop in downtown Changchun to attend one of Xing's raves. They danced to fast-paced industrial techno spun by Du Jizhe, a local part-time DJ who works in HR by day. He said it's the natural soundtrack of auto manufacturing cities like Changchun and Detroit, which prides itself on being the birthplace of techno. For Du, techno evokes childhood memories of the auto factory where his father worked. 'Techno is basically industrial noise like hammering and mechanical sounds,' Du said 'These noises exert a subtle influence on people's ears in industrial cities.' Chen Xiangyu, a fashion student in an oversized black T-shirt with hair dyed blond, a black leather choker, a lip piercing, and smoky eye makeup, said raves are a pure release. 'The first time I came, I thought to myself, I don't know anyone, no one knows me, so nobody's paying any attention to how I dance, so long as I'm happy, it's all good,' she said. 'I shouldn't care too much about what others think.' Even at raves, illegal drugs are rarely seen in China, but promoters still face risks from authorities who have little patience for unapproved social gatherings. Advertisements promoting raves are often cryptic, with only a date, a DJ line-up, and the cost of admission. Sometimes, the location won't be revealed until an hour ahead of the party. Some organizers require guests to cover their phone's camera with a sticker. Loong Wu said her requirements for a rave spot were no CCTV cameras, no security, and no nearby residents. Even those aren't a guarantee — local police once busted one of her raves in an industrial port. 'It was pathetic how few such places exist in the city,' she said. Frustrated with how hard it was to find a good rave spot, she once organized a public party where she put her DJ equipment on a cart and pushed it through city streets as revelers danced alongside. 'Restrictions exist for sure, but that's exactly why we need to create our own scene,' she said. 'We always need 'wild dances.' We always need to dance outside of set rules.'	https://www.voanews.com/a/china-s-underground-raves-include-street-techno-quotes-from-chairman-mao-/7863378.html	2024-11-15T23:00:00-08:00	
Wild deer population boom has some in England promoting venison to consumers	WINCHESTER, England — In the half-light of dusk, Martin Edwards surveys the shadows of the ancient woodland from a high seat and waits. He sits still, watching with his thermal camera. Even the hares don't seem to notice the deer stalker until he takes aim. The bang of his rifle pierces the stillness. He's killed a buck, one of many wild deer roaming this patch of forest in Hampshire, southern England. Edwards advocates humane deer management: the culling of deer to control their numbers and ensure they don't overrun forests and farmland in a country where they no longer have natural predators. For these advocates, shooting deer is much more than a sport. It's a necessity because England's deer population has gotten out of control. There are now more deer in England than at any other time in the last 1,000 years, according to the Forestry Commission, the government department looking after England's public woodland. That has had a devastating impact on the environment, officials say. Excessive deer foraging damages large areas of woodland including young trees, as well as the habitats of certain birds like robins. Some landowners have lost huge amounts of crops to deer, and overpopulation means that the mammals are more likely to suffer from starvation and disease. 'They will produce more young every year. We've got to a point where farmers and foresters are definitely seeing that impact,' said Edwards, pointing to some young hazel shrubs with half-eaten buds. 'If there's too many deer, you will see that they've literally eaten all the vegetation up to a certain height.' Forestry experts and businesses argue that culling the deer — and supplying the meat to consumers — is a double win: It helps rebalance the ecosystem and provides a low-fat, sustainable protein. While venison — a red meat similar to lean beef but with an earthier flavor — is often perceived as a high-end food in the U.K., one charity sees it as an ideal protein for those who can't afford to buy other meats. 'Why not utilize that fantastic meat to feed people in need?' said SJ Hunt, chief executive of The Country Food Trust, which distributes meals made with wild venison to food banks. Pandemic population boom An estimated 2 million deer now roam England's forests. The government says native wild deer play a role in healthy forest ecosystems, but acknowledges that their population needs managing. It provides some funding for solutions such as building deer fences. But experts like Edwards, a spokesman for the British Association for Shooting and Conservation, believe lethal control is the only effective option, especially after deer populations surged during the COVID-19 pandemic. The pandemic was a boon to deer because hunters, like everyone else, stayed home and the restaurant market — the main outlet for venison in the U.K. — vanished overnight. 'There were no sales of venison and the price was absolutely on the floor,' said Ben Rigby, a leading venison and game meats wholesaler. 'The deer had a chance to breed massively.' Rigby's company now processes hundreds of deer a week, turning them into diced venison or steaks for restaurants and supermarkets. One challenge, he said, is growing the domestic appetite for venison so it appears on more dinner plates, especially after Brexit put new barriers up for exporting the meat. 'We're not really a game-eating nation, not like in France or Germany or Scandinavia,' he said. 'But the U.K. is becoming more and more aware of it and our trade is growing.' From the forest to the table Shooting deer is legal but strictly regulated in England. Stalkers must have a license, use certain kinds of firearms and observe open seasons. They also need a valid reason, such as when a landowner authorizes them to kill the deer when their land is damaged. Hunting deer with packs of dogs is illegal. Making wild venison more widely available in supermarkets and beyond will motivate more stalkers to cull the deer and ensure the meat doesn't go to waste, Edwards said. Forestry England, which manages public forests, is part of that drive. In recent years it supplied some hospitals with 1,000 kilograms of wild venison, which became the basis of pies and casseroles popular with patients and staff, it said. The approach appears to have been well received, though it has attracted some criticism from animal welfare group PETA, which advocates veganism. Hunt, the food charity chief, said there's potential to do much more with the meat, which she described as nutritious and 'free-range to the purest form of that definition.' Her charity distributed hundreds of thousands of pouches of venison Bolognese meals to food banks last year — and people are hungry for more, she said. She recalled attending one food bank session where the only protein available was canned sardines, canned baked beans and the venison meals. 'There were no eggs. There was no cheese. That's all that they could do, and people were just saying, 'Thank you, please bring more (of the venison),' she said. 'That's fantastic, because people realize they're doing a double positive with helping the environment by utilizing the meat as well.'	https://www.voanews.com/a/wild-deer-population-boom-has-some-in-england-promoting-venison-to-consumers/7863366.html	2024-11-15T23:00:00-08:00	
Operation False Target: How Russia plotted to mix a deadly new weapon among decoy drones in Ukraine	KYIV, Ukraine — At a secretive factory in Russia's central grasslands, engineers are manufacturing hundreds of decoy drones meant to overwhelm Ukrainian defenses as they try to protect against a horrific new weapon, an Associated Press investigation has found. The plant at Russia’s Alabuga Special Economic Zone recently started churning out thermobaric drones alongside the decoys, the investigation found. The thermobaric warheads create a vortex of high pressure and heat that can penetrate thick walls. They suck out all the oxygen in their path, and have a fearsome reputation because of the injuries inflicted even outside the initial blast site: Collapsed lungs, crushed eyeballs, brain damage. Russia came up with the plan for decoys in late 2022 and codenamed it Operation False Target, according to a person familiar with Russia’s drone production who spoke on condition of anonymity because the industry is highly sensitive. The idea was to launch armed drones along with dozens of decoys, sometimes stuffed with rags or foam, and indistinguishable on radar from those carrying real bombs. Ukrainian forces must make split-second decisions about how to expend scarce resources to save lives and preserve critical infrastructure. 'The idea was to make a drone which would create a feeling of complete uncertainty for the enemy. So he doesn’t know whether it’s really a deadly weapon ... or essentially a foam toy,' the person said. With the thermobarics, there is now a 'huge risk' an armed drone could deviate from its course and end up in a residential area where the 'damage will be simply terrifying,' he said. Russia's drone factory In recent weeks, decoys have filled Ukraine’s skies by the dozens, each one appearing as an indistinguishable blip on military radar screens. During the first weekend of November, the Kyiv region spent 20 hours under air alert, and the sound of buzzing drones mingled with the boom of air defenses and rifle shots. Unarmed decoys now make up more than half the drones targeting Ukraine, according to the person and Serhii Beskrestnov, a Ukrainian electronics expert whose black military van is kitted out with electronic jammers to down drones. Both the unarmed decoys and the armed Iranian-designed Shahed drones are being built at a factory in Russia’s Alabuga Special Economic Zone, an industrial complex set up in 2006 about 1,000 kilometers east of Moscow to attract businesses and investment to Tatarstan. It expanded after the 2022 invasion of Ukraine and some sectors switched to military production, adding new buildings and renovating existing sites, according to satellite images analyzed by The Associated Press. In social media videos, the factory promotes itself as an innovation hub. But David Albright of the Washington-based Institute for Science and International Security said Alabuga’s current purpose is purely to produce and sell drones to Russia‘s Ministry of Defense. The videos and other promotional media were taken down after an AP investigation found that many of the African women recruited to fill labor shortages there complained they were duped into taking jobs at the plant. Russia and Iran signed a $1.7 billion deal for the Shaheds in 2022, after President Vladimir Putin invaded Ukraine, and Moscow began using Iranian imports of the unmanned aerial vehicles, or UAVs, in battle later that year. Soon after the deal was signed, production started in Alabuga. In October, Moscow attacked with at least 1,889 drones – 80% more than in August, according to an AP analysis tracking the drones for months. On Saturday, Russia launched 145 drones across Ukraine, just days after the reelection of Donald Trump threw into doubt U.S. support for the country. Since summer, most drones crash, are shot down or are diverted by electronic jamming, according to an AP analysis of Ukrainian military briefings. Less than 6% hit a discernible target, according to the data analyzed by AP since the end of July. But the sheer numbers mean a handful can slip through every day – and that is enough to be deadly. Daily drone swarms The swarms have become a demoralizing fact of life for Ukrainians. Russian drone tactics continue to evolve. Now, more powerful missiles often follow close behind as air defenses are exhausted by the drones. The most destructive are the ballistic and cruise missiles that fly many times faster than the drones, which buzz loudly and can be tracked by the naked eye. Even the decoys can be useful to Russia. One decoy with a live-feed camera allows the aircraft to geolocate Ukraine’s air defenses and relay the information to Russia in the final moments of its mechanical life. Night after night, Ukrainian sharpshooters spring into action to down the drones with portable surface-to-air missiles. One sharpshooter, who like most Ukrainian soldiers asked to be identified by his call-sign Rosmaryn, said he’s shot down perhaps a dozen drones in all over nearly two years and saw one that was stuffed with rags and foam. Rosmaryn sees his adversary in almost human terms, describing the aircraft’s quest to outwit his small unit. 'It was part of a swarm, flying as one of the last ones,' he said. 'When it’s in the sky, we can’t tell what kind it is, because everything is inside the drone. We only find out after it’s shot down.' Many fly at 2,000 to 3,000 meters before dropping to lower altitudes on their final approach, Rosmaryn said. Leaked videos suggest Ukraine is now using helicopters to shoot down the high-altitude drones. Three decoys of Russian origin have crashed in Moldova in the past week, authorities there said. Thanks to optical trickery, radar can’t distinguish a drone armed with a Shahed’s usual 50-kilogram payload of explosives or with a thermobaric weapon – also known as a vacuum bomb – from those without a warhead or topped with live-feed surveillance cameras. There are also other even rougher-quality drones, armed and unarmed, but in fewer quantities than the Shahed-style unmanned aircraft. That’s why, even knowing that decoys now make up most of an incoming swarm, Ukraine can’t afford to let anything through. 'For us, it’s just a point on the radar … It has speed, direction, and altitude,' said Col. Yurii Ihnat, an Air Force spokesperson. 'We have no way of identifying the exact target during flight, so we have to either jam them with electronic warfare or use firepower to neutralize them. The enemy uses these to scatter our attention.' The engines and electronics for the armed Shaheds and decoys are a mix of Chinese and Western imports, according to fragments seen by The Associated Press at a Ukrainian military lab. Without them, the drones can’t fly. Despite nearly three years of sanctions, Moscow can still source the parts – largely from China and via third countries in Central Asia and the Middle East. Halfway through the series of air alerts on November 2, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy said the swarms of Shaheds, which he put at 2,000 for the month of October alone, were made possible by Western technology slipping through sanctions. 'Included in this many Shaheds are more than 170,000 components that should have been blocked for delivery to Russia. Microcircuits, microcontrollers, processors, many different parts, without which this terror would simply be impossible,' Zelenskyy said. The joint manufacturing of the drones — some to carry bombs, others to divert attention — is saving Russia's military money. Production of the decoys started earlier this year and now the plant turns out about 40 of the cheaper unarmed drones a day and around 10 armed ones, which cost an estimated $50,000 and take longer to produce, according to the person with knowledge of Russian drone production. The Russian news outlet Izvestia in late October said the aim of the decoy is to 'weaken' the enemy by forcing it to waste ammunition before sending in armed Shaheds. Both Beskrestnov and the person familiar with Russian drone production said engineers at Alabuga are also constantly experimenting, putting Moscow at the cutting edge of drone production. To make electronic interference harder, they add Ukrainian SIM cards, roaming SIMS, Starlinks, fiberoptics – and can sometimes receive real-time feedback before the drones are jammed, downed or run out of fuel. Sometimes they attach a silver-painted foam ball to make the drone seem larger on a radar. But the latest thermobaric variant is causing new anguish in Ukraine. Thermobaric fears From a military point of view, thermobarics are ideal for going after targets that are either inside fortified buildings or deep underground. Alabuga’s thermobaric drones are particularly destructive when they strike buildings, because they are also loaded with ball bearings to cause maximum damage even beyond the superheated blast, said Albright. Beskrestnov, who is more widely known as Flash and whose black military van is kitted out with electronic jammers to down drones, said the thermobarics were first used over the summer and estimated they now make up between 3% and 5% of all drones. 'This type of warhead has the possibility to destroy a huge building, especially block flats. And it’s very effective if the Russian Federation tries to attack our power plants,' he said. They have a fearsome reputation because of the physical effects even on people caught outside the initial blast site, said Arthur van Coller, an expert in international humanitarian law at South Africa’s University of Fort Hare. 'With a thermobaric explosion, because of the cloud it would create, everything in its radius would be affected,' he said. 'It creates massive fear in the civilian population. Thermobaric weapons have created this idea that they are really horrible weapons, and that creates fear.'	https://www.voanews.com/a/operation-false-target-how-russia-plotted-to-mix-a-deadly-new-weapon-among-decoy-drones-in-ukraine/7866087.html	2024-11-15T22:25:59-08:00	
Protesters demand resignation of leader in Russian-backed breakaway region of Georgia	Protesters stormed the parliament of the Russian-backed breakaway Georgian region of Abkhazia on Friday and demanded the resignation of its leader over an unpopular investment agreement with Moscow. The self-styled president of the region, Aslan Bzhania, said he had no intention of stepping down or fleeing. He said talks were proceeding with opposition representatives. But opposition representatives rejected the president's statement, and news reports said they had broken off the talks. Russia said it was following the 'crisis situation' with concern and urged its citizens to avoid travel to Abkhazia. Russia recognized Abkhazia and another breakaway region, South Ossetia, as independent states in 2008 after it defeated Georgia in a five-day war. It maintains troop bases in both regions and props up their economies. In Abkhazia's capital, Sukhumi, protesters used a truck to smash through the metal gates surrounding parliament. They then climbed through windows after wrenching off metal bars. An opposition leader, Temur Gulia, said protesters initially demanded cancellation of the investment agreement, which critics feared would allow wealthy Russians and businesses to buy up property in the lush Black Sea region, pricing out locals. But now, he said, the protesters wanted to oust the president. Protesters break into offices Protesters also broke into presidential administration offices in the same complex as the parliament. Emergency services said at least nine people were taken to the hospital. Bzhania, writing on the Telegram messaging app, said he and other leaders were 'staying in place and will keep on working.' 'I ask you not to give in to panic. I am staying in Abkhazia and will work as I have done,' Bzhania wrote, saying that the first task was to clean up after the unrest. 'At this time, talks are going on with the opposition.' Opposition activist Akhra Bzhania rejected the statement, telling Reuters the president had 'lost his legitimacy. His refusal to resign today does not change anything.' Talks broken off The Tass news agency quoted opposition representative Kan Kvarchia as saying all talks had been broken off. Bzhania's office later said the president, a former chief of the state security service who became head of state in 2020, was in his coastal home village of Tamysh. Another opposition leader, Eshsou Kakalia, told Reuters the protesters would not leave the government complex until Bzhania agreed to resign. The presidential administration said in a statement that authorities were preparing to withdraw the investment agreement. Olesya Vartanyan, an independent regional expert, said the crisis was the culmination of mounting Russian pressure to get more from Abkhazia in return for its financial support. 'The Russians are paying them — they want something back,' she said in a telephone interview. 'There is always this question: 'Why are we supporting you guys and you're not even allowing Russian citizens to buy property there?' ' If Bzhania fell, he would be the third local leader to be toppled in a similar way since 2008. Vartanyan said Moscow's usual approach was to allow the periodic crises to play out and then strike deals with whichever leader came next. 'Every single Abkhaz leader after they got recognized by Moscow became sort of a hostage to Moscow,' she said. 'When you come to power, you have to be loyal to Moscow and then you have to find a way to cooperate.' Most of the world recognizes Abkhazia as part of Georgia, from which it broke away during wars in the early 1990s. The opposition said in a statement that the protests were not against Russian-Abkhazian relations, but charged that Bzhania 'has been trying to use these relations for his own selfish interests, manipulating them for the sake of strengthening his regime.'	https://www.voanews.com/a/protesters-demand-resignation-of-leader-in-russian-backed-breakaway-region-of-georgia-/7866046.html	2024-11-15T18:52:41-08:00	
Dutch government survives dispute over Amsterdam violence	AMSTERDAM — Dutch Prime Minister Dick Schoof saved his governing coalition on Friday despite threats of an exodus by Cabinet members over the right-wing government's response to violence against Israeli football fans last week. Junior Finance Minister Nora Achahbar unexpectedly quit the Cabinet on Friday to protest claims by some politicians that Dutch youths of Moroccan descent attacked Israeli fans in Amsterdam around the November 7 match between a Dutch team Ajax and Maccabi Tel Aviv. Her resignation triggered a crisis Cabinet meeting at which four ministers from her centrist NSC party also threatened to quit. If they had, the coalition would have lost its majority in parliament. 'We have reached the conclusion that we want to remain, as a Cabinet for all people in the Netherlands,' Schoof said at a news conference late on Friday in The Hague. Last week's violence was roundly condemned by Israeli and Dutch politicians, with Amsterdam's mayor saying 'antisemitic hit-and-run squads' had attacked Israeli fans. The city's police department has said Maccabi fans were chased and beaten by gangs on scooters. Police also said the Israeli fans attacked a taxi and burned a Palestinian flag. Achahbar, a former judge and public prosecutor who was born in Morocco, felt comments by several political figures were hurtful and possibly racist, De Volkskrant daily reported. 'Polarization in the recent weeks has had such an effect on me that I no longer can, nor wish to fulfill my position in this cabinet,' Achahbar said in a statement. Schoof, a former civil servant who does not have a party affiliation, denied any ministers in the Cabinet are racist. Details of the Cabinet discussion were not disclosed. The coalition is led by the anti-Muslim populist party PVV of Geert Wilders, which finished first in a general election a year ago. The government was installed in July after months of tense negotiations. Wilders, who is not a Cabinet member, has repeatedly said Dutch youth of Moroccan descent were the main attackers of the Israeli fans, although police have not specified the backgrounds of suspects. Schoof said on Monday the incidents showed that some youth in the Netherlands with immigrant backgrounds did not share 'Dutch core values.'	https://www.voanews.com/a/dutch-government-survives-dispute-over-amsterdam-violence/7866053.html	2024-11-15T18:20:40-08:00	
Western diplomats urge Somaliland leaders to accept election results	Western diplomats have urged Somaliland's three presidential candidates and their supporters to accept the election results, expected in the coming days, as vote counting continues. The diplomats said they have visited 30 polling stations in different cities in Somaliland to 'reaffirm their support for the democratic process.' The foreign diplomats from nine European countries and the United States, who were in Somaliland on Wednesday to witness the elections, said they commend Somaliland's National Electoral Commission for conducting a 'transparent voter registration and candidate nomination process.' In a statement read by the U.K. ambassador to Somalia, Mike Nithavrianakis, the diplomats said they stand ready to work alongside Somaliland to further strengthen democracy and accountability in the future. Meanwhile, international observers in Somaliland said the elections were peaceful, although in some parts the polling stations did not open 'due to conflict.' Tim Cole, a former British diplomat, is the chief observer of the International Election Observation Mission Somaliland. He is leading a team of 28 international observers invited by the Somaliland election committee. Cole said the observers visited 146 polling stations and saw 'some administrative issues' and said in some places 'procedures weren't followed.' However, he said the team observed that in general, people wanted to participate in the election, there was enthusiasm for voting and the elections were peaceful. 'In some parts of Somaliland ... the polling stations didn't open because of conflict. So that's one issue that some voters faced,' he told VOA's Horn of Africa Service. 'There were long queues, which can be seen as a good thing, but it also means people are standing around for a long time. But, yeah, the main challenges were really, I would say, there were some procedural issues. As I said, some of the polling stations, for example, didn't open as early as they should have done. They were due to open at 7 o'clock and they opened later. That was also true in the capital, Hargeisa.' The observer said the tallying starts when the ballot boxes are brought from all six regions of Somaliland. He said the results will take days to be released. 'It will be sometime next week before we know the final results,' he said. 'So, I'm not sure exactly which day that could be, because all of those things can take time or could be done very quickly depending on logistics, cars breaking down, all those sorts of things. That can happen in any country. So, it will be a few days yet before we get the final result.' The Brenthurst Foundation, a Johannesburg-based think tank that sent observers to Somaliland, said no serious incidents threatened the integrity of the election on voting day. 'In our opinion, this election was free, fair and credible despite the constraints of Somaliland's financial and institutional means,' it said in a report published Friday. More than 1.2 million people registered to vote in the election, the fourth in Somaliland since 2003. The region seceded from the rest of Somalia in 1991 but gained no international recognition. Somalia still considers Somaliland as part of its territory. Guleid Ahmed Jama is a prominent Somaliland human rights lawyer and analyst. He says the economy, international recognition, foreign affairs, and peace and security were the main issues the candidates have been campaigning on. 'The economy of Somaliland is in a very poor position. Somaliland is a poor country; it's one of the poorest places in the world. It doesn't produce or manufacture anything. Most of the things, most of the goods used in Somaliland are imported from the outside,' he said. 'Somaliland export is only livestock and also gets some money from remittance and by the diaspora community. So, its economy is very poor. That is an issue in Somaliland, particularly to the youth,' Jama said. Recognition is another key issue in Somaliland. The current president, Muse Bihi Abdi, signed a Memorandum of Understanding (MOU) with Ethiopia in January, agreeing to lease 20 kilometers of seafront to the landlocked country in return for recognition. Jama said if the incumbent wins, he will implement the MOU. He said the opposition has welcomed the agreement, but with reservations. 'The political leaders, particularly two main contenders, are all on the same page to have some sort of agreement with Ethiopia in relation to access to [the] sea. But the opposition's position is that they will like to see the memorandum of understanding — what is written — because they haven't seen it. It is not a public document, and they say the people will be consulted and the process will be transparent,' he said. 'But the ruling party candidate obviously says if he gets elected, he will convert it to a legally binding agreement. So, it depends on who wins in this election, whether they will proceed with the memorandum of understanding or not.' Somalia condemns the MOU as illegal and an infringement of its sovereignty and territorial unity, while Ethiopia and Somaliland defend it. Without commenting on the MOU, Ethiopia praised Somaliland's election and congratulated the people of Somaliland 'on the conduct of [voters for the] peaceful and democratic election.' In a statement issued by the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, Ethiopia commended Somaliland's National Electoral Commission for conducting a 'free and fair election.' 'This process reflects the maturity of Somaliland's governance and democratic system,' the statement concluded.	https://www.voanews.com/a/western-diplomats-urge-somaliland-leaders-to-accept-election-results/7866027.html	2024-11-15T18:20:26-08:00

FBI says bigoted text messages also sent to LGBTQ, Hispanic people	The U.S. FBI said on Friday that a spate of offensive text messages sent out in the wake of Donald Trump's presidential election win and apparently aimed at Black Americans had expanded to target Hispanic and LGBTQ people. In a statement, the bureau said it was aware of the messages, many of which used ethnic slurs and instructed the recipients to pick cotton, a reference to past enslavement of Black people in the United States. The FBI said on Friday that a new wave of messages was sent to Hispanics and LGBTQ people, with 'some recipients reported being told they were selected for deportation or to report to a re-education camp.' The texts, some of which referred to Trump's election win, drew widespread revulsion after several recipients shared them on social media last week. Both federal and state authorities have said they are investigating. They have not said anything about who might be behind the messages or how many people have received them. Some Black Americans have said they fear a rollback of civil rights after Trump, a Republican, won the November 5 presidential election. Trump, who takes office on January 20, has pledged to end federal diversity and inclusion programs. The Trump campaign has said it has nothing to do with the messages.	https://www.voanews.com/a/fbi-says-bigoted-text-messages-also-sent-to-lgbtq-hispanic-people/7866037.html	2024-11-15T17:48:23-08:00	
Democratic senators ask Pentagon, US officials to probe reports of Musk's alleged calls with Russia	washington — Reports that billionaire Elon Musk has held multiple calls with Russian officials, including President Vladimir Putin, should be investigated by the Pentagon and law enforcement agencies on national security grounds, two senior Democratic senators said in a letter seen by Reuters on Friday. Musk, who has been appointed to a senior government role by Republican President-elect Donald Trump, oversees billions of dollars in Pentagon and intelligence community contracts as CEO of aerospace company SpaceX. Senator Jeanne Shaheen, a senior Foreign Relations Committee member, and Senate Armed Services Committee Chair Jack Reed told U.S. Attorney General Merrick Garland and the Pentagon's inspector general that Musk's involvement in those SpaceX programs should be probed for potential debarment and exclusion after reports as recent as October of his conversations with Russian officials. Debarment refers to exclusion from certain contracts and privileges. 'These relationships between a well-known U.S. adversary and Mr. Musk, a beneficiary of billions of dollars in U.S. government funding, pose serious questions regarding Mr. Musk's reliability as a government contractor and a clearance holder,' the lawmakers said in a joint letter dated Friday. Several Democratic lawmakers have publicly called for a probe into Musk's communications with Moscow since a report by The Wall Street Journal last month on the alleged contact, but the letter to the U.S. officials who could launch such an investigation has not been previously reported. The call by Shaheen and Reed for a federal probe is a long-shot effort as Trump prepares to return to the White House with backing from Musk, who spent over $119 million on Trump's reelection campaign and was appointed co-head of the president-elect's forthcoming Department of Government Efficiency. SpaceX, Musk and the Pentagon did not immediately respond to requests for comment. The Pentagon and Justice Department did not immediately respond to similar requests. Russian contact Reports of Musk's contact with Russian officials emerged in 2022, when political scientist Ian Bremmer, president of consulting firm Eurasia Group, said he was told by Musk that he had spoken with Putin about the Ukraine war and Russia's red line for using nuclear weapons. Musk denied Bremmer's claim and said he had only spoken to Putin 18 months earlier, about space. Last month, The Wall Street Journal reported Musk has had multiple conversations with Russian officials, including Putin and his first deputy chief of staff, Sergei Kiriyenko, citing unnamed U.S., European and Russian officials. Shaheen and Reed said in the letter it was 'deeply concerning' that Musk reportedly had conversations with Kiriyenko. He was charged this year with other Russian officials by the U.S. Justice Department for spearheading an AI-powered propaganda campaign on Musk's social-media platform X and other sites to promote Russian interests and influence voters ahead of the U.S. presidential election. Musk has publicly claimed he holds a U.S. security clearance, giving him access to secret information at SpaceX, which holds billions of dollars in Pentagon and NASA launch contracts. The company also has a $1.8 billion intelligence community contract to build a vast spy satellite network, Reuters has reported. 'Communications between Russian government officials and any individual with a security clearance have the potential to put our security at risk,' the lawmakers said in the letter. Tensions between the U.S. and Russia in space have spiked since Russia's 2022 Ukraine invasion. Pentagon officials have condemned suspect maneuvers by Russian satellites in orbit and this year accused Russia of developing a space-based nuclear weapon capable of disabling large satellite networks. Musk's SpaceX has come to dominate the U.S. space industry and is relied on heavily by NASA and the Pentagon. The company's Starlink internet network of nearly 7,000 satellites has made SpaceX the world's largest satellite operator and a disruptive force in the satellite internet sector, with heavy interest from the Pentagon for military communications. Ukraine's military relies heavily on Starlink for battlefield connectivity. The senators sent a separate letter on Friday to U.S. Air Force Secretary Frank Kendall saying Musk's reported conversations raise the need for more competition in the launch and satellite communications industries and to use more companies besides SpaceX for sensitive national security missions. 'Mr. Musk's reported behavior could pose serious risks to national security, and as CEO of a company with billions of dollars in sensitive defense and intelligence contracts, warrant reconsideration of SpaceX's outsized role in [the Defense Department's] commercial space integration,' the lawmakers said.	https://www.voanews.com/a/democratic-senators-ask-pentagon-us-officials-to-probe-reports-of-musk-s-alleged-calls-with-russia/7865802.html	2024-11-15T16:56:50-08:00

Pakistani religious body declares using VPN is against Islamic law	islamabad — Pakistan’s top advisory body on religious affairs on Friday declared that using virtual private networks to access blocked content on the internet is against Shariah, or Islamic law. The statement came as authorities deploy a nationwide firewall and push users to register VPNs with the state’s media regulator, ostensibly to enhance cybersecurity and fight terrorism. Critics say such measures, however, increase online surveillance, curb freedom of expression and hurt e-commerce. Virtual private networks enable internet users to hide their identity and location, allowing them to maintain privacy and security and access online content that is blocked in their country. The Council of Islamic Ideology said the technology was being used in Pakistan to access content prohibited according to Islamic principles or forbidden by law, including 'immoral and porn websites or websites that spread anarchy through disinformation.' 'Using VPNs to access blocked or illegal content is against Islamic and social norms, therefore, their use is not acceptable under Islamic law. It falls under ‘abetting in sin,’ ' said the statement, quoting the council’s chairman, Raghib Naeemi. The statement declared that any technology, including the internet, used to access 'immoral or illegal activities is prohibited according to Islamic principles.' Earlier in the day, the Ministry of Interior sent a letter to the Pakistan Telecommunication Authority, or PTA, the country’s independent media regulator, asking it to block all 'illegal' VPNs, claiming terrorists were using the cyber tool. 'VPNs are increasingly being exploited by terrorists to facilitate violent activities and financial transactions in Pakistan,' the letter said. The ministry also pointed to the use of VPNs for viewing pornography. 'Pakistan is also considered as one of the leading [countries] in terms of [people] visiting porn sites using VPNs. However, these trends warrant prohibition of unauthorized VPNs to address the critical threats,' the note added. Along with using VPNs for online business and entertainment, many Pakistanis use the tool to access social media platform X, formerly Twitter, which remains mostly inaccessible since February’s controversial general elections. According to court filings, the interior ministry ordered the PTA to suspend the platform 'in the interest of upholding national security, maintaining public order and preserving the integrity of our nation.' Opponents of the restrictions say the increased push to control online activities is aimed at curbing criticism of the Pakistani military. The powerful institution is facing intense backlash for its alleged meddling in politics since incarcerated former Prime Minister Imran Khan was pushed out of office in April 2022. Denying political interference, the military repeatedly has referred to online criticism and smear campaigns as 'digital terrorism.' Speaking Friday at a security forum in Islamabad, Pakistan's army chief, General Asim Munir, reiterated the call for greater regulation of online speech. 'Freedom of expression without rules and regulations is becoming a source of degradation of values in all societies,' Munir told the audience at the Margalla Dialogue. Earlier this week the PTA announced a meeting with representatives from the Ministry of Information Technology & Telecommunication, the Pakistan Software Export Board and the Pakistan Software Houses Association to discuss a VPN registration framework. The authority also announced a 'streamlined' VPN registration process that it said allows 'legitimate users to register their VPNs through a new online platform.' This came after Pakistanis reported widespread disruption in VPN connectivity over the weekend. A cybersecurity source confirmed to VOA the outage was part of a government-run experiment to block VPNs using the firewall that is being deployed and was tested for months. Officials reject the notion the government is attempting to throttle the internet. However, experts say the nationwide internet regulation tool acquired from China increases the Pakistani state’s capability to monitor communications.

In its letter Friday, the interior ministry asked the PTA to allow users to register VPNs until the end of the month.	https://www.voanews.com/a/pakistani-religious-body-declares-using-vpn-is-against-islamic-law-/7865991.html	2024-11-15T16:51:42-08:00	
Taliban relocation plan could worsen humanitarian crisis in Afghanistan, analysts say	The Taliban's Ministry of Refugees and Repatriation announced plans this week to return millions of internally displaced people (IDP) to their home villages and provinces in Afghanistan, a move analysts warn could worsen the country's humanitarian crisis. 'In the first phase, 5,000 displaced families in Kabul would be moved to different places to their places of origin. Most of these families are from [the northeastern province of] Kunduz,' said the ministry’s statement, issued Wednesday. The Taliban called on national and international organizations to support their relocation plan. 'This is a priority for the ministry,' the statement said. 'It is a good decision to relocate displaced families to their communities of origin,' said Sayed Ahmad Selab, the founder of the Selab Charity Foundation and former Afghan parliamentarian, adding, 'but it could bring about a humanitarian crisis under the current circumstances.' Most of these families would not have shelter, Selab said, if they were returned to their provinces. 'They were displaced because of the yearslong conflict and drought. Most of them lost their houses and would have no prospects of jobs and places to live if they were returned,' he said. The United Nations refugee agency, or UNHCR, says there are 3.2 million IDPs in Afghanistan. More than 7.6 million Afghans are living as refugees in Pakistan and Iran, including 1.6 million Afghans who left after the Taliban’s takeover in August 2021. About a year ago, both Iran and Pakistan started forcible repatriation of Afghan refugees from their countries. The Taliban government said in June that around 2,000 Afghans were arriving daily from these countries. Hafiz Ahmad Miakhil, a former adviser to the Ministry of Refugee and Repatriation, told VOA that he does not think the Taliban 'have any policy in place for the relocation plan.' He told VOA that the Taliban’s ministry is not in a position to undertake the repatriation of millions of internally displaced people. 'For the repatriation of internally displaced people, there is the need to construct schools and provide shelters and health services. The Taliban don’t have the resources to do so,' Miakhil said. He added that the Taliban would need the support of the international community and for that, the Taliban 'have to get recognized nationally and internationally.' The Taliban, who seized power in August 2021 after the former Afghan government collapsed, are not yet recognized as the legitimate government of Afghanistan by any country. Under the Taliban, Afghanistan is facing multiple crises. Sanctions against the Taliban, no banking transfers, frozen assets, no access to global institutions and the dwindling of foreign aid have moved millions into poverty and hunger. There are 11.6 million people who are food insecure in Afghanistan. In September, the U.N. said that it received only 30% of the $3 billion needed this year for the humanitarian response in the country. Since returning to power, the Taliban have imposed repressive measures on women and imposed their strict interpretation of Islam in the country. 'The de facto authorities are exacerbating this crisis by policies that focus insufficiently on the real needs of its people and undermine its economic potential,' said Roza Otunbayeva, the U.N. special representative for Afghanistan. Abdul Hamid Jalili, the former Afghan attache in the Peshawar Consulate, told VOA that the Taliban’s decision to return IDPs to their villages 'would bring yet another humanitarian crisis.'

Philippines deals with massive flooding after 5th typhoon hits	Tropical storms bearing dangerous amounts of moisture are affecting communities on opposite sides of the world. Typhoon Usagi in the northern Philippines has dumped massive amounts of rain in the region, knocking out power, sweeping away houses and bridges and displacing thousands of people since it made landfall Thursday afternoon. Thousands of people were evacuated before the typhoon’s arrival, but no deaths have been reported so far. Usagi is the northern Philippines’ fifth major storm in less than a month, landing just two days after Typhoon Toraji left the area, leaving behind floods and displacing more than 82,000 people. 'Typhoons are overlapping,' U.N. Philippines Resident and Humanitarian Coordinator Gustavo Gonzalez said in a statement. 'As soon as communities attempt to recover from the shock, the next tropical storm is already hitting them again.' In its emergency plan, the U.N. Humanitarian Country Team in the Philippines said: 'The Philippines is facing an exceptionally challenging tropical cyclone season, with successive cyclones reaching unprecedented locations and scales. Local authorities, who are often impacted themselves, are overwhelmed as they simultaneously respond to the crisis and coordinate rescue efforts for affected families.' Philippines President Ferdinand Marcos Jr. said Friday that the country’s sixth typhoon, Man-yi, is expected to make landfall Saturday over eastern provinces, including the Manila region. He urged officials to make sure sufficient food and other supplies are available to deal with Man-yi's aftermath. 'We have to do a little extra here. We are already in bad shape because of the saturation, the damage done to infrastructure, homes and other infrastructure,' Marcos said at a briefing. 'Watch out for the storm surge and continue what you are doing on the relief goods.' Meanwhile, Mexico and Belize have issued warnings for Tropical Storm Sara, and Honduras has canceled its warning from the Nicaragua/Honduras border westward to Punta Patuca, according to the National Hurricane Center. However, the forecasters reported in their latest advisory that Sara is 'sluggishly meandering near the Honduras coast' with 'catastrophic flooding and mudslides ongoing for portions of Central America.' In Mexico, the NHC said, a warning is in effect from Puerto Costa Maya southward to Chetumal, while in Belize the warning is in effect from Belize City northward to Chetumal. NHC forecasters predict 'the center of Sara will continue to move near the northern coast of Honduras during the next day or so before approaching Belize, and then move onshore in Belize during the day on Sunday.' Despite the NHC cancellation of the warning for Honduras, its latest advisory reported that northern Honduras could expect 38 to 63 centimeters of rain, and isolated totals as high as 88 centimeters. NHC said that much rain could lead to 'widespread areas of life-threatening and potentially catastrophic flash flooding and mudslides, especially along and near the Sierra La Esperanza.' According to the NHC, Sara is set to drop 12 to 25 centimeters of rain and as much as 38 centimeters across the rest of Honduras, Belize, El Salvador, eastern Guatemala, western Nicaragua and the Mexican state of Quintana Roo through early next week. Some information for this report came from The Associated Press and Reuters.	https://www.voanews.com/a/philippines-deals-with-massive-flooding-after-5th-typhoon-hits-/7865804.html	2024-11-15T16:07:34-08:00	
Republican lawmakers optimistic Trump can end Russia-Ukraine war	Top Republican members of the House of Representatives say lawmakers have begun discussions about Russia’s war in Ukraine in an effort to carry out President-elect Donald Trump’s campaign pledge to quickly end the conflict there. Lawmakers told VOA’s Ukrainian Service that they are optimistic that Trump can achieve his goal. Republican Representative Mike Waltz, who was nominated by Trump this week to be his national security adviser, told VOA that 'the president has been clear in terms of getting both sides to the table and is focused on ending the war and not perpetuating it.' Waltz said that while Trump did not address Russia’s war in Ukraine when he gave a speech to lawmakers at their leadership meeting Wednesday, he said discussions about the war were happening 'off to the side.' He did not give further details. Republican Representative Mike Rogers, who serves as the chair of the House Armed Services Committee, was bullish about Trump’s ability to negotiate a cease-fire. 'I expect the president to negotiate an armistice before the end of the year,' he told VOA. When asked how the United States would pressure Russia to lay down its weapons, he said, 'I have an idea what it is but I’m not going to talk about it.' Trump spoke by phone with Russian President Vladimir Putin last week and urged him not to escalate the war, according to U.S. media outlets, first reported in The Washington Post. The Kremlin denies the call took place. Republican Representative Michael McCaul, chairman of the House Foreign Affairs Committee, who has been a strong supporter of U.S. military aid to Ukraine, told VOA that Trump wants to have a 'very strong military presence in Europe,' part of a 'path of deterrence that eventually will get us to a period of negotiation.' However, he cautioned that he does not believe that Ukraine has enough leverage right now for successful negotiations with Russia. Russia and Ukraine are engaged in fierce battles in eastern Ukraine, as uncertainty mounts over how a Trump presidency will affect the war and whether the two sides will be pushed into negotiations. Analysts say that both sides are looking to increase their territory before any negotiations take place. When asked about how the U.S. could pressure Russia to the negotiating table, Republican Representative Tom Cole, who serves as the chairman of the House Appropriations Committee, told VOA, 'I think you have to persuade them what is in their best interest.' Cole said he thinks the war has been a disaster for Russia, noting that the conflict pushed Sweden and Finland to join NATO, the Western military alliance formed in 1949 to provide collective security against the Soviet Union. He said talks in the House have not yet led to any definitive plan on the Russia-Ukraine war, but said, 'I think there is just hope that President Trump can bring this conflict in Europe — the worst conflict since 1945 — to a speedy end.' Trump has yet to detail how he will fulfill his campaign pledge to end the war quickly. During a meeting with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy in September, Trump said he 'can work out something that's good for both sides.' When asked at that time whether Ukraine should turn over some of its own land to Russia to end the war, Trump said, 'We'll see what happens.' Vice President Kamala Harris said on the campaign trail that suggestions by the Trump camp to create a demilitarized zone between Russia and Ukraine at the current battle lines 'are not proposals for peace.' 'Instead, they are proposals for surrender, which is dangerous and unacceptable,' she said. U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken assured Ukraine and its NATO allies Wednesday that Washington remains committed to putting Ukraine 'in the strongest possible position' in the final months of President Joe Biden’s administration. 'President Biden has committed to making sure that every dollar we have at our disposal will be pushed out the door between now and January 20th,' Blinken told reporters at NATO headquarters in Brussels on Wednesday. Trump told reporters in September that his plan to end the Russia-Ukraine war is 'not a surrender.' 'What my strategy is, is to save lives,' he said.

History is going on right now,' says Ukrainian journalist honored for her coverage	washington — Three investigative journalists are being recognized with international awards for their courage and reporting. Reporters John-Allan Namu from Kenya, Valeriya Yegoshyna from Ukraine and Rana Sabbagh from Jordan were in Washington this week for a ceremony highlighting their work. Namu and Yegoshyna were honored with the ICFJ Knight International Journalism Award by the global media network, the International Center for Journalists, or ICFJ. Sabbagh was awarded the ICFJ Knight Trailblazer award. 'From corruption to war crimes, the outstanding journalism they have done has led to greater accountability and change,' ICFJ President Sharon Moshavi said in a statement. For Sabbagh, the award is the most important one she’s received in her career. As a co-founder of the Arab Reporters for Investigative Journalism and senior editor for the MENA region within the Organized Crime and Corruption Reporting Project, Sabbagh has worked as a journalist for over 40 years in the Middle East. She is known for her commitment to free speech and for producing accountability journalism, including on human rights and gender equality. Sabbagh has faced numerous cyberattacks. In the past three years, her phone was infected six times by Pegasus, a surveillance software developed and marketed to governments by an Israeli company. The journalist’s career has also put her health and private life at risk. She said that she and other journalists in the region are often victims of a 'very rigid political system that is going to punish anybody.' But, she said, reporting is her mission in life. Her mother taught her to always protect those who are weak, and this value has guided her journalism career. 'I feel like I give a voice to the voiceless, and I talk about people that are totally ignored, and I expose corruption that is eating at the root of our societies in the Middle East,' Sabbagh told VOA. Sabbagh appreciates seeing the real-world effects of her reporting. Every time she publishes an investigation, she said, 'something happens for the better.' With the Arab Reporters for Investigative Journalism, she investigated neglect and abuse in privately run care homes for children with disabilities. After the piece was published, the Jordanian king visited the care homes and closed them, Sabbagh told VOA. 'It shows me that the 40 years of my life have not been in vain, that I was able to take big risks, sometimes at my own expense,' she said. 'But in the process, it allowed me such a great possibility to meet people that I would have never met.' Fellow awardee Namu also covers human rights abuses and corruption, including an investigation on bribery between city inspectors and criminal gangs in Kenya. For Namu —co-creator and editorial director of Africa Uncensored — the award is about the body of work he’s created over a 20-year career. Namu hopes his reporting can help dispel the notion that the 'Global South' is disconnected from the rest of the world, he told VOA. He said stories that begin in Africa can have worldwide implications. 'There’s no [Global] North or South,' he told VOA. 'People are just people, and the stories we tell should be interconnected and looked at in that way.' Namu has faced numerous lawsuits for his work with Africa Uncensored, but he believes it is easier to be a reporter in Kenya, where the democracy is relatively more stable, than in some other countries on the continent. One global trend he has seen, however, is how misinformation and disinformation in political conflicts creates a dangerous environment for reporters. 'Recently, there's been a lot of coordinated inauthentic messaging and disinformation around me and my organization,' he told VOA. False claims were circulated claiming Africa Uncensored received funding to cause social upheaval. That falsehood, he said, made the organization a target of the Kenyan public. The other awardee, Ukrainian reporter Yegoshyna, also knows what it is like to be targeted. A reporter for Schemes, an investigative project at VOA sister outlet RFE/RL, Yegoshyna was awarded for her 'powerful, enterprising, clever and innovative' reporting, ICFJ judge Simon Robinson said in a statement. 'I'm so glad about this award,' Yegoshyna told VOA. 'I'm also kind of proud because I'm the second Ukrainian who received this award.' Yegoshyna reports from 'de-occupied zones' — towns in Ukraine that border or are extremely close to Russian-controlled areas. There, she interviews attack survivors and digs through destroyed buildings. Yegoshyna joined the team at Schemes before Russia’s full-scale invasion and focused primarily on anti-corruption reporting. But now her coverage includes investigating war crimes. 'When the invasion started, we didn't know what to do, but we decided not to stop working for even a single day,' she told VOA. The team members’ investigative reporting skills help them uncover and publicize information about occupied areas. Sometimes that involves details from calls between Russian soldiers and their relatives. She and her team analyzed satellite images to uncover mass graves in the Ukrainian city of Mariupol. Russia's siege of the Ukrainian city left thousands dead and others displaced. The work can often be dangerous. According to the ICFJ, reporters at Schemes have experienced wiretapping and online harassment as a result of their investigations. But Yegoshyna said being an investigative journalist also allows her to show the world what is going on in Ukraine. 'It's important to report in a war zone area because we're fixing history, and we're giving the truth to people who are living in Ukraine and outside Ukraine,' she told VOA. 'History is going on right now.'	https://www.voanews.com/a/history-is-going-on-right-now-says-ukrainian-journalist-honored-for-her-coverage-/7865786.html	2024-11-15T15:51:20-08:00	
Trump to add North Dakota Governor Burgum as interior secretary	U.S. President-elect Donald Trump has selected North Dakota Governor Doug Burgum to run the Interior Department, as his new Cabinet continues to take shape. The transition team officially announced the pick Friday, though Trump first announced the selection late Thursday during a dinner at his Florida estate, Mar-a-Lago. Additionally, Trump announced Friday that Burgum also will lead a newly created National Energy Council that will be established to help the U.S. achieve 'energy dominance' around the globe. In this role, Burgum will direct a panel that crosses all executive branch agencies involved in energy permitting, production, generation, distribution, regulation and transportation, Trump said in a statement. As chairman of the National Energy Council, Burgum will have a seat on the National Security Council, the president-elect said. 'This Council will oversee the path to U.S. ENERGY DOMINANCE by cutting red tape, enhancing private sector investments across all sectors of the Economy, and by focusing on INNOVATION over longstanding, but totally unnecessary, regulation,'' Trump wrote. His new policies will help drive down inflation and win an 'arms race' with China over artificial intelligence, Trump said. Burgum, 68, is the two-term governor of North Dakota. A billionaire former software company executive, he was first elected to the governorship in 2016 and was easily reelected in 2020. Burgum briefly ran against Trump as a candidate for the Republican presidential nomination in 2023 before dropping out and enthusiastically throwing his support behind the eventual president-elect. A staunch conservative, Burgum, in his new position, is expected to be a strong ally of Trump’s efforts to open public lands for oil, gas and mineral exploration. Communications director The Trump-Vance transition team announced Steven Cheung will return to the Trump White House as communications director. He held the same position for the Trump-Vance 2024 presidential campaign and served in the White House during Trump’s first term as director of strategic response. Trump has swiftly named an array of political loyalists to key Cabinet positions. They remained vocal supporters during his four years out of office, and most of them are likely to win quick Senate approval after confirmation hearings. Having won majorities in both the U.S. House of Representatives and the U.S. Senate, Republicans are set to take full control of the U.S. government by the third week in January. 'Republicans in the House and Senate have a mandate,' newly reelected House Speaker Mike Johnson said earlier this week. 'The American people want us to implement and deliver that 'America First' agenda' espoused by Trump. Trump will be sworn in as the country's 47th president on January 20, two weeks after the new Congress has been seated. Trump, 78, campaigned on a sweeping agenda that Democrats will be largely powerless to stop unless joined by a handful of Republican defectors in Congress on any specific issue that would undercut the party's slim majorities in both chambers. Republicans will have a 53-47 edge in the Senate, and the tie-breaking vote of Vice President-elect JD Vance in the event of a 50-50 stalemate on any legislative proposal. Republicans have secured at least 218 seats in the 435-member House, pending the outcome of seven undecided elections for two-year terms. During his bid to win a second, nonconsecutive four-year term, Trump called for the massive deportation of millions of undocumented migrants living in the U.S. to their home countries; an extension and expansion of 2017 tax cuts that are set to expire at the end of 2025; further deregulation of businesses; a curb on climate controls; and prosecution of his political opponents, people he calls 'the enemy within.' Senator John Thune of South Dakota, newly elected by his fellow Republicans as the Senate majority leader, said, 'This Republican team is united. We are on one team. We are excited to reclaim the majority and to get to work with our colleagues in the House to enact President Trump's agenda.' Trump also has called on Senate Republican leaders to allow him to make 'recess appointments,' which could occur when the chamber is not in session and would erase the need for time-consuming and often contentious confirmation hearings. Controversial picks Despite the likelihood that most of his nominees will be approved, Trump this week named four who immediately drew disparaging assessments from several Democrats and some Republicans for their perceived lack of credentials. They are former Representative Matt Gaetz as attorney general; former Representative Tulsi Gabbard, a Democrat turned Republican, as director of national intelligence; former junior military officer and Fox News host Pete Hegseth as defense secretary; and former presidential candidate and anti-vaccine activist Robert F. Kennedy Jr. to lead the Department of Health and Human Services. The blowback presages tough confirmation fights for the four in the Senate, which reviews the appointments of top-level officials and then votes to confirm them or, on occasion, reject them, forcing the White House to make another choice. The appointment of Gaetz, 42, could prove particularly problematic, with some senators openly questioning whether he can win a 51-vote majority to assume the government's top law enforcement position. Gaetz announced his resignation from the House late Wednesday, when a House ethics committee probe was in the final stages of investigating whether he'd engaged in sexual misconduct and illicit drug use. His resignation ended the probe. The Justice Department Gaetz hopes to lead already had decided not to pursue criminal charges. Gaetz has denied all wrongdoing. Gabbard, 43, has been attacked for her lack of direct experience in intelligence and accused of disseminating pro-Russian disinformation. If confirmed, she would be tasked with overseeing 18 U.S. intelligence agencies. She won over Trump with her switch from being a Democratic House member from Hawaii to changing parties and staunchly advocating for his election. Critics have assailed Hegseth, 44, a decorated former military officer, as someone who lacks managerial experience in the military or business world. A weekend anchor on Fox News, he has voiced his opinions on military operations, including his opposition to women serving in combat roles. He has lobbied Trump to pardon military service members accused of war crimes. A descendant of the Kennedy family political dynasty, Kennedy, 70, for years has been one of the country's most prominent proponents of anti-vaccine views. He has also opposed water fluoridation and suggested the coronavirus could have been deliberately designed to affect some ethnic groups more than others. On Thursday, Trump also selected former Securities and Exchange Commission Chairman Jay Clayton to be Manhattan's top federal prosecutor; and former Representative Doug Collins to be secretary of the Department of Veterans Affairs. He named one of his personal criminal defense attorneys, Todd Blanche, to be deputy attorney general, and another of his attorneys, D. John Sauer, to be solicitor general.

Families of North Korean soldiers in Russia face fear, anxiety	washington — North Korean defectors say Pyongyang has likely kept the deployment of that nation’s soldiers to fight in Russia’s war against Ukraine as a secret from its own people, including the soldiers’ own families, but the news will undoubtedly leak out, causing anxiety and pain. Western intelligence officials estimate that as many as 10,000 North Korean soldiers are now in place, mainly in locations around Russia’s Kursk region where Ukrainian forces have captured some Russian territory, and that the troops have already suffered combat casualties. 'North Korean mothers who sent their children to Russia must feel unimaginable pain,' said Kim Jeong-ah, a North Korean defector and former first lieutenant in the North Korean People's Army who spoke to VOA Korean by phone Wednesday. 'It drives you crazy; how else can you express that feeling?' said Kim, herself a mother who now runs a nonprofit in Seoul that promotes women’s rights in North Korea. 'They cannot even cry as hard as you want at home, because there’s no soundproof walls between houses.' Kim, who escaped North Korea in 2009, said, 'The families of those North Korean soldiers in Russia must be suffering without being able to express their grievances due to pressure from the North Korean regime.' Rising human rights concerns It is widely believed that the Kim Jong Un regime mobilized its elite 'Storm Corps' special forces to support Russia. Lee Hyun Seung, a former soldier in the Storm Corps unit and an escapee who now lives in the U.S., told VOA Korean in a phone call Wednesday that 'the North Korean regime does not inform families of overseas deployments, unit locations or personal safety issues,' for fear of leaking military secrets. Lee suggested that news of the deployment is likely already spreading by word of mouth among residents, and that 'there will certainly be internal opposition among residents to this clear violation of human rights — deploying the troops without notice to the families.' 'Rumors will spread quickly, and if the families who were not aware of the deployment find out their sons were sacrificed, this will be a huge blow to the regime.' In a recent talk hosted by the Center for Strategic and International Studies in Washington, Tae Young-ho, former North Korean diplomat who served in South Korea’s National Assembly after his defection, said although Pyongyang is keeping the deployment secret, North Korean troop fatalities will be hard to keep from public view. Tae also said that North Korea has a very low birth rate, with families having only one or two children, so parents will not be able to accept the fact that their children died defending Russia, not their own country. Lack of training, resources Lee Woong-gil, who defected from North Korea after 13 years of service with the Storm Corps, told VOA Korean by phone that he had heard that the training conditions and capabilities of North Korean special forces have deteriorated, compared with when he served. 'If you look at the photos and videos [of North Korean soldiers in Russia], they don't look like the best-trained special forces soldiers, they just look like soldiers who came out during training,' Lee said. 'They didn’t look very fit, and they looked like run-of-the-mill soldiers who were just drafted during training.' North Korea is one of the most militarized countries in the world. All men between the ages of 17 and 30 must enlist for military service for a period of five to 13 years. Lee also said it is very difficult for the North Korean regime to provide proper economic compensation to deployed troops and their families, adding 'the only thing North Korean soldiers can hope for is the safety of themselves and their families.' Lee predicted that when faced with extreme pain and fear of death, North Korean soldiers in Russia would feel agitated and would highly likely surrender during combat or attempt to escape and even seek asylum. Risk of severe trauma Oh Eun-kyung, a counselor at the Korean Counseling Psychological Association in Seoul, who counsels North Korean defectors, said in a phone call with VOA Korean on Monday that North Korean soldiers deployed in Russia are highly likely to suffer from severe trauma due to mental stress. 'The psychological isolation and helplessness of not being able to do anything will increase among the families left behind in North Korea,' said Oh. 'The families' anger at the regime's anti-human rights measures could serve as a trigger for major social unrest within North Korea.' David Maxwell, a former U.S. Special Forces colonel who served on the U.N.’s Combined Forces Command in South Korea, told VOA Korean by phone that North Korean soldiers who have never participated in actual battles are being sent to the front line, risking exposure to even more serious trauma. 'They will suffer from post-traumatic stress disorder. They will suffer from traumatic experience, but they have been so thoroughly indoctrinated ... that I don't think you will see it manifest in ways that it does in the rest of the world,' said Maxwell, who now is vice president of the Center for Asia Pacific Strategy. 'They certainly will not be properly cared for [to deal with] the experience.' War without just cause Ri Jong Ho, a North Korean defector now in the U.S. and a former high-ranking economic official for the Kim regime, said Pyongyang will not publicly acknowledge the Russia deployment, given its weak justification. 'When North Korea sent troops to Vietnam, our goal was to protect the socialist front; it was the Cold War back then,' Ri told VOA Korean by phone Wednesday. North Korea has long denied that it sent members of its air force into the Vietnam War, although it was belatedly confirmed in 2002 when North Korean state media reported that a delegation had retrieved remains of North Korean airmen from Vietnamese soil. 'They don't have any justification this time,' Ri said. 'They participated in the war of aggression. The North Korean soldiers are just there as cannon fodder.'

Documentary captures surveillance, harassment of Cuban journalist	The personal and painful reality of life under surveillance is documented in an intimate new film that follows an independent Cuban journalist's flight into exile. After tough questioning by Cuban police, Abraham Jimenez Enoa relates his ordeal on camera. He recalls being forced to strip and being handcuffed in a room by five men, and the nausea after being forced into a car and driven around. Enoa, who was writing columns for The Washington Post from Cuba, said agents accused him of being a CIA agent. 'They said if I published another article in The Washington Post they were going to destroy my family,' he said. The interview is just one of several harrowing accounts in a hard-hitting documentary filmed secretly by Enoa and his wife Claudia Calvino as they struggled to cope with police surveillance and becoming parents for the first time. The young family went into exile in Spain in 2022 after Enoa said authorities gave him an ultimatum: leave or he would be jailed. 'Isla Familia,' which will be shown at the Doc New York City film festival between November and December, lifts the lid on the daily pressures faced by independent journalists under the Cuban communist government. 'We just wanted to relate our story. I had no pretensions to make a documentary about life as an independent journalist,' Enoa told VOA. 'But often the story of opposition activists or journalists is not told this way.' Calvino, a film producer, said the documentary was a way for the couple to channel their feelings while under surveillance. 'There was a necessity to channel our emotions more than to give a message. We were just a family living in a house at the time,' she told VOA. Filmed mostly in Cuba before Enoa was forced into exile, the documentary provides an intimate portrait of the restricted life he led with his wife and their young son, who is now 4, in a cramped flat in Havana. Harassment in Havana When Enoa was a child, Cuba's revolutionary leaders loomed large in his life. His grandfather was a bodyguard to Fidel Castro and Che Guevara. In the documentary, he shows the viewer around his grandparents' home, which is filled with photographs of Castro and Guevara. But a career in journalism forced Enoa to leave behind his revolutionary family — and roots. In 2016, Enoa founded an independent magazine, El Estornudo (The Sneeze). The harassment Enoa faced in Havana grew when Enoa took a new role as a columnist for The Washington Post. In the documentary, Enoa points out the secret police outside his flat who watch his family daily. He records when huge protests start in 2021 against food and medicine shortages, reporting firsthand on the demonstrators. He swaps nervous messages with his wife, who worries in case he is arrested. Initially he is denied a passport, as he is on a list of people under surveillance by the Cuban authorities. It proves to be a pivotal moment. 'I knew this was going to happen, but why does this get to me so much? I don't want to be in this country anymore,' Enoa says on camera in the documentary. In response to those protests, Cuba passed a social communication law. It is the first law to target online media, and it gives the government the power to restrict content that is used to 'propagandize in favor of the war of a foreign state hostile to the interests of the nation.' The Cuban Institute for the Freedom of Expression and Press (ICLEP) says the new media law is another tool for the government to suppress the freedom of the media. 'This is another law of censorship which defends the interest of the Cuban dictatorship,' Normando Hernandez, ICLEP general director, told VOA. 'It is a law which maintains the illegality of the independent media and criminalizes the freedom of the press which is not under government control.' VOA contacted the Cuban Embassy in Madrid and the government's International Press Center in Havana for a response about the findings by ICLEP. No one responded to either request for comment. The price of exile Legal threats and surveillance drive many Cubans into exile. But as the film 'Isla Familia' shows, transitioning to live in a free country with a young family can be a cultural shock. Negotiating the Barcelona metro appears scary. 'How deep is it?' asks Enoa. Exile carries a cost as he tries to speak to relatives back home on faltering telephone lines and cannot send condolences when his grandmother dies. His wife can return to Cuba with their son, but Enoa is, in effect, barred. When Calvino does arrive in Cuba to see family during a temporary visit, she sees her husband's face on television, where he is once again accused of working for the United States. Left back in Spain, it is hard for Enoa being away from his family. 'That was the most difficult moment of my life — when I realized the importance of family, and without my wife and my son, I was all on my own,' Enoa told VOA. Enoa and Calvino have been granted Spanish citizenship and are building a life in Spain. But the journalist knows he cannot return home because of the risk of arrest. 'Of course I miss it terribly,' he said.	https://www.voanews.com/a/documentary-captures-surveillance-harassment-of-cuban-journalist/7865647.html	2024-11-15T14:06:22-08:00

Muslims welcome Supreme Court's crackdown on India's 'bulldozer justice'	Muslims in India are largely welcoming a ruling this week from the country's Supreme Court declaring authorities must not demolish any property simply because its owner has been accused of a crime. Such demolitions — decried as 'bulldozer justice' by critics — have targeted mostly Muslim-owned properties in states ruled by Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s Bharatiya Janata Party over the past few years. On Wednesday, while issuing the verdict, India’s highest court called bulldozer justice 'totally unconstitutional' and laid down strict guidelines concerning such demolitions. 'The chilling sight of a bulldozer demolishing a building, when authorities have failed to follow the basic principles of natural justice and have acted without adhering to the principle of due process, reminds one of a lawless state of affairs,' the court said. Such 'high-handed and arbitrary actions' have no place in a constitutional democracy and would be dealt with through the 'heavy hand of the law,' the court added. Jamiat Ulama-e-Hind, a leading organization of Islamic scholars in India, said it welcomes the Supreme Court verdict. 'The court has declared demolishing someone’s house as a crime, and an unacceptable form of punishment. It has also emphasized that the government may not play judge, and only the judiciary has the authority to determine what is legal or illegal,' JUH President Maulana Syed Arshad Madani told VOA. 'This ruling is a victory for justice, and we hope it will serve as a lesson to all authorities,' he said. After firebrand monk and Hindu nationalist BJP leader Yogi Adityanath became chief minister of the northern state of Uttar Pradesh in 2017, he ordered his officials to take the strictest possible actions against all criminals. Soon, the police and other civic officials in Uttar Pradesh started taking strict action against those accused of crimes, including demolishing their properties deemed illegal. Properties of hard-core criminals were targeted initially. But it was not long until others began losing their properties to demolition for allegedly partaking in protest rallies, pelting stones at others during communal disturbances, slaughtering cows and other offenses. Over the past few years, houses, shops and other 'illegal' structures owned by accused criminals, communal violence rioters and others have been demolished in states including Uttar Pradesh, Madhya Pradesh, Haryana, Assam and Maharashtra — where the BJP was in power. In most cases, the victims belonged to the minority Muslim community. According to the Housing and Land Rights Network, a housing rights group, more than 153,000 homes were demolished by various state governments in India, displacing about 738,000 people in the last few years. Since 2022, JUH filed multiple petitions to the Supreme Court seeking orders to prevent the governments from demolishing properties as a form of extrajudicial punishment. On September 13, while hearing another petition, the court observed that running a bulldozer on the property of an accused is 'akin to bulldozing the law of the land.' In its verdict on Wednesday, the Supreme Court firmly stated that the executive must not overstep its bounds by acting as a judge and executing punitive measures such as demolitions. 'The executive cannot pronounce a person guilty. Only on the basis of accusation, if the executive demolishes the property of the person, it will strike at the rule of law. The executive cannot become a judge and demolish the properties of the persons accused,' the verdict said. 'No demolition can be carried out without prior show-cause notice and within 15 days from the date of the notice being served,' it said. New Delhi-based lawyer Mohammad Huzaifa said that this week’s verdict marked a 'historic stand against ‘bulldozer justice,’ affirming that punitive demolitions have no place in our democratic framework.' 'While justice may have come too late for many, this ruling offers renewed faith in our judiciary and stands as a beacon of hope for those wronged by arbitrary demolitions impacting scores of people living under the fear of bulldozer state terror,' Huzaifa, a member of the legal team of civil rights group Association for Protection of Civil Rights, told the VOA. 'The challenge now lies in vigilant implementation — true justice will be measured by how effectively these guidelines are enforced on the ground,' he said. Muslim community leader Zafarul-Islam Khan said he welcomed the verdict although it has come too late. 'Demolition of people’s homes was a huge issue of human rights violation. Courts should have taken suo motu notice of the cases as soon as those demolitions began some years ago,' Khan, former chairman of the Delhi Minorities Commission, told VOA. 'No doubt, the authorities will not feel so free as before in demolishing homes in the future, but they may still look for their devious ways to do so,' he said. The verdict, in some ways still sounds not complete, Khan added. 'This welcome verdict will remain incomplete unless and until tens of thousands of the previous victims are also compensated and the powerful people who violated the law at will are punished,' he said. Human rights activist Harsh Mander said that he was relieved that the Supreme Court had spoken out against a process that was 'entirely unlawful and unconstitutional.' 'State injustice bulldozing the homes and shops of the working poor has continued for decades, and periodic orders to follow the compassionate due process from the Supreme Court similar to the recent order have not restrained the executive,' Mander told VOA. 'But my problem with the ruling is that it doesn’t act effectively to deter the current form of demolition, which is essentially targeting a particular community, Indian Muslims. I would have wanted the court to both reprimand and punish political leaders who order and justify such unlawful retributive targeting, and officers who implemented these acts.'	https://www.voanews.com/a/muslims-welcome-supreme-court-s-crackdown-on-india-s-bulldozer-justice-/7865676.html	2024-11-15T13:45:59-08:00	
Guatemala appeals court verdict could see publisher returned to prison	WASHINGTON — The Guatemalan journalist Jose Ruben Zamora could be returned to prison after an appeals court Friday overturned an order that had moved him into house arrest. Zamora, who is the founder of the newspaper El Periodico, had been detained on questionable grounds for two years before being granted house arrest in October. But prosecutors appealed the order, and Friday the appeals court ruled that Zamora, who is 68, should return to prison. The journalist’s son confirmed the appeals court decision and said his father’s lawyers had been notified, according to The Associated Press. Zamora was arrested in July 2022 after publishing an editorial in his former media outlet El Periodico. He was convicted of money laundering. But last month an appeals court overturned the conviction and ordered a new trial for 2025. International groups at the time said the accusation of money laundering and other charges leveled at him were in response to his media coverage and reporting on corruption in the government of former President Alejandro Giammattei. The United Nations Working Group on Arbitrary Detention had in July said that the imprisonment of the publisher was a violation of international law. Media watchdogs expressed alarm Friday at the appeals court decision. 'The need for [Zamora’s] full and unconditional release has never been more urgent,' said Reporters Without Borders. The Committee to Protect Journalists described the decision as concerning on social media, and said, 'We reiterate that judicial processes must guarantee fair and impartial treatment, without becoming tools to silence critical journalism.' After his release, Zamora had told the AP he believed his paper’s investigative work led him to be targeted. He said that the justice system remained co-opted and that he was sure they would try to find a way to return him to jail. The Guatemala Embassy in Washington did not immediately respond to VOA’s request for comment.

Germany's Scholz speaks with Putin, demands Russia withdraw from Ukraine	A German government spokesperson said that Chancellor Olaf Scholz held direct talks via telephone Friday with Russian President Vladimir Putin during which he demanded the withdrawal of Russian troops from Ukraine and that Russia show a willingness to negotiate a just and lasting peace. A statement from German government spokesperson Steffen Hebestreit said Scholz condemned Russia's war of aggression against Ukraine and called on Putin to end it and withdraw troops. The statement said the chancellor reaffirmed Germany's unwavering determination to support Ukraine in its fight against Russian aggression for as long as necessary. The brief statement did not include a response from Putin. The spokesperson said Scholz spoke with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy before his call with the Russian leader and intended to call him again afterwards. Media reports say that call lasted about an hour. Reuters news agency reported the Kremlin confirmed the call, which it said had come at Berlin's request. The news agency reported the Kremlin said Putin told Scholz any agreement to end the war in Ukraine must take Russian security interests into account and reflect 'new territorial realities.' Kremlin spokesperson Dmitry Peskov said despite deep disagreements, the fact the two leaders had the call at all was 'very positive.' Zelenskyy, however, was not as pleased by the call. In a video address posted to his website Friday, Zelenskyy said that in his opinion, the call is a 'Pandora's box.' 'This is exactly what Putin has wanted for a long time: It is crucial for him to weaken his isolation. Russia's isolation,' Zelenskyy said. 'And to engage in negotiations, ordinary negotiations, that will lead to nothing.' He said it is what Putin has done for decades. 'This allowed Russia to change nothing in its policy, to do nothing substantial, and ultimately it led to this war.' Zelenskyy said Ukraine understands how to act regarding Putin and handle negotiations accordingly. 'And we want to warn everyone: There will be no Minsk-3,' he said, referencing the Minsk agreements, two failed cease-fire deals between Kyiv and Moscow over the status of the eastern Donbas region. 'What we need is real peace.' The call came roughly one week after Scholz's coalition government fell apart, and he is facing new elections early next year. Also on Friday, Hungarian Prime Minister Viktor Orban said in a state radio interview the European Union must abandon its sanctions against Russia or face economic collapse. The EU and its western partners have imposed numerous sanctions against Russia and Putin since Russia's full-scale invasion of Ukraine in 2022, many of which target Russia's energy sector. Orban, a staunch ally of Putin's, said in the interview the sanctions on Russia have driven up energy prices and must be reviewed by EU leaders in Brussels. He said the sanctions have failed and as long as they are in place, energy prices will not come down and it will destroy the European economy. Orban also referenced U.S. President-elect Donald Trump's victory last week. Referring to Trump as 'our comrade in arms,' and 'our fellow peace fighter,' he said his victory means minds have to be changed in Brussels — site of EU headquarters. Orban said they must urge 'a pro-peace' turn in the EU, referring to their support for Ukraine. Some information for this report was provided by The Associated Press, Reuters and Agence France-Presse.	https://www.voanews.com/a/germany-s-scholz-speaks-with-putin-demands-russia-withdraw-from-ukraine/7865605.html	2024-11-15T13:00:42-08:00	
Ukrainians face harsh winter as Russian attacks destroy energy infrastructure	GENEVA — Ukraine is heading into its third, most challenging winter since the war started nearly 1,000 days ago because 'systematic attacks' by Russia have damaged and destroyed most of the country’s energy infrastructure, a senior U.N. official warned. 'I am told that by now, 65% of Ukraine’s own energy production capacities has been destroyed,' Matthias Schmale, resident and humanitarian coordinator in Ukraine, told journalists Friday in Geneva. 'There are a lot of worries that the Russian Federation’s military forces might strike the energy sector again,' he said. 'And the real concern is, if they were to target the energy sector again, this could be a tipping point, also a tipping point for further mass movements, both inside the country and outside the country. 'The systematic attacks on energy infrastructure may pose an additional risk in winter, especially for already vulnerable people, as power cuts extend more than a few days in subzero temperatures,' he said. 'Deliberately attacking and destroying energy infrastructure that the civilian population depended on is a violation of international humanitarian law and has to stop.' The U.N. Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs, OCHA, said more than 12,000 people have been killed since Russia launched its full-scale invasion against Ukraine on Feb. 24, 2022. It said civilian infrastructure has been decimated, with more than 2,000 attacks on health care facilities and 2 million damaged homes. It said almost 40% of the population in Ukraine needs humanitarian assistance. 'There is also a sort of hidden crisis,' Schmale noted. 'I think this prolonged war, almost three years in February, has led to widespread trauma and psychological distress, and I think the need for mental health support is very evident. It will take years to help people deal with their traumas.' The World Health Organization has verified 2,134 attacks on health care targets in Ukraine, killing at least 197 health workers and patients. The agency said attacks on health facilities have 'intensified significantly' since December 2023, 'occurring on a near-daily basis.' 'The marked increase in attacks on Ukraine’s energy and health infrastructure has led to widespread disruptions to power and water,' said Dr. Margaret Harris, a WHO spokesperson. 'The high cost of medicines, treatment and insufficient number of health care workers have emerged as major concerns, including near the front lines. 'In the coming months we anticipate civilians who live near the front lines may experience coronary vascular diseases, mental health issues and dental problems,' she said, noting that the WHO continues to call for humanitarian access to all parts of Ukraine, including Russian-controlled areas. Resident coordinator Schmale expressed grave concern about the escalating use of drones against the civilian population, many supplied to Russia by North Korea. 'During my many visits to the front lines, civilians have increasingly described to me being targeted,' he said, underscoring that the drones not only cause physical damage but also are being used as a form of 'psychological terror.' 'I am very worried, along with many others, that increased use of drones by the armed forces of the Russian Federation will have an increasingly damaging impact on the civilian population,' he said. 'The fear of a nuclear fallout because of either a deliberate or accidental hit on a nuclear power plant, such as the one in Zaporizhzhia … would be extremely devastating, and the worst-case scenario.' OCHA said that U.N. agencies are prioritizing support to people close to the front line, as well as to the thousands who have evacuated in recent weeks and months to help them survive the freezing temperatures that are coming. It said U.N., international and volunteer organizations have been able to assist 7.2 million people thanks to $1.8 billion received for the humanitarian response in Ukraine. However, another $500 million will be needed to address the emergency needs of 1.8 million people by March. Schmale underscored the appeal by emphasizing that vulnerable people in high-rise residential buildings in urban areas, the disabled, the elderly and the 3.6 million internally displaced people inside the country are most at risk and in need of help. He said that helping people to get through this winter 'is a race against time,' made more difficult because of waning support from the donor community. While the trend was downward, he expressed hope the international community and humanitarian support from the U.S. would continue under the new leadership. 'They have been by far our biggest individual country supporter at country level,' he said. 'The hope is that they understand like the present administration that there are huge humanitarian needs that need to continue to be addressed. 'We must not normalize the war in Ukraine,' he said. 'We must continue to support this country to the best of our abilities.'	https://www.voanews.com/a/ukrainians-face-harsh-winter-as-russian-attacks-destroy-energy-infrastructure-/7865623.html	2024-11-15T12:54:26-08:00	
Italy’s president urges Elon Musk to ‘respect sovereignty’ after court blocks Albania migrant deal	LONDON — Italy’s controversial policy of holding migrants in detention centers in Albania for processing has hit a legal roadblock as judges in Rome this week asked the European Union’s Court of Justice for clarification on its legality. The EU judges could take months or years to make a ruling. The judges at a special immigration court in Rome referred the matter to the EU court in Luxembourg after refusing to rule on a government request to detain several migrants at the processing centers in Albania. The court decision triggered an online spat between Italy’s president and U.S. billionaire Elon Musk, who criticized the Italian judges’ decision. Italian Prime Minister Giorgia Meloni struck a deal with Albania in February for migrants to be processed in the Balkan country. Several European countries have been closely watching the plan amid speculation that many want to also process migrants in third countries. Italy has built two migrant detention centers in Albania, projected to cost upwards of $650 million to run over the next five years. The centers are designated as Italian border zones and are run by Italian officials. Rome’s plan is to transport migrants rescued in international waters directly to the detention centers in Albania, to fast-track their asylum applications, and quickly return those who fail to their countries of origin. Italy hoped to process 3,000 migrants a month at the centers, acting as a major deterrent for irregular migration. So far, though, just 24 migrants from Egypt and Bangladesh have been sent to Albania, all of whom have since been sent back to Italy on the orders of a special immigration court in Rome. The judges cited a recent European Union Court of Justice ruling that no country of origin could be deemed safe if parts of it are dangerous. The Italian judges are now seeking further clarification of what constitutes a safe country of origin, according to Andreina De Leo, an expert on EU migration law at Maastricht University in the Netherlands. 'The border procedure in Italy is applied on the basis of this concept of ‘safe country of origin.’ [EU] member states can designate third countries as safe country of origin only if these countries are safe in their entirety,' De Leo told VOA. 'What the Italian judge said is that, OK, the Court of Justice said that the countries have to be safe in their entirety. But the reasoning leading to this decision can also be applied to exceptions that are not only based on territorial exception, but [also] groups. 'So, for instance, Bangladesh and Egypt, also Tunisia, are generally safe — but they are not safe for homosexuals, for human rights defenders and other categories,' she added. De Leo suggested no decision could be expected from the court for at least a year, 'So, it means that this [policy] is blocked,' De Leo said. The EU court decision would take precedent over Italian legislation. Backlash Italian Prime Minister Meloni has disputed the Italian judges’ interpretation of the EU directives, which represents a major setback for her flagship policy aiming at slashing irregular migration. Speaking last month in the Italian Senate, she called the Albania agreement 'a new, courageous, unprecedented path, but one that perfectly reflects the European spirit.' Deputy Prime Minister Matteo Salvini, currently on trial for allegedly preventing a migrant rescue boat from docking when he was interior minister in 2019, said the Italian judges had made 'a choice that endangers the safety and wallets of Italians.' Meloni also received backing from Musk, the American billionaire and ally of U.S. President-elect Donald Trump. Responding to the Italian court decision, Musk wrote on his social media platform X, 'These judges need to go,' later describing them as an 'unelected autocracy.' Italian President Sergio Mattarella rebuked Musk’s intervention Thursday, saying he 'must respect Italy’s sovereignty.' Italy has long been on the front line of Europe’s migration crisis. More than 58,000 migrants have arrived by sea illegally so far this year, although that is 60% less than in the same period last year. Across the EU, governments are under pressure to cut immigration, with several eyeing deals like that between Italy and Albania to process migrants in third countries. The bloc’s new Pact on Migration and Asylum — approved by member states in April — is due to come into force in 2026 and will make it easier for member states to detain migrants at the border, De Leo said. 'This means that from 2026 onwards, they will have a new ground to put people in the [accelerated] border procedures. What I think is that by the time the EU Court of Justice makes a decision, it will probably be time to start applying in the new law, so it will not matter,' De Leo told VOA.	https://www.voanews.com/a/italy-s-president-urges-elon-musk-to-respect-sovereignty-after-court-blocks-albania-migrant-deal-/7865320.html	2024-11-15T09:08:40-08:00	
Blinken discusses economic cooperation with Taiwan's APEC envoy	STATE DEPARTMENT — U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken met with Taiwan’s envoy to the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation (APEC) summit, Lin Hsin-I, on Thursday ahead of the bloc's Economic Leaders’ Meeting in Lima, Peru. The discussion centered on economic cooperation, as Blinken highlighted in a social media post. 'Met with Lin Hsin-i in Lima. We spoke about our growing economic relationship and our enduring shared commitment to foster an open, dynamic, and peaceful Indo-Pacific,' Blinken wrote on X. The pull-aside meeting, which lasted about 20 minutes, was not previously announced in Blinken’s official schedule. 'We discussed our important economic cooperation,' Assistant Secretary of State for East Asian and Pacific Affairs Daniel Kritenbrink, who also participated in the meeting, told reporters during a phone briefing late Thursday. In a readout, Taiwan said that Blinken and Lin exchanged views on strengthening the U.S.-Taiwan partnership and discussed strategies for ensuring regional peace and stability. Lin, a former vice premier of Taiwan and a senior presidential adviser to President Lai Ching-te, was chosen to represent Taiwan at this year’s APEC leaders meetings in Peru. On Friday, the White House announced that the Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company, the world’s leading advanced semiconductor producer, will receive up to $6.6 billion in CHIPS & Science Act funding. That supports TSMC’s $65 billion investment to build three facilities in Arizona, creating tens of thousands of jobs by the decade’s end. The White House called it the largest foreign direct investment in a completely new project in U.S. history. Taiwan’s role in APEC APEC, an international forum comprising 21 member economies from the Pacific Rim, promotes free trade and economic cooperation across the Asia-Pacific region. Although Taiwan holds full membership in APEC, it faces restrictions due to pressure from China and has to send special envoys instead of its presidents to the annual leaders meetings. Since the establishment of the People’s Republic of China in 1949, it has never governed Taiwan but continues to view the self-ruled democracy as part of its territory. Upcoming Biden-Xi talks Blinken will accompany U.S. President Joe Biden at Saturday’s meeting with Chinese President Xi Jinping, marking the third in-person talks between the two leaders. Biden is expected to 'underscore the importance of maintaining peace and stability across the Taiwan Strait and express his concerns that the PRC’s increased military activities around Taiwan are destabilizing and eroding the status quo,' according to U.S. officials. On Friday, China’s Ministry of Foreign Affairs spokesperson Lin Jian urged Washington to abide by the 'one-China principle' and not allow Taiwan President Lai to transit through the United States, urging Washington to take 'concrete actions to uphold China-U.S. relations.' Lin was asked to comment on a Reuters report that Lai plans to stop in Hawaii and maybe Guam on a visit to Taiwan’s diplomatic allies in the Pacific in coming weeks. The U.S. one-China policy differs from the PRC's one-China principle, which Washington has said it does not subscribe to. The U.S. says it remains committed to its long-standing, bipartisan 0ne-China policy, guided by the Taiwan Relations Act, the Three Joint Communiques and the Six Assurances. Chinese officials have rejected the Taiwan Relations Act, calling the U.S. law governing its relations with Taiwan 'illegal and invalid.'	https://www.voanews.com/a/blinken-discusses-economic-cooperation-with-taiwan-s-apec-envoy-/7865296.html	2024-11-15T08:45:10-08:00	
Regional bloc urged to deal with Mozambique’s post-election violence	HARARE, ZIMBABWE — Heads of state of the Southern African Development Community regional bloc are due to meet next week in Zimbabwe on post-election violence in neighboring Mozambique, where the political opposition is disputing poll results. Mozambique has been rocked by violence following its October 9 elections, with police accused of killing some 30 protesters, according to civil society organizations there. Amnesty International says the crackdown on human rights by the government led by the winning Frelimo party continues. Venancio Mondlane, leader of Mozambique’s opposition PODEMOS party, is disputing that Frelimo’s Daniel Chapo won the presidential election. Speaking to VOA Friday from her base in Johannesburg, Amnesty International’s deputy regional director for East and Southern Africa, Khanyo Farise, urged Southern African Development Community leaders to advocate for an end to the violence when they meet in Harare. 'The situation in Mozambique gets worse every day as the death toll spirals, yet the SADC remains shockingly silent,' Farise said. 'Regardless of the outcome of the elections, SADC must take a strong stand against the assault on the right to protest and the killing of protesters. 'SADC has been painfully slow to respond to Mozambique’s crisis,' she said. 'The bloc must forcefully speak out now against the ongoing violations of human rights by Mozambican security forces and put human rights and accountability at the center of its upcoming summit in Harare.' Adriano Nuvunga, director of the Center for Democracy and Human Rights in Mozambique, said that his country has experienced post-election violence before but that this year, 'the magnitude and the duration of incidences is unprecedented.' 'It is nationwide violence led by the young people,' Nuvunga said, who 'feel that the results announced favoring Frelimo did not reflect the will of the people expressed at the polls.' 'In the past three days everything is paralyzed,' he said. 'The ports are paralyzed, corridors, borders are paralyzed, which is affecting not only Mozambique but neighboring countries that depend on Mozambique to access to sea and ports. So, this makes it a regional crisis not only a domestic crisis.' But, Nuvunga said, the leaders of Tanzania, Zimbabwe and South Africa have 'taken sides [a] long time ago' because they acknowledged Frelimo and Chapo as the winners of the election even before results were announced by the Constitutional Council. 'So, SADC will meet. SADC will discuss. But the trust in SADC is not that big,' he said.	https://www.voanews.com/a/regional-bloc-urged-to-deal-with-mozambique-s-post-election-violence/7865226.html	2024-11-15T08:05:44-08:00	
Hundreds of South African miners, police continue standoff	JOHANNESBURG — Hundreds of illegal gold miners remained stuck underground Friday at an unused mine in South Africa that police have surrounded. South African authorities are refusing to allow supplies down to the miners, who they say are criminals. Police initially thought some 4,000 illegal miners were underground at the closed Stilfontein mine, about 150 kilometers from Johannesburg. They’ve revised the figure to several hundred but are still denying them food and water as part of 'Operation Vala Umgodi' or 'close the hole.' Police say they are trying to force the miners — believed to have been underground for several weeks — to resurface. They say the miners are refusing to come up, fearing arrest, or in the case of undocumented migrants, deportation. The government loses millions of dollars each year to illegal mining, according to the Minerals Council of South Africa. 'We are not sending help to criminals. We are going to smoke them out,' said Cabinet Minister Khumbudzo Ntshavheni earlier this week. 'They will come out.' Anxious relatives have gathered at the mine, hoping to send supplies down to loved ones. On Thursday, a decomposing body was recovered from the shaft. Some have accused the government of taking an inhumane position. David van Wyk, a researcher at the Bench Marks Foundation, a nonprofit that works on issues surrounding illegal miners, said what is happening at Stilfontein is a 'problematic' humanitarian situation. 'The workers got to be there because South Africa is in a transition,' he said. 'Large-scale industrial gold mining is no longer profitable, and many mines are shutting down and tens of thousands of workers are losing their jobs.' There’s a term in South Africa for the men who risk their lives searching for gold deep underground: 'zama zamas,' which means 'take a chance' in the Zulu language. Johannesburg, dubbed 'egoli' or 'city of gold' for the riches that lie beneath, was once a major gold mining hub. Many of the mines have closed, however, and the illegal artisanal miners have gone underground hoping to get what’s left. Most are desperately poor, many from neighboring countries such as Lesotho and Mozambique, and stay underground for weeks or even months at a time with no protective equipment in the huge maze of tunnels under the city. Subterranean networks and an underground economy have developed, where food and cigarettes, and sometimes prostitutes, are brought down to the men, experts say. Drug use is rife, and turf wars between rival groups armed with AK-47s and other weapons often break out. While they eke out a meager living, zama zamas have become associated with violent gangs and criminal syndicates that run things and are getting rich from the illicit industry. The Bench Marks Foundation’s Van Wyk said his organization has recommended government regulate and legalize small-scale mining. He says there are some 6,000 abandoned mines in South Africa. 'It’s basically a free for all that has evolved and that has resulted in mine workers becoming super exploited,' Van Wyk said. 'The police never arrest the mining syndicates that control them. Everyone is profiting from it except the poor guys who find themselves starved underground.' Police say more than 1,000 zama zamas have resurfaced in North West province, where the Silfontein mine is located, since police started operations there in mid-October. The police minister was visiting the site Friday.	https://www.voanews.com/a/hundreds-of-south-african-miners-police-continue-standoff/7865151.html	2024-11-15T07:13:21-08:00

Dutch government says needs 'more time' for strategy on anti-Semitism	The Hague, Netherlands — The Dutch government needs 'more time' to flesh out a strategy to fight anti-Semitism after last week's violence between Israeli football fans and locals, the justice minister has said. 'Because of the terrible events of November 7 and 8 and because I want to promote a fruitful debate in parliament, I have decided to take more time to get a strategy ready,' Justice Minister David van Weel said. 'The strategy will soon be sent to parliament,' he said in a letter to MPs, published late on Thursday. Prime Minister Dick Schoof promised 'far-reaching measures' earlier this week. He said they would be announced after a cabinet meeting on Friday but this now seems to be postponed. The discussions follow violence in the streets of Amsterdam before and after the Europa League match between Dutch giants Ajax and Maccabi on November 7. Amsterdam police chief Peter Holla said that before the match Maccabi fans burned a Palestinian flag, attacked a taxi and chanted anti-Arab slogans, according to city authorities. They also reportedly booed a minute's silence during the match for victims of Spain's recent deadly floods. After the game, youths on scooters engaged in 'hit-and-run' assaults on Maccabi fans, officials said. Some social media posts had included calls to 'hunt Jews', according to police. Schoof said the attacks amounted to 'unadulterated anti-Semitism.' 'Pouring oil on the fire' The authorities have set aside 4.5 million euros ($4.8 million) for the new strategy, including 1.2 million euros for securing Jewish institutions, Dutch media reported. Schoof told parliament on Wednesday the government was looking at 'far-reaching measures' to punish anti-Semitic violence. This included the possibility of scrapping Dutch nationality for people with dual nationality. Police, prosecutors and other law authorities have launched a massive probe into the incidents surrounding the Maccabi-Ajax match, with eight suspects behind bars so far. Far-right anti-Islam MP Geert Wilders, leader of the biggest party in the coalition government, accused the country's Muslim community for the unrest. He demanded perpetrators be prosecuted 'for terrorism, lose their passports and kicked out of the country.' But opposition parties condemned Wilders' language, saying he was 'pouring oil on the fire, abusing the genuine fear and pain of one group to stoke hate against another.' Many opposition politicians and commentators said that although anti-Semitism was abhorrent, the violence was not one-sided. The violence took place against the backdrop of an increasingly polarized Europe, with heightened tensions following a rise in anti-Semitic, anti-Israeli and Islamophobic attacks since the start of the war in Gaza.	https://www.voanews.com/a/dutch-government-says-needs-more-time-for-strategy-on-anti-semitism-/7864956.html	2024-11-15T04:32:17-08:00	
Spanish regional leader admits 'mistakes' in handling deadly floods	Valencia, Spain — The head of Spain's eastern Valencia region admitted Friday to 'mistakes' in handing the country's deadliest flood in decades that killed 216 people there. 'I'm not going to deny mistakes,' Carlos Mazon told the regional parliament in an address, adding he was 'not going to shirk any responsibility.' As the head of the regional government 'I would like to apologize' to those who 'felt' that 'the aid did not arrive or was not enough,' he added. The October 29 disaster marked the country's deadliest floods in decades. A total of 224 people were killed nationwide, with 216 of them in Valencia. While he spoke, dozens of protesters gathered outside the regional parliament, jeering and chanting slogans demanding his resignation. The floods wrecked infrastructure, gutted buildings and submerged fields. The final bill is expected to soar to tens of billions of euros. Almost half of the people killed in Spain's Valencia region during recent floods were 70 years old or older and 26 were foreigners, including two Britons. Outrage at the authorities for their perceived mismanagement before and after the floods triggered mass protests on Saturday, the largest in Valencia city which drew 130,000 people. Critics have questioned the efficiency of the Valencia region's alert system during October's downpour, when in some cases only reached residents' telephones when floodwater was already gushing through towns. Many local residents have also complained that they were left without food and water for days, and had to rely on aid provided by volunteers instead of the government.	https://www.voanews.com/a/spanish-regional-leader-admits-mistakes-in-handling-deadly-floods-/7864942.html	2024-11-15T04:17:43-08:00	
Tropical Storm Sara makes landfall in Honduras, brings heavy rain to Central America	SAN PEDRO SULA, Honduras — Tropical Storm Sara made landfall in northern Honduras late Thursday and threatened to dump torrential rains across parts of Central America and southern Mexico. Sara hit land about 165 kilometers west-northwest of the Cabo Gracias a Dios on the Honduras-Nicaragua border, according to the U.S. National Hurricane Center in Miami. That is near Brus Laguna, a village of about 13,000 inhabitants. There are few other population centers nearby. At 3 a.m.(0900 GMT) the center said the storm was located about 100 kilometers east, southeast of Belize City in Honduras with a maximum sustained wind speed of 75 kph. Mexican authorities warned it could cause 'intense rains' over the resort-studded Yucatan Peninsula. Sara had winds of about 75 kph and was moving west at about 17 kph. It was expected to remain roughly on that path before heading out to sea again and threatening the coast of Belize. The center said that along the way Sara was forecast to drop 25 to 50 centimeters of rain, even up to 75 centimeters in isolated areas. Such heavy rain could lead to life-threatening flooding and landslides. Sara was forecast to pass over or very near the tourist destination of Roatan off Honduras' coast on Sunday. The storm was then expected to turn northwesterly toward Belize and the Yucatan Peninsula.	https://www.voanews.com/a/tropical-storm-sara-makes-landfall-in-honduras-brings-heavy-rain-to-central-america/7864873.html	2024-11-15T02:02:25-08:00	
Australia's plan to ban children from social media proves popular, problematic	MELBOURNE, Australia — How do you remove children from the harms of social media? Politically the answer appears simple in Australia, but practically the solution could be far more difficult. The Australian government's plan to ban children from social media platforms including X, TikTok, Facebook and Instagram until their 16th birthdays is politically popular. The opposition party says it would have done the same after winning elections due within months if the government hadn't moved first. The leaders of all eight Australian states and mainland territories have unanimously backed the plan, although Tasmania, the smallest state, would have preferred the threshold was set at 14. But a vocal assortment of experts in the fields of technology and child welfare have responded with alarm. More than 140 such experts signed an open letter to Prime Minister Anthony Albanese condemning the 16-year age limit as 'too blunt an instrument to address risks effectively.' Details of what is proposed and how it will be implemented are scant. More will be known when legislation is introduced into the Parliament next week. The concerned teen Leo Puglisi, a 17-year-old Melbourne student who founded online streaming service 6 News Australia at the age of 11, laments that lawmakers imposing the ban lack the perspective on social media that young people have gained by growing up in the digital age. 'With respect to the government and prime minister, they didn't grow up in the social media age, they're not growing up in the social media age, and what a lot of people are failing to understand here is that, like it or not, social media is a part of people's daily lives,' Leo said. 'It's part of their communities, it's part of work, it's part of entertainment, it's where they watch content – young people aren't listening to the radio or reading newspapers or watching free-to-air TV – and so it can't be ignored. The reality is this ban, if implemented, is just kicking the can down the road for when a young person goes on social media,' Leo added. Leo has been applauded for his work online. He was a finalist in his home state Victoria's nomination for the Young Australian of the Year award, which will be announced in January. His nomination bid credits his platform with 'fostering a new generation of informed, critical thinkers.' The grieving mom-turned-activist One of the proposal's supporters, cyber safety campaigner Sonya Ryan, knows from personal tragedy how dangerous social media can be for children. Her 15-year-old daughter Carly Ryan was murdered in 2007 in South Australia state by a 50-year-old pedophile who pretended to be a teenager online. In a grim milestone of the digital age, Carly was the first person in Australia to be killed by an online predator. 'Kids are being exposed to harmful pornography, they're being fed misinformation, there are body image issues, there's sextortion, online predators, bullying. There are so many different harms for them to try and manage and kids just don't have the skills or the life experience to be able to manage those well,' Sonya Ryan said. 'The result of that is we're losing our kids. Not only what happened to Carly, predatory behavior, but also we're seeing an alarming rise in suicide of young people,' she added. Sonya Ryan is part of a group advising the government on a national strategy to prevent and respond to child sexual abuse in Australia. She wholeheartedly supports Australia setting the social media age limit at 16. 'We're not going to get this perfect,' she said. 'We have to make sure that there are mechanisms in place to deal with what we already have which is an anxious generation and an addicted generation of children to social media.' A major concern for social media users of all ages is the legislation's potential privacy implications. Age estimation technology has proved inaccurate, so digital identification appears to be the most likely option for assuring a user is at least 16. Australia's eSafety Commissioner, an office that describes itself as the world's first government agency dedicated to keeping people safer online, has suggested in planning documents adopting the role of authenticator. The government would hold the identity data and the platforms would discover through the commissioner whether a potential account holder was 16. The skeptical internet expert Tama Leaver, professor of internet studies at Curtin University, fears that the government will make the platforms hold the users' identification data instead. The government has already said the onus will be on the platforms, rather than on children or their parents, to ensure everyone meets the age limit. 'The worst possible outcome seems to be the one that the government may be inadvertently pushing towards, which would be that the social media platforms themselves would end up being the identity arbiter,' Leaver said. 'They would be the holder of identity documents which would be absolutely terrible because they have a fairly poor track record so far of holding on to personal data well,' he added. The platforms will have a year once the legislation has become law to work out how the ban can be implemented. Ryan, who divides her time between Adelaide in South Australia and Fort Worth, Texas, said privacy concerns should not stand in the way of removing children from social media. 'What is the cost if we don't? If we don't put the safety of our children ahead of profit and privacy?' she asked.	https://www.voanews.com/a/australia-s-plan-to-ban-children-from-social-media-proves-popular-problematic/7864823.html	2024-11-15T01:07:12-08:00	
1 dead, thousands without heat after Russian strike on Ukraine port city	Kyiv, Ukraine — A massive Russian attack that set apartments alight and knocked out heating to thousands in Ukraine's southern port city Odesa killed one person and wounded 10 others, authorities said Friday. The Thursday night strikes on the Black Sea city damaged residential buildings, the heating system, churches and educational institutions, according to Odesa Mayor Gennadiy Trukhanov, who said it had been 'a massive combined enemy strike.' Trukhanov said early Friday that a 35-year-old woman sleeping near a window at the time of the attack had died. The State Emergency Service of Ukraine confirmed one death and said another 10 people were wounded, including two children. Fires broke out in several places but were quickly extinguished, while the main heating pipeline was damaged, leaving tens of thousands in the cold as nightly temperatures plunge to freezing. 'More than 40,000 people (as well as) medical and social institutions are without heating,' Trukhanov wrote on Telegram. 'Generators and heaters are working in medical institutions.' The mayor's office said hot drinks and blankets were being distributed while the pipeline was repaired. After fleeing during the air raid siren, Odesa resident Oleksandra said she saw pictures of her damaged home. 'When everything happened, we were hiding in a shelter. We saw that this was our house in the photos from the local channels,' she told public broadcaster Suspilne Odesa. Russia has recently stepped-up aerial attacks on southern Ukraine, damaging civilian vessels and port facilities in the Odesa region, while Kyiv has intensified its attacks on Russian military and energy targets. Early Friday morning, Ukraine's air force reported six Tu-95 bombers -- which are capable of carrying cruise missiles -- heading southeast from a base in Russia. Moscow's Ministry of Defense meanwhile announced it had intercepted 51 Ukrainian drones overnight, thwarting an attack that had targeted coastal regions, including over Crimea and the Sea of Azov. Ukraine is bracing for its toughest winter of war yet, with Moscow having destroyed swathes of its generating capacity and continuing to strike energy sites. In previous winters, millions of Ukrainians endured regular blackouts and lost heating in sub-zero conditions. Ukrainian forces are losing ground in the east and concerns are mounting in Kyiv over the future of foreign military aid after the victory of Donald Trump in the United States presidential election. Kyiv has for months been appealing to its Western allies to provide more air-defense systems to fend off Russian attacks on cities and critical infrastructure.	https://www.voanews.com/a/dead-thousands-without-heat-after-russian-strike-on-ukraine-port-city/7864826.html	2024-11-15T01:04:11-08:00	
Israeli airstrike hits south Beirut	Beirut — An airstrike hit the Lebanese capital's southern suburbs on Friday, sending plumes of gray smoke into the sky after the Israeli military called for people to evacuate, AFPTV images showed. Lebanon's state-run National News Agency said an Israeli drone fired two missiles at the Beirut suburb of Ghobeiry before the air force carried out a 'very heavy' strike that leveled a building near municipal offices. The evacuation order posted on X by Israeli army spokesperson Avichay Adraee told residents to leave, warning of imminent strikes. 'All residents in the southern suburbs, specifically ... in the Ghobeiry area, you are located near facilities and interests affiliated with Hezbollah,' Adraee said in his post. 'For your safety and the safety of your family members, you must evacuate these buildings and those adjacent to them immediately.' His post included maps identifying buildings in the area near Bustan High School. Repeated Israeli airstrikes on south Beirut have led to a mass exodus of civilians from the Hezbollah stronghold, although some return during the day to check on their homes and businesses. NNA also reported pre-dawn strikes on the southern city of Nabatieh. The Israeli military said it had struck 'command centers' of Hezbollah's elite Radwan Force and launchers used to fire rockets at Israel on Thursday. It said that over the past day, the air force had struck more than 120 targets across Lebanon, including weapons storage facilities, command centers and a large number of rocket launchers. Since September 23, Israel has ramped up its air campaign in Lebanon, later sending in ground troops following almost a year of limited, cross-border exchanges begun by Hezbollah over the Gaza war. Hezbollah has been designated a terror group by the United States, the U.K. and other Western countries. Lebanese authorities say that more than 3,380 people have been killed since October last year, when Hezbollah and Israel began trading fire. The conflict has cost Lebanon more than $5 billion in economic losses, with actual structural damage amounting to billions more, the World Bank said on Thursday.	https://www.voanews.com/a/israeli-airstrike-hits-south-beirut/7864856.html	2024-11-15T01:01:27-08:00	
US, Japan, South Korea coordinate response to North Korean threats	U.S. President Joe Biden will meet with leaders of South Korea and Japan Friday to come up with a 'coordinated' response to the deployment of thousands of North Korean troops to help Moscow’s war against Ukraine and on Pyongyang’s nuclear threat more broadly, on the sidelines of the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation Forum in Lima, Peru. Pyongyang’s troop deployment is a 'significant development,' White House national security adviser Jake Sullivan told reporters aboard Air Force One en route to Lima, Wednesday. 'We are going to treat it with the seriousness with which it deserves to be treated,' he said. Sullivan said the trilateral summit will allow leaders to prepare for any potential 'provocative' move from Pyongyang, including nuclear testing and ballistic missile launches, as the U.S. prepares for a change of administration when Donald Trump takes office in January. 'Transitions have historically been time periods when the DPRK has taken provocative actions,' Sullivan said, using the abbreviation for North Korea’s formal name, the Democratic People’s Republic of Korea. The United States has an 'extended deterrence' policy that aims to prevent adversaries from attacking allies, including South Korea and Japan. The policy states Washington will come to their aid if they are attacked, potentially including use of American nuclear capabilities. No specific announcement on extended deterrence will be announced at a trilateral level in Lima, Sullivan said. However, the trilateral meeting will be an opportunity to 'ensure that each of these two bilateral dialogues are working to reinforce one another, and that there aren't gaps and seams between them.' The leaders are set to announce establishment of a trilateral secretariat as part of their efforts to 'institutionalize' three-way cooperation that began as a series of leaders’ dialogues on economic security, intelligence sharing, and defense policy coordination. The trilateral leaders’ dialogues began in May 2023 on the sidelines of the G7 summit in Hiroshima, Japan, and then at Camp David in August that year. The trilateral effort is one of Biden’s signature regional security initiatives to push Seoul and Tokyo to overcome years of animosity and work together to deter common adversaries, North Korea and China. The leaders are also set to bolster trilateral exercises, Sullivan said. 'We've made progress on technology protection, on supply chain diversification, on missile warning and the sharing of data with respect to miswarning in all of those areas,' he said. 'We expect to take further steps tomorrow.' U.S., Japanese and South Korean militaries Thursday launched joint exercises in waters south of the Korean peninsula and west of Japan, the final drills under the Biden administration. During his first term Trump advocated for friendlier ties with North Korean leader Kim Jong Un and pressured Tokyo and Seoul to take on a larger share of U.S. defense burden-sharing. A day before Trump’s reelection, the U.S. and South Korea a finalized a new agreement for Seoul to pay $1.19 billion in 2026 to support U.S. troops, an 8.3% increase from the previous year.	https://www.voanews.com/a/us-japan-south-korea-coordinate-response-to-north-korean-threats/7864811.html	2024-11-14T22:48:39-08:00	
Party of Sri Lanka's new Marxist-leaning president takes large lead in parliamentary vote	COLOMBO, Sri Lanka — The party of Sri Lanka's new Marxist-leaning President Anura Kumara Dissanayake took a large lead Friday in early results from the parliamentary elections, in an apparent solid mandate for his program for economic revival. Dissanayake's National People's Power Party won 15 of the 22 electoral districts whose results have been released so far by the Elections Commission. Dissanayake was elected president on September 21 in a rejection of traditional political parties that have governed the island nation since its independence from British rule in 1948. But he received just 42% of the votes, fueling questions over his party's outlook in Thursday's parliamentary elections. But the party received large increases in support less than two months into his presidency. In a major surprise and a big shift in the country's electoral landscape, his party won the Jaffna district, the heartland of ethnic Tamils in the north, and many other minority strongholds. The victory in Jaffna marks a great dent for traditional ethnic Tamil parties that have dominated the politics of the north since independence. It is also a major shift in the attitude of Tamils, who have long been suspicious of majority ethnic Sinhalese leaders. Ethnic Tamil rebels fought an unsuccessful civil war in 1983-2009 to create a separate homeland, saying they were being marginalized by governments controlled by Sinhalese. According to conservative U.N. estimates, more than 100,000 people were killed in the conflict. Of the 225 seats in parliament, 196 were up for grabs under Sri Lanka's proportional representative electoral system, which allocates seats in each district among the parties according to the proportion of the votes they get. The remaining 29 seats — called the national list seats — are allocated to parties and independent groups according to the proportion of the total votes they receive countrywide. The election comes at a decisive time for Sri Lankans, as the island nation is struggling to emerge from its worst economic crisis, having declared bankruptcy after defaulting on its external debt in 2022. The country is now in the middle of a bailout program with the International Monetary Fund, with debt restructuring with international creditors nearly complete. Dissanayake said during the presidential campaign that he planned to propose significant changes to the targets set in the IMF deal, which his predecessor, Ranil Wickremesinghe, signed, saying it placed too much burden on the people. However, he has since changed his stance and says Sri Lanka will go along with the agreement. Sri Lanka's crisis was largely the result of economic mismanagement combined with fallout from the COVID-19 pandemic, which along with 2019 militant attacks devastated its important tourism industry. The pandemic also disrupted the flow of remittances from Sri Lankans working abroad. The government also slashed taxes in 2019, depleting the treasury just as the virus hit. Foreign exchange reserves plummeted, leaving Sri Lanka unable to pay for imports or defend its currency, the rupee. Sri Lanka's economic upheaval led to a political crisis that forced then-President Gotabaya Rajapaksa to resign in 2022. Parliament then elected Wickremesinghe to replace him. The economy was stabilized, inflation dropped, the rupee strengthened and foreign reserves increased under Wickremesinghe. Nonetheless, he lost the election as public dissatisfaction grew over the government's effort to increase revenue by raising electricity bills and imposing heavy new income taxes on professionals and businesses as part of the government's efforts to meet the IMF conditions. Voters were also drawn by the NPP's cry for change in the political culture and an end to corruption, because they perceived the parties that ruled Sri Lanka so far caused the economic collapse. Dissanayake's promise to punish members of previous governments accused of corruption and to recover allegedly stolen assets also raised much hope among the people.	https://www.voanews.com/a/party-of-sri-lanka-s-new-marxist-leaning-president-takes-large-lead-in-parliamentary-vote/7864810.html	2024-11-14T22:39:44-08:00	
A criticized Airbnb deal will let users play gladiator in Rome's Colosseum	ROME — The ancient Roman Colosseum will be the venue of gladiator fights — albeit staged — for the first time in two millennia under a $1.5 million sponsorship deal with Airbnb that aims to promote 'a more conscious tourism.' But some visitors to the monument Thursday, as well as housing activists, were skeptical about the value of the arrangement, citing ongoing controversies in many cities over the role of short-term rental platforms in fueling overtourism and limiting affordable housing for residents and students. Under the deal announced by Airbnb and the Colosseum on Wednesday, the sponsorship by the short-term rental giant will cover the renewal of an educational program inside the ancient Roman amphitheater covering the history of the structure and gladiators. Eight of the platform's users and their plus-ones will be able to participate in faux gladiator fights after the Colosseum's closing time on May 7-8, taking the same underground route used by gladiators in ancient Rome to reach the arena. People can apply for the experience on November 27 at no cost, and the 'gladiators' will be chosen by lottery. The superintendent of the Colosseum Archaeological Park, Alfonsina Russo, told The Associated Press that the deal is in conjunction with the release of Ridley Scott's new film 'Gladiators II,' which opened in Italy on Thursday. Russo characterized the sponsorship arrangement as one of the many such deals to help finance projects at the park. The Italian fashion brand Tod's, for example, has funded a multimillion renovation of the Roman monument, including a cleaning, replacing the locking system of arches with new gates and redoing the subterranean areas. Alberto Campailla, the coordinator of the Nonna Roma nonprofit organization that focuses on housing and food for the poor, called the campaign with Airbnb 'a disgrace,' and a form of 'touristification.' Airbnb and other platforms offering short-term rentals 'are literally driving people out of not only the city center, but also the outskirts and suburban neighborhoods,' Campailla said. Tourists from other European cities grappling with overtourism also took issue with the deal. 'It seems to me that the purpose of the Colosseum today is to be a tourist attraction, but not to create an amusement park within it,' said Jaime Montero, a tourist visiting from Madrid. 'In the end, tourism eats the essence of the cities, here in Rome, as in other capitals.' Visiting from Naples, Salvatore Di Matteo saw the deal as 'yet another takeover of the territory' by big companies. 'If they start to touch sacred monuments such as the Colosseum here in Rome, it is obviously something that should make us think and is, in any case, a bit worrying,' he said. The Colosseum is the most important and largest amphitheater constructed by the ancient Romans. Built in the 1st century, it was the center of popular entertainment, hosting hunts and gladiator games, until the 6th century.	https://www.voanews.com/a/a-criticized-airbnb-deal-will-let-users-play-gladiator-in-rome-s-colosseum/7864806.html	2024-11-14T22:23:09-08:00	
South Africa's government won't help illegal miners inside closed mine	JOHANNESBURG — South Africa's government says it won't help a group of illegal miners inside a closed mine in the country's North West province who have been denied access to basic supplies as part of an official strategy against illegal mining. The miners in the mineshaft in Stilfontein are believed to be suffering from a lack of food, water and other basic necessities after police closed off the entrances used to transport their supplies underground. It is part of the police's Vala Umgodi, or Close the Hole, operation, which includes cutting off miners' supplies to force them to return to the surface and be arrested. Police had earlier indicated that information received from those who recently helped bring three miners to the surface indicated that up to 4,000 miners may be underground. However, on Thursday afternoon, police spokesperson Athlenda Mathe said that they believed the number was exaggerated and maybe be far less than that, estimating a figure of between 350 and 400 miners. 'We feel that the numbers are being exaggerated. We have deployed maximum resources to this case including our intelligence operative who are on the ground who have engaged with all stakeholders. 'We have managed to estimate the numbers to be between 350 and 400,' Mathe said. South African ministers of police and defense are on Thursday expected to visit the mine to engage with officials and community members on the ground, Mathe said. Stilfontein is one of the mines that were targeted by police as they intensified their operation in the North West province from October 18. It's unclear how long the current group of miners have been underground, as the groups are reported to often stay underground for months, depending on supplies of basic necessities like food and water from the outside. 'We have taken a decision that no police officer, no soldier or government official will go down to an abandoned mine. There is a high risk of loss of life,' she said. Mathe said they had information that the miners may be heavily armed, adding that since embarking on operations against illegal miners since last December, police had seized more than 369 high caliber firearms, 10,000 rounds of ammunition, 5 million rand ($275,000) in cash and 32 million rand ($1.75 million) worth of uncut diamonds. In the past few weeks, more than 1,000 miners have surfaced at various mines in North West province, with many reported to be weak, hungry and sickly after going for weeks without basic supplies. Police continue on Thursday to guard areas around the mine to catch all those appearing from underground. Cabinet Minister Khumbudzo Ntshavheni told reporters on Wednesday that the government wouldn't send any help to the illegal miners, because they are involved in a criminal act. 'We are not sending help to criminals. We are going to smoke them out. They will come out. Criminals are not to be helped. We didn't send them there,' Ntshavheni said. Illegal mining remains common in South Africa's old gold-mining areas, with miners going into closed shafts to dig for any possible remaining deposits. The illegal miners are often from neighboring countries, and police say the illegal operations involve larger syndicates that employ the miners. Their presence in closed mines have also created problems with nearby communities, which complain that the illegal miners commit crimes ranging from robberies to rape. Illegal mining groups are known to be heavily armed, and disputes between rival groups sometimes result in fatal confrontations.	https://www.voanews.com/a/south-africa-s-government-won-t-help-illegal-miners-inside-closed-mine/7864805.html	2024-11-14T22:12:56-08:00	
North Korea tests exploding drones as Kim calls for mass production	SEOUL, South Korea — North Korea tested exploding drones designed to crash into targets and leader Kim Jong Un called for accelerating mass production of the weapons, state media said Friday. The country's latest military demonstration came as the United States, South Korea and Japan engaged in combined military exercises involving advanced fighter jets and a U.S. aircraft carrier in nearby international waters, in a display of their defense posture against North Korea. North Korea's official Korean Central News Agency published photos of Kim talking with officials near at least two different types of unmanned aerial vehicles. They included those with X-shaped tails and wings that look similar to the ones the country disclosed in August, when Kim inspected another demonstration of drones that explode on impact. The drones flew various routes and accurately struck targets, KCNA said. Its images showed what appeared to be a BMW sedan being destroyed and old models of tanks being blown up. Kim expressed satisfaction with the weapons' development process and stressed the need to 'build a serial production system as early as possible and go into full-scale mass production,' noting how drones are becoming crucial in modern warfare. KCNA paraphrased Kim as saying drones were easy to make at low cost for a range of military activities. The report didn't say if Kim spoke directly about rival South Korea, which the North Korean drones are apparently designed to target. North Korea last month accused South Korea of sending its own drones to drop anti-North Korean propaganda leaflets over the North's capital of Pyongyang, and threatened to respond with force if such flights occur again. South Korea's military has refused to confirm whether or not the North's claims were true. Tensions in the region have escalated as Kim flaunts his advancing nuclear and missile program, which includes various nuclear-capable weapons targeting South Korea and intercontinental ballistic missiles that can potentially reach the U.S. mainland. Kim is also allegedly sending military equipment and troops to Russia to support President Vladimir Putin's war on Ukraine, which raised concerns in Seoul that he would get Russian technology in return to further develop his arsenal. In addition to his intensifying nuclear threats, Kim has also engaged in psychological and electronic warfare against South Korea, such as flying thousands of balloons to drop trash in the South and disrupting GPS signals from border areas near the South's biggest airport. South Korean officials say North Korea will be a key topic in a trilateral summit between South Korean President Yoon Suk Yeol, U.S. President Joe Biden and Japanese Prime Minister Shigeru Ishiba this week at the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation meetings in Peru. South Korean Foreign Minister Cho Tae-yul and U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken met on the margins of the APEC on Thursday and discussed 'strong concerns' over deepening ties between Pyongyang and Moscow, particularly the deployment of North Korean troops to support Russia's war against Ukraine, the U.S. State Department said.	https://www.voanews.com/a/north-korea-tests-exploding-drones-as-kim-calls-for-mass-production/7864793.html	2024-11-14T21:24:33-08:00	
Masses of residents flee homes in Haiti's capital as gangs ratchet up violence	PORT-AU-PRINCE, Haiti — Masses of residents fled a running battle Thursday between gang members and police in one of the few neighborhoods of Haiti's capital that hadn't already been fully taken over by gangs, as violence flared amid political turmoil. Families frantically packed mattresses and furniture into cars and carried their belongings on their heads as they left the Solino neighborhood, one of a handful of areas in Port-au-Prince where a coalition of gangs, called Viv Ansanm, and police were locked in a violent firefight over the past several days. 'We barely made it out,' said 52-year-old Jean-Jean Pierre, who was carrying his son in his arms as he fled the neighborhood with throngs of people. 'I've lived here 40 years of my life and I've never seen it this bad.' Violence has exploded in the capital since Sunday when Haiti's transitional council created to restore democratic order fired the interim prime minister amid political infighting. The Caribbean nation hasn't held an election since 2016, largely because of the gang violence. The U.N. International Office for Migration reports that since Sunday more than 4,300 people have fled their homes in Port-au-Prince and neighboring towns, U.N. spokesperson Stephane Dujarric told reporters at the U.N. in New York on Thursday. Gangs like the Viv Ansanm coalition often seize on moments of political chaos to make power grabs like the one seen in Solino in recent days. Gangs also largely shut down the country's main airport by shooting a number of planes, wounding one flight attendant on Monday. The United Nations said that it documented 20 armed clashes in Port-au-Prince in just one day. The U.N. estimates that gangs control 85% of the city. A U.N.-backed mission led by Kenyan police sent to subdue the gangs has been unable to quell the violence. Pierre, the fleeing father, said he hasn't seen any presence of the U.N.-backed mission in his neighborhood, and that he and his family don't know where they'll go. Other residents said gang members had forced them from their homes and burned their belongings. 'These gangs are more powerful than the police,' Pierre said. The United Nations has mobilized help, spokesperson Dujarric said. In the past two days, he said the U.N. children's agency UNICEF provided cash to nearly 1,500 people in displacement sites in the capital and the U.N. population and migration agencies deployed mobile health clinics and are providing clean water. Starting Thursday, he said, the U.N. World Food Program delivered food to more than 50,000 displaced people in Port-au-Prince. 'Across Haiti, WFP has also provided cash to nearly 100,000 people and is delivering daily meals to 430,000 children in 2,000 schools across the country,' Dujarric said. The country's new interim prime minister, Alix Didier Fils-Aimé, has been largely silent about the violence since he was sworn in on Monday, but on Wednesday released a statement condemning the plane shootings. His office said that he ordered police to regain control of the airport and nearby areas. Meanwhile, videos on social media have shown smoke rising up from the Solino area, as gunfire has echoed from the neighborhood's streets in recent days. While it wasn't immediately clear how many people were fleeing the violence in Solino, it appeared that much of the neighborhood was emptying out. Residents said that gang members had killed a police officer who was known as a community leader fighting back against the gangs. That killing also was reported by local media, though The Associated Press wasn't able to confirm the death with authorities. In October, the same gang coalition made a similar violent push into the Solino neighborhood, setting fire to homes and leaving many fleeing with all they could carry or calling radio stations to plead for help.	https://www.voanews.com/a/masses-of-residents-flee-homes-in-haiti-s-capital-as-gangs-ratchet-up-violence/7864783.html	2024-11-14T20:45:57-08:00	
UN committee: Israel war in Gaza ‘consistent with genocide’	While fighting continued in Gaza and Lebanon on Thursday, a United Nations special committee said that Israeli policies and practices in Gaza are 'consistent with the characteristics of genocide.' In a report published Thursday, the U.N. Special Committee to Investigate Israeli Practices also accused Israel of using 'starvation as a weapon of war' and running an 'apartheid system' in the occupied West Bank. There was no immediate response from the Israeli government. In the past, it has accused the U.N. of being biased against Israel. The U.N. special committee was set up in 1968 to monitor the Israeli occupation. Its annual report covers the period from October 2023 to July 2024. The International Court of Justice is investigating a claim by South Africa that Israel’s military campaign in Gaza is genocidal. The Israeli government has rejected the charges. Also Thursday, Human Rights Watch accused Israel of war crimes and crimes against humanity in its war against Hamas militants in Gaza, a conclusion Israel rejected. The report said Israel, which has repeatedly displaced and relocated civilians, is 'committing the war crime of forcible transfer,' and the actions 'appear to also meet the definition of ethnic cleansing' in the areas where Palestinians will not be able to return. In response, Israel accused the organization of using rhetoric that is 'completely false and detached from reality.' The Israeli Foreign Ministry said that Israel's efforts are 'directed solely at dismantling Hamas's terror capabilities and not at the people of Gaza, unlike Hamas, which uses civilians as human shields and embeds terror infrastructure within residential areas.' 'Israel views all civilian harm as a tragedy, while Hamas views all civilian harm as a strategy. Israel will continue to operate in accordance with the law of armed conflict,' spokesperson Oren Marmorstein said in a statement. Hamas denies that it uses civilians as human shields or hides fighters and weapons in facilities such as hospitals and schools. War’s toll Israel invaded the Gaza Strip last year after Hamas led a terror attack on communities in southern Israel, killing about 1,200 people, according to Israeli authorities, and abducting more than 250 as hostages, about 100 of whom are still in Gaza, a third of them believed to be dead. Since then, the Israeli counteroffensive has killed more than 43,700 people, according to Gaza health authorities. An additional 103,000 Palestinians have been injured. The Israeli military says the death toll includes thousands of Hamas militants. Israel also has destroyed much of the enclave's infrastructure, forcing most of the 2.3 million population to move several times. The war spread to Lebanon in mid-September, after months of rocket fire from Hezbollah into Israel and drone and airstrikes by Israel's military in south Lebanon escalated. More than 3,200 Lebanese have been killed, most of them in the past six weeks. Hamas and Hezbollah have been designated as terror groups by the United States, Britain and other Western countries. West Bank For the past month, Israeli troops have moved tens of thousands of people from areas in the north of the territory along the Mediterranean Sea as they sought to destroy Hamas forces the military says have been regrouping around the towns of Jabalia, Beit Lahiya and Beit Hanoun. Human Rights Watch said the displacement of Palestinians 'is likely planned to be permanent in the buffer zones and security corridors,' an action it said would amount to 'ethnic cleansing.' The Israeli military has denied seeking to create permanent buffer zones, and Foreign Minister Gideon Saar said on Monday that Palestinians displaced from their homes in northern Gaza would be allowed to return at the end of the war. Air strikes in Gaza, Lebanon On the war front, an Israeli strike on a home in northern Gaza killed three children, among at least six people killed in the territory, Palestinian medics said. An airstrike hit the southern suburbs of Beirut on Thursday after an Israeli warning to evacuate parts of the Hezbollah bastion, Agence France-Presse reported. Shortly before the strike, Israel had issued a warning to residents to evacuate their homes. 'You are located near Hezbollah facilities and interests against which the [Israeli military] will operate in the near future,' army spokesperson Avichay Adraee said in a post on X that included a map identifying buildings in the areas. In a post on the Telegram messaging app Thursday, Israel Defense Forces said the air force struck and dismantled more than 140 Hezbollah launchers in southern Lebanon and had killed two battalion commanders and a company commander. 'Over the past week, the IDF eliminated over 200 Hezbollah terrorists in southern Lebanon from the air and ground,' the post stated. But, in a sign that a truce may be slowly approaching, the U.S. ambassador to Lebanon on Thursday submitted a draft truce proposal to Lebanon's parliament speaker, Nabih Berri, according to Reuters. Some information in this report came from The Associated Press, Reuters and Agence France-Presse.	https://www.voanews.com/a/un-committee-israel-war-in-gaza-consistent-with-genocide-/7864776.html	2024-11-14T19:53:08-08:00	
Trump taps old ally, campaign stalwart for top intelligence posts	US President-elect Donald Trump is turning to an old ally to lead the CIA and an outsider some see as a potential disruptor to oversee American intelligence agencies when his second term begins in January.

Philippines bolsters maritime claims despite China pressure	BANGKOK — China is likely to continue its aggressive naval approach toward the Philippines amid their disputes in the South China Sea, experts say. Philippines President Ferdinand Marcos Jr. has signed two new maritime laws to protect Manila’s disputed territory: the Philippine Maritime Zones Act and Philippine Archipelagic Sea Lanes Act. According to the Philippines Presidential Office, the Philippine Maritime Zones Act 'seeks to designate the country’s archipelagic sea lanes, which would create routes over the country’s water and airspace.' The act also 'declares the Philippines’ maritime zones in accordance with the standards set by the United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea (UNCLOS). The Philippine Archipelagic Sea Lanes Act establishes a system of archipelagic sea lanes and air routes, through which foreign vessels and aircraft shall exercise the right of archipelagic sea lanes passage.' Raymond Powell, director of Sealight at Stanford University’s Gordian Knot Center for National Security Innovation, says the introduction of the laws is necessary for Manila’s long-term strategy of resistance against Beijing. 'Passage of the Philippines’ new maritime laws is a necessary step in its lawfare against China’s maritime aggression, which has reached the scale of an occupation of large swaths of the West Philippine Sea,' Powell told VOA. Lawfare is a name given to using political and judicial action in a dispute. Malaysia is also protesting the Philippines new maritime laws. Malaysia’s deputy foreign minister, Mohamad Alamin, says the laws touch upon Malaysia’s overlapping claims of territory that borders Sabah on Borneo Island. But it's China that claims almost all of the South China Sea under its nine-dash line designating its territory. In 2016 the Permanent Court of Arbitration ruled that China’s claims have no legal basis under the United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea. China has long ignored that ruling. Beijing and the Philippines both claim the Second Thomas Shoal of the Spratly Islands, which China calls the Nansha Islands. The Scarborough Shoal, or Huangyan Island, is also contested between the two countries. Beijing seized the island in 2012. In recent years, the overlapping claims escalated when Philippine vessels faced aggressive encounters from Chinese ships while operating in the contested waters. Powell said Manila’s signing of maritime laws is part of a long-term strategy. 'The Philippines now not only has a PRC [People’s Republic of China] military base at Mischief Reef, deep within its lawful exclusive economic zone, China now controls access to several key features, such as Scarborough, Sabina and Second Thomas Shoals. With Beijing now behaving as an imperial occupation force, Manila needs a comprehensive, long-term strategy of resistance to raise the costs of that occupation. Lawfare will be a key component to that campaign,' he said. China has already opposed the Philippines new maritime laws, calling them a serious infringement. Beijing summoned the Philippines’ ambassador to protest last week, while China’s embassy has warned Manila of its 'unilateral' actions. 'China will continue to take necessary measures in accordance with the law to safeguard its territorial sovereignty and maritime rights,' the embassy said in a statement, according to Reuters. Jay Batongbacal, a maritime expert, told VOA’s Mandarin Service that China opposes resistance from the Philippines to serve its own interests. 'The fundamental source of insecurity really is that China's interests in the South China Sea have always been defined and driven by its military and strategic objectives of establishing and gaining dominance and control in the first and second island chains,' he said. Zachary Abuza, a professor at the National War College in Washington, says the laws help Manila challenge China's claims. 'The laws do not fundamentally change things on the ground, but they do have their purposes. The law allows the Philippines to assert their own effective control and create a legal basis to challenge China's claims,' he told VOA. But China will push back aggressively, he added. 'We should expect more aggressive behavior,' he said. 'We just saw them draw baselines around Scarborough Shoal, a low tide elevation, which is totally illegal in international law. China just hates it when states move to advance their legal claims. It is still stinging from 2016 when the Permanent Court of Arbitration tossed out each of their legal clams of sovereignty over the entire South China Sea.' China has responded by publishing on Sunday new baselines outlining its claims over Scarborough Shoal, and on Wednesday, Beijing conducted air and naval combat drives at the disputed shoal. Since Marcos became president in 2022, Manila has reinvigorated its relations with the U.S., which had been distanced under previous Philippines President Rodrigo Duterte, despite the U.S., and the Philippines being long-time mutual defense partners. Under Marcos, the Philippines has given U.S. troops more access to its military bases and conducted joint naval exercises. Manila is also aiming to buy midrange missiles from Washington to bolster its defense, while China claims the action will undermine peace in the region. U.S. Secretary of Defense Lloyd Austin will travel to the Philippines later this month as part of a series of Asia-Pacific meetings in the region. But with U.S. President-elect Donald Trump set to take office in January, questions remain about Washington's role between the two countries. 'The Philippines needs to be able to convince President-elect Trump of its continued value as U.S. partner in the Indo-Pacific,' Vincent Kyle Parada, a former defense analyst in the Philippines Navy, told VOA’s Mandarin Service. 'While bipartisan consensus against China remains strong, Marcos Jr. should anticipate a more quid pro quo or a transactional relationship with Washington and work to rely on his foreign policy initiatives with the U.S.,' he added.	https://www.voanews.com/a/philippines-bolsters-maritime-claims-despite-china-pressure/7864730.html	2024-11-14T18:03:39-08:00	
Can Trump's return to White House be an opportunity for enhancing US-Turkey ties?	washington — Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan was among the first foreign leaders to congratulate U.S. President-elect Donald Trump on his early November election victory. President Joe Biden has not hosted Erdogan at the White House though the two have met on sidelines of international summits and spoken by phone. Speaking to journalists accompanying his return from visits to Saudi Arabia and Azerbaijan, Erdogan expressed his hope for improved U.S. ties, adding, however, that in-person meetings would be needed to achieve that end, and that Ankara needs to wait to see what kind of a Cabinet Trump forms. The two leaders had a close personal relationship during Trump’s first term in office. However, bilateral relations have also been marked by tough times during that administration. With Trump’s January return to the White House, analysts told VOA that although there may be opportunities for more cooperation in some areas, they don’t expect major changes. James Jeffrey, who served as the U.S. ambassador to Turkey from 2008 to 2010, sees Ukraine as one area with potential for cooperation. Referring to Trump’s promise to end the war in Ukraine, Jeffrey says Turkey could play a role in negotiating a cease-fire, making both sides 'well-aligned for a productive relationship.' Alan Makovsky, a senior fellow for national security and international policy at the Center for American Progress, also believes Trump’s priority to end the war in Ukraine creates a significant opportunity for Erdogan. A NATO ally, Turkey has adopted a careful balancing act amid the war in Ukraine, supplying armed drones to Ukraine while maintaining ties with Russia in energy and tourism. Erdogan, who has maintained good relations with both Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy and Russian President Vladimir Putin, has long said neither side is gaining from the war and offered to host and mediate negotiations. Disagreement over Syria Disagreements between Turkey and the United States during Trump’s first term included Ankara’s frustration with U.S. support for Syrian Democratic Forces (SDF) led by Kurdish militia — People’s Protection Units, known as YPG in northern Syria. After a phone call with Erdogan on October 6, 2019, Trump unexpectedly announced that the U.S. would withdraw from Syria. Many U.S. military officials, all of whom were caught off guard by the announcement, did not support the idea. Tension between the allies worsened after Trump on October 9 sent a letter to Erdogan, warning him against a military incursion into Syria. Following Trump’s withdrawal announcement, Turkey launched a military operation in northern Syria targeting the YPG on October 9. A cease-fire agreement was reached during then-Vice President Mike Pence’s visit to Ankara on October 17. Now, some in Ankara expect the U.S. may reconsider its presence in northern Syria during Trump’s second term. Jeffrey, a U.S. envoy for Syria from 2018 to 2020, suggests Trump’s administration may reassess this issue. 'Each time people were able to convince [Trump on Syria, it] was that the troops were serving a set of important purposes. This is one of the most low-cost, high-return military deployments. We are keeping the Islamic State under control. Secondly, we are holding vital terrain, blocking Iranian, Assad and Russian ambitions,' he told VOA. Washington has long said its SDF partnership is necessary for the enduring defeat of ISIS and countering Iran. Ankara considers YPG a Syrian offshoot of PKK, which U.S. officials have also designated as a terrorist organization. Trump nominated Marco Rubio, a Republican senator from Florida, for secretary of state. Rubio was one of the strongest opponents of a U.S.-pullout from Syria at the time. He labeled the decision as 'a catastrophic mistake that will have dire consequences far beyond Syria,' urging Trump to reconsider it. 'We’ll have to see how that works out and how Marco Rubio’s views may have changed to accord more with Trump's or vice versa,' Makovksy said. 'But anyone who thought that Trump's election meant that the U.S. would soon be withdrawing from Syria would certainly have to rethink that view in light of the Rubio appointment. I think that makes it unlikely that we will withdraw from Syria.' Trump’s nominees for Cabinet positions will require Senate approval before they assume office. F-35 program One complicating factor in U.S.-Turkey relations during Trump’s first term was Turkey’s purchase of the S-400 missile defense system from Russia, which prompted Washington to remove Ankara from an F-35 joint strike fighter program. 'The F-35 cannot coexist with a Russian intelligence collection platform that will be used to learn about its advanced capabilities,' said a White House statement when the system was delivered in July 2019, explaining the U.S. decision to remove Turkey from the project. The Trump administration in December 2020 sanctioned Turkey under the Countering America’s Adversaries Through Sanctions Act (CAATSA). Turkey, which has since requested removal of CAATSA sanctions, has returned to talks with U.S. officials about a possible return to the F-35 program. Analysts say that while there is a likelihood that CAATSA sanctions might be lifted during Trump’s second term, any solution to the S-400 issue that is not permanent would not be technically acceptable to the U.S. military. Describing the F-35s as the U.S. military’s largest project since World War II, Jeffrey said, 'A permanent solution is that they [the S-400s] go away, they're sold to somebody else. I would like to have a solution, but technically, I don't think there is one.’’ Makovsky called Turkey’s return to the F-35 program unlikely in the near term. 'If they completely get rid of the S-400s, really give up possession as the law requires, there could be a reasonable chance for F-35,' he told VOA. 'But it will be up to the so-called Four Corners - the chairman and senior members of the House Foreign Affairs Committee and the Senate Foreign Relations Committee.'

Petrol prices projected to decrease amid new agreements	For decades, Nigeria has relied on imports to meet fuel demand, spending about $15 billion annually. Now, new alliances aim to cut these expenses by investing in homegrown energy, targeting affordable petrol for consumers and boosting the economy. New agreements among the Nigerian National Petroleum Company Limited, Dangote Refinery and independent oil marketers may end long-standing issues over fuel imports. NNPC and oil marketers will now take petrol directly from local refiner Dangote instead of importing it, aiming to reduce import costs, stabilize petrol prices and make fuel more affordable for consumers. Energy expert Faith Nwadishi praises this move for its potential to strengthen the economy. 'If we begin to buy products from Dangote, we will be able to save at least 24 trillion naira [$14.3 billion] yearly,' said Nwadishi. 'Nigeria depends on that. The economy depends on that. If there's no fuel, you see the hardship it takes on people. Products cannot come from farms to markets.' Sharing optimism, David Etim, an energy expert and entrepreneur, said he believes this is the right step toward energy independence. 'Energy self-sufficiency or energy dependency is actually a national security issue,' said Etim. 'It's just like food security. No country in the world that depends on outsiders to provide such an essential input to its social life as energy can call itself independent. So, the fact that Nigeria has moved from energy dependency to energy independency is a significant move in a very positive direction.' Nigerians currently pay high fuel prices, with some areas reporting more than 1,200 naira per liter [$0.71]. This deal raises hopes as the oil sector shifts to local production. Consumers such as Felix Chukwuemeka, an Abuja businessman feeling the heat of rising prices, eagerly await relief. 'From my house to my junction, we paid 300 [$0.18], but now we are paying 600 naira [$0.36],' said Chukwuemeka. 'So, you can see the expense is doubled. ... It would be very exciting to many of us, especially in the business sector, if the price of petrol seems to reduce, because it will really enhance our business.' Despite optimism, Nigeria's four refineries remain nonfunctional, raising sustainability concerns. Senior economist Paul Alaje emphasizes the need to revamp refineries and stabilize the currency for lasting gains. 'The more you abandon your refinery, it becomes moribund, it becomes sunk cost to the economy. And sadly, this is reality today,' said Alaje. '... Nigerians will be looking at a price between 500 to 600 naira per liter of PMS [petroleum motor spirit]. But, do I think this is achievable even under this current agreement? I doubt very much. Why? There is a big elephant in the room. This elephant is called the exchange rate.' While the new alliances in the oil sector signal a positive step toward stable, affordable fuel, experts stress the need for transparency, accountability and strict implementation to ensure that Nigerians benefit. For now, there's been no notable impact on the cost of PMS across the country. However, if successful, these agreements could mark a major shift for Nigeria's oil industry — securing energy independence, easing prices and boosting economic growth.	https://www.voanews.com/a/petrol-prices-projected-to-decrease-amid-new-agreements/7864677.html	2024-11-14T17:06:33-08:00

Wisconsin agency issues permits for Enbridge Line 5 reroute around reservation	MADISON, Wisconsin — Enbridge's contentious plan to reroute an aging pipeline around a northern Wisconsin tribal reservation moved closer to reality Thursday after the company won its first permits from state regulators. Wisconsin Department of Natural Resources officials announced they have issued construction permits for the Line 5 reroute around the Bad River Band of Lake Superior Chippewa's reservation. The energy company still needs discharge permits from the DNR and the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers. The project has generated fierce opposition. The tribe wants the pipeline off its land, but tribal members and environmentalists maintain rerouting construction will damage the region's watershed and perpetuate the use of fossil fuels. Permits issued with conditions The DNR issued the construction permits with more than 200 conditions attached. The company must complete the project by November 14, 2027, hire DNR-approved environmental monitors and allow DNR employees to access the site during reasonable hours. The company also must notify the agency within 24 hours of any permit violations or hazardous material spills affecting wetlands or waterways; can't discharge any drilling mud into wetlands, waterways or sensitive areas; keep spill response equipment at workspace entry and exit points; and monitor for the introduction and spread in invasive plant species. Enbridge officials issued a statement praising the approval, calling it a 'major step' toward construction that will keep reliable energy flowing to Wisconsin and the Great Lakes region. Bad River tribal officials warned in their own statement Thursday that the project calls for blasting, drilling and digging trenches that would devastate area wetlands and streams and endanger the tribe's wild rice beds. The tribe noted that investigations identified water quality violations and three aquifer breaches related to the Line 3 pipeline's construction in northern Minnesota. 'I'm angry that the DNR has signed off on a half-baked plan that spells disaster for our homeland and our way of life,' Bad River Chairman Robert Blanchard said in the statement. 'We will continue sounding the alarm to prevent yet another Enbridge pipeline from endangering our watershed.' Tribe sues in 2019 Line 5 transports up to 23 million gallons (about 87 million liters) of oil and natural gas daily from Superior, Wisconsin, through Michigan to Sarnia, Ontario. About 19 kilometers (12 miles) of the pipeline run across the Bad River reservation. The tribe sued Enbridge in 2019 to force the company to remove the pipeline from the reservation, arguing that the 71-year-old line is prone to a catastrophic spill and that land easements allowing Enbridge to operate on the reservation expired in 2013. Enbridge has proposed a 66-kilometer (41-mile) reroute around the reservation's southern border. The company has only about two years to complete the project. U.S. District Judge William Conley last year ordered Enbridge to shut down the portion of pipeline crossing the reservation within three years and pay the tribe more than $5 million for trespassing. An Enbridge appeal is pending in a federal appellate court in Chicago. Michigan's Democratic attorney general, Dana Nessel, filed a lawsuit in 2019 seeking to shut down twin portions of Line 5 that run beneath the Straits of Mackinac, the narrow waterways that connect Lake Michigan and Lake Huron. Nessel argued that anchor strikes could rupture the line, resulting in a devastating spill. That lawsuit is still pending in a federal appellate court. Michigan regulators in December approved the company's $500 million plan to encase the portion of the pipeline beneath the straits in a tunnel to mitigate risk. The plan is awaiting approval from the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers.	https://www.voanews.com/a/wisconsin-agency-issues-first-round-of-permits-for-enbridge-line-5-reroute-around-reservation-/7864406.html	2024-11-14T15:39:30-08:00	
China tries to smooth ties with EU as it anticipates shift in US foreign policy	Taipei, Taiwan — China is ramping up efforts to smooth ties with the European Union in the wake of the U.S. elections, with a top Chinese official and state media maintaining that improved ties are in the interest of both Brussels and Beijing. As countries worldwide try to anticipate what President-elect Donald Trump's victory might mean for U.S. foreign policy, analysts say the push by Beijing appears aimed at driving a wedge between the EU and the United States. 'Beijing is trying to exploit current uncertainty regarding the future of transatlantic relations to ensure that the EU distances itself from Washington's increasingly confrontational approach toward China, but it will be difficult [for Beijing] to accomplish [the task,]' said Alicja Bachulska, an expert on Chinese foreign policy at the European Council on Foreign Relations. 'Europe is becoming increasingly aware of the negative impact of China's foreign and industrial policy on the single market and the security of NATO's Eastern flank,' she told VOA in a written response. On November 9, the deputy head of European affairs at the Chinese Foreign Ministry, Cao Lei, said that because Trump's victory could be 'the turning point of our times,' the EU and China should repair divisions and improve bilateral relations. 'No one wants to return to the law of the jungle, no one wants to go back to the era of confrontation and the Cold War, and no one wants to return to unilateral hegemony. This is the backdrop that China-EU relations are facing,' he said at the launch of the China Think-Tank Network on Europe at Beijing Foreign Studies University. Tension rises Some Chinese analysts say the two should restore trust because Europe is more important for China than the United States. 'With Trump returning to the White House, an enhanced China-Europe cooperation will be beneficial for both sides to address [challenges] at the onset of a new era of uncertainties in the world,' Feng Zhongping, the head of European studies at the Chinese Academy of Social Sciences, a Chinese government-affiliated think tank, said at the same event. Meanwhile, Chinese state media outlets are urging the EU to adopt a 'pragmatic approach' to cooperating with China after the bloc decided to increase tariffs on electric vehicles imported from China to as much as 45.3% in October. 'A hardline economic and trade policy stance toward China will only further restrict the EU's maneuvering space in economic cooperation, which will, in turn, exacerbate the EU's economic difficulties,' China's state-run tabloid Global Times wrote in an opinion piece on Wednesday. Those remarks come amid rising trade tension between China and the EU. In response to the bloc's tariffs against Chinese EVs, China announced Monday that it will start imposing temporary anti-dumping measures against imported European brandies on November 15. While the EU and China both claim to have made some progress in the ongoing negotiation to address the EV tariffs last week, Bloomberg reported on Monday that the bloc sees little prospect of a quick deal. Experts say while China hopes to stabilize trade relations with the EU as it prepares for potential tariffs that Trump has vowed to impose on Chinese products once he takes office, Brussels is unlikely to halt its efforts to rebalance trade relations with China. 'What Beijing could potentially expect is to see its divide-and-conquer approach slow down the EU's efforts to implement relevant economic defensive instruments,' Zsuzsa Anna Ferenczy, an expert on EU-China relations at National Dong Hwa University in Taiwan, told VOA by phone. Some European leaders also are becoming more critical of China's close partnership with Russia. Kaja Kallas, the incoming foreign policy chief for the EU, said Beijing should pay 'a higher price' for supporting Russia in the war against Ukraine. 'Without China's support to Russia, Russia would not be able to continue its war with the same force. China needs to also feel a higher cost,' Kallas said during a hearing at the European Parliament on Tuesday. Bachulska said Kallas' comments reflect the growing realization across Europe that 'China is a strategic enabler of Russia,' but the sense of urgency is not evenly distributed across EU member states. 'Some actors are convinced that Beijing should not be further 'antagonized' and that China's geographic distance from Europe makes it less of a threat,' she told VOA, adding that Beijing will try to exploit this narrative. Other experts add that with the security threat posed by Russia, European countries will likely put more effort into maintaining their close alliance with the U.S. rather than trying to adjust the bloc's foreign policy approach toward China. 'The common denominator is that in the European Commission, security issues now seem to take the driving seat so it's hard to imagine Europe not putting a lot of effort into maintaining the transatlantic alliance, and it will be surprising if the EU takes a united front to prioritize relations with China,' Sari Arho Havren, an associate fellow at the Royal United Services Institute, told VOA by phone. Common ground possible, some say While European analysts say the effect of China's attempt to weaken the trans-Atlantic relationship may be limited, some Chinese experts say if Trump imposes high tariffs against products from China and European countries, Beijing and Brussels may find more common ground. 'I think Trump would impose tariffs against both China and the EU, so this may provide both sides an opportunity to reconcile the bilateral relationship,' Zhou Bo, a senior fellow at the Center for International Security and Strategy at Tsinghua University in China, told VOA by phone.	https://www.voanews.com/a/china-urges-eu-to-mend-ties-as-us-foreign-policy-shift-is-anticipated/7864347.html	2024-11-14T14:45:15-08:00

VOA’s Persian Service ‘heartbroken’ at former colleague’s suicide in Tehran	WASHINGTON — VOA’s Persian Service has expressed shock and grief at the suicide of a former colleague, Kianoosh Sanjari, who jumped to his death from a building in Tehran on Wednesday in protest against Iran’s authoritarian rulers. Sanjari, a 42-year-old Iranian, was a former journalist and rights activist who worked at VOA Persian’s Washington bureau from 2009 to 2013 before returning to Iran in 2016 to care for his parents. Sanjari had been jailed in Iran for his activism before and after his work in the United States. He spoke publicly about how he suffered psychological harm from solitary confinement and other ill treatment by Iranian authorities. VOA Persian Service Director Leili Soltani wrote on Instagram that she and her staff are 'heartbroken and deeply affected' by the loss of their former colleague. 'This devastating loss has been extremely difficult and shocking for everyone at VOA Persian, especially for those of us who worked closely with him,' Soltani wrote. 'Kianoosh was only 17 when he was arrested, tortured and kept in solitary confinement. Though he is gone, his passion for freedom and human rights will live on.' VOA Director Michael Abramowitz said he also was 'deeply saddened' to learn of Sanjari’s death. 'Kianoosh, a former VOA journalist & a man who loved his country, suffered imprisonment & faced severe repression from the Iranian regime that ultimately led to his passing. He will be deeply missed,' Abramowitz wrote in a post on the X platform. Responding to a VOA query, a State Department spokesperson said the Biden administration is 'saddened' by Sanjari’s death and expresses condolences to his family. 'His and other recent youth suicides in Iran indicate growing despondence on the part of Iranian youth with a regime that suppresses their most basic human rights,' the spokesperson said in an email. 'We again call for the immediate and unconditional release of all political prisoners detained in Iran without just cause. The Iranian regime’s campaign to silence critics and human rights activists must stop,' the U.S. official said. Sanjari had posted a message on his X account early Wednesday saying he would end his life in protest of the 'dictatorship' of Iranian Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei if judicial authorities did not announce the release of four political prisoners by 7 p.m. that day. No such announcement came. At 7:20 p.m. Wednesday, he made two more posts on his X account, one of them a photograph taken from the terrace of Tehran’s Charsou shopping mall complex showing a bridge and the street beneath him. In the other, Sanjari wrote that he would end his life after the post, in which he also said, 'No one should be imprisoned for expressing their opinions. Protest is the right of every Iranian citizen.' Video posted to social media shortly after Sanjari’s final social media posts showed the body of a man lying on a sidewalk beside the Charsou mall, as onlookers gathered and emergency service personnel arrived at the scene. Informed sources told VOA Persian that the body was that of Sanjari, who had jumped from the terrace to his death. Iranian state news agency IRNA cited Judge Mohammad Shahriari, head of Tehran's Criminal Affairs Prosecutor's Office, as saying he has opened a 'suspicious death' case related to Sanjari. Before visiting the mall, sources told VOA Persian, Sanjari had been at his parents’ Tehran home, where several friends had visited him and believed they had dissuaded him from taking his life. Sanjari’s death as an act of antigovernment protest has drawn expressions of sadness from other rights activists and journalists around the world. 'The Islamic Republic is undoubtedly responsible for this tragic death,' wrote Roya Boroumand, executive director of Abdorrahman Boroumand Center, a U.S.-based group dedicated to the promotion of human rights and democracy in Iran. In a statement sent to VOA, Boroumand said Sanjari was politically active after his release from prison, 'campaigning for others languishing in prison and also against the death penalty.' 'He always held Iran dear in his heart and did not let the brutality of the Islamic Republic and strains of his personal life stop him from fighting against repression. By ending his life and the message he left behind, he reminded us of this bitter reality and condemned his oppressors and those who claim to be ruling on behalf of God,' Boroumand wrote.

Wife of jailed Azerbaijani journalist calls for his release	washington — Nargiz Mukhtarova knew something was wrong when she didn’t hear from her husband. Farid Mehralizada, a journalist and an economist, always texted her to let her know he had arrived at his office in Azerbaijan’s capital, Baku. But on May 30, the text never came. The panic over his whereabouts lasted several hours. Eventually, he arrived at their home, handcuffed and accompanied by about eight police officers, Mukhtarova told VOA. 'I tried to stay calm and not add to his worry. I kept thinking about how many days this would take from our lives and what would happen next,' she said. At the time of her husband’s arrest, she was five months pregnant. 'Now, nearly six months have passed, and he is still not home. He missed the birth of our baby. Our child is now one month old, and her father still hasn’t seen her,' Mukhtarova said. Mehralizada works at the Azerbaijani Service of VOA’s sister outlet Radio Free Europe/Radio Liberty. His case underscores the state of press freedom in Azerbaijan. 'Azerbaijan has long been one of the world’s worst violators of human rights in general and press freedom in particular,' Gulnoza Said, Europe and Central Asia program coordinator at the Committee to Protect Journalists, or CPJ, told VOA. Over the past year alone, Azerbaijani authorities have jailed at least 14 journalists in direct retaliation for their work, according to the New York-based CPJ. Many of the journalists are facing charges of currency smuggling, which media watchdogs have rejected as bogus. Azerbaijani authorities have 'cynically embarked on an unprecedented jailing spree against its brightest and most probing reporters, silencing anyone who could hold the authorities to account,' Said told VOA. On June 1, a Baku court placed Mehralizada under pretrial detention for 'conspiring to smuggle foreign currency' in connection to a case brought against the independent news outlet Abzas Media. Mehralizada and Abzas Media both say he never worked for the outlet. Although Mehralizada’s involvement with Abzas Media was limited to giving expert commentary, several journalists who work at the independent media outlet are among those who have been jailed en masse over the past year. Abzas Media is considered one of the last remaining independent news organizations in Azerbaijan. It is known for its coverage of corruption, including allegations linked to the country’s ruling Aliyev family. In August, a couple months after Mehralizada’s arrest, authorities brought new charges, accusing him of 'illegal entrepreneurship, money laundering, tax evasion and document forgery.' He faces up to 12 years behind bars if convicted of all the charges. RFE/RL has called for Mehralizada’s release. 'We are deeply concerned by his continued imprisonment on false charges,' RFE/RL President Stephen Capus said in an October statement. Mehralizada is one of four RFE/RL journalists currently jailed for their work. The others are Ihar Losik and Andrey Kuznechyk in Belarus, and Vladyslav Yesypenko in Russia-occupied Crimea. RFE/RL rejects the charges against all of them as false. The U.S. Agency for Global Media, which oversees outlets including RFE/RL and VOA, has also rejected the charges against Mehralizada as bogus. 'Journalism is not a crime, yet, as we see in Farid’s case, journalists around the world continue to be persecuted for reporting the truth,' USAGM CEO Amanda Bennett told VOA in a statement. 'The cruelty is abhorrent. It’s time for Farid to return home, and for the unjust persecution against journalists to end.' The Azerbaijani government has targeted RFE/RL’s Azerbaijani Service for years, including shuttering its bureau, blocking its website and using Pegasus spyware to target its reporters. 'Our people, like Farid, do their jobs at great personal risk,' Ilkin Mammadov, director of RFE/RL’s Azerbaijani Service, told VOA. Earlier this week, Vugar Gurbanov, a counselor at Azerbaijan’s embassy in Washington, told VOA in an email that 'Azerbaijan has a vibrant journalism tradition.' 'Understandably, journalism has nothing to do with permissiveness to engage in illegal activities,' Gurbanov added. The embassy did not reply to specific questions about Mehralizada’s case. Almost six months have passed since Mehralizada was arrested, and Mukhtarova says her husband is doing OK. He spends his days reading books, doing crossword puzzles, and finding whatever ways he can to pass the time without his family, she said. The couple is permitted to have one weekly meeting. 'We look forward to it with excitement every Monday,' Mukhtarova said. 'He’s my partner in every sense, sharing both the joys and challenges of life.' Still, she says, it’s 'heartbreaking for both of us' that Mehralizada hasn’t been able to meet their newborn daughter. 'He was so excited about becoming a father, and missing these early moments is incredibly painful for him,' she said. Mehralizada is well-known for his coverage of economic, social and environmental issues in Azerbaijan, according to Mammadov. He is especially skilled at explaining the everyday impact of complicated economic policies to readers, he told VOA. 'What makes him a uniquely talented journalist is his mastery of the art of storytelling,' said Mammadov, who believes Mehralizada was targeted because of his work. 'This is a textbook case of retaliation against a journalist,' Mammadov said. 'It is clear the government’s case against him is a direct attempt to silence his honest reporting.' Mukhtarova agrees. 'Whenever he uncovered something overlooked, he would feel a surge of excitement,' she said. 'Farid had a passion for revealing the truth to people.' Mehralizada is expected to be held in pretrial detention until at least mid-December. Like many journalists jailed in Azerbaijan, his future remains uncertain.	https://www.voanews.com/a/wife-of-jailed-azerbaijani-journalist-calls-for-his-release-/7864374.html	2024-11-14T14:35:42-08:00	
Nigeria launches 'Human Rights Defenders' forum	ABUJA, NIGERIA — The Nigerian National Human Rights Commission on Wednesday inaugurated a forum targeting rights violations in the West African nation. The Human Rights Defenders Forum was held on the sidelines of an NHRC meeting to review the state of human rights in Nigeria. The initiative is a partnership between the NHRC and the European Union. Officials say the forum, comprising various human rights groups, will be responsible for ensuring greater protection of civil liberties in Nigeria and serve as a unified platform for rights defenders to interact and address common challenges. NHRC Executive Director Anthony Ojukwu said, 'We're gathered here not only to discuss the current state of human rights in Nigeria, but also to start to chart a way forward — one that ensures safer protection for civil liberties, fosters democratic consolidation and safeguards the fundamental rights of all Nigerians, especially those who stand up for the rights of others.' The meeting comes amid a recent spate of human rights violations, including a crackdown on antigovernment demonstrations in August and the prolonged detention of minors who took part. The delegates also discussed digital rights, privacy protection, gender-based violence and child abandonment by parents. The NHRC said security forces were contributing to human rights violations in Nigeria. Hilary Ogbonna, a senior adviser to the agency, said, 'The majority of these violators are the Nigerian police, the military, bandits and parents of children. We also saw an upsurge of sexual and gender-based violence. 'But that is not as worrisome as 4,300 [cases of] child abandonment,' he said. The Nigerian police and military have not responded to being named as violators of human rights, but last week, the NHRC found the military culpable for infanticide and extrajudicial killings during a 2016 operation in a remote village in northeastern Borno State. The NHRC also raised concerns about the growing threat of insecurity in Nigeria and its impact on the rights of the people. The commission said it recorded more than 1,700 cases of kidnappings and about 1,500 killings between January and September this year. Damilola Decker, programs officer with the Nigeria-based group Global Rights, said economic vulnerability is one of the reasons that the rights situation is deteriorating. 'What we're observing under the [Nigerian President Bola] Tinubu administration is that civic space is under attack, attacks on journalists, attacks on the rights of people to protest,' Decker said. 'We're also seeing economic and sociocultural rights of Nigerians being impacted majorly because of the harsh economic conditions especially related to energy prices,' he said. 'It's cascading — crime is on the rise; the state of insecurity is on the increase.'	https://www.voanews.com/a/nigeria-launches-human-rights-defenders-forum/7864341.html	2024-11-14T14:03:09-08:00	
Mozambique unrest costing region	cape town, south africa — Southern African Development Community leaders are expected at a coming summit to address the scores of civilian fatalities and injuries that have occurred in Mozambique since the ruling Frelimo party declared Daniel Chapo president with more than 70% of the vote. This week, Venancio Mondlane, leader of the opposition PODEMOS party, called for even more protests against the October 9 election result. Police have used brutal force to crack down on thousands of Mondlane's supporters who have taken to the streets since the announcement in favor of Chapo. Analyst Willem Els of the Institute for Security Studies said Mondlane 'had to flee Mozambique. He’s somewhere in a neighboring country and we suspect that he’s in South Africa because his life is severely in danger.' Els described some of the damage done by pro-Mondlane demonstrators at a border post a week ago. It has since been closed intermittently. 'They burned down the border post as well as immigration and everything on the Ressano-Garcia side at the Lebombo border post with South Africa,' he said. 'They then kept about a thousand trucks that were at Mile Four — where they had to clear customs — at ransom. And what happened then is that they looted some of those trucks and they also burned down at least one of the trucks.' South Africa’s commissioner of the border management authority, Michael Masiapato, said in a statement Thursday, 'We have resumed operations, especially the processing of cargo to the Mozambican side, after they have confirmed to us that the situation has stabilized. And therefore, the corridor is ready to receive the export cargo from the South African side into Maputo.' Masiapato confirmed that officials were also processing people at the border. 'But the majority of the people that we are processing are Mozambicans that are returning back to their country, as well as South Africans that are returning back to South Africa,' he said. 'On that basis we would like to still discourage South Africans from going into Mozambique for holiday purposes primarily because the situation remains volatile.' Cross-border analyst Kage Barnette, who’s an affiliate of the Southern Africa Association of Freight Forwarders, said the unrest was costing the region millions. 'South Africa is one of the largest producers of chrome in the world, so there’s a huge amount of ore that goes along that corridor,' as well as mining equipment, food and fuel, he said. He said the association had been told that the military had been placed along the route. But he said truck drivers were nervous. 'The last thing you want is to potentially be facing a protesting crowd that could potentially not only cause damage to your vehicle but also yourself,' Barnette said. SADC leaders, who have been criticized for taking too long to respond to the crisis, are slated to meet in Harare for five days beginning Saturday, in an extraordinary session to discuss possible solutions. The regional bloc may decide to deploy its panel of elders, comprising former heads of state, to mediate between the government, opposition and all other stakeholders.	https://www.voanews.com/a/mozambique-unrest-costing-region/7864328.html	2024-11-14T13:54:20-08:00	
French military tech used in Sudan, rights group reports	Amnesty International reported that French-manufactured military technology incorporated into armored personnel carriers (APCs) made by the United Arab Emirates is being used in Sudan's civil war, a likely violation of a United Nations arms embargo. In a report posted online Thursday, the human rights organization said it first became aware of the armored vehicles' presence in Sudan in July, when another study revealed what the group described as 'a constant flow of weapons into the country' from several nations, including China, Russia, Serbia, Turkey, the UAE and Yemen. The APCs were part of the flow of weapons that in some cases were taken to Darfur, the scene of heavy fighting in western Sudan. Amnesty International said additional research showed the APCs include sophisticated French-designed and manufactured reactive defense systems. The report said the vehicles are in use by the Rapid Support Forces paramilitary group. The conflict broke out in April 2023 between the Sudanese army and the paramilitary fighters after relations broke down between military leader General Abdel Fattah al-Burhan and RSF chief General Mohamed Hamdan Dagalo. The two generals are former allies who together orchestrated an October 2021 coup that derailed a transition to civilian rule following the 2019 ouster of longtime leader Omar al-Bashir. Amnesty International said the APCs are manufactured by the UAE company Edge Group and are equipped with the French Galix reactive defense system. Amnesty identified the systems in pictures posted on social media after APCs were captured or destroyed by the Sudanese army. The Galix technology is a defense system for land vehicles that release counter measures — decoys, smoke and projectiles — when close-range threats are encountered. In a statement, Amnesty International Secretary-General Agnès Callamard said any use of the French-made weapons technology in Darfur would be a clear breech of the U.N. arms embargo on Sudan. She called on France to ensure the makers of the defense systems immediately stop the supply to UAE manufacturers. Callamard called on all nations to 'immediately cease direct and indirect supplies of all arms and ammunition to the warring parties in Sudan. They must respect and enforce the U.N. Security Council's arms embargo regime on Darfur before even more civilians' lives are lost. ' The U.N. arms embargo is part of a series of sanctions that include asset freezes and travel bans imposed against Sudan for systematic human rights abuses by both the RSF and the Sudanese Armed Forces against the people of Darfur. Some information for this report was provided by The Associated Press and Reuters.	https://www.voanews.com/a/french-military-tech-used-in-sudan-rights-group-reports-/7864300.html	2024-11-14T13:53:01-08:00	
Trump taps senator, former rival Marco Rubio as his top diplomat	WASHINGTON — President-elect Donald Trump’s choice to serve as the next U.S. secretary of state is Marco Rubio, a Florida Republican who has been in the Senate since 2011 and serves on the chamber’s foreign relations and intelligence committees. Trump, in a statement Wednesday, called Rubio a highly respected leader and a very powerful voice for freedom who 'will be a strong Advocate for our Nation, a true friend to our Allies, and a fearless Warrior who will never back down to our adversaries.' Rubio, vice chairman of the Senate Select Committee on Intelligence and a senior member of the Committee on Foreign Relations, is regarded as intelligent, ambitious and well-liked by Senate colleagues of both parties. If Rubio, who is 53 and the son of Cuban immigrants, is confirmed by his Senate colleagues, he would become the first Latino secretary of state. In that role, he would be tasked with helping to implement Trump’s 'America First' foreign policy. After Russia’s full-scale invasion of Ukraine in 2022, Rubio was a vocal supporter of Kyiv. More recently, he has called for negotiations to end the conflict and voted in April against a $95 billion military aid package for the Ukrainians. Rubio is a strong supporter of Israel, in line with Trump’s stance. He has exhibited a tough stance toward authoritarian regimes in Cuba, Nicaragua and Venezuela, as well as toward the communist leadership in Beijing. In response, China has banned the senator from entering the country — something that likely will change if Rubio is confirmed as secretary of state. Some leading Democrats in Congress, who will be the opposition party in January, are making positive comments about the Republican. 'I've got a good relationship with Marco, and I think Marco is very capable,' Democratic Senator Mark Kelly, who has served on the intelligence committee with Rubio, told VOA after Rubio’s name was circulated in media reports. On social media, Democratic Senator John Fetterman called Rubio 'a strong choice,' adding that he looks forward to voting for his confirmation. 'Compared to some of the other names that were floating around, people who really don't have any experience in foreign policy, I think this is a pretty good one,' former Republican Congressman Adam Kinzinger said on CNN before Trump’s official announcement. In choosing members for his Cabinet and senior White House staff, Trump is generally emphasizing loyalty rather than experience. Rubio campaigned for Trump during this year’s presidential election. The two had been rivals in the Republican presidential primary eight years ago. Trump had repeatedly belittled the senator, while Rubio questioned the New York real estate investor’s qualification for the presidency, calling Trump 'a con man,' deemed him dangerous and someone who could not be trusted with the launch codes for nuclear weapons. After Trump won the party’s nomination and the presidency, the relationship warmed. But Rubio did not side with Trump when he refused to accept defeat at the hands of Democratic Party candidate Joe Biden four years ago. After Trump’s supporters stormed the U.S. Capitol on Jan. 6, 2021, Rubio condemned the violence, calling the attackers 'unpatriotic' and 'un-American' 'low-lives.' Earlier this year, Trump considered Rubio, a behind-the-scenes campaign foreign policy adviser, as his running mate before selecting Republican Senator JD Vance. Should Rubio take the job, he would have to vacate his Senate seat. A successor would then be selected by Florida Governor Ron DeSantis. Among the candidates being promoted by influential Republicans for the Senate seat is Lara Trump, co-chair of the Republican National Committee and Trump’s daughter-in-law.

Reporters Without Borders sues X	Washington — The press freedom group Reporters Without Borders on Thursday announced that it is suing the social media company X, accusing it of spreading disinformation. After Reporters Without Borders, or RSF, discovered that it was the target of a disinformation campaign this past summer, the Paris-based group filed 10 reports of policy violations with X, formerly known as Twitter. Since none of the posts in question have been removed, RSF opted to sue the company in French courts 'for its complicity in disseminating false information, misrepresentation and identity theft,' the group said in a statement. 'Is X’s deliberate unwillingness to fight disinformation punishable by law? Does it make the company complicit in the pollution of public debate?' the statement said. 'With the new case brought forth by RSF, the French courts now have the opportunity to address these pressing questions, establish X’s legal obligations and hold it to account.' The case concerns a late August video that RSF said it found, falsely labeled as from the BBC, claiming RSF produced a report on Nazi beliefs in Ukraine’s military. The video used RSF’s logo and photos of the group’s advocacy director, and it reached nearly half a million views by mid-September, mainly on X and Telegram, RSF said. The press freedom group later determined that the Russian government was behind the fake video. RSF filed several reports with X about the fake video, but the social media platform did not remove any of the posts in question, RSF said. 'X’s refusal to remove content that it knows is false and deceitful — as it was duly informed by RSF — makes it complicit in the spread of the disinformation circulating on its platform,' RSF’s advocacy director Antoine Bernard said in a statement. 'X provides those who spread falsehoods and manipulate public opinion with a powerful arsenal of tools and unparalleled visibility, while granting the perpetrators total impunity,' Bernard added. Emmanuel Daoud, an attorney representing RSF, said in a statement that the lawsuit seeks to remind X and its executives that they can be held criminally responsible 'if they knowingly provide a platform and tools for disseminating false information, identity theft, misrepresentation, and defamation — offenses punishable under the French Penal Code.' RSF’s lawsuit comes after several French news outlets sued X earlier this week for allegedly running their content without payment. That lawsuit was filed by top French outlets including Le Monde, Le Figaro, Les Echos, and several others. They’re accusing X of violating so-called neighboring rights, which under French law are due when social media platforms republish news content. X did not immediately reply to VOA’s request for comment. The social media platform is owned by tech billionaire Elon Musk, who campaigned for U.S. President-elect Donald Trump. On Tuesday, Trump announced that Musk would co-chair, with fellow billionaire and former Republican presidential candidate Vivek Ramaswamy, a new Department of Government Efficiency in the Trump administration.	https://www.voanews.com/a/reporters-without-borders-sues-x/7864293.html	2024-11-14T13:19:24-08:00	
Lawmakers stage Maori protest in New Zealand's parliament during fraught race relations debate	wellington, new zealand — A vote in New Zealand’s parliament was suspended and two lawmakers ejected on Thursday when dramatic political theater erupted over a controversial proposed law redefining the country’s founding agreement between Indigenous Maori and the British Crown. Under the principles laid out in the 1840 Treaty of Waitangi, which guide the relationship between the government and Maori, tribes were promised broad rights to retain their lands and protect their interests in return for ceding governance to the British. The bill would specify that those rights should apply to all New Zealanders. The bill has scant support and is unlikely to become law. Detractors say it threatens racial discord and constitutional upheaval, while thousands of New Zealanders are traveling the length of the country this week to protest it. Despite its unpopularity, however, the proposed law passed its first vote on Thursday after dominating public discussion for months, due to a quirk of New Zealand’s political system that allows tiny parties to negotiate outsized influence for their agendas. It also reflects unease among some New Zealanders about more rapid progress in recent years toward upholding the promises made to Maori when the country was colonized. 184-year-old treaty provokes fresh debate For decades after the Treaty of Waitangi was signed, differences between the English and Maori texts and breaches by New Zealand governments intensified the disenfranchisement of Maori. By the middle of the 20th century, Indigenous language and culture had dwindled, much tribal land was confiscated and the Maori were disadvantaged on every metric. As the Indigenous protest movement surged in the 1970s, lawmakers and the courts slowly began to elucidate what it understood the treaty to promise Maori: partnership with the Crown, participation in decision-making and protection of their interests. 'What all of these principles have in common is that they afford Maori different rights from other New Zealanders,' David Seymour, leader of minor libertarian party ACT and the bill’s author, said Thursday. To those who have championed the treaty, that is the point. Work has involved billion-dollar land settlements, embrace of the Maori language, guaranteed representation in central and local government and attempts through policy to reverse the stark inequities Indigenous people still face. But Seymour – who is Maori – said no law or court had actually settled for good a definition of the treaty’s principles, and that had caused division. His bill filled 'a silence this parliament has left for five decades,' he said. Lawmakers vote for bill they oppose Prime Minister Christopher Luxon disagrees, though his party voted for the bill Thursday to fulfil the political deal with Seymour that handed Luxon power. Without enough seats to govern after last October's election, Luxon curried support from two minor parties – including Seymour's ACT, which won less than 9% of the vote – in return for political concessions. Luxon told Seymour his party would vote for the treaty bill once, while promising publicly that it would go no further. The treaty’s principles had been negotiated and debated for 184 years, Luxon told reporters Thursday, and it was 'simplistic' for Seymour to suggest that they could be resolved 'through the stroke of a pen.' Government lawmakers made awkward speeches in parliament explaining that they opposed the bill before voting for it to jeers from opponents, who demanded they break ranks. Luxon was spared that; he left the country for the meeting of leaders from the Asia-Pacific APEC bloc hours before the vote. His political horse-trading drew scorn from opposition lawmakers. Fraught, outraged response 'Shame! Shame! Shame on you, David Seymour,' roared Willie Jackson, a veteran Maori lawmaker. 'Shame on you for what you’re trying to do to this nation.' Jackson was thrown out of the debating chamber by Speaker Gerry Brownlee for calling Seymour a liar. 'You are complicit in the harm and the division that this presents,' said Rawiri Waititi, a lawmaker from Te Pāti Maori, an Indigenous group, speaking to all who advanced the bill. 'If you vote for this bill, this is who you are,' Green party leader Chloe Swarbrick told Luxon's lawmakers. No one deviated from their planned votes and the bill passed. But not before one final flashpoint. Rare outburst When asked how her party’s lawmakers would vote, Hana-Rawhiti Maipi-Clarke of Te Pāti Maori stood and began a ringing haka – a rhythmic Maori chant of challenge – which swelled to a roar as first opposition lawmakers, and then spectators in the public gallery, joined in. An irate Brownlee was unable to quiet the fracas as opponents approached Seymour’s seat. The live broadcast of Parliament’s proceedings was cut and Brownlee ordered the public be removed before the vote resumed. He suspended Maipi-Clarke, 22, from Parliament for a day. The bill will proceed to a public submission process before another vote. Seymour hopes for an outpouring of support to change Luxon's mind about vetoing it. The proposal will shortly roil Parliament again. Thousands of protesters are due to arrive in the capital, Wellington, on Tuesday for what is likely to be one of the largest race relations marches in New Zealand’s history.	https://www.voanews.com/a/lawmakers-stage-maori-protest-in-new-zealand-s-parliament-during-fraught-race-relations-debate-/7864254.html	2024-11-14T12:41:25-08:00

Israeli airstrikes hit Damascus area, killing 15, Syrian state media say	DAMASCUS, SYRIA — Israel carried out at least two airstrikes on a western neighborhood of Damascus and one of the capital's suburbs on Thursday, killing at least 15 people and wounding 16, Syria's state news agency said. The airstrikes on the Mazzeh neighborhood in Damascus and the suburb of Qudsaya, northwest of the capital, struck two buildings, the SANA news agency said. An Associated Press journalist at the scene in Mazzeh said that a five-story building was damaged by a missile that hit the basement. The Israeli military said it hit infrastructure sites and command centers of the Islamic Jihad militant group in Syria and 'inflicted significant damage to the terrorist organization's command center and to its operatives.' The airstrikes in Damascus and the nearby suburb came shortly before Ali Larijani, an adviser to Iranian supreme leader Ali Khamenei, was scheduled to meet in the Syrian capital with representatives of Palestinian factions at the Iranian Embassy in Mazzeh. The Israeli military said Islamic Jihad participated alongside Hamas, the Palestinian militant group in the Gaza Strip, in the October 7, 2023, attacks on southern Israel that killed some 1,200 people — mostly civilians — and saw 250 others abducted into Gaza. The military 'will continue to operate against the Islamic Jihad terrorist organization wherever necessary,' it said. Israel's retaliation to the October 7 attack and the ensuing Israel-Hamas war has spilled into the wider region, affecting Lebanon and Syria and leading to strikes between Israel and Iran. The war has left much of Gaza in ruins and has killed over 43,000 Palestinians, mostly women and children, according to local health authorities who do not distinguish between civilians and combatants. An official with the Palestinian Islamic Jihad Group said that the strike in Mazzeh targeted one of their offices, and that several members of the group were killed. The official spoke on condition of anonymity because he wasn't authorized to speak to the media. Syria's state news agency, SANA, said that the country's air defenses were activated against a 'hostile target' south of the central city of Homs. It gave no further details. Tehran has been a main backer of Syrian President Bashar Assad's government since a 2011 uprising turned into a full-blown civil war and has played an instrumental role in turning the tide of the conflict in his favor. Iran has sent scores of military advisers and thousands of Iran-backed fighters from around the Middle East to Syria to fight on Assad's side. Tehran has also been an economic lifeline for Assad, sending fuel and credit lines worth billions of dollars. Israel has carried out hundreds of airstrikes in Syria targeting members of neighboring Lebanon's Hezbollah and officials from Iranian-backed groups. Hezbollah began firing into Israel on October 8, 2023, in solidarity with Hamas in Gaza. Since then, more than 3,200 people have been killed in Lebanon and more than 14,200 wounded, the country's Health Ministry reported. In Israel, 76 people have been killed, including 31 soldiers. In Lebanon Lebanon's state media said an Israeli airstrike Thursday hit a building in Baalbek city in eastern Lebanon, killing at least nine people and wounding five others. The strike on Baalbek came without warning. The Israeli military did not immediately comment and the target was not clear. Israeli warplanes intensified airstrikes on Thursday, targeting various areas in southern and eastern Lebanon, including the outskirts of the southern port city of Tyre city and the Nabatieh province, the National News Agency said. Throughout the day, sporadic airstrikes targeted Beirut's southern suburbs in a clear uptick in attacks on the area over the past two days, with the Israeli army issuing evacuation warnings for several locations and buildings in the suburbs. The Israeli military said it carried out strikes on Hezbollah targets in the Dahiyeh area, including weapons storage facilities and command centers. Lebanon's Health Ministry said the death toll in Lebanon since the war began on October 8, 2023, has reached 3,365 while those wounded are 14,344. Nearly 1.2 million people have been displaced. Before the war intensified on September 23, Hezbollah said that it had lost nearly 500 members, The group has stopped releasing statements about their killed fighters since. UN peacekeeping forces United Nations peacekeeping chief Jean-Pierre Lacroix, speaking during a visit to Lebanon, said the U.N. remains committed to keeping its peacekeeping force, known as UNIFIL, in place in all its positions in southern Lebanon, despite intense ongoing battles between Israeli forces and Hezbollah militants. UNIFIL has continued to monitor the escalating conflict between Israel and Hezbollah across the boundary, known as the Blue Line, despite Israeli calls for peacekeepers to pull back 5 kilometers (3 miles) from the border. UNIFIL has accused Israel of deliberately destroying observation equipment, and 13 peacekeepers have been injured in the fighting. Lacroix visited some of the wounded peacekeepers during his trip. UNIFIL forces 'continue to be deployed in all the positions, and we think it is very important to preserve that presence everywhere,' LaCroix said. '... Had we vacated some of the positions, then that would have certainly jeopardized the capacity for UNIFIL to continue today, but probably even more importantly, that would have significantly undermined the capacity for UNIFIL to play a role, tomorrow, when the cessation of hostilities takes place - hopefully sooner than later.' Lacroix said there is still a 'large consensus that resolution 1701 remains the critical framework for settlement,' referring to the U.N. Security Council resolution that ended the brutal monthlong war between Israel and Hezbollah in 2006 but which has never been fully implemented by either party.	https://www.voanews.com/a/israeli-airstrikes-hit-damascus-area-killing-15-syrian-state-media-say/7863979.html	2024-11-14T09:37:03-08:00	
Trial begins for Russian accused of sending military video to Ukraine	MOSCOW — A Russian man went on trial Thursday on charges of high treason for a video he allegedly sent to Ukraine's security services, the latest in a growing series of espionage cases involving the conflict. The Volgograd District Court began hearing a new case against Nikita Zhuravel, who is currently serving a 3½-year sentence for burning a Quran in front of a mosque. The new charges are based on allegations that Zhuravel filmed a trainload of military equipment and warplanes in 2023 and sent the video to a representative of Ukraine's security agency. He could be sentenced to life in prison if convicted. Rights activists say Zhuravel is a political prisoner who was beaten while in custody. While in pretrial custody before his first sentence, Zhuravel was beaten by the 15-year-old son of Ramzan Kadyrov, the Kremlin-appointed strongman leader of the mostly Muslim region of Chechnya. The elder Kadyrov posted the video on social media and praised his son, causing public outrage. He later awarded his son with the medal of 'Hero of the Republic of Chechnya.' Federal authorities have refrained from any criticism of the Chechen strongman. Separately, a military court on Thursday sentenced to 24 years in prison a man convicted of treason and terrorism for setting fire to a military recruitment office in Moscow. Prosecutors said Sergei Andreev committed the November 2023 attack on instructions from the Ukrainian special services that he received on a messaging app. Treason and espionage cases have skyrocketed after President Vladimir Putin sent troops into Ukraine in February 2022. The cases have targeted a wide range of suspects, from Kremlin critics and independent journalists to scientists, drawing attention from rights groups. The legal definition of treason has been expanded to include providing vaguely defined 'assistance' to foreign countries or organizations, effectively exposing to prosecution anyone in contact with foreigners.	https://www.voanews.com/a/trial-begins-for-russian-accused-of-sending-video-of-military-equipment-to-ukraine/7863945.html	2024-11-14T09:08:43-08:00	
Is Europe ready for year-end cutoff of Russian gas via Ukraine?	On the first day of 2025, Ukraine’s contract with Russian state-owned Gazprom will expire, shutting down a major Russian natural gas pathway to Europe. Although the Kremlin says it is ready to continue the transit deal, urging Europeans to persuade Ukraine to extend the contract, Kyiv has said it won’t budge. Russian natural gas supplies were a cornerstone of European energy security before Moscow’s February 2022 invasion, when it temporarily cut off 80 billion cubic meters of gas supplies to the continent in response to sanctions and a payment dispute. The cut-off dealt a major blow to Europe’s economy that remains palpable in 2024, according to an International Monetary Fund analysis. Since 2021, however, Europe has secured alternative suppliers for natural gas, with Russian imports via Ukraine dropping from 11% to 5%, according to Rystad Energy, an Oslo-based energy analysis firm. Observers say some EU countries have taken the issue more seriously than others. Germany and the Czech Republic, for example, have invested heavily in liquefied natural gas (LNG) terminals in record time, said Olga Khakova, deputy director for European energy security at the Washington-based Atlantic Council. 'A lot of landlocked countries, like Czech Republic, have gone out of their way to look at alternative supplies and invested in alternative options,' she told VOA. Others, like Hungary, have doubled down on their reliance on Russia, while Slovakia and Austria have increased Russian imports. Those countries, said Khakova, 'will have to live with this decision,' explaining that they’ll need to secure alternative routes. Turkey, for example, offers the only other operational pipeline for Europe-bound Russian energy. Although some European nations would prefer to maintain Russian gas deliveries via Ukraine, it's 'a difficult sell for the EU,' said Christoph Halser, Rystad’s gas and LNG analyst. He expressed confidence in Europe’s political will and supply chain logistics to forfeit dependence on Ukraine’s pipelines for Russian gas. Other analysts argue that the EU should do more to send a clear signal to companies that cheap Russian gas will no longer be available. With enforceable goals from the EU for phasing out Russian pipeline gas, companies will invest in competing projects to supply reliable European customers, Khakova said. LNG to compensate? Although Russia’s pipeline exports to Europe have decreased, Moscow has compensated for some of the shortfall with LNG deliveries via sea, road and rail, seeing the overall share of European LNG imports increase from 15% to 19%. Rystad’s Halser, however, calls further expansion unlikely, given Western sanctions against Russia. 'To further increase, and to compensate for the set of pipelines, is not possible with current infrastructure,' he told VOA. 'New unsanctioned projects on the Russian side would be necessary.' Growing LNG deliveries from the United States could replace Russian gas, which European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen said she brought up with U.S. President-elect Donald Trump during a phone call late last week. 'LNG is one of the topics that we touched upon — I would not say discussed,' she told reporters in Budapest, according to Agence France-Presse. 'We still get a whole lot of LNG via Russia, from Russia. ... Why not replace it with American LNG, which is cheaper and brings down our energy prices.' Will Ukraine’s pipeline be empty? Ending the transit of Russian gas to Europe poses some difficult questions for Ukraine. With the contract’s termination imminent, Khakova and other analysts say Russia feels emboldened to attack Ukraine’s natural gas system, adding to Ukraine’s concerns this winter over how to protect the country’s energy infrastructure. Some observers say Ukraine may not find another commercial use for its dormant infrastructure. Bloomberg reported late last month that European buyers were in talks with Azerbaijan on a deal that would, through a swap arrangement, effectively deliver Azeri-branded gas to Europe though the Russia-Ukraine pipeline network. Subsequent reports, however, indicate that no deal has been reached, and Oleksiy Chernyshov, head of state-owned Naftogaz — Ukraine’s largest oil and gas company — told reporters last week that there is no alternative to halting the delivery of Russian gas via Ukrainian pipelines. Any arrangement short of completely halting the transit of gas across Ukraine would send a negative signal to Europe, said Aura Sabadus of the London-based Independent Commodity Intelligence Services. 'If Ukraine allows for this gas to flow from 2025 onwards, even if it's sold under a different label — let's say Azeri gas — other countries might come around and say, ‘well, if Ukraine is doing it, why can't we do it?’' she told VOA. Sabadus said industrial consumers in Germany, for example, could then increase pressure to resume gas flows via the Nord Stream network of offshore natural gas pipelines beneath the Baltic Sea, which stretch from Russia to Germany and were the target of apparently deliberate underwater explosions in September 2022. But Rystad’s Halser finds it unlikely that a short-term transitional deal to keep the natural gas flowing across Ukraine would prompt demands to reopen Nord Stream. 'There is no political consensus in Germany for taking Russian gas in the near future,' he said, adding that an agreement with a third party to deliver gas across Ukraine might benefit all sides involved and bolster commercial interest in Ukraine’s pipeline system.	https://www.voanews.com/a/is-europe-ready-for-year-end-cutoff-of-russian-gas-via-ukraine/7863919.html	2024-11-14T08:53:02-08:00	
Pacific atolls face risk from rising seas	A study by the World Bank on Thursday said urgent action is needed to address rising sea levels in the Pacific atoll islands of Kiribati, the Marshall Islands and Tuvalu, which under current projections could be 50% to 80% submerged in the next 50 years. The World Bank’s 'Pacific Atoll Countries Country Climate and Development Report' says the low-lying nations and the roughly 200,000 people who live on them face some of the most severe existential threats from climate change of any region in the world. The study cites projected sea level rises of up to a half meter in the last half of this century and suggests 50% to 80% of major urban areas in the countries could be underwater. The region is already seeing annual losses from climate events — such as more frequent and powerful storms — equivalent to 7% of the total economic output in Tuvalu. About 3% to 4% of output in the Marshall Islands and Kiribati are projected to increase. The bank said that without urgent global and local action, a 1-in-20-year climate event in Tuvalu could lead to damage and losses equivalent to 50% of current annual output by 2050. The study makes near-, medium- and long-term recommendations for the island nations. The near- and medium-term suggestions include investments in sustainable construction to protect freshwater resources, fisheries and energy supplies, among other crucial infrastructure. The study’s long-term suggestions include investments in education, legal and regulatory frameworks, economic development and climate resilience. The study also called on the international donor community to make contributions to the Pacific atoll countries, which still face a significant climate funding gap. The World Bank produces diagnostic country climate and development reports, CCDRs, that integrate climate change and development considerations and suggest concrete actions that countries can take to mitigate and adapt to climate change. The bank has completed over 45 CCDRs around the world as of October 2024.	https://www.voanews.com/a/pacific-atolls-face-risk-from-rising-seas/7863887.html	2024-11-14T08:39:55-08:00	
Scientists say toxic smog choking Pakistan will get worse	Pakistanis are choking on toxic air.

EU fines Meta $840 million over abusive practices benefiting Facebook Marketplace	Brussels — The European Commission on Thursday fined Meta Platforms $840.24 million over abusive practices benefiting Facebook Marketplace, it said in a statement, confirming an earlier report by Reuters. 'The European Commission has fined Meta ... for breaching EU antitrust rules by tying its online classified ads service Facebook Marketplace to its personal social network Facebook and by imposing unfair trading conditions on other online classified ads service providers,' the European Commission said. Meta said it will appeal the decision, but in the meantime, it will comply and will work quickly and constructively to launch a solution which addresses the points raised. The move by the European Commission comes two years after it accused the U.S. tech giant of giving its classified ads service Facebook Marketplace an unfair advantage by bundling the two services together. The European Union opened formal proceedings into possible anticompetitive conduct of Facebook in June, 2021, and in December, 2022, raised concerns that Meta ties its dominant social network Facebook to its online classified ad services. Facebook launched Marketplace in 2016 and expanded into several European countries a year later. The EU decision argues that Meta imposes Facebook Marketplace on people who use Facebook in an illegal 'tie' but Meta said that argument ignores the fact that Facebook users can choose whether to engage with Marketplace, and many do not. Meta said the Commission claimed that Marketplace had the potential to hinder the growth of large incumbent online marketplaces in the EU but could not find any evidence of harm to competitors. Companies risk fines of as much as 10% of their global turnover for EU antitrust violations.	https://www.voanews.com/a/eu-fines-meta-840-million-over-abusive-practices-benefiting-facebook-marketplace/7863767.html	2024-11-14T07:20:46-08:00	
Foreign acquisition of US Steel faces cooler temperatures after presidential election	Before the U.S. presidential election, President Joe Biden and former President Donald Trump opposed a Japanese company’s planned $14 billion purchase of U.S. Steel, a once-iconic pillar of America’s industrial age.

Satirical news site The Onion buys Alex Jones' Infowars with help from Sandy Hook families	The satirical news publication The Onion won the bidding for Alex Jones' Infowars at a bankruptcy auction, backed by families of Sandy Hook Elementary School shooting victims whom Jones owes more than $1 billion in defamation judgments for calling the massacre a hoax, the families announced Thursday. 'The dissolution of Alex Jones' assets and the death of Infowars is the justice we have long awaited and fought for,' Robbie Parker, whose daughter Emilie was killed in the 2012 shooting in Connecticut, said in a statement provided by his lawyers. The sale price was not immediately disclosed. Jones confirmed The Onion's acquisition of Infowars in a social media video Thursday and said he planned to file legal challenges to stop it. An email message seeking comment was sent to Infowars. It was not immediately clear what The Onion planned to do with the conspiracy theory platform, including its website, social media accounts, studio in Austin, Texas, trademarks and video archive. The Chicago-based Onion did not immediately return emails seeking comment Thursday. Sealed bids for the private auction were opened Wednesday. Both supporters and detractors of Jones had expressed interest in buying Infowars. The other bidders have not been disclosed. The Onion, a satirical site that manages to persuade people to believe the absurd, bills itself as 'the world's leading news publication, offering highly acclaimed, universally revered coverage of breaking national, international, and local news events' and says it has 4.3 trillion daily readers. Jones has been saying on his show that if his detractors bought Infowars, he would move his daily broadcasts and product sales to a new studio, websites and social media accounts that he has already set up. He also said that if his supporters won the bidding, he could stay on the Infowars platforms. Relatives of many of the 20 children and six educators killed in the shooting Jones and his company for defamation and emotional distress for repeatedly saying on his show that the shooting in Newtown, Connecticut, was a hoax staged by crisis actors to spur more gun control. Parents and children of many of the victims testified that they were traumatized by Jones' conspiracies and threats by his followers. The lawsuits were filed in Connecticut and Texas. Lawyers for the families in the Connecticut lawsuit said they worked with The Onion to try to acquire Infowars.	https://www.voanews.com/a/satirical-news-site-the-onion-buys-alex-jones-infowars-with-help-from-sandy-hook-families-/7863746.html	2024-11-14T06:41:22-08:00	
WHO links forced Afghan repatriation from Pakistan to polio resurgence	Islamabad — The World Health Organization has labeled a forced repatriation of Afghan nationals from Pakistan as a 'major setback' for polio eradication efforts, contributing to the regional resurgence of the paralytic disease. Pakistan and neighboring Afghanistan are the only two polio-endemic nations, reporting 49 and 23 cases respectively, so far this year, up from only six cases each in 2023. The latest case in Pakistan was confirmed Thursday in the southwestern province of Balochistan, which sits on the Afghan border and accounts for half the cases reported in 2024. 'Until you get rid of polio completely, it will resurge and come back, and this is what we are seeing now in Pakistan [where] nearly half of the districts are infected, and in Afghanistan, a third of the provinces are infected,' Hamid Jafari, the WHO director for the Eastern Mediterranean, said Wednesday while discussing causes of polio resurgence in both countries. 'I think the major setback was a forced repatriation of Afghan nationals that led to a massive and unpredictable movement of populations within Pakistan and across both borders and within Afghanistan, so the virus moved with these populations,' Jafari told the virtual discussion hosted by the Global Polio Eradication Initiative, or GPEI. The United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees has said that Pakistan's crackdown on undocumented foreign nationals has resulted in more than 730,000 Afghan migrants returning to Afghanistan since August 2023. Jafari also mentioned other factors contributing to the rise of polio in Pakistan, including authorities' inability to consistently carry out vaccination campaigns in areas affected by militancy, where children cannot be effectively immunized against the crippling disease. He also highlighted the presence of 'significant vaccine hesitancy and community boycotts' rooted in public frustration over the lack of essential services in impoverished districts. Pakistani and WHO officials say vaccine boycotts in some regions also result from the false propaganda that anti-polio campaigns are a Western plot to sterilize Muslim children. Additionally, anti-government militants in violence-hit regions occasionally stage deadly attacks on polio teams, suspecting them of spying for authorities, routinely disrupting vaccination drives in districts near the Afghan border. Afghan polio ban While sharing the latest polio situation in Afghanistan, the senior WHO official stated they are collaborating with various humanitarian actors and partners to promote vaccination against polio and all other diseases. 'We cannot implement house-to-house vaccination,' Jafari stated, referencing the ban imposed by Taliban authorities on polio teams over security concerns. 'The program is working closely with [Taliban] authorities to re-update micro plans and work closely with the communities and local officials to make sure children are mobilized to vaccination sites,' he added. In September, the Taliban abruptly halted house-to-house vaccine deliveries in parts of southern Afghanistan, including Kandahar, without publicly stating any reason. An independent monitoring board of the GPEI recently said that the Taliban’s action had stemmed from their 'administration’s concerns about covert surveillance activities.' The report quoted de facto Afghan authorities as explaining that their leadership is living in Kandahar and has concerns about their security. Jafari stated that Pakistan and Afghanistan are taking measures to address the challenges in their bid 'to rebuild community confidence' and work closely with security agencies in both countries to be able to access all children. He cautioned that the current resurgence of polio in Pakistan and Afghanistan does not guarantee a low point next year. 'We are confident that we will come very close to elimination, but the key is to make sure that in these final safe havens for poliovirus in insecure areas, among migrant and mobile populations, and vaccine-hesitant communities, we can finally overcome these residual challenges to make sure that finally polio is eradicated,' the regional WHO director said. Polio once paralyzed an estimated 20,000 children in Pakistan each year until the country initiated national vaccination campaigns in the 1990s to control the infections, according to the WHO. In 2019, there were 176 reported cases in Pakistan and Afghanistan. In 2021 and 2022, however, the countries reported only one and two infections, respectively.	https://www.voanews.com/a/who-links-forced-afghan-repatriation-from-pakistan-to-polio-resurgence/7863709.html	2024-11-14T06:26:59-08:00	
EU parliament loosens delayed anti-deforestation rules	The European Parliament on Thursday approved a one-year delay on implementing the bloc's landmark anti-deforestation rules, while also voting to loosen some requirements of the controversial law. The move triggered an outcry from environmental groups, which had hailed the law as an unprecedented breakthrough in the fight to protect nature and combat climate change. Parliament was called to sign off on a delay requested by the European Commission following pressure from trading partners such as Brazil and the United States, and some member states including Germany. But lawmakers on the right used the vote to bring new amendments, passed with support from right-wing and far-right groups. This de facto restarted the legislative process, as the new text should now be re-discussed by the commission and member states -- creating further uncertainty over its implementation. The legislation would prohibit a vast range of goods -- from coffee to cocoa, soy, timber, palm oil, cattle, printing paper and rubber -- if produced using land that was deforested after December 2020. Exporting countries considered high-risk would have at least nine percent of products sent to the EU subjected to checks, with the proportion falling for lower-risk ones. Among the amendments introduced Thursday was the creation of a 'no risk' category that would see products from some countries -- such as Germany -- face virtually no scrutiny. Julia Christian, a campaigner at environmental group Fern, said it was the equivalent of giving 'EU forested countries a free pass.' 'The message to the rest of the world is unmistakable: you must stop destroying your forests, but the EU won't end the widespread degradation afflicting its forests,' she said.	https://www.voanews.com/a/eu-parliament-loosens-delayed-anti-deforestation-rules/7863590.html	2024-11-14T04:17:04-08:00	
Sri Lankan president hopes to ramp up support in Parliamentary elections	New Delhi — Millions of Sri Lankans voted Thursday to choose a new parliament in a key election that will decide if the country’s new leftist president gets the mandate to push ahead with his agenda of improving lives for millions of people struggling with an economic downturn and stamping out corruption. President Anura Kumara Dissanayake swept to power in September on his promise of systemic change in a country where public anger with mainstream political parties has been running high since the country’s crushing economic collapse two years ago. Hoping to build on the widespread support he secured in the presidential election, he dissolved parliament and ordered snap polls about a year ahead of schedule. Dissanayake’s party, a fringe group, held only three seats in the 225-member parliament. His coalition, the National People’s Power (NPP) is likely to win a majority, according to political analysts. 'Normally in this country the presidential winner gets enough parliamentary backing to enable him to govern,' Paikiasothy Saravanamuttu, Executive Director of the Center for Policy Alternatives in Colombo, told VOA. 'Getting to the half-way mark, that is 113 seats, is crucial because he needs a majority to implement his program.' About 17 million people were eligible to choose from about 8,800 candidates. Many of the candidates contesting from the NPP are newcomers to politics. Some analysts say that is an advantage because they are not tainted by corruption in a country that has rejected traditional parties, blaming established politicians for a corrupt culture. Others point out that because they are mostly unknown faces, much will depend on whether President Dissanayake, a charismatic leader, was able to convince voters to back them. 'Parliament needs more NPP members to establish a strong government which will eliminate bribery and corruption,' the Sri Lankan leader said in his final public meeting before the polls. Although Dissanayake was a member of parliament for 25 years, his party, the JVP or People’s Liberation Front, was a fringe group on the margins of Sri Lanka’s politics. In the runup to the presidential polls, the 55-year-old leader put together a coalition that consists of members of his party, professionals, civil society organizations, women and youth groups. Public expectations in the country ran high as people headed out to vote on Thursday. Melanie Gunathilaka, a Colombo resident, who voted soon after polls opened, said she is optimistic the elections will pave the way for the change that many Sri Lankans are yearning for. 'There was a lot of resentment among people like us about the misuse of state funds and mismanagement by the established parties,' she told VOA. 'We hope the new government will reflect a political culture that is rooted in transparency and accountability.' The main challenger to Dissanayake’s coalition NPP, is the Samagi Jana Balawegaya, led by opposition leader Sajith Premadasa. The New Democratic Front (NDF), backed by former president Ranil Wickremesinghe, is also in the fray. But the opposition campaign in the runup to the parliamentary polls was low-key. 'The opposition is in disarray, so the sense of a contest is not there. Only the NPP has held big rallies,' according to Saravanamuttu. Voters directly elect 196 members of parliament, while the remaining 29 seats are allocated according to the proportional vote obtained by each party. Tens of thousands of security personnel were deployed at the more than 13,000 polling stations set up across the island country, at schools, temples and other public places. The outcome of Thursday’s polls will be important in determining how smoothly Dissanayake is able to implement reforms he has promised, such as cutting taxes and supporting small businesses. His first task will be to appoint a full-fledged cabinet. At the moment he only has a prime minister and two ministers. He backs policies that will ease hardship for working class people and has said that he will renegotiate the terms of a $2.9 billion bailout from the International Monetary Fund, while sticking with the program. While the IMF package helped stabilize the country’s economy, subsidies were slashed as part of austerity measures imposed by the IMF. Since the economic collapse, millions have fallen into poverty, food and fuel prices have skyrocketed and citizens say there are fewer job opportunities.	https://www.voanews.com/a/sri-lankan-president-hopes-to-ramp-up-support-in-parliamentary-elections/7863575.html	2024-11-14T03:58:30-08:00	
Hong Kong man jailed nearly 24 years for alleged bomb plot	hong kong — Hong Kong's high court on Thursday sentenced a man to 23 years and 10 months in prison for being the leader of an alleged plot to attack police with explosives during the city's pro-democracy and anti-China protests in 2019. The man, Ng Chi-hung, had been charged under the United Nations Anti-Terrorism Ordinance, for offences linked to a conspiracy to use explosives and firearms to endanger life. Another defendant, the leader of a group known as the 'Dragon Slayers' which was active during the 2019 protests, was sentenced to 13 years and six months imprisonment. The long jail terms come amid a protracted national security clampdown by China in the global financial hub, and is the first time the UN anti-terrorism ordinance has been used in Hong Kong since 2002.	https://www.voanews.com/a/hong-kong-man-jailed-nearly-24-years-for-alleged-bomb-plot/7863530.html	2024-11-14T02:50:15-08:00	
Malaysia to protest to Philippines over its new maritime laws	KUALA LUMPUR, Malaysia — Malaysia will send a protest note to the Philippines over its new maritime laws due to their overlapping claims in the South China Sea, its deputy foreign minister said on Thursday. The protest will follow a complaint also from China over the Philippines' Maritime Zones Act and the Archipelagic Sea Lanes Act, which Manila said was intended to strengthen its maritime claims and bolster its territorial integrity. Malaysia's Deputy Foreign Minister Mohamad Alamin said the government has reviewed the reference documents related to the Philippines' laws and found that they touch upon claims to the Malaysian state of Sabah on Borneo island. 'We will send a protest note today to demonstrate our commitment to defending Sabah's sovereign rights and the sovereignty of our country,' Mohamad told parliament. The Philippines' foreign ministry did not immediately respond to request for comment. The Philippines has a dormant claim to the eastern part of Sabah dating back to colonial times, but official statements on the issue are rare. Its Supreme Court in 2011 ruled that the claim has never been relinquished.	https://www.voanews.com/a/malaysia-to-protest-to-philippines-over-its-new-maritime-laws/7863523.html	2024-11-14T02:31:21-08:00	
Russian forces capture village in eastern Ukraine	Russia’s military reported capturing a village in east Ukraine on Thursday, with forces closing in on the town of Kurakhove. The Russian Defense Ministry said the army captured the village of Voznesenka in the Donetsk region. The town had a population of about 20,000 before the war began in 2022, Agence France-Presse reported. Russia also reported damaging Ukrainian airfields and energy facilities and shooting down 78 drones, according to state news agency RIA. Ukraine’s military said it shot down 21 of 59 Russian drones launched in an overnight attack. The fighting followed a massive aerial attack on Kyiv and other locations in Ukraine early Wednesday, involving ballistic and cruise missiles and dozens of drones. Ukraine's air force said its units shot down four missiles and 37 drones launched by Russia over eight regions. 'It is important that our forces have the means to defend the country from Russian terror,' President Volodymyr Zelenskyy said after attack. In his Wednesday address, Zelenskyy praised the country’s 'air defense warriors.' 'Every night, every day, they shoot down Russian ‘Shahed’ drones and missiles,' he said. 'This morning, they intercepted Russian ballistics. This is significant. Every such success means saving the lives of our people.' Ukraine has been appealing to allies to supply more air defense systems to protect against Russian attacks, and Zelenskyy said the country was grateful 'to all our partners who help us with anti-missiles and air defense systems.' 'The strategic goal is to reach a practical level of cooperation with our partners that will enable us to produce the air defense systems and anti-missiles we need here in Ukraine,' he said. He added Ukraine needs to 'finally push Russia towards making a fair peace.'	https://www.voanews.com/a/russian-forces-capture-village-in-eastern-ukraine/7863521.html	2024-11-14T02:30:36-08:00	
Analysts skeptical about African impact of China’s zero-tariff offer	NEW DELHI — Analysts interviewed by VOA expressed skepticism over China’s recent decision to eliminate tariffs for goods from least developed countries with diplomatic relations with Bejing, including 33 in Africa, next month. The move was announced by Chinese President Xi Jinping at the 2024 Summit of the Forum on China-Africa Cooperation in Beijing in early September. The analysts see it as an effort to expand China's influence in Africa without bringing much benefit to the LDCs. 'This move has not generated the excitement it should, due to well-known structural difficulties in Africa,' Emmanuel Owusu-Sekyere, director of research, policy and programs at the African Center for Economic Transformation in Accra, Ghana, told VOA. 'Cooperation between China and Africa has benefitted China much more than it has Africa,' he said, adding, 'Africa has given China unbridled access to its markets, which has crippled local production capacity in several aspects of the manufacturing sector e.g., textiles.' Xi described the zero-tariffs plan as making China the first major economy to take such a step to offer Africa a substantial opportunity to do business in the large Chinese market. Analysts see it as Beijing’s attempt to compete with the United States. The U.S. African Growth and Opportunity Act provides duty-free access to the U.S. market for more than 1,800 products from 32 sub-Saharan African countries. It will come up for renewal next year. They say China is also trying to take advantage of resentment of some African countries barred from AGOA on such grounds as human rights or lack of democracy and free markets. 'China's move to allow African LDCs to export tariff-free is clearly a move to project its power in an alternative world order,' said Samir Bhattacharya, associate fellow at the New Delhi-based Observer Research Foundation. 'The rigid policies of the U.S. have made some African countries averse towards it. China sees this as an opportunity to undermine the U.S.-led world order and promote its own narrow interests,' Bhattacharya said. 'China has reworked its trade basket to lure African leaders,' he added. 'This scheme would offer additional support to dictators and military leaders in African countries who are not comfortable with the U.S.,' he said. 'It would not improve the economy of these countries.' China’s viewpoint Chinese Commerce Ministry spokesperson He Yongqian has said that the initiative would boost LDC exports. It will also promote solidarity and cooperation among the countries of the Global South and advance the goal of 'inclusive and equitable economic globalization,' she said. She said China has signed framework agreements on economic partnership for common development with 22 African countries, including Ethiopia, Burundi, Gabon and Zimbabwe. However, Owusu-Sekyere expressed a different view. 'African countries are not strategically located in Asian production value chains like Bangladesh and Vietnam. Lack of strategic positioning and planning as well as structural bottlenecks will make it difficult for African countries to take advantage of this plan,' Owusu-Sekyere said. Every time China’s government enters into a trade or investment agreement with another country, Chinese entrepreneurs usually rush to grab the business opportunities created by the deal. This has been the experience of several countries in Africa and Asia that have received Chinese investments. Owusu-Sekyere said several African countries have enacted laws reserving the retail sector exclusively for locals but it has been taken over in those countries by Chinese entrepreneurs using local partners as fronts. The bigger challenge for African countries are nontariff barriers related to such things as quality, he said. 'African economies are not diversified enough to supply at the quality and scale required to meet the sophisticated and diverse demands of a huge market as China.' according to Owusu-Sekyere.	https://www.voanews.com/a/analysts-skeptical-about-african-impact-of-china-s-zero-tariff-offer-/7863517.html	2024-11-14T02:08:14-08:00	
Human Rights Watch accuses Israel of war crimes, ethnic cleansing	While fighting continued in Gaza and Lebanon on Thursday, Human Rights Watch issued a report accusing Israel of war crimes and crimes against humanity. The report said Israeli officials who have repeatedly displaced and relocated civilians are 'committing the war crime of forcible transfer,' and the actions 'appear to also meet the definition of ethnic cleansing' in the areas where Palestinians will not be able to return. 'Human Rights Watch found that forced displacement has been widespread, and the evidence shows it has been systematic and part of a state policy. Such acts also constitute crimes against humanity,' the report said. There was no immediate comment from the Israeli military or foreign ministry, but Israeli authorities have previously said their military actions are in compliance with international laws. The law of armed conflict forbids the forcible displacement of civilian populations from occupied territory, unless necessary for the security of civilians or imperative military reasons. Israel has said the displacement is necessary to keep civilians safe from fighting or to achieve military objectives. 'The Israeli government cannot claim to be keeping Palestinians safe when it kills them along escape routes, bombs so-called safe zones, and cuts off food, water, and sanitation,' said Human Rights Watch researcher Nadia Hardman in a news release accompanying the report. 'Israel has blatantly violated its obligation to ensure Palestinians can return home, razing virtually everything in large areas.' Hardman noted the report's findings are based on interviews with displaced Gazans, satellite imagery, and public reporting conducted until August 2024. Airstrikes in Gaza, Lebanon An Israeli strike on a home in northern Gaza killed three children, among at least six people killed in the territory, Palestinian medics said. An airstrike hit the southern suburbs of Beirut Thursday after an Israeli warning to evacuate parts of the Hezbollah bastion, Agence France-Presse reported. Shortly before the strike, Israel had issued a warning to residents to evacuate their homes. 'You are located near Hezbollah facilities and interests against which the (Israeli military) will operate in the near future,' army spokesperson Avichay Adraee said in a post on X that included a map identifying buildings in the areas. In a post on the Telegram messaging app Thursday, Israel Defense Forces said the air force struck and dismantled more than 140 Hezbollah launchers in southern Lebanon and had killed two battalion commanders and a company commander. 'Over the past week, the IDF eliminated over 200 Hezbollah terrorists in southern Lebanon from the air and ground,' the post stated. On Wednesday, six Israeli soldiers were killed in combat near the border with Lebanon. The soldiers 'fell during combat in southern Lebanon,' the army said in a statement. Their deaths mean 47 Israeli troops have been killed in combat with Hezbollah since September 30, when Israel sent ground forces into Lebanon. The war in Gaza was triggered when Hamas-led militants stormed into southern Israel on October 7, 2023, killing about 1,200 people, mostly civilians, and abducting about 250. Some 100 hostages are still inside Gaza, although about one-third of them are believed to be dead. Israel's counteroffensive has killed more than 43,000 Palestinians, more than half of them women and children, according to local health authorities. The Israeli military says the death toll includes thousands of Hamas militants. The war spread to Lebanon in mid-September, after months of rocket fire from Hezbollah into Israel and drone and airstrikes by Israel's military in south Lebanon escalated. More than 3,200 Lebanese have been killed, most of them in the past six weeks. Both Hamas and Hezbollah have been designated as terrorist organizations by the United States. Information from The Associated Press, Reuters and Agence France-Presse was used in this report.	https://www.voanews.com/a/human-rights-watch-accuses-israel-of-war-crimes-ethnic-cleansing-/7863508.html	2024-11-14T01:42:04-08:00	
China battles rare surge in violent crime incidents amid economic woes	beijing — China's economic malaise is fueling social tensions that make people more likely to commit violent crimes out of anger or desperation, analysts say, after the country witnessed its deadliest massacre in a decade. The country has experienced a spate of violent attacks this year, challenging Beijing's proud reputation for public order and prompting online soul-searching about the state of society. On Monday, a man plowed a car into crowds at a sports complex in the southern city of Zhuhai, killing 35 and wounding 43, according to official figures. It followed a string of similar crimes as China struggles to revive economic growth, keep people employed and boost confidence since it ended rigid COVID curbs in late 2022. 'The recent spate of violent attacks in China is a reflection of its worsening social and macroeconomic conditions,' said Hanzhang Liu, an assistant professor of political studies at Pitzer College in the United States. 'Although these incidents are sporadic in nature, the increasing frequency at which they happen does suggest that more people in China are suffering from hardships and desperation that they have not previously experienced,' she told AFP. Signs of economic distress have multiplied in China in recent years, from capital flight and emigration to rising joblessness, anger at expensive housing and childcare, and youth cultures glorifying low expectations and rejecting the rat race. Lynette Ong, distinguished professor of Chinese politics at Canada's University of Toronto and senior fellow at the Asia Society, said violent attacks were the 'negative side of the same coin.' 'These are symptoms of a society with a lot of pent-up grievances,' Ong told AFP. 'Some people resort to giving up. Others, if they're angry, want to take revenge.' The problem was 'very new to China,' she said, adding that the country may be tipping 'towards a different type of society, an uglier society.' New threats Police said initial enquiries showed the perpetrator of Monday's rampage was a 62-year-old man 'dissatisfied' with a divorce settlement. In other cases, a middle-aged man used a knife and firearm to kill at least 21 people in eastern Shandong province in February, and a 55-year-old man rammed a car into a crowd in the central city of Changsha in July, killing eight, following a property dispute. A 50-year-old man wounded five in a knife attack at a school in Beijing last month; a 37-year-old man fatally stabbed three and injured 15 in a Shanghai supermarket in September; and a 44-year-old unemployed man fatally knifed a Japanese schoolboy in Shenzhen the same month. In some cases, the motives remain unclear or undisclosed, while scant media coverage and widespread online censorship have hampered understanding of the problem's potential social roots. But the attacks have revealed the limits of a nationwide system of surveillance cameras and data-driven policing that roots out public security threats. Suzanne Scoggins, an associate professor of political science at Clark University in the United States, said the recent attacks showed that 'there is no such thing as an all-seeing, all-knowing police state.' Minxin Pei, a professor at California's Claremont McKenna College, told AFP that 'the system is very good at watching known threats, but it does a poor job dealing with previously unknown or unidentified threats.' 'The man who killed so many people in Zhuhai most probably was not known as a threat to the police,' said Pei, who also authored The Sentinel State, a book on surveillance in China. Secrecy, strain President Xi Jinping called on officials to prevent 'extreme cases' after Monday's attack, while Beijing's foreign ministry repeated that the country is 'one of the safest' in the world. China's official murder rate last year was 0.46 cases per 100,000 people, compared to 5.7 in the United States. Still, authorities swiftly extinguished commemorations of the Zhuhai incident, clearing public memorials to victims and quashing online discussion. Analysts said the censorship was a reflexive state response to deter copycat violence and prevent official embarrassment. 'The Chinese state's default modus operandi is secrecy,' said Steve Tsang, director of the SOAS China Institute in London. Liu, of Pitzer College, called the violence a 'thorny challenge' to Beijing as it addresses the economic slowdown. China typically responds to social instability by bolstering public security and surveillance systems, she told AFP. But with the government facing 'unprecedented fiscal woes,' this would only put more pressure on drained public coffers, Liu said.	https://www.voanews.com/a/china-battles-rare-surge-in-violent-crime-incidents-amid-economic-woes/7863497.html	2024-11-14T01:24:07-08:00	
Facing Trump’s return, South Korea tees up for alliance strains	Seoul, South Korea — Following U.S. President-elect Donald Trump’s electoral victory, world leaders have scrambled to secure calls and send delegations to strengthen ties with his team. South Korean President Yoon Suk Yeol is taking a different approach: golf practice. South Korean presidential officials confirmed to VOA that Yoon recently took up golf for the first time in eight years, specifically to prepare for diplomacy with Trump, who is known for bonding with world leaders over the sport. It’s part of a broader response to the return of Trump, whose unpredictable 'America First' approach poses unique economic and security challenges to South Korea. The task may be especially difficult for Yoon, a conservative who leaned hard into a values-based alliance with the United States under President Joe Biden, pressing North Korea on human rights and projecting military strength. Now, Yoon must contend with Trump, a famously transactional leader who has advocated for friendlier ties with North Korean leader Kim Jong Un and dismissed U.S.-South Korea military drills as costly 'war games.' Trump has also consistently questioned the value of the seven-decade alliance, even hinting at a U.S. troop withdrawal if South Korea does not pay more. Economic concerns add to South Korea’s unease, as officials worry Trump’s talk of imposing tariffs, and a renewed U.S.-China trade war could destabilize its export-driven economy. Trump’s win has prompted soul-searching in South Korea, with many left-leaning commentators lamenting what they see as an over-reliance on an increasingly unreliable ally. 'Trump’s reelection heralds a tectonic shift in the U.S.-led international order, which South Korea has been largely dependent on for the past 70 years,' read a recent opinion piece in the prominent Hankyoreh newspaper. It warned that the Yoon administration, after having 'placed all its eggs in the South Korea-U.S. alliance basket,' will now 'witness the devastating consequences of such blind belief.' Many conservative South Korean commentators also expressed concerns about the future of alliance, even while noting that Trump presents unique opportunities. An editorial in the Chosun Ilbo, South Korea’s largest newspaper, said if Trump demands an excessive increase in defense cost-sharing, South Korea 'could negotiate for independent nuclear armament in return.' Cost-sharing woes Defense burden-sharing could become the first major alliance test once Trump returns – just as it was throughout his first term. Just one day before Trump’s reelection, the United States and South Korea finalized a new agreement for Seoul to pay $1.19 billion in 2026 to support U.S. troops – an 8.3% increase from the previous year. The six-year deal was widely seen as an attempt to 'Trump-proof' the alliance. However, some analysts worry it may have the opposite effect, possibly prompting Trump to overturn the agreement unilaterally or impose new financial demands. For example, Trump could require that South Korea cover costs for joint military exercises or the visits of 'strategic assets,' such as bombers and aircraft carriers, said Park Won-gon, a professor at Seoul’s Ewha University. Such exercises and deployments were recently expanded – a key reassurance for South Korea, which relies on the U.S. nuclear umbrella for protection against nuclear-armed North Korea. If Trump demanded payment for these activities, Park said, it would 'inevitably weaken the overall framework of extended deterrence.' Abandonment concerns Trump has long been a critic of U.S.-South Korea military exercises, even scaling them back unexpectedly after his first summit with Kim in 2018. Many in South Korea now worry he could pursue renewed diplomacy with Pyongyang that sidelines Seoul’s security interests. During his first term, Trump reserved his strongest criticism for North Korea’s intercontinental ballistic missile launches, which threaten the U.S. mainland, while downplaying short-range tests that pose a more immediate risk to South Korea. Analysts also fear that Trump and Kim could resume talks that highlight their warm relations and project diplomatic progress, without advancing denuclearization in any meaningful way. 'In that case, North Korea will be recognized as a de facto nuclear state, which is a development that South Korea will find difficult to accept,' wrote Lee Sang-hyun, a senior research fellow at Seoul’s Sejong Institute, in an analysis of Trump’s reelection. Louder nuclear calls These concerns have emboldened voices within South Korea calling for an independent nuclear arsenal – a proposal that has moved into the mainstream under Yoon’s administration. The latest high-profile figure to embrace the idea is Park Jin, who served as Yoon’s foreign minister until earlier this year. In an interview this week with a South Korean news outlet, Park stated that South Korea must 'seriously consider all possible security options, including potentially acquiring nuclear capabilities,' if Trump resumes threats to withdraw U.S. troops. South Korea’s nuclear armament also has gained traction in U.S. policy circles, particularly with a growing number of former Trump officials. Trump himself even proposed the idea during his first presidential campaign, though not as president. But significant barriers remain. Such a move would likely provoke a strong reaction from North Korea and China, potentially endangering South Korea’s security during any 'breakout' period. Additionally, South Korea could face severe economic sanctions if it decided to go nuclear. Golf diplomacy Together, these challenges present a major diplomatic test for Yoon, who hopes that spending time on the golf course with Trump will offer a chance to address them one on one. Such an approach would emulate that of Japan’s late former Prime Minister Shinzo Abe, who formed a close bond with Trump and tried to smooth bilateral frictions, in part by playing golf. It’s a strategy that makes sense, according to Park, the Seoul-based professor, who stressed the importance of personal relationships and proactive engagement when dealing with Trump. 'For Trump, it’s all about who he listens to,' Park said. 'He tends to repeat what those close to him feed him, so we need to leverage close relationships to convey our stance.'	https://www.voanews.com/a/facing-trump-s-return-south-korea-tees-up-for-alliance-strains/7863495.html	2024-11-14T01:10:25-08:00	
South Korean court finds former lawmaker guilty of misusing funds meant for sexual slavery victims	SEOUL, South Korea — South Korea's Supreme Court on Thursday handed a suspended prison sentence to a former lawmaker who was found guilty of embezzling funds while leading a group supporting Korean survivors of Japan's wartime sexual slavery. Yoon Meehyang, who was also convicted of fraudulently receiving government subsidies and unlawfully collecting donations, didn't attend the verdict, which confirmed a lower court's sentence of a year and six months in prison, suspended for three years. In a statement on Facebook, Yoon described her conviction as 'unjust,' saying she and her colleagues handled the group's funds properly and 'had not pursued private interests.' Yoon's group, the Korean Council for Justice and Remembrance for the Issues of Military Sexual Slavery by Japan, said it plans to return the government subsidies linked to the fraud charges but criticized the court for failing to see the 'substantive truth.' 'Despite our efforts over the past four years, we failed to achieve a 'not guilty' result with the Supreme Court, but I want to use this opportunity to say once again — my colleagues and I are innocent,' Yoon wrote. Controversy surrounding Yoon and her group erupted in 2020 when one of the slavery victims, Lee Yong-soo, accused her of misusing donations and other funds and spending little on the victims. Yoon, who had just begun her term as a lawmaker for the liberal opposition Democratic Party, denied allegations that she and the group used the funds for private gain and insisted that Lee's claim was based on a misunderstanding. Historians say tens of thousands of women from around Asia, many of them Korean, were sent to front-line military brothels to provide sexual services for Japanese soldiers. Hundreds were registered with the South Korean government as victims but only eight of them are still alive. Prosecutors indicted Yoon in September 2020 over embezzlement, fraud and other charges, months before the Democratic Party expelled her over separate suspicions of inappropriate real-estate investments. She finished her four-year term as a legislator last year as an independent. The Supreme Court upheld a verdict by the Seoul High Court in September last year, which found Yoon guilty of fraudulently obtaining 65.2 million won ($46,300) in government subsidies from 2014 to 2020 by falsely reporting labor costs, and of embezzling 79 million won ($56,150) of the group's funds. The court also ruled that Yoon violated laws by collecting donations through unregistered accounts as the group organized the funeral of Kim Bok-dong, a sexual slavery victim and activist who died in 2019. The issues of sexual slavery, forced labor and other abuses during Japan's brutal colonial rule of the Korean Peninsula before the end of World War II have long been a source of tensions between Seoul and Tokyo.	https://www.voanews.com/a/south-korean-court-finds-former-lawmaker-guilty-of-misusing-funds-meant-for-sexual-slavery-victims/7863490.html	2024-11-14T00:35:31-08:00	
BRICS offered Turkey partner country status, Turkish trade minister says	ANKARA, turkey — Turkey was offered partner country status by the BRICS group of nations, Trade Minister Omer Bolat said, as Ankara continues what it calls its efforts to balance its Eastern and Western ties. Turkey, a NATO member, has in recent months voiced interest in joining the BRICS group of emerging economies, comprising Brazil, Russia, India, China, South Africa, Ethiopia, Iran, Egypt, and the United Arab Emirates. Turkish President Tayyip Erdogan attended a BRICS leaders' summit hosted by Russian President Vladimir Putin in Kazan last month, after Ankara said it had taken formal steps to become a member of the group. 'As for Turkey's status regarding (BRICS) membership, they offered Turkey the status of partner membership,' Bolat said in an interview with private broadcaster TVNet on Wednesday. 'This (status) is the transition process in the organizational structure of BRICS,' he said. Ankara sees the BRICS group as an opportunity to further economic cooperation with member states, rather than an alternative to its Western ties and NATO membership, Erdogan has said. Turkish officials have repeatedly said potential membership of BRICS would not affect Turkey's responsibilities to the Western military alliance. Aside from full membership, BRICS members introduced a 'partner country' category in Kazan, according to the declaration issued by BRICS on October 23. Bolat did not say whether Ankara had accepted the proposal. An official in Erdogan's ruling AK Party told Reuters this month that while the proposal had been discussed in Kazan, partner country status would fall short of Turkey's demands for membership.	https://www.voanews.com/a/brics-offered-turkey-partner-country-status-turkish-trade-minister-says-/7863488.html	2024-11-14T00:27:20-08:00	
Philippines braces for fifth major storm to hit in three weeks	MANILA, Philippines — The fifth major storm in three weeks approached the Philippines on Thursday, prompting more largescale evacuations and a United Nations request for emergency funds to help the government ease the plight of hard-hit villagers. Typhoon Usagi had sustained winds of up to 185 kph and gusts of up to 230 kph and was forecast to strengthen further before slamming Thursday afternoon into the coast of Cagayan province at the northern tip of Luzon, the country's most populous agricultural region. Another storm was brewing in the Pacific and may hit the northern Philippines this weekend, according to forecasters. The country's weather agency warned of life-threatening tidal surges of up to 3 meters in coastal areas of Cagayan and seven other nearby provinces and clusters of islands, and urged all ships to remain in port or immediately take shelter. Typhoon Toraji blew away from the northern Philippines just two days ago after unleashing floods, knocking down power lines and forcing more than 42,000 people to evacuate their homes. The government has struggled to deal with the impact of the last four major storms, which left at least 160 people dead, displaced millions and devastated farmland and infrastructure, mostly in the northern Luzon region. President Ferdinand Marcos Jr.'s administration has spent more than 1 billion pesos ($17 million) for food and other aid for hundreds of thousands of storm victims, Welfare Assistant Secretary Irene Dumlao said. Defense Secretary Gilberto Teodoro, who oversees disaster-response efforts, sought the help of neighboring countries, including Singapore, Indonesia, Malaysia and Brunei, in providing additional aircraft to transport food, water and other aid to villages isolated by the storms. The United States, Manila's longtime treaty ally, deployed cargo aircraft with food and other assistance. The U.N. Humanitarian Country Team in the Philippines said it was raising $32.9 million to help the government provide assistance to about 210,000 people in critical need of aid and protection, especially women, children and people with disabilities, in the next three months. 'The Philippines is facing an exceptionally challenging tropical cyclone season, with successive cyclones reaching unprecedented locations and scales,' the U.N. team in said in its emergency plan. 'Local authorities, who are often impacted themselves, are overwhelmed as they simultaneously respond to the crisis and coordinate rescue efforts for affected families.' The Philippines is battered by about 20 typhoons and tropical storms each year. It is often hit by earthquakes and has more than a dozen active volcanoes, making it one of the world's most disaster-prone countries. In 2013, Typhoon Haiyan, one of the strongest recorded tropical cyclones, left more than 7,300 people dead or missing, flattened entire villages and caused ships to run aground and smash into houses in the central Philippines.	https://www.voanews.com/a/philippines-braces-for-fifth-major-storm-to-hit-in-three-weeks/7863487.html	2024-11-14T00:17:14-08:00	
Senegal heads to the polls amid fiscal crisis, threat of unrest	DAKAR, Senegal — Senegal will vote in legislative elections on Sunday that will determine whether the new president and government can gain control over the national assembly and push through their agenda for reforms. The high stakes in the election are threatening to spark renewed unrest following a period of calm. The run-up to the presidential election in March saw some of the worst violence in the country's recent history. Campaigning has grown heated in recent days and comes at a precarious time for the new government, which is navigating a spiraling fiscal crisis that could undermine its ability to deliver on promises to boost the economy and create jobs. Prime Minister Ousmane Sonko, known for his fiery rhetoric, said this week that his supporters had come under attack and urged them to take revenge. He has also warned that restraint should not be mistaken for weakness. 'Let them not say that we've changed and that since we came, everyone can do as they please,' he said on Tuesday evening. 'We could have used our strength, but we didn't.' Top priorities for Senegalese voters are jobs and the economy, as inflation has squeezed livelihoods and the nation's growing youth population struggle to find employment. More than 7 million registered voters will have the chance to vote for candidates for the 165 seat-assembly, choosing between 41 registered parties or other entities. Polls open Sunday at 8 a.m. (0800 GMT) and close at 6 p.m. 'We want a lower cost of living, affordable water, electricity, and transport, so everyone can work and live decently,' said Cheikh Diagne, a street seller in downtown Dakar. Babacar Ndiaye, research director at the think-tank WATHI, said that Senegalese have historically voted in favor of the president during previous parliamentary elections. 'When they choose a president, they then give that president the means to work and govern,' he said. 'Every time a president has won, he has in due course also gained an absolute majority in the National Assembly.' The West African country is plunging towards a debt crisis after the new government said it had discovered the budget deficit was much wider than reported by the previous government. A $1.9 billion IMF program is on hold while the government audit is reviewed. The main threat to the ruling party Pastef's ambitions is the unexpected alliance of two opposition parties, including the Republic party (APR) headed by the former Prime Minister Macky Sall. The race also includes two smaller opposition coalitions. The one led by Dakar's mayor, Barthelemy Dias, has clashed with supporters of Pastef. Mariam Wane Ly, a former parliamentarian and trailblazer for women in politics in Senegal, said the campaign period had given leaders a chance to explain their agendas and she expected Pastef to win the majority it is seeking. 'I think it's going to make up for all the unhappiness,' she said.	https://www.voanews.com/a/senegal-heads-to-the-polls-amid-fiscal-crisis-threat-of-unrest-/7863482.html	2024-11-14T00:09:19-08:00	
Swiss villagers pack up for evacuation over fears of another rockslide	GENEVA — Families in a tiny Swiss village were packing up Wednesday after authorities issued an evacuation order with a weekend deadline because of the threat of a possible rockslide from an Alpine mountainside overhead. Authorities in charge of the eastern village of Brienz said in a statement Tuesday that they analyzed the potential danger with geology and natural-hazards specialists and recommended the precautionary evacuation by 1 p.m. Sunday. Christian Gartmann, a member of the crisis management board in the town of Albula, which counts Brienz in its jurisdiction, said inhabitants of the village, with a population of 90, were making quick preparations. A similar evacuation took place in May last year. The following month, a rockslide sent 2 million cubic meters of stone tumbling down the mountainside — but it missed the village. Another 1.2 million cubic meters still loom, leading to the new order for evacuation. 'It has begun, immediately actually. People in the village organized themselves,' Gartmann said by phone. Some were 'a little bit aggressive towards us' for ordering the evacuation, he said, adding that he understood their discontent. 'No one is in favor of his own evacuation. They would love to stay in their houses. They have been living in these houses for generations and they don't want to leave their village,' Gartmann said. 'But actually, it's the mountain that orders us to evacuate them.' In recent days, authorities have been advising villagers to take essential items, like computers, winter wear and school and work materials, for up to six months out of town, he said. 'It's not a total moving-out,' Gartmann said, summarizing the order to locals as 'take everything that you need for the next few months. If you have some cheap ... sofa at home, leave it.' Temporary lodging out of the village, which sits in between Italian and German-speaking parts of southeastern Switzerland, has already been arranged for about three-quarters of residents, and some were staying nearby with friends or family, he said. The main threat is posed by rocks that are already strewn along the mountainside, not a larger breakage, Gartmann said. A controlled explosion to trigger a rockslide to reduce the risk of an uncontrolled one has been ruled out, in part because 300 tons of explosives would be needed, he said. Blasting crews would face risks, and a detonation could also affect a nearby mountain. A severe rockslide would almost certainly destroy the village anyway, Gartmann said. Instead, work is under way to relieve water pressure under the land that has unsettled the rocks in a bid to reduce the risk and give peace of mind to residents. The gradual erosion has taken place over 12,000 years, since the end of the last Ice Age, he said. While authorities plan to compensate evacuees for extra costs related to their departure, no payouts are planned for damage to personal belongings 'because it's no one's fault. It's nature that dictates the evacuation,' Gartmann said.	https://www.voanews.com/a/swiss-villagers-pack-up-for-evacuation-over-fears-of-another-rockslide/7863471.html	2024-11-13T23:37:51-08:00	
Sri Lanka votes for new parliament as economic recovery hangs in balance	COLOMBO, Sri Lanka — Sri Lanka began voting in a snap election on Thursday which will determine if the island nation wants to empower its new, leftist President Anura Kumara Dissanayake to push his pro-poor policies as it recovers from a financial meltdown. A little over 17 million Sri Lankans are eligible to elect lawmakers to the 225-member parliament for a five-year term. A record 690 political parties and independent groups are in the fray across 22 electoral districts. Marxist-leaning Dissanayake, 55, was elected president in September but his National People's Power (NPP) coalition had just three of 225 seats in parliament, prompting him to dissolve the legislature almost a year before its term ended and seek a fresh mandate. Over 7,000 police personnel have been deployed to ensure free and fair elections at the more than 13,400 polling stations set up across the country, police officers told Reuters. 'The military is also on standby to assist the police but we do not expect any incidents,' said Police Spokesman Nihal Thalduwa, adding that voting was proceeding smoothly. As polling opened in the early hours of the morning, people began trickling into temples, schools and other public buildings being used as polling stations. Among them was Umeshi Perera, 32, who lined up to cast her ballot at a school in Biyagama, a suburb about 15 km from the South Asian nation's largest city of Colombo. 'I think we are seeing the first signs of a positive political change in Sri Lanka after the president was elected and we should give him the chance to continue that change,' she said. Analysts say Dissanayake's coalition is expected to draw significant support, while a victory for a rival could lead to a policy logjam the country cannot afford. The Samagi Jana Balawegaya party of opposition leader Sajith Premadasa - who favors a mix of interventionist and free-market economic policies - is NPP's main challenger. The other key contender is the New Democratic Front, backed by previous President Ranil Wickremesinghe. 'All arrangements are in place and we appeal to the public to work with us to ensure a free and fair election,' Election Commission Chairman RML Rathnayake told reporters at a pre-election briefing on Tuesday. Votes will be counted soon after polling closes on Thursday and results are expected to be announced on Friday. A country of 22 million people just across the southern tip of India, Sri Lanka was crushed by a 2022 economic crisis triggered by a severe shortfall of foreign currency, causing the economy to shrink by 7.3% in 2022 and 2.3% last year. Boosted by a $2.9 billion bailout program from the International Monetary Fund, the economy has begun a tentative recovery, but the high cost of living is still a critical issue for many voters, especially the poor. Dissanayake wants to push anti-poverty policies including bigger welfare schemes and fight corruption as a political outsider in a country dominated by family parties for decades. He also aims to tweak targets set under the IMF program to reduce high income taxes and free up funds to invest in welfare for millions hit hardest by the crisis. The new government must deliver a budget to reach a crucial primary surplus target of 2.3% of GDP in 2025 set under the IMF program, deliver pro-poor policies, and put growth on a sustainable path. But investors worry Dissanayake's desire to revisit the terms of the IMF bailout could delay future disbursements, and make it harder for Sri Lanka to hit that primary surplus target. 'In past elections, people did not have confidence in us but in September people gave us victory and proved that we are a winning party and we can form a government,' Dissanayake said on Sunday as the campaign neared its conclusion. 'The next task is to unite people from the four corners of this country and build a powerful people's movement,' he said.	https://www.voanews.com/a/sri-lanka-votes-for-new-parliament-as-economic-recovery-hangs-in-balance/7863456.html	2024-11-13T22:16:56-08:00	
UN nuclear chief in Iran to 'reach diplomatic solutions'	Tehran, Iran — International Atomic Energy Agency chief Rafael Grossi was to hold talks with top Iranian officials Thursday on Tehran's nuclear program, a week after Donald Trump's re-election as US president. During his first term in the White House from 2017 to 2021, Trump was the architect of a policy called 'maximum pressure,' which levied against Tehran biting sanctions that had been lifted through a landmark nuclear agreement in 2015. Grossi, who is the director general of the UN agency, arrived at Tehran airport on Wednesday evening and was greeted by Behrouz Kamalvandi, the spokesman for the Atomic Energy Organization of Iran (AEOI). Grossi is set to meet Thursday in Tehran with AEOI chief Mohammad Eslami as well as Foreign Minister Abbas Araghchi, who was chief negotiator in the nuclear talks between Tehran and the major powers that resulted in the 2015 deal formally called the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action. The deal, reached after 21 months of negotiations between Iran and world powers, gave Tehran sanctions relief in exchange for curbs on its nuclear program to guarantee that it could not develop a nuclear weapon -- something it has always denied wanting to do. Three years later, then-president Trump unilaterally withdrew the United States from the agreement and reimposed heavy sanctions against Iran. Search for solutions A year later, Iran started to gradually roll back its commitments to the nuclear deal, which only allowed Tehran to enrich uranium to 3.65% purity. The IAEA says Iran has considerably increased its reserves of enriched uranium to 60%, close to the 90% needed to develop an atomic bomb. The head of the IAEA 'will do what he can to prevent the situation going from bad to worse' given the significant differences between Tehran and Western capitals, analyst Ali Vaez, an Iran expert for the Crisis Group, a U.S.-based think tank, told AFP. 'The one who left the agreement was not Iran, it was America,' Iran's government spokeswoman Fatemeh Mohajerani said on Wednesday. 'Mr. Trump once tried the path of maximum pressure and saw that this path did not work.' Grossi's visit comes only two days after the defense minister of Iran's arch enemy Israel warned that the Islamic republic was 'more exposed than ever to strikes on its nuclear facilities.' The two countries have exchanged missile fire in recent months in a context of high tensions in the Middle East due to the war waged by Israel in the Gaza Strip against Hamas and in Lebanon against Hezbollah, two militant groups allied with Iran. Trump's return to the White House in January also raises fears of rising tensions between Iran and his country. 'The margins for maneuver are beginning to shrink,' Grossi warned in an interview with AFP on Tuesday, adding that 'it is imperative to find ways to reach diplomatic solutions.' Religious decree Grossi has said that while Iran does not have any nuclear weapons at this moment in time, it does have plenty of nuclear materials that could be used eventually to make a weapon. Iranian President Masoud Pezeshkian, who came to office in July with hopes of improving ties with the West and having sanctions lifted, favors a revival of the nuclear deal. But all efforts to get the nuclear agreement off life support have so far failed. The IAEA chief has repeatedly called for more cooperation from Iran. In recent years, Tehran has decreased its interaction with the UN agency by deactivating surveillance devices needed to monitor the nuclear program and effectively barring its inspectors. The foundations of Iran's nuclear program date back to the late 1950s, when the United States signed a civil cooperation agreement with Iran's then-Shah Mohammad Reza Pahlavi. In 1970, Iran ratified the Non-Proliferation Treaty (NPT), which requires signatory states to declare and place their nuclear materials under the IAEA control. But with Iran threatening to hit back at Israel for its latest missile strikes, some lawmakers in the Islamic republic have called on the government to revise its nuclear doctrine to pursue nuclear weapons. The parliamentarians called on supreme leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, who wields ultimate authority in Iran, to reconsider his long-standing religious edict or fatwa banning nuclear weapons. The Islamic republic has maintained its policy against acquiring nuclear weapons, insisting its nuclear activities are entirely peaceful.	https://www.voanews.com/a/un-nuclear-chief-in-iran-to-reach-diplomatic-solutions-/7863452.html	2024-11-13T22:04:13-08:00	
Vote counting underway in Somaliland after peaceful election	washington — Polls have closed across Somaliland after presidential elections, and it appears Wednesday's voting across the breakaway region has gone smoothly. The Somaliland National Electoral Commission (NEC) said polls closed across the region at 6 p.m. local time. More than 1 million people were registered to vote across some 2,000 polling stations in Somalia's breakaway region. In the evening, vote counting was underway, according to the electoral agency. 'It will start from polling centers level, then passes to district, and the regional before we announce the result,' said NEC Chairman Muse Hassan Yusuf. 'We have successfully solved minor technical issues reported in some polling stations,' he said. He said the NEC would announce the result of the election by November 21. General Mohamed Adan Saqadhi, head of Somaliland Police Force, said throughout Somaliland the election was peaceful. 'Thanks to Allah, the election took place democratically and peacefully. No incident was reported,' said Saqadhi. Candidates promise to grow economy Three candidates, including incumbent President Muse Bihi Abdi, were on the ballot in Wednesday's poll. In interviews with VOA Somali, each of the three candidates promised to strengthen democracy, boost economic growth, and gain the international recognition Somaliland has sought for 33 years. Abdi, of the ruling Peace, Unity and Development Party, also known simply as Kulmiye, was seeking a second term. He ran against Abdirahman Mohamed Abdullahi, known as 'Irro,' of the Waddani party and Faisal Ali Warabe of the Justice and Development Party, or UCID. This is the fourth presidential election since the region on the northwestern tip of Somalia broke away from the rest of the country, following the collapse of the Siad Barre regime in 1991. The territory declared independence that year but has never achieved international recognition. Despite that, Somaliland has a functioning government and institutions, a political system that has allowed democratic transfers of power between rival parties, its own currency, passport and armed forces. Voters cast ballots amid tension Wednesday's vote comes at a time when tensions remain high between Somalia and Ethiopia over a controversial memorandum of understanding that Ethiopia signed with Somaliland. The deal would grant Ethiopia a 50-year lease of access to 20 kilometers of the Gulf of Aden coastline in exchange for the potential recognition of Somaliland's independence, which Somalia views as a violation of its sovereignty and territorial integrity. The deal, signed on January 1 in Addis Ababa by Abdi and Ethiopia Prime Minister Abiy Ahmed, sparked anger in Mogadishu, which considers Somaliland part of its national territory. In April, Somalia expelled Ethiopian Ambassador Muktar Mohamed Ware, alleging 'internal interference' by Ethiopia. Somalia also ordered the closure of Ethiopia's consulates in Somaliland and Puntland, although both consulates remained open. Last month, Somalia expelled Mogadishu-based Ethiopian diplomat Ali Mohamed Adan, who was a counselor at Ethiopia's embassy in Mogadishu. In July and August, two rounds of talks between Ethiopia and Somalia, mediated by Turkey, failed to solve the dispute, with Somalia demanding Ethiopia withdraw from the deal and Ethiopia insisting that it does not infringe on Somalia's sovereignty. On Saturday, Somali Defense Minister Abdulkadir Mohamed Nur repeated the Somali government position against Ethiopian troop involvement in a new African Union peacekeeping mission in Somalia due to start in January. 'I can say that Ethiopia is the only government we know of so far that will not participate in the new AU mission because it has violated our sovereignty and national unity,' Nur said Saturday in a government-run television interview.	https://www.voanews.com/a/vote-counting-underway-in-somaliland-after-peaceful-election/7863396.html	2024-11-13T20:16:31-08:00	
Trump picks former rival Marco Rubio for secretary of state	washington — U.S. President-elect Donald Trump announced on Wednesday he is nominating Republican Senator Marco Rubio, a senior member of both the foreign relations and intelligence committees and former political rival, to be secretary of state. 'He will be a strong Advocate for our Nation, a true friend to our Allies, and a fearless Warrior who will never back down to our adversaries,' Trump said in a statement. Rubio, 53, is known as a China hawk, an outspoken critic of Cuba's Communist government and a strong backer of Israel. In the past, he has advocated for a more assertive U.S. foreign policy with respect to America's geopolitical foes, although recently his views have aligned more closely with those of Trump's 'America First' approach to foreign policy. In April, Rubio was one of 15 Republican senators to vote against a big military aid package to help Ukraine resist Russia and support other U.S. partners, including Israel. Trump has been critical of Democratic President Joe Biden's continuing military assistance for Ukraine as it fights Russia's invasion. Rubio has said in recent interviews that Kyiv needs to seek a negotiated settlement with Russia rather than focus on regaining all of the territory that Moscow has taken in the last decade. On the Gaza war, Rubio — like Trump — has been staunchly behind Israel, calling Hamas a terrorist organization that must be eliminated and saying America's role is to resupply Israel with the military materials needed to finish the job. Rubio is a top Senate China hawk, and Beijing imposed sanctions on him in 2020 over his stance on Hong Kong's democracy protests. This could create difficulties for any attempts to maintain the Biden administration's effort to keep up diplomatic engagement with Beijing to avoid an unintended conflict. Among other things, Rubio shepherded an act through Congress that gave Washington a new tool to bar Chinese imports over China's treatment of Uyghur Muslims and has also pushed a bill that would decertify Hong Kong's U.S. economic and trade offices. Rubio had also become a strong Trump backer, after harshly criticizing him when he ran against the former real estate developer for president in 2016. The three-term Republican senator should easily win confirmation in the Senate, where Trump's Republicans will hold at least a 52-48 majority starting in January. Democratic Senator Mark Warner, chairman of the intelligence committee, quickly issued a statement praising the choice of Rubio, the panel's vice chairman. 'I have worked with Marco Rubio for more than a decade on the Intelligence Committee, particularly closely in the last couple of years in his role as Vice Chairman, and while we don't always agree, he is smart, talented, and will be a strong voice for American interests around the globe,' Warner said in a statement. Rubio, the son of immigrants from Cuba, will be the first Latino to serve as America's top diplomat.	https://www.voanews.com/a/7863414.html	2024-11-13T20:08:16-08:00	
Republicans win 218 US House seats, giving Trump's party control of government	WASHINGTON — Republicans have won enough seats to control the U.S. House, completing the party’s sweep into power and securing their hold on U.S. government alongside President-elect Donald Trump. A House Republican victory in Arizona, alongside a win in slow-counting California earlier Wednesday, gave the GOP the 218 House victories that make up the majority. Republicans earlier gained control of the Senate from Democrats. With hard-fought yet thin majorities, Republican leaders are envisioning a mandate to upend the federal government and swiftly implement Trump’s vision for the country. The incoming president has promised to carry out the country’s largest-ever deportation operation, extend tax breaks, punish his political enemies, seize control of the federal government’s most powerful tools and reshape the U.S. economy. The GOP election victories ensure that Congress will be onboard for that agenda, and Democrats will be almost powerless to check it. When Trump was elected president in 2016, Republicans also swept Congress, but he still encountered Republican leaders resistant to his policy ideas, as well as a Supreme Court with a liberal majority. Not this time. When he returns to the White House, Trump will be working with a Republican Party that has been completely transformed by his 'Make America Great Again' movement and a Supreme Court dominated by conservative justices, including three that he appointed. Trump rallied House Republicans at a Capitol Hill hotel Wednesday morning, marking his first return to Washington since the election. 'I suspect I won’t be running again unless you say, 'He’s good, we got to figure something else,'' Trump said to the room full of lawmakers who laughed in response. House Speaker Mike Johnson, who with Trump's endorsement won the Republican Conference's nomination to stay on as speaker next year, has talked of taking a 'blowtorch' to the federal government and its programs, eyeing ways to overhaul even popular programs championed by Democrats in recent years. The Louisiana Republican, an ardent conservative, has pulled the House Republican Conference closer to Trump during the campaign season as they prepare an 'ambitious' 100-day agenda. 'Republicans in the House and Senate have a mandate,' Johnson said earlier this week. 'The American people want us to implement and deliver that ‘America First’ agenda.' Trump's allies in the House are already signaling they will seek retribution for the legal troubles Trump faced while out of office. The incoming president on Wednesday said he would nominate Rep. Matt Gaetz, a fierce loyalist, for attorney general. Meanwhile, Rep. Jim Jordan, the chair of the powerful House Judiciary Committee, has said Republican lawmakers are 'not taking anything off the table' in their plans to investigate special counsel Jack Smith, even as Smith is winding down two federal investigations into Trump for plotting to overturn the results of the 2020 presidential election and hoarding classified documents at his Mar-a-Lago estate. Still, with a few races still uncalled the Republicans may hold the majority by just a few seats as the new Congress begins. Trump's decision to pull from the House for posts in his administration — Reps. Gaetz, Mike Waltz and Elise Stefanik so far — could complicate Johnson's ability to maintain a majority in the early days of the new Congress. Gaetz submitted his resignation Wednesday, effective immediately. Johnson said he hoped the seat could be filled by the time the new Congress convenes January 3. Replacements for members of the House require special elections, and the congressional districts held by the three departing members have been held by Republicans for years. With the thin majority, a highly functioning House is also far from guaranteed. The past two years of Republican House control were defined by infighting as hardline conservative factions sought to gain influence and power by openly defying their party leadership. While Johnson — at times with Trump's help — largely tamed open rebellions against his leadership, the right wing of the party is ascendant and ambitious on the heels of Trump's election victory. The Republican majority also depends on a small group of lawmakers who won tough elections by running as moderates. It remains to be seen whether they will stay onboard for some of the most extreme proposals championed by Trump and his allies. House Democratic Leader Hakeem Jeffries, meanwhile, is trying to keep Democrats relevant to any legislation that passes Congress, an effort that will depend on Democratic leaders unifying over 200 members, even as the party undergoes a postmortem of its election losses. In the Senate, GOP leaders, fresh off winning a convincing majority, are already working with Trump to confirm his Cabinet picks. Sen. John Thune of South Dakota won an internal election Wednesday to replace Sen. Mitch McConnell, the longest serving party leader in Senate history. Thune in the past has been critical of Trump but praised the incoming president during his leadership election bid. 'This Republican team is united. We are on one team,' Thune said. 'We are excited to reclaim the majority and to get to work with our colleagues in the House to enact President Trump’s agenda.' The GOP’s Senate majority of 53 seats also ensures that Republicans will have breathing room when it comes to confirming Cabinet posts, or Supreme Court justices if there is a vacancy. Not all those confirmations are guaranteed. Republicans were incredulous Wednesday when the news hit Capitol Hill that Trump would nominate Gaetz as his attorney general. Even close Trump allies in the Senate distanced themselves from supporting Gaetz, who had been facing a House Ethics Committee investigation into allegations of sexual misconduct and illicit drug use. Still, Trump on Sunday demanded that any Republican leader must allow him to make administration appointments without a vote while the Senate is in recess. Such a move would be a notable shift in power away from the Senate, yet all the leadership contenders quickly agreed to the idea. Democrats could potentially fight such a maneuver. Meanwhile, Trump's social media supporters, including Elon Musk, the world's richest man, clamored against picking a traditional Republican to lead the Senate chamber. Thune worked as a top lieutenant to McConnell, who once called the former president a 'despicable human being' in his private notes. However, McConnell made it clear that on Capitol Hill the days of Republican resistance to Trump are over.	https://www.voanews.com/a/republicans-win-218-us-house-seats-giving-trump-s-party-control-of-government-/7863427.html	2024-11-13T20:07:47-08:00	
At APEC and G20, Biden faces leaders worried about US policy changes	White House — In what will likely be his farewell appearance on the world stage, President Joe Biden faces a daunting question: what to tell world leaders wondering about potential changes in U.S. policies when President-elect Donald Trump returns to the White House with his America First agenda. Biden is set to depart for Peru and Brazil Thursday for two major economic summits. Biden is scheduled to spend Friday and Saturday in Lima with leaders of the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation forum, made up of 21 member economies that promote free trade in the region. He will be in Rio de Janeiro on Monday and Tuesday to meet with leaders of the world's 20 largest economies at the Group of 20 summit. On the way to Rio from Lima, Biden will make a brief stop at Manaus for a climate-focused engagement in Brazil's state of Amazonas. In his meetings, Biden must face allies and partners who four years ago may have been skeptical about his 'America is back' message and the durability of U.S. global commitments. These leaders saw Trump, during his first term, act to withdraw the U.S. from the Paris Climate Accord and threaten to pull out of NATO. Uncertainties about future U.S. policy will complicate efforts to reach an agenda on issues of global concern such as trade, poverty and debt alleviation, climate change, sustainable development, and green energy. 'There will be a lot of combination of lamenting, speculation, guessing about what we'll see coming first in terms of policies out of the campaign and how countries are best able to position themselves,' said Victor Cha, president of the Geopolitics and Foreign Policy Department at the Center for Strategic and International Studies. 'America's allies are vital' To these leaders, Biden's message is that 'America's allies are vital to America's national security,' said national security adviser Jake Sullivan, who previewed the trip to reporters on Wednesday. 'They make us stronger. They multiply our capability. They take a burden off of our shoulders. They contribute to our common causes,' Sullivan said. He underscored that Biden would be attending the APEC summit when U.S. alliances in the region were at an 'all-time high,' with bolstered ties with Japan, Korea, Australia and the Philippines. Biden will hold a trilateral meeting on the sidelines of APEC with President Yoon Suk Yeol of South Korea and Prime Minister Shigeru Ishiba of Japan to 'discuss the importance of institutionalizing' the progress made so that it carries forward through the transition to the new administration, Sullivan said. Whatever the questions surrounding the next administration, Biden will emphasize his faith in the 'ideals of American engagement around the world,' said Josh Lipsky, senior director of the Atlantic Council's GeoEconomics Center. 'He believes it is in the best interest of both America and the world for it to continue,' Lipsky said. 'And not one election or one president can undercut that, from his perspective.' Biden's agenda In Rio de Janeiro, Biden will 'demonstrate the strong value proposition of the United States to developing countries and lead the G20 to work together to address shared global challenges,' the White House said. He is expected to hold bilateral meetings with summit hosts Peruvian President Dina Boluarte and Brazilian President Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva. In Lima, he is set to support Peru's initiative to expand APEC's economic inclusion efforts to empower workers in the informal economy, said Matt Murray, U.S. senior official for APEC. In Rio, he will focus on workers' rights and clean economic growth and attend the launch of the Global Alliance Against Hunger and Poverty, Lula's initiative aimed at accelerating global efforts to reduce hunger and poverty by 2030. In Manaus, Biden will make history as the first sitting U.S. president to visit the Brazilian Amazon. There, he will deliver remarks on climate conservation and engage Indigenous leaders working to preserve the rainforest. Symbolic and short-lived Many of Biden's efforts will be mostly symbolic and short-lived, as the incoming U.S. administration could bring dramatically different priorities on global welfare programs and climate change. Analysts say that while the world has watched U.S. leadership swing from Republican to Democratic and back again in recent years, Chinese President Xi Jinping will seek to project an image of stability as he exerts his vision of China's increased role on the global stage. In Peru, Xi will inaugurate a $1.3 billion megaport, part of China's infrastructure investment program that has bought him influence in various parts of the world. Beijing has increased diplomatic engagement in the region, with Xi visiting 11 Latin American countries since becoming president, according to Chinese state news agency Xinhua. Summit hosts Peru and Brazil are set to honor him with state visits this month. A meeting between Biden and Xi, likely their last during Biden's term, is scheduled in Lima for Saturday. The meeting comes as Trump appoints ardent China critics in key foreign policy positions, moves that could lead to a more confrontational U.S. posture toward Beijing. Whatever the next administration decides, it's going to need to find ways to manage the 'tough, complicated relationship' between the U.S. and China, a senior official said when asked what Biden might tell Xi to expect from the incoming administration.	https://www.voanews.com/a/at-apec-and-g20-biden-faces-leaders-worried-about-us-policy-changes/7863428.html	2024-11-13T20:07:31-08:00	
US downplays impact as China, Peru set to update trade pact, open mega port	brussels — As China and Peru prepare to sign an updated free-trade agreement at this year’s Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation summit, Chinese President Xi Jinping is set to inaugurate a Chinese-financed mega port in Peru, known as Chancay, while attending the APEC meetings. China promotes the Chancay port on Latin America's Pacific coast as a key hub to boost trade connectivity with South America. The plan includes using infrastructure projects to link Chancay, reducing shipping times for goods. A senior U.S. official downplayed the port’s implications for the United States, stating that it does not complicate U.S. relationships in the region and that it is natural for Latin American countries to have diverse trade and investment partnerships beyond the U.S. Matt Murray, the U.S. senior official for APEC, spoke to VOA on Wednesday from Lima, Peru, outlining the U.S. agenda for this year’s APEC meetings. This interview has been edited for brevity and clarity. VOA: Could you unpack for us the agenda of APEC 2024? Matt Murray, U.S. senior official for APEC: APEC, as you know, is a multilateral forum with 21 member economies that account for half of global trade and 60% of global GDP. Each year, APEC is hosted by a different member economy. The United States was delighted to host in 2023, and this year, the forum has moved to Peru for 2024. APEC always focuses on three key areas: trade and investment, innovation and digitalization, and sustainable, strong, secure, inclusive and balanced growth. Peru has continued these priorities by bringing APEC economies together to discuss these issues and make progress on specific initiatives, including a renewed focus on sustainability. This year, during the energy ministerial meeting in August, Peru launched the Just Energy Transition Initiative within APEC. They have also supported new programming, focused on curbing food loss and waste in the region, which is crucial for the sustainability of our agricultural sectors. VOA: Chinese President Xi Jinping will sign an updated free-trade agreement with Peru and inaugurate a new mega port north of Lima, called Chancay. Can you talk about the implications for the United States? Murray: I think we expect countries, including APEC economies like Peru, to engage in trade and investment relationships with a variety of partners, including the People’s Republic of China. As President Xi arrives in Lima, attention will be given to areas where China has invested in Peru, as well as the trade and investment ties between the two countries. However, from the U.S. perspective, our primary focus is on our own relationship with Peru and with Latin America, particularly in terms of trade, investment and broader engagement. I don’t necessarily see this as complicating our relationship in the region. We view it as a natural part of business that Latin American countries will have diverse trade and investment partners. VOA: Given President-elect Donald Trump's stance on tariffs and the potential withdrawal from the Indo-Pacific Economic Framework, and with several IPEF members also part of APEC, how might the U.S. reassure global leaders about its commitment to deepening economic ties with other nations? Murray: Since 1989, both Democratic and Republican U.S. administrations have engaged with APEC. We view it as an opportunity to engage a wide range of partners in a consensus-based, nonbinding way. One of the key ways we reassure leaders is simply by showing up. This week, we’re showing up in a big way. The best way to demonstrate our commitment to deepening economic ties with the region is by having the president, secretary of state and U.S. trade representative all come to Lima to participate in APEC Economic Leaders Week. That, I think, demonstrates leadership and our willingness to continue engaging. VOA: What does the future look like for APEP, or Americas Partnership for Economic Prosperity, an economic initiative for Latin America, and IPEF? Murray: I don't think I can speculate on the future of these particular arrangements. As you know, this is part of our democracy. We have administrations in power that transition to new ones, which may make different or sometimes similar decisions. There are, in fact, areas where we've seen continuity from the Obama administration to the Trump administration and then to the Biden administration, and there may continue to be such continuity. So, I don’t think it's possible to speculate on any one particular issue.	https://www.voanews.com/a/us-downplays-impact-as-china-peru-set-to-update-trade-pact-open-mega-port/7863411.html	2024-11-13T18:49:53-08:00	
Explosions outside Brazil's Supreme Court leave 1 dead, force justices to evacuate	SAO PAULO — Two explosions outside Brazil's Supreme Court on Wednesday killed a man and forced the justices and staff to evacuate the building in the capital of Brasilia. The court said in a statement that two very strong blasts were heard at about 7:30 p.m. local time, shortly after Wednesday's session had finished. It added that all the justices and staff left the building safely after the incident. A police statement had said earlier that an artifact exploded outside the court. Local firefighters confirmed that one man died at the scene but did not identify him. Local media reported that the second explosion occurred about 20 seconds after the first. The incident took place in Brasilia's Three Powers Plaza, where Brazil's main government buildings, including the Supreme Court, Congress and presidential palace, are located. President Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva was not in the neighboring presidential palace at the time of the blasts, spokesperson José Chrispiniano said. Police blocked all access to the area, and the presidential security bureau was conducting a sweep of the grounds around the presidential palace. Brazil's federal police force said it was investigating and did not provide a motive. The Supreme Court in recent years has become a target for threats by far-right groups and supporters of former President Jair Bolsonaro due to its crackdown on the spread of false information. Justice Alexandre de Moraes in particular has been a focus for their ire. Earlier, another explosion was heard outside Brazil's Congress, but it apparently did not cause damages.	https://www.voanews.com/a/explosions-outside-brazil-s-supreme-court-leave-1-dead-force-justices-to-evacuate-/7863399.html	2024-11-13T18:41:44-08:00	
Conservative lawyer Ted Olson, former US solicitor general, dies at 84	washington — Former U.S. Solicitor General Ted Olson, one of the country's best-known conservative lawyers who served two Republican presidents and successfully argued on behalf of same-sex marriage, died Wednesday. He was 84. The law firm Gibson Dunn, where Olson had practiced since 1965, announced his death on its website. No cause of death was given. Olson was at the center of some of the biggest cases of recent decades, including a win on behalf of George W. Bush in the 2000 Florida presidential election recount dispute that went before the U.S. Supreme Court. 'Even in a town full of lawyers, Ted's career as a litigator was particularly prolific,' said Mitch McConnell, the longtime Senate Republican leader. 'More importantly, I count myself among so many in Washington who knew Ted as a good and decent man.' Bush made Olson his solicitor general, a post the lawyer held from 2001 to 2004. Olson had previously served in the Justice Department as an assistant attorney general during President Ronald Reagan's first term in the early 1980s. During his career, Olson argued 65 cases before the Supreme Court, according to Gibson Dunn. 'They weren't just little cases,' said Theodore Boutrous, a partner at the law firm who worked with Olson for 37 years. 'Many of them were big, blockbuster cases that helped shape our society.' Those included the Citizens United v. Federal Election Commission, a 2010 case that eliminated many limits on political giving, and a successful challenge to the Trump administration's decision to rescind the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals program. 'He's the greatest lawyer I've ever worked with or seen in action,' said Boutrous, who worked so closely with Olson that they were known at Gibson Dunn as 'the two Teds.' 'He was an entertaining and forceful advocate who could go toe to toe with the Supreme Court justices in a way few lawyers could. They respected him so much.' One of Olson's most prominent cases put him at odds with many fellow conservatives. After California adopted a ban on same-sex marriage in 2008, Olson joined forces with former adversary David Boies, who had represented Democrat Al Gore in the presidential election case, to represent California couples seeking the right to marry. During closing arguments, Olson contended that tradition or fears of harm to heterosexual unions were legally insufficient grounds to discriminate against same-sex couples. 'It is the right of individuals, not an indulgence to be dispensed by the state,' Olson said. 'The right to marry, to choose to marry, has never been tied to procreation.' A federal judge in California ruled in 2010 that the state's ban violated the U.S. Constitution. The U.S. Supreme Court let that decision stand in 2013. 'This is the most important thing I've ever done, as an attorney or a person,' Olson later said in a documentary film about the marriage case. He told The Associated Press in 2014 that the marriage case was important because it 'involves tens of thousands of people in California, but really millions of people throughout the United States and beyond that to the world.' His decision to join the case added a prominent conservative voice to the rapidly shifting views on same-sex marriage across the country. Boies remembered Olson as a giant in legal circles who 'left the law, our country, and each of us better than he found us. Few people are a hero to those that know them well. Ted was a hero to those who knew him best.' Olson's personal life also intersected tragically with the nation's history when his third wife, well-known conservative legal analyst Barbara Olson, died on September 11, 2001. She was a passenger on American Airlines Flight 77, which crashed into the Pentagon. His other high-profile clients have included quarterback Tom Brady during the 'Deflategate' scandal of 2016 and technology company Apple in a legal battle with the FBI over unlocking the phone of a shooter who killed 14 people in San Bernardino, California, in 2015. The range of his career and his stature on the national stage were unmatched, said Barbara Becker, managing partner of Gibson Dunn. In a statement, she described Olson as 'a titan of the legal profession and one of the most extraordinary and eloquent advocates of our time.'	https://www.voanews.com/a/ted-olson-former-us-solicitor-general-and-conservative-lawyer-dies-at-84-/7863357.html	2024-11-13T18:11:12-08:00	
UNMISS calls for tangible evidence of progress toward democratic elections in South Sudan	Juba, South Sudan — The United Nations Mission in South Sudan has called for tangible evidence of progress toward democratic elections the country. Briefing the United Nations Security Council this week, special representative of the secretary-general and head of UNMISS, Nicholas Haysom, told government leaders 'the clock on the extension is already ticking.' Since winning its independence in 2011, South Sudan is just beginning its fourth extension of the transitional period government, with elections now rescheduled for 2026. Speaking for Haysom, U.N. South Sudan acting spokesperson Rabindra Giri said, 'The international community needs tangible evidence that this country’s leaders and political elite are genuinely committed to a democratic future.' As the country struggles with increasing internal conflict, the delay in democratic reform affects the hopes for peace, stability and development, even beyond South Sudan's borders, impacting the entire East African region. UNMISS officials stressed that time is running out for political leaders to fulfill their obligations under the peace agreement. 'We must collectively seize the opportunity to make this extension the last and deliver the peace and democracy that the people of South Sudan deserve,' Giri said. On the streets of Juba, South Sudanese citizens were eager to talk about how the delays in implementing the peace agreement raise doubts about whether their leaders genuinely care about the nation’s well-being and are impacting their hopes for peace, stability and development. Nunu Diana, a women’s rights advocate in South Sudan, is one of them. 'I think because of the extension, personally, as a young person, I have lost morale in the governance system of the country,' Diana said. Data Gordon, an advocate for peace and gender equality, is another. 'The time for political statements without tangible and time-bound action is over,' Gorton said. 'For elections to take place as scheduled, the government needs to walk the talk.' UNMISS said it is moving ahead with support to the National Elections Commission, while Haysom highlighted civic education, preparing for voter registration, a code of conduct between political parties, civil society, media and election security among the areas that the parties could immediately address. Haysom said time is a nonrenewable resource. He said this is South Sudan’s last chance to deliver on its promise of democracy, and there is a need for sustained international support while holding South Sudan's leaders accountable to their own commitments. 'This cannot be business as usual for the parties to the peace agreement, the political elite, the guarantors of the peace agreement or the international community,' Giri said. 'We must collectively seize the opportunity to make this extension the last and deliver the peace and democracy that the people of South Sudan deserve.'	https://www.voanews.com/a/unmiss-calls-for-tangible-evidence-of-progress-toward-democratic-elections-in-south-sudan-/7863377.html	2024-11-13T18:09:06-08:00	
Six Israeli troops killed in nation's deadliest day in Lebanon	Jerusalem — Israel suffered one of the deadliest days of its ground offensive against Hezbollah in Lebanon on Wednesday when six of its soldiers were killed in combat near the border. The soldiers 'fell during combat in southern Lebanon,' the army said in a statement. Their deaths brought to 47 the number of Israeli troops who have been killed in combat with Hezbollah since September 30, when Israel sent ground forces into Lebanon. The army's announcement came after Israel Katz, Israel's new defense minister, said there would be no easing up in the war against Hezbollah. Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu on X shared an image of the 'Golani' Brigade symbol, the unit the soldiers who were killed belonged to, a green olive tree against a yellow background, with a broken heart emoji. Since September 23, Israel has stepped up its bombing campaign in Lebanon, mainly targeting Hezbollah strongholds in south Beirut and in the east and south of the country. On September 30, it sent in ground troops. The offensive came after nearly a year of cross-border exchanges of fire, launched by Hezbollah in support of its Palestinian ally Hamas following its October 7, 2023, attack on Israel that triggered the Gaza war. Strike at Aramoun Earlier on Wednesday, an Israeli strike hit Aramoun, a densely packed area south of Beirut that is outside Hezbollah's traditional strongholds. The health ministry said the strike killed six people. Lebanese state media on the same day reported a third wave of Israeli raids on Hezbollah's south Beirut bastion in 24 hours. The Israeli army, meanwhile, said it had intercepted some of the 'five projectiles' that had crossed from Lebanon into Israeli territory. Katz told senior military commanders on his first visit to the border region since his appointment last week that Israel would 'make no cease-fires, we will not take our foot off the pedal, and we will not allow any arrangement that does not include the achievement of our war objectives.' Katz added: 'We will continue to strike Hezbollah everywhere.' Israel's objectives include disarming Hezbollah and pushing the militants beyond the Litani River, which flows across southern Lebanon. After Katz's address, another airstrike hit a Beirut suburb Wednesday evening after a warning by Israel's military for residents to evacuate. Hezbollah said on Wednesday it had fired ballistic missiles at the Israeli army's headquarters in the commercial hub of Tel Aviv, which also houses the defense ministry. Contacted by AFP, the Israeli army spokesperson's unit said it would 'not to react to Hezbollah's allegations.' Lebanese authorities say more than 3,360 people have been killed since October 8, 2023, when Hezbollah and Israel began engaging in cross-border clashes. Rocket fire from Lebanon on Tuesday killed two residents of the northern Israeli city of Nahariya. The deaths brought to 45 the number of civilians killed in northern Israel as a result of rocket fire from Lebanon. Israeli hostage The Palestinian Islamic Jihad militant group, an ally of Hamas, released a video earlier on Wednesday of an Israeli hostage held in Gaza, identifying himself as Sasha Trupanov. Trupanov's mother, Lena, in a statement published by the Hostage and Missing Families Forum campaign group, urged the hostages' immediate release. When Hamas militants staged their October 7, 2023, attack, they killed about 1,200 people and about 250 hostages into the Gaza Strip. Of those, about 100 remain held hostage, while about a third of them are confirmed dead. Their bodies remain in Gaza. In the more than 13 months of war, Israel’s offensive has killed nearly 44,000 people, the health ministry in Hamas-run Gaza said Wednesday. The health ministry does not distinguish between civilians and combatants but says more than half of those killed were women and children.	https://www.voanews.com/a/six-israeli-troops-killed-in-nation-s-deadliest-day-in-lebanon-/7863368.html	2024-11-13T17:54:26-08:00	
China showcases new stealth fighter at Zhuhai air show	taipei, taiwan — China showcased its second fifth-generation stealth fighter jet this week, the J-35A, at the country’s premier aviation exhibition in the southern province of Guangdong, an achievement state media said puts Beijing on par with the United States. Military analysts say China’s ability to field two different types of stealth fighter jets marks an important milestone in Beijing’s development of military technology, but it still has a way to go to catch up with the U.S. With its J-20 and J-35A stealth fighter jets, China claims it is the first country to operate two types of stealth fighter jets after the U.S., which has its F-22 and F-35. Russia currently has one stealth fighter in operation, the Su-57, with another, the Su-75 Checkmate, still in development. The J-35A made its debut on the opening day of the air show in Zhuhai, performing aerobatic displays. In addition to the J-35A and J-20, two of Russia’s Su-57s were on exhibit for the first time at the biennial air show, which lasts until Sunday. Higher profile as supplier Song Zhongping, a Beijing-based defense expert, said China's possession of both the J-35 series and the J-20 stealth fighters brings with it benefits for Beijing in combat scenarios and raises its profile as a supplier of advanced military hardware. 'China is now one of the few countries worldwide with the capability to field two types of stealth fighters simultaneously,' Song told VOA. 'The advanced arms market should not be dominated solely by the U.S., Russia and Europe. China must also have a place, which will enhance China's defense industry strength on the global stage.' Song said that the J-35 has incorporated numerous new technologies that significantly improve its stealth capabilities compared with the United States’ F-35. In a post on China’s X-like social media platform Weibo, Hu Xijin, the former editor-in-chief of the party-backed Global Times, called the display of the new fighter jet a 'strong and decisive response' to 'Washington’s overreach to stifle China’s military achievements.' 'China now has its own versions of the most attractive American equipment,' Hu said in the post. 'The U.S. has the F-22 and F-35; China now has the J-20 and J-35. The U.S. has THAAD [an anti-missile system], and China has the HQ-19 [surface-to-air missile system].' Analysts say Russia’s participation this year, showcasing its Su-57 alongside China’s J-35 and J-20 at Zhuhai, not only highlights how Moscow and Beijing are working together in the global arms market but their closeness in the wake of Russia's war in Ukraine. Yang Tai-yuan, a researcher at the Centre for Advanced Technology at Taiwan’s Tamkang University, said that while China’s technology is improving, its pilots lack real combat experience. 'The J-35 looks very similar to the American F-35. Was there copying involved? I think it’s inevitable. To surpass the U.S. may not be possible,' Yang said. 'While the equipment may match the U.S. in many aspects, China's operational experience is not as robust.' Yang said other challenges remain, including getting more pilots trained and helping them transition from Beijing’s third-generation J-7 and J-8 fighter jets to the highly digital systems of fifth-generation jets. He also noted that while it takes at least 1,000 flight hours for a pilot to become experienced, People's Liberation Army pilots have fewer training hours compared with U.S. and NATO pilots, which makes it harder to develop situational handling experience. He also pointed out that China’s role for its 'dual stealth fighters' remains unclear. While the J-20 primarily focuses on air superiority, the operational roles for the J-35 are not yet defined. In terms of the global market, the United States' F-35 has already been sold to 20 U.S. allies around the world. Analysts say it is highly unlikely that China will be able to sell its J-35 to countries that have the capability of operating a stealth fighter. Even Singapore, which has deep economic ties with China, decided to buy 20 F-35s. There seems no way for the J-35 to compete against F-35 in the global fighter market, according to experts at the show. Significant impacts Timothy R. Heath, a senior international defense researcher at the RAND Corporation, believes stealth fighters may enhance the survivability of Chinese naval aviation. In a written response to VOA, Heath said China’s 'dual stealth fighters' approach will have significant geopolitical and military impacts, prompting some Asia-Pacific nations to consider military cooperation with China. 'On the operational side, Southeast Asia and Indian Ocean coastal nations may feel pressured, as China’s carrier-based stealth fighters could become a potent tool against their naval forces,' Heath said. Heath added that the J-35’s political impact is significant but unlikely to drastically affect the situation in the Taiwan Strait, as China already has substantial air power over Taiwan. Beijing considers self-ruled Taiwan a breakaway province that must one day reunite with the mainland, by force if necessary. Stealth fighters are dependent on carriers, which are vulnerable to U.S. submarines or long-range missiles, limiting their operational value in a Taiwan conflict. Heath said that in a Taiwan Strait conflict, if Chinese carriers ventured beyond coastal anti-access protection, their operations might be short-lived. However, he added, deploying the J-35 from land-based air force units could enhance its effectiveness in operations over Taiwan.

FBI raids Polymarket CEO's home, seizing phone, electronics	NEW YORK — Federal law enforcement agents raided the downtown New York home of Polymarket CEO Shayne Coplan on Wednesday, seizing his phone and electronics, the company confirmed. The early morning raid of Coplan's SoHo apartment followed last week's presidential election, in which bettors on Polymarket, an offshore, crypto-fueled election gambling website, had for weeks put Donald Trump's odds drastically higher than those of Vice President Kamala Harris, in sharp divergence from opinion polls. Coplan, Polymarket's 26-year-old founder, was roused from his bed at 6 a.m. by FBI agents demanding he give them his electronic devices. The DOJ is investigating Polymarket for allegedly allowing U.S.-based users to bet on the site, Bloomberg News reported Wednesday evening. Polymarket declined to comment on those allegations, but a spokesperson said the FBI raid was 'obvious political retribution by the outgoing administration against Polymarket for providing a market that correctly called the 2024 presidential election.' The company told Reuters that Coplan had not been arrested or taken into custody. The FBI declined to comment. The Department of Justice and the White House did not respond to requests for comment on the raid. In the run-up to the presidential election, the site gained widespread attention for the way it placed Trump's odds high above those of Harris, when opinion polls had for months shown the race in a dead heat. Polymarket, which does not allow trading in the U.S., also gained scrutiny after a mystery French trader, known as the Polymarket whale, made large bets on Trump winning the election. The trader's huge wagers came in tandem with a dramatic rise in Trump's chances on the exchanges. He walked away with more than $46 million in profit. Last week, France's gambling regulator said it was examining whether Polymarket complies with French laws.	https://www.voanews.com/a/fbi-raids-polymarket-ceo-s-home-seizing-phone-electronics/7863348.html	2024-11-13T17:18:53-08:00	
Suspected Chinese hack of US telecoms reveals broader plot	washington — A hack of U.S. telecommunications systems linked to China that initially appeared to focus on the American presidential campaigns goes much deeper, according to investigators, and is likely part of a vast effort by Beijing to spy on the United States. The FBI and the U.S. Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency warned on Wednesday that the breach first detected late last month has now 'revealed a broad and significant cyber espionage campaign.' The two agencies said in a statement that their investigation has confirmed Chinese-linked hackers compromised the networks of multiple U.S. telecommunication companies, gaining access to a potential treasure trove of information. Specifically, they said the hackers would have been able to access customer call records and infiltrate the private communications of a select number of government officials and politicians. Additionally, the hackers appear to have been able to copy information requested by U.S. law enforcement as a result of court orders. 'We expect our understanding of these compromises to grow as the investigation continues,' the FBI and CISA said. 'We encourage any organization that believes it might be a victim to engage its local FBI field office or CISA,' they added. The two agencies first announced they were investigating a breach of U.S. telecommunications systems in late October, less than two weeks before U.S. voters cast their ballots in nationwide elections. Word of the breach followed a report by The New York Times that Chinese hackers were thought to have broken into telecommunications networks to target the campaign of President-elect Donald Trump — including phones used by Trump and Vice President-elect JD Vance. The Trump campaign confirmed the breach in a statement to VOA. Separately, a person familiar with the investigation told VOA that people affiliated with the campaign of Vice President Kamala Harris were also targeted. The Chinese Embassy in Washington at the time dismissed the U.S. hacking allegations as disinformation, calling the U.S. 'the origin and the biggest perpetrator of cyberattacks.' The embassy has yet to respond to the latest FBI and CISA allegations. U.S. intelligence agencies warned for months that foreign adversaries were using a combination of cyberattacks and influence operations to meddle with the November 5 U.S. presidential election. In addition, reports issued by private cybersecurity firms indicated a significant uptick in activity by actors linked to Russia, China and Iran. All three nations have repeatedly denied accusations of election meddling. U.S. agencies, led by CISA and the FBI, have long warned that China-linked hackers have burrowed into U.S. computer systems and networks, in some cases hiding for years. The China-linked group, known as Volt Typhoon, has been 'positioning itself to launch destructive cyberattacks that would jeopardize the physical safety of Americans,' according to an advisory issued in February. 'What we've found to date is likely the tip of the iceberg,' CISA Director Jen Easterly said in a statement at the time.	https://www.voanews.com/a/suspected-chinese-hack-of-us-telecoms-reveals-broader-plot/7863318.html	2024-11-13T16:47:48-08:00	
World’s largest coral discovered in Solomon Islands	Washington — National Geographic scientists say they’ve discovered the world’s largest coral near the remote Solomon Islands in the Pacific Ocean — an undersea mass that is so big, it can be seen from space. The man who found it, Manu San Felix, director of cinematography for National Geographic Society’s Pristine Seas, a program dedicated to marine conservation, says the giant organism measures 34 meters wide and 32 meters long and is 'close to the size of a cathedral.' 'I see this as a living library that has the information of the conditions of the oceans for centuries,' he told reporters this week, underscoring it is a reminder of the need to better protect the ocean from global climate change. Eric Brown, a Pristine Seas coral scientist, said the enormous coral species, Pavona clavus, is healthy and has 'high reproductive potential,' making it essential to help other coral reef ecosystems recover from the damage of a warming ocean. Corals 'are very vulnerable ecosystems. So, it’s important for us to do whatever we can to protect these environments that are both small and mighty,' Brown said at a Tuesday press briefing to announce the find. The announcement comes as world leaders gather for the United Nations climate conference, known as COP29, in Azerbaijan. Attendees are trying to agree on new mechanisms to finance a global energy transition to renewables and help nations like the Pacific Islands pay for the cost of adapting to rising oceans. Pristine Seas is also encouraging nations to designate marine protected areas, or MPAs. The goal is to protect 30% of the world’s oceans by 2030. Palau President Surangel Whipps Jr. is attending the summit. Palau has walled off 80% of its waters to development, while the nearby Pacific Island nation of Niue has designated 40% of its waters for protection. 'It cannot just be big countries. Small countries need to do their part,' he told VOA in an interview. 'So, it's all of us working together ... protecting our oceans, because we know that healthy oceans are an important part of the ecosystem and important in regulating climate.' Solomon Islands Prime Minister Jeremiah Manele agreed. 'Our survival depends on healthy coral reefs, so this exciting discovery underlines the importance of protecting and sustaining them for future generations,' he said in a press release. But so far, the Solomon Islands has created a network of 79 designated ocean conservation areas — less than 1% of its exclusive economic zone. What’s more, its economy is largely dependent on forestry — the very industry that threatens the viability of coral through sedimentation. 'All that sediment is going onto a reef, and it’s smothering the reef, thereby preventing the corals from being able to feed, to grow, to reproduce,' Molly Timmers, Pristine Seas lead scientist on the Solomon Islands, said at the press briefing. According to the Observatory of Economic Complexity, an online platform that seeks to visualize the distribution of international trade, the Solomons exported $308 million in rough wood in 2022, with $260 million of it going to China. VOA asked Chief Dennis Marita, director of culture at the Ministry of Culture & Tourism, how the government can find a balance. 'Much of the logging activities are happening on the mainland' away from the coral, Marita said in an interview, but 'there needs to be a serious awareness about the impacts of what’s happening in the logging industry to the marine environment.' Marita sees this coral discovery as a way to attract researchers, biologists and tourists to bring in revenue to the small island nation of 740,000 people. Earlier this week, the Solomon Islands signed an agreement with China to provide visa-free travel between the two countries. 'Suddenly, people will start coming to the island, but then we need to be prepared for them, and also, we need to ensure that the coral is safeguarded,' Marita said. Dr. Daniel Barshis of Old Dominion University’s Ecological Sciences Department in Norfolk, Virginia, said that idea has merit. 'I would imagine this discovery would draw tourists to the area, similar to how old-growth trees inspire folks to visit,' he told VOA via email. 'The fact that [corals] like this still exist is a reminder that coral reefs are still surviving and deserve us working as hard as we possibly can to save them from some of the worst-case scenarios if we don't reverse course on greenhouse gas emissions as soon as possible,' said Barshis. William Yang contributed to this report.	https://www.voanews.com/a/world-s-largest-coral-discovered-in-solomon-islands/7863036.html	2024-11-13T16:09:31-08:00

US court overturns 1983 Beirut bombing victims' $1.68B judgment against Iran bank	new york — A U.S. appeals court on Wednesday threw out a $1.68 billion judgment against Iran's central bank that had been won by family members of troops killed and injured in the 1983 bombing of the U.S. Marine Corps barracks in Beirut. The 2nd U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals in Manhattan said a lower court judge should have addressed questions of state law before ruling against Bank Markazi and Luxembourg intermediary Clearstream Banking, a unit of Deutsche Boerse. In a 3-0 decision, the panel also rejected a claim that a 2019 federal law designed to make it easier to seize Iranian assets held outside the United States waived Bank Markazi's sovereign immunity. That law 'neither abrogates Bank Markazi's jurisdictional immunity nor provides an independent grant of subject matter jurisdiction,' Circuit Judge Robert Sack wrote. The court returned the case to U.S. District Loretta Preska, in Manhattan to address state law questions in the 11-year-old case, and whether the case can proceed in Bank Markazi's absence. Bombing victims sought to hold Iran liable for providing material support for the October 23, 1983, suicide attack that killed 241 U.S. service members, by seizing bond proceeds held by Clearstream in a blocked account on Bank Markazi's behalf. Bank Markazi claimed immunity under the Foreign Sovereign Immunities Act, which generally shields foreign governments from liability in U.S. courts. Lawyers for the plaintiffs did not immediately respond to requests for comment. Bank Markazi's and Clearstream's lawyers did not immediately respond to similar requests. Iran, other U.S.-designated sponsors of terrorism, and banks accused of providing services to terrorists face thousands of claims in U.S. courts by victims and their families. It is often difficult for these claimants to collect judgments. In the Bank Markazi case, the plaintiffs sued in 2013 to partially satisfy a $2.65 billion default judgment they had won against Iran in 2007. Another judge dismissed the case in 2015, but the 2nd Circuit Court revived it in 2017. Then in 2020, the U.S. Supreme Court ordered a fresh review in light of the 2019 law, which then-President Donald Trump signed as part of the National Defense Authorization Act. The plaintiffs have said they hold more than $4 billion of judgments against Iran and have been unable to collect for decades. The case is Peterson et al v. Bank Markazi et al, 2nd U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals, No. 15-690.	https://www.voanews.com/a/beirut-bombing-victims-1-68-billion-iran-judgment-overturned-by-us-appeals-court-/7863044.html	2024-11-13T16:03:27-08:00

Iran ready for possible oil export curbs after Trump election	Dubai, United Arab Emirates — Iran has made plans to sustain its oil production and exports and is ready for possible oil restrictions from a Trump administration in the U.S., Oil Minister Mohsen Paknejad said on Wednesday, according to the oil ministry's news website Shana. In 2018, then-U.S. President Donald Trump withdrew from a 2015 nuclear pact with Iran and re-imposed sanctions that hurt Iran's oil sector, with production dropping to 2.1 million barrels per day, or bpd, during his presidency. 'Required measures have been taken. I will not go into detail but our colleagues within the oil sector have taken measures to deal with the restrictions that will occur and there is no reason to be concerned,' Paknejad said. In recent years, Iranian oil production has rebounded to around 3.2 million barrels per day according to the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries, of which Iran is a member. Iranian oil exports have climbed this year to near multi-year highs of 1.7 million bpd despite U.S. sanctions. Chinese refiners buy most of its supply. Beijing says it doesn't recognize unilateral U.S. sanctions.	https://www.voanews.com/a/iran-ready-for-possible-oil-export-curbs-after-trump-election/7863028.html	2024-11-13T15:27:09-08:00	
Ukraine drone attacks spark fires in Russia's Bryansk, Kaluga regions	Ukrainian overnight drone attacks have set several non-residential buildings on fire in Russia's Kaluga and Bryansk regions, regional governors said on Sunday.

US overdose deaths down, giving experts hope for enduring decline	NEW YORK — The decline in U.S. drug overdose deaths appears to have continued this year, giving experts hope the nation is seeing sustained improvement in the persistent epidemic. There were about 97,000 overdose deaths in the 12-month period that ended June 30, according to provisional Centers for Disease Control and Prevention data released Wednesday. That's down 14% from the estimated 113,000 for the previous 12-month period. 'This is a pretty stunning and rapid reversal of drug overdose mortality numbers,' said Brandon Marshall, a Brown University researcher who studies overdose trends. Overdose death rates began steadily climbing in the 1990s because of opioid painkillers, followed by waves of deaths led by other opioids like heroin and — more recently — illicit fentanyl. Provisional data had indicated a slight decline for 2023, and the tally released Wednesday showed that the downward trend has kept going. Of course, there have been moments in the last several years when U.S. overdose deaths seemed to have plateaued or even started to go down, only to rise again, Marshall noted. 'This seems to be substantial and sustained,' Marshall said. 'I think there's real reason for hope here.' Experts aren't certain about the reasons for the decline, but they cite a combination of possible factors. One is COVID-19. In the worst days of the pandemic, addiction treatment was hard to get, and people were socially isolated — with no one around to help if they overdosed. 'During the pandemic we saw such a meteoric rise in drug overdose deaths that it's only natural we would see a decrease,' said Farida Ahmad of the CDC's National Center for Health Statistics. Still, overdose deaths are well above what they were at the beginning of the COVID-19 pandemic. The recent numbers could represent the fruition of years of efforts to increase the availability of the overdose-reversing drug naloxone, and addiction treatments such as buprenorphine, said Erin Winstanley, a University of Pittsburgh professor who researches drug overdose trends. Marshall said such efforts likely are being aided by money from settlements of opioid-related lawsuits, brought by state, local and Native American governments against drugmakers, wholesalers and pharmacies. Settlement funds have been rolling out to small towns and big cities across the U.S., and some have started spending the money on naloxone and other measures. Some experts have wondered about changes in the drug supply. Xylazine, a sedative, has been increasingly detected in illegally manufactured fentanyl, and experts are sorting out exactly how it's affecting overdoses. In the latest CDC data, overdose death reports are down in 45 states. Increases occurred in Alaska, Nevada, Oregon, Utah and Washington. The most dramatic decreases were seen in North Carolina and Ohio, but CDC officials voiced a note of caution. Some jurisdictions have had lags in getting death records to federal statisticians — particularly North Carolina, where death investigations have slowed because of understaffing at the state medical examiner's office. The CDC made estimates to try to account for incomplete death records, but the decline in some places may ultimately turn out not to be as dramatic as initial numbers suggest. Another limitation of the provisional data is that it doesn't detail what's happening in different groups of people. Recent research noted the overdose deaths in Black and Native Americans have been growing disproportionately larger. 'We really need more data from the CDC to learn whether these declines are being experienced in all racial ethnic subgroups,' Marshall said.	https://www.voanews.com/a/us-overdose-deaths-down-giving-experts-hope-for-enduring-decline/7862958.html	2024-11-13T13:41:51-08:00	
After declaring end to cholera outbreak, Zimbabwe sees new cases	Harare, Zimbabwe — Zimbabwe has recorded new cases of cholera several months after declaring the end of an outbreak that killed more than 700 people over an 18-month period. On Wednesday, Zimbabwe confirmed a new outbreak of cholera has been recorded in the district of Kariba — on the border with Zambia — where 21 cases have been confirmed and one person died. Dr. Godfrey Muza, the Kariba district medical officer, said the government is working to contain the situation: 'We have set up cholera equipment camp and also some oral rehydration points within the affected villages,' said Muza. 'We are getting assistance from our local and regional partners like MSF [Medecins Sans Frontieres, also known as Doctors Without Borders] and UNICEF. And our teams are on the ground doing risk communication and community engagement activities on health promotion, hygiene promotion and assisting the community in terms of improving sanction.' In August, the Zimbabwe government declared that the 18-month long cholera outbreak was over. The outbreak affected up to 35,000 people and claimed more than 700 lives. Zimbabwe has dealt with cholera outbreaks in the past. In 2008, an outbreak resulted in more than 98,000 cases and more than 4,000 reported deaths. Independent health experts such as Dr. Norman Matara of Zimbabwe Doctors for Human Rights said the government needs to address the conditions that enable the waterborne disease to spread. 'In public health, we often say cholera is a disease of poverty which mainly affects people with inadequate access to safe water and basic sanitation,' said Matara. 'In Zimbabwe, we have witnessed perennial cholera outbreaks in recent years and these outbreaks are being caused by a lack of safe drinking water supply and a broken-down sanitation system which leaves residents in densely populated communities surrounded by flowing sewer. This sewer will then contaminate alternative sources of water such as shower wells, streams, rivers and even boreholes resulting in people drinking or eating food contaminated with the cholera bacteria.' He said that those conditions have been chronic over the years in Zimbabwe, contributing to the repeated outbreaks. How does Zimbabwe get out of this cycle of recurring cholera outbreaks? 'We need to make sure that our hospitals are well-supposed with the real addressing solutions and medicines so that people can be assisted,' said Matara. ' ... Also, those high-risk communities, especially in towns and urban cities, we may give them the oral cholera vaccine so that they may be protected. In the long term, the government needs to invest more in proper sanitation facilities and infrastructure as well as making sure that people are provided with clean safe water for drinking and cooking.' Matara said he hopes the current outbreak is contained quickly and does not spread to other parts of Zimbabwe. But with raw sewage flowing in some streets of Harare, it might be a question of time.	https://www.voanews.com/a/zimbabwe-sees-new-cholera-cases-after-declaring-end-to-outbreak/7862861.html	2024-11-13T13:35:17-08:00	
Birth control, abortion pill requests surge since Trump election	Hours after Donald Trump was elected president for the second time, Dr. Clayton Alfonso had two messages from patients seeking to replace their IUDs. Over the next few days, three women inquired about getting their tubes tied. All of them said the election was the reason they were making these choices now. Requests for long-term birth control and permanent sterilizations have surged across the nation since the election, doctors told The Associated Press. And companies that sell emergency contraception and abortion pills say they're seeing significant spikes in requests from people who are stockpiling the medications — one saw a 966% increase in sales of emergency contraception from the week before in the 60 hours after the election. 'I saw this bump after the Trump election in 2016' and after Roe vs. Wade was overturned in 2022, said Alfonso, an OB-GYN at Duke University in North Carolina. 'But the patients seem more afraid this time.' Although anti-abortion advocates are pressing Trump for more restrictions on abortion pills, it's unclear what — if much — will be done regarding access to contraceptives of any kind during the second Trump administration. Trump told a Pittsburgh television station in May that he was open to supporting regulations on contraception. But after media reports on the interview, he wrote on his social media platform Truth Social that he 'has never and will never' advocate for restricting birth control and other contraceptives. Alfonso said his patients want to replace still-effective IUDs and 'restart' the 3-to-12-year clock on them before the inauguration. He also said the women are particularly concerned about IUDs, which have been attacked by abortion opponents who believe life begins when an egg is fertilized. Experts believe the devices work mostly by blocking fertilization, but also may make it harder for a fertilized egg to implant in the womb. A patient who requested a tubal ligation Tuesday told Alfonso she doesn't want kids and is 'just absolutely terrified of either forced pregnancy or inability to access contraception.' Pittsburgh OB-GYN and abortion provider Dr. Grace Ferguson said more of her patients are scheduling IUD insertions or stockpiling emergency contraception, telling her upfront that it's 'because of the upcoming administration change.' One patient, Mara Zupko, said she wants prescription emergency contraception since she's on the cusp of the weight limit for Plan B, the most well-known over-the-counter type. Her husband is getting a vasectomy. 'We always kind of teetered on whether we wanted children or not,' said Zupko, 27. 'But as the world has become scarier and scarier, we realized we didn't want to bring a child into that environment. And I also have several health risks.' Women are also turning to companies that sell emergency contraception online or offer abortion pills mifepristone and misoprostol through telehealth — something that's been happening even before the election, but that some companies say has accelerated. A study earlier this year showed the abortion pill supplier Aid Access received about 48,400 requests from across the U.S. for so-called 'advance provision' pills from September 2021 through April 2023 — with requests highest right after news leaked about Roe being overturned but before the formal announcement. Other research found that more women had their tubes tied post-Roe, with the biggest increases in states that ban abortion. Mifepristone has a shelf life of about five years and misoprostol around two years, according to Plan C, an organization that provides information about medical abortions. Plan B typically has a shelf life of four years. Telehealth company Wisp saw orders for abortion pills spike 600% between Election Day and the following day. And between Nov. 6 and 11, the company saw a 460% increase in sales of its emergency contraception and birth control offerings. At Gen Z-focused Winx Health, which sells emergency contraception called Restart, company leaders saw a 966% increase in sales in the 60 hours following the election compared with the week before. Sales of 'value packs' of Restart — four doses instead of one — were up more than 7,000% in the past week. 'Morning after pills' are legal in all states, but Winx co-founder Cynthia Plotch said many people seem confused about what emergency contraception is compared to abortion pills. In a 2023 poll by the health policy research organization KFF, a majority of responders said they know these two things aren't the same, but only 27% reported knowing emergency contraceptive pills cannot end a pregnancy. Doctors agree confusion around morning after pills may explain some of the stockpiling. But Alfonso at Duke suspects most people are doing this for the same reason they are seeking longer-term methods of birth control: to avoid abortion by preventing pregnancy in the first place. Alfonso predicts the birth control and abortion pill surge may level out like it did in 2016 and 2022. If the new administration 'is not focused on health care right away,' he said, 'then I think it'll go to the back of people's minds until it picks up in the media.'	https://www.voanews.com/a/birth-control-abortion-pill-requests-surge-since-trump-election/7862869.html	2024-11-13T12:22:25-08:00	
New storms and flooding in Spain threaten hard-hit Valencia again	Madrid — New storms in Spain caused school closures and train cancellations on Wednesday, two weeks after flash floods in Valencia and other parts of the country killed more than 220 people and destroyed thousands of homes. Coastal areas of Valencia were placed under the highest alert on Wednesday evening. Forecasters said up to 180 millimeters (7 inches) of rain could fall there within five hours. Cleanup efforts in parts of Valencia hardest hit by the Oct. 29 storm were still continuing, and there were concerns over what more rain could bring to streets still covered with mud and debris. In southern Malaga province, streets were flooded, while 3,000 people near the Guadalhorce river were moved from their homes as a preventive measure. Schools across the province were closed, along with many stores. High-speed AVE train service was canceled between Malaga and Madrid as well as Barcelona and Valencia. There were no reports of any deaths. Spanish weather forecaster AEMET put Malaga on red alert, saying up to 70 millimeters (roughly 3 inches) of rain had accumulated in an hour. Parts of Tarragona province in the east also faced heavy rain and remained under red alert. The forecast in Malaga delayed the start of the Billie Jean King Cup tennis finals between Spain and Poland, which was set for Wednesday. The storm system affecting Spain is caused by warm air that collides with stagnant cold air and forms powerful rain clouds. Experts say that drought and flood cycles are increasing with climate change.	https://www.voanews.com/a/new-storms-and-flooding-in-spain-threaten-hard-hit-valencia-again/7862848.html	2024-11-13T12:17:01-08:00	
Trump's unexpected pick for Pentagon chief is decorated veteran, Fox News host	Pentagon — President-elect Donald Trump has made a largely unexpected pick to run the world’s largest military, nominating Fox News host and decorated veteran Pete Hegseth to be defense secretary. Trump has picked someone who has no previous experience in government or in running a large business. But the Army National Guard officer and 'Fox and Friends' weekend host has raised his profile through hinting at several changes to the Defense Department. Hegseth has said he opposes diversity, equity and inclusion programs, or DEI, which he has called 'woke.' He has questioned the role of women in combat positions, all of which were opened to women by Secretary of Defense Ash Carter in January 2016. Since then, women have earned positions as Green Berets, Army Rangers and Navy combat-craft crewman after completing the same grueling tests as men. Hegseth, a graduate of Princeton and Harvard, authored the book 'The War on Warriors,' which blames the military’s DEI programs for its recruiting crisis. 'There just aren’t enough lesbians from San Francisco who want to join the 82nd Airborne. Not only do the lesbians not join, but those very same ads turn off the young, patriotic, Christian men who have traditionally filled our ranks,' he wrote. The nominee has also hinted he could target military leaders, including Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff Gen. C.Q. Brown, to push out those who have supported DEI programs. 'First of all, you’ve got to fire the chairman of the Joint Chiefs' and 'any general that was involved, any general, admiral, whatever,' he told podcast host Shawn Ryan earlier this year. Hegseth served tours of duty in Iraq, Afghanistan and Guantanamo Bay as an infantry officer and has pushed to make the U.S. military more lethal. Trump has praised his pick as 'tough, smart and a true believer in America First.' Hegseth’s nomination will need to be confirmed by a Senate majority. Republicans currently hold the majority by at least three seats. One former Pentagon official, who spoke to VOA on condition of anonymity to discuss a nomination before a Senate vote, praised Hegseth’s dedication to American troops and veterans. 'He will fight for them because he really cares,' the former official said. Other national security officials, who also spoke to VOA on condition of anonymity, said they were surprised by the pick. After Congressman Mike Waltz of Florida was chosen to be Trump’s national security adviser, many had expected the secretary of defense position to be filled by one of the established national security heavy-hitters in the Republican party, such as U.S. Rep. Mike Rogers of Alabama, who chairs the House Armed Services committee, or a Senate Armed Services committee member such as Joni Ernst of Iowa or Tom Cotton of Arkansas. Both are veterans. The Defense Department oversees more than 2.5 million active-duty and National Guard troops and has a budget that is expected to exceed $800 billion this year. Trump had a rocky relationship with defense secretaries in his first administration. His first secretary of defense, retired Gen. Jim Mattis, resigned in protest of Trump’s treatment of allies and his decision to withdraw all U.S. troops from Syria. His other Senate-confirmed secretary of defense, Mark Esper, has called the president-elect 'unfit for office.' Ahead of the election, Trump told podcaster Joe Rogan that his 'biggest mistake' in his first term was appointing 'bad people,' including 'neocons.' Hegseth was the executive director for Concerned Veterans for America, a group funded by the Koch brothers that advocated greater privatization of the Department of Veterans Affairs. He was reportedly under consideration to run the Department of Veterans Affairs in the first Trump administration.	https://www.voanews.com/a/trump-s-unexpected-pick-for-pentagon-chief-is-decorated-veteran-fox-news-host/7862840.html	2024-11-13T12:16:43-08:00	
Mexican lawmakers reelect human rights agency leader criticized for not addressing abuses	mexico city — Legislators from Mexico's ruling party reelected the head of the National Human Rights Commission on Wednesday despite widespread opposition and her failure to call out the government for abuses. The reelection of Rosario Piedra Ibarra in a party-line Senate vote appeared to be another example of the ruling Morena party's attempts to weaken independent oversight bodies. Morena has proposed eliminating a host of other oversight, transparency and freedom-of-information agencies, claiming they cost too much to run. Mexico's civic and nonprofit rights groups have been almost unanimous in their criticism of Piedra's reelection. 'This is an undeserved prize for a career marked by inaction, the loss of independence and the weakening of the institution,' the Miguel Agustin Pro Juarez human rights center wrote on social media. Piedra is a committed supporter of former President Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador, who left office on September 30. She once affirmed that none of the deaths caused by the armed forces under his administration were illegal or unjustified, and she shared the former president's delight in attacking and criticizing other independent human rights groups. Commission issues few recommendations Since her first election in 2019, Piedra has done little to investigate allegations of massacres or extrajudicial killings by soldiers and members of the militarized National Guard, to whom Lopez Obrador gave sweeping powers. Despite receiving over 1,800 citizen complaints against the armed forces between 2020 and 2023, her commission issued only 39 recommendations, and most of the few military cases her commission did follow up on involved abuses committed under previous administrations. The rights commission has the power to make non-binding recommendations to government agencies. If they do not agree to follow the recommendations, they are at least required by law to explain why. Piedra has almost exclusively focused the commission's work on issuing recommendations in cases where people have not received proper health care at government-run hospitals. Those recommendations accomplish little, because they don't address the underlying problem of underfunded, poorly equipped hospitals forced to handle too many patients. At times Piedra acted as if human rights violations no longer existed under Lopez Obrador. In 2019, she expressed disbelief when asked about the killing of journalists, despite the fact that almost a dozen were killed in Lopez Obrador's first year in office. 'Are they killing journalists?' she said with an expression of disbelief. 'Her actions appear to support impunity ' Piedra comes from a well-known activist family: Her mother founded one of Mexico's first groups to demand answers for families whose relatives had been abducted and disappeared by the government in the 1960s and '70s. But even her mother's group, the Eureka Committee, did not support Piedra's reelection. 'Her actions appear to support impunity for the perpetrators of governmental terrorism, and the government's line of obedience and forgetting' rights abuses, the committee wrote in a statement. Piedra broke with two important traditions: she was a member of the ruling party up until she was elected to her first term in 2019. The job has usually gone to nonpartisan human rights experts. And she has openly endorsed and supported government policies and actions. Previous heads of the commission had a more critical relationship with the government. Piedra also failed to make the final cut for candidates for the post this year in a congressional examination of their qualifications, but was put on the ballot anyway. That's important because similar evaluation committees will decide who gets on the ballot in judicial reforms that make federal judges stand for election next year. Activists worry that the same kind of favoritism will come into play in the election of judges. 'This decision comes after a selection process in which she (Piedra) wasn't found to be the most qualified,' a coalition of rights groups said in a statement. 'That reveals the political, partisan considerations that put her onto the ballot.' She also apparently falsified a letter of recommendation; a bishop and human rights activist said a letter she presented to support her reelection had not been signed by him. Piedra will serve under new President Claudia Sheinbaum, another devoted follower of Lopez Obrador, who took office October 1. On Sheinbaum's first day in office, the army killed six migrants near the Guatemalan border; 10 days later, soldiers and National Guard killed three bystanders in the northern border city of Nuevo Laredo while chasing suspects. Sheinbaum's third week in office was capped by the killing of a crusading Catholic priest who had been threatened by gangs, and a lopsided encounter in northern Sinaloa state in which soldiers killed 19 drug cartel suspects, but suffered not a scratch themselves. That awakened memories of past human rights abuses, like a 2014 incident in which soldiers killed about a dozen cartel suspects after they had surrendered. The purportedly leftist government has been quick to criticize human rights groups and activists who expose abuses. In June, an outspoken volunteer advocate for missing people found an apparent body dumping ground with human remains in Mexico City, embarrassing ruling party officials who had done little to look for such clandestine grave sites. City prosecutors lashed out at her, claiming 'the chain of custody' of the evidence had been manipulated, which could lead to charges.	https://www.voanews.com/a/mexican-lawmakers-reelect-head-of-human-rights-agency-who-did-not-address-abuses-/7862765.html	2024-11-13T11:55:36-08:00	
Experts push contract farming to boost Africa food systems, farmers’ income	Nairobi — As African farmers struggle with unpredictability caused by climate change, some are looking into contract farming, which involves growing a certain crop for a price set in advance. About 400 people attended the International Conference on Contract Farming in Nairobi this week to learn more about the practice. Peris Wanjiku, the conference director, said such agreements can help solve the challenges that many smallholder farmers face in Africa. 'It's always important to farm with a plan. I believe it's not enough to simply plant a crop, whatever it is, without knowing where it will end up,' Wanjiku said. 'Farmers should know beforehand what to grow and where to sell. This is why contract farming is so important, as it provides the framework for certainty and sustainability. 'But it's not only about the traditional farmer. I believe we can extend the benefit of contract farming to those who may not be farmers themselves right now, but they own a piece of land.' Experts say the growing interest in contract farming is associated with increasingly complicated systems in food production, marketing and distribution, which has made it difficult for farmers to meet consumers' demands. Contract farming, experts say, is an instrument that manages and reduces production risks for both parties. Wilson Milito Ole-Rampei, a vegetable farmer in Kenya, is attending the conference and is optimistic that the practice would help him. 'I will benefit because if, for example, I am growing vegetables, we will arrange with them to get a market. They will give me their technical advice, then our arid land will be used. Because of [a] shortage of rain, we will do irrigation. I would have knowledge of what I am growing,' Ole-Rampei said. An economist for the U.N.’s Food and Agriculture Organization, Lan Li, said contract farming is often a good deal for small-scale farmers. 'It sets the agreements on what products to produce, quantity, and price,' Li said. 'As such, it helps secure more stable income and better production planning for producers. It can improve access to inputs for small-scale holder farmers, technical assistance training, and financing solutions.' African farmers have seen reduced harvests due to global warming and drought. For many, a lack of knowledge and skills also contributes to low food production. In areas where farmers can produce enough food, they sometimes face obstacles such as bad roads or insecurity that prevent them from getting to market. Carole Kariuki, head of the Kenya Private Sector Alliance, said the private and public sectors need to collaborate to improve the agriculture sector. 'The private sector is doing its best. It's filling that gap where it can, but we cannot do it all, and we need the government to be able to go back and say we can get agriculture extension officers helping out small farmers and all the farmers in the country. Contract farming holds immense potential to transform African agriculture,' she said. Contract farming can have drawbacks, such as making farmers less able to sell to alternative buyers when produce prices increase. In addition, there are environmental risks from growing only one crop for a long time. Buyers, meanwhile, can face high transaction costs from contracting with many farmers. But Kariuki believes the benefits outweigh the risks. She called contract farming a model to lift up small-scale farmers, boost food production, and drive sustainable growth.	https://www.voanews.com/a/experts-push-contract-farming-to-boost-africa-food-systems-farmers-income/7862748.html	2024-11-13T11:09:54-08:00	
Chadian women complain of underrepresentation in December elections	Yaounde, Cameroon — An estimated 8 million voters in Chad go to the polls Dec. 29 in legislative, local and district elections. Female leaders and activists, however, say women candidates are being underrepresented. Chadian officials say the legislative elections will mark an end to a three-year transition from military to civilian rule that began when General Mahamat Idriss Deby seized power in April 2021 following the death of his father, long-serving President Idriss Deby Itno. During the transitional period, Deby said he would make sure women, who constitute more than 51% of Chad's population, were nominated in legislative, provincial and district elections. He said Chad would respect its pledges as a signatory to the Maputo Protocol, a commitment by African nations through the African Union to ensure gender equality in political decision making. But activists say women constitute just over one-third of the candidates in this year’s races, in which 180 political parties have nominated more than 8,500 candidates. They say limiting women from elective positions prohibits a majority of the central African nation’s civilians from participating in their country's development and legislating and voting on laws that will improve living conditions. Ahmed Bartchiret, president of ANGE, Chad’s national elections management body, acknowledged the low number of women running for elected office. He said women constitute less than 35% of the lists of nominees submitted by political parties, including Deby's Patriotic Salvation Movement, or MPS, for the Dec. 29 elections. ANGE also acknowledged that some nominations, including those of women, were turned down, but gave no further details. ANGE said anyone whose nomination was rejected can take up the issue through the courts. Women’s groups, including the Association of Indigenous Women and People and the Civil Society Group Against Injustice and Inequality, said in a release that ANGE rejected nomination papers of women candidates who could not pay the roughly $250 application fee. Activists, however, say some political parties are still very reluctant to nominate women, at times claiming that women are not educated enough to occupy political office. Amina Priscille Longoh is Chad's minister of women and child protection. Speaking Wednesday on state television, she noted that in some communities, there is resistance to women seeking higher office. Longoh said Deby’s strong political will to involve more women in politics is facing opposition from communities, traditional rulers and some clerics, who think that women should stay at home to take care of their husbands and children. She said Deby has ordered that a mass education campaign be carried out to advocate for the respect of women's rights and political participation. Longoh also said many women lack the financial means to run in elections. Some Chadian women have complained that Prime Minister Allamaye Halina, whom Deby appointed on May 23 as part of a new civilian government, has reduced the number of female ministers from 12 to eight. Activists say the government has not respected a resolution of the central African nations’ 2022 Inclusive and Sovereign National Dialogue which states that more women should be appointed to government positions. Female leaders say women constitute the majority of Chad’s population and can have more influence than men in peacekeeping processes.	https://www.voanews.com/a/chadian-women-complain-of-underrepresentation-in-december-elections/7862734.html	2024-11-13T11:09:44-08:00	
US Senate Republicans choose Senator John Thune as majority leader	U.S. Senate Republicans on Wednesday chose Senator John Thune to serve as majority leader when they retake control of the chamber next year. In a secret ballot, the South Dakota senator beat Senators John Cornyn and Rick Scott to assume the Republican leadership mantle that Mitch McConnell has held for the past 18 years. The 63-year-old Thune was elected to the Senate in 2004 and currently holds the number two spot in Republican leadership, serving as minority whip. He is perceived as a more mainstream choice than Scott, a hardline conservative and close ally of President-elect Donald Trump. Thune received 23 votes to Cornyn’s 15 and Scott’s 13. He will serve as Senate majority leader for at least the next two years. Republicans will hold at least 52 seats in the 100-person U.S. Senate. Votes in the Pennsylvania Senate race are still being counted. Trump has floated the idea of bypassing the normal hearing process for Cabinet appointees, a significant departure from the normal process. Trump endorsed Speaker of the House Mike Johnson on Wednesday, saying he should serve as leader in the 119th Congress. With vote counting still underway in some states, Republicans hold a slim majority over Democrats in the U.S. House of Representatives.	https://www.voanews.com/a/us-senate-republicans-choose-senator-john-thune-as-majority-leader/7862664.html	2024-11-13T10:55:22-08:00	
Biden, Xi to meet in Lima on sidelines of APEC summit in Peru	U.S. President Joe Biden and Chinese President Xi Jinping will meet November 16 on the sidelines of the 2024 Asia Pacific Economic Cooperation, or APEC summit in Lima, Peru, the White House announced Wednesday. The meeting follows the leaders' last in-person engagement a year ago on the sidelines of the APEC summit in California, and their 2022 meeting in Bali on the sidelines of the G20 summit. Biden and Xi are expected to revisit areas of cooperation, particularly the resumption of military-to-military contacts, efforts to combat the global fentanyl crisis and nascent work to deal with the risks of Artificial Intelligence, or AI, a senior administration said in a briefing with reporters Wednesday. The U.S. president will also express 'deep concern' over Beijing's support for Moscow's war against Ukraine, and the deployment of North Korean troops to aid Russia, said the official, who requested anonymity to speak on the upcoming meeting. The official said Biden will also reiterate his 'longstanding concern' over China's 'unfair trade policies and non-market economic practices' that hurt American workers. The official added Biden will raise Chinese cyber-attack efforts on U.S. civilian critical infrastructure as well as Beijing's increased military activities around Taiwan and the South China Sea while also underscoring the importance of respect for human rights. The meeting is likely to be the last between Biden and Xi ahead of the incoming administration of Donald Trump in January. The president-elect has appointed ardent China critics in key foreign policy positions that could lead to a more confrontational U.S. posture toward Beijing. They include Republican Congressman Mike Waltz as Trump's pick for national security adviser and Senator Marco Rubio as secretary of state. Whatever the next administration decides, they're going to need to find ways to manage the 'tough, complicated relationship' between the U.S. and China, the official said in response to a question from VOA. 'Russia, cross-strait issues, the South China Sea and cyber are areas the next administration is going to need to think about carefully, because those are areas of deep policy difference with China, and I don't expect that will disappear,' the official said. Xi is also likely anticipating what the Trump administration plans to do about global trade, particularly whether he will enact promises to impose steep tariffs on all Chinese goods.	https://www.voanews.com/a/biden-xi-to-meet-in-lima-on-sidelines-of-apec-summit-in-peru/7862589.html	2024-11-13T09:30:00-08:00	
Trump meets with Biden at White House	U.S. President-elect Donald Trump returned triumphantly to Washington on Wednesday and walked into the White House for the first time in four years to meet with outgoing President Joe Biden. Biden invited Trump for the traditional visit — a show of the coming Jan. 20 peaceful transfer of power in the American democracy between the current U.S. leader and the incoming chief executive. But the Biden-Trump get-together is rife with political tension. Biden, a Democrat running for reelection, had sought to defeat Trump, the Republican, for a second time before ending his campaign in July after he faltered badly in a debate against him. Biden quickly endorsed his vice president, Kamala Harris, to succeed him, but Trump swept through seven political battleground states in the election and easily defeated her. When Biden defeated Trump in 2020, Trump offered no White House invitation to meet him ahead of the inauguration and then left Washington two hours before Biden’s swearing-in on the steps of the U.S. Capitol. Trump, who to this day claims falsely that he was cheated out of winning the 2020 election by vote fraud, was the first president to not witness his successor’s inauguration since Andrew Johnson skipped the swearing-in of Ulysses S. Grant in 1869. Trump also met with Republican lawmakers in the House of Representatives. Republicans hold a narrow majority in the chamber in the current Congress and are nearing a slight majority control in the Congress set to be sworn in Jan. 3, but the outcome of more than a dozen seats remains uncertain. Trump has moved quickly to fill his nascent administration with Republican officials who have been the most politically loyal to him in the four years he was out of office. He has sought to fill several key defense and national security positions, including Pete Hegseth, a Fox News host and veteran of the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan, to be his next defense secretary. The choice of Hegseth was outside the norm of those usually named as the Pentagon leader. But he was a vocal supporter of Trump during his first term, embracing his 'America First' agenda of trying to withdraw U.S. troops from abroad and often taking up the cause of combat veterans accused of war crimes. Trump has also announced South Dakota Governor Kristi Noem as his choice for Homeland Security chief, picked John Ratcliffe as the director of the CIA and, according to news accounts, settled on Florida Senator Marco Rubio as secretary of state, the country’s top diplomat. Both Rubio and Noem were on Trump’s short list of possible vice-presidential running mates several months ago. While Trump later picked first-term Ohio Senator JD Vance, now the vice president-elect, to join him on the Republican national ticket, both Rubio and Noem remained Trump stalwarts as he won the election. Ratcliffe was the nation’s sixth director of national intelligence, serving for the last eight months of the Trump administration after a rocky confirmation process. Trump also announced that billionaire businessman Elon Musk and entrepreneur and former Republican presidential candidate Vivek Ramaswamy will lead what he called the Department of Government Efficiency. The announcement said they would provide advice and guidance to 'drive large-scale structural reform' of the federal government. The acronym for the new agency, DOGE, is a nod to Musk’s favorite cryptocurrency, dogecoin. Other notable picks by Trump include William McGinley as White House Counsel, Florida Congressman Michael Walz as national security adviser and Thomas Homan, former acting immigration chief, to be 'border czar' to head efforts to deport undocumented migrants living in the United States. Just ahead of the election, Trump, who only rarely publicly admits making any mistakes, told podcaster Joe Rogan that his biggest error during his term from 2017 to 2021 was hiring 'bad people or disloyal people.' 'I picked some people that I shouldn’t have picked,' he said. Some of the top officials Trump chose then, including former chief of staff John Kelly and national security adviser John Bolton, became sharp public Trump critics after he ousted them. Kelly said during this year’s campaign that Trump met the definition of a fascist ruler. Trump attacked both former officials, calling Kelly 'a bully but a weak person' and disparaging Bolton as 'an idiot.' Rubio sparred sharply with Trump during their 2016 run for the Republican presidential nomination, which Trump captured enroute to his first term as president. Rubio mocked Trump as having small hands and sporting an orange spray tan, while Trump derided Rubio as 'little Marco.'

Uncertain future for Chinese migrants without US visa under Trump	Austin, Texas — The price of entering the U.S. through the southern border is 250,000 yuan or close to $35,000, said Xiao Jing, a woman in her 30s who is to paying that amount to try to enter the U.S. without a visa. She is using a pseudonym due to the sensitivity of the issue. 'It was introduced by an acquaintance who had been successful [entering the U.S. illegally through the southern border] to help me apply for a Japanese visa and arrange the pickup service after I arrive in Mexico,' she told VOA. The person who will pick her up in Mexico will then help her cross into the U.S. Xiao worked as a clerk in a small company in the Chinese city of Chongqing. But because of China’s economic downturn in recent years, she said her boss first defaulted on wages, then laid off many people, including her. 'At my age, it's hard to find a job, and I don't like the political atmosphere in the country,' she said. If she applied for a U.S. visa, Xiao said, she would have to wait for an interview and her assets and income would be scrutinized. She chose plan B: obtaining a visa to Japan, then buying a plane ticket, although she has not decided to which city. 'My agent [for helping to get a travel visa] told me that if I was afraid, I should stay in China. But I still want to give it a try,' she told VOA. A woman who only calls herself 'Lisa' is a China-based 'agent' who is helping Chinese migrants with their attempts to cross into the U.S. without documentation. Because of her work, she does not want to give her real name and be identified by the police. She told VOA she received an unusually large number of inquiries from people in China in the past few days, and she advised them to get on the road as soon as possible and enter the U.S. before President-elect Donald Trump takes office. One of Trump’s top campaign promises was to make it tougher for migrants to enter the United States unlawfully. 'The day I take office, the migrant invasion ends, and the restoration of our country begins,' said Trump in a November 1 campaign rally in Henderson, Nevada. He also singled out migrants from China during an April 13 speech in Schnecksville, Pennsylvania, describing them as 'military age and they mostly are men. And it sounds like to me, are they trying to build a little army in our country?' Lisa said people from China have not stopped wanting to enter the U.S., because China’s economy and lack of freedom of speech have not improved. She has created several Telegram groups that discuss illegal immigration. Lisa said the membership of those chat groups has been increasing daily. Lisa said, currently, the Chinese have had no problems entering Mexico. She showed VOA the entry stamps in the passport pages of several of her clients. Her recommended route is to fly to Tijuana, Mexico, and climb the border wall into San Diego, California. San Diego is also close to Los Angeles, where there is a large Chinese population. She observed that it is more difficult to enter the U.S. now, and people are kept in immigration detention centers longer than a year ago. Wang Zhongwei, a 33-year-old asylum-seeker and activist, well-known among the Chinese migrants, told VOA that people had been discussing new routes through either Cuba or Bolivia for months, but very few people were able to reach the U.S. via these routes. 'I have not been in contact with anyone taking this route through Cuba, and we are now in contact with a much smaller group of people [who are trying to come to the U.S. through the southern border] than before. Almost everyone who entered the country flew from Japan to Mexico and then crossed the wall into the U.S.,' he told VOA. Guo Bin from Guangxi Province arrived in the U.S. through the southern border last year with his 12-year-old daughter. He said in the last two to three months, fewer people have tried to take the journey from China through Turkey, then Ecuador and then up through Central America and Mexico to the U.S. Guo has been listening to the chatter on social media channels within the communities of Chinese migrants who have crossed or attempted to cross the U.S. southern border. 'The people who entered the U.S. border now are the ones stranded on the road in the past two or three months, not the ones who just set off from China. Many people are now stranded in Mexico, Ecuador or Turkey. Some have run out of money halfway through, and some have been deceived by snakeheads [human traffickers], so they have to stay in the local area and work and continue the journey after getting enough money by working for a few months,' he said. The number of migrants from China that U.S. border agents have encountered at the southern border has been declining since December 2023 when it reached close to 6,000 people. In September, the number of Chinese encounters dropped to just over 1,300, according to U.S. Customs and Border Protection statistics. The December high is consistent with overall undocumented migrant numbers described by the Biden administration as 'the highest level of encounters between ports of entry in history.' In June, Biden issued an executive order that temporarily restricted asylum eligibility at the U.S.-Mexico border whenever the number of migrants crossing unlawfully or without authorization reaches a daily average of 2,500. The Mexican government has also stepped up its border enforcement with checkpoints on major roads and increased patrols of border crossings into the U.S. Guo said comments on social media from the Chinese migrant community revealed some of the Chinese who did manage to enter the U.S. without visas were deported. 'Some of them were [repatriated] because they are members of the Communist Party, and they might not pass the interview,' Guo said. In July, the U.S. announced the first large charter flight since 2018, deporting Chinese nationals to China. 'We will continue to enforce our immigration laws and remove individuals without a legal basis to remain in the United States,' Secretary of Homeland Security Alejandro Mayorkas said. 'People should not believe the lies of smugglers.' News of Trump’s election victory has frightened many Chinese migrants in the U.S., Wang told VOA. 'The moment the election results came out, the immigrant group’s chats turned into heated discussions, and many people began to worry. I'm a little worried about what the new policy will be,' he said. Trump's 'rhetoric of mass deportations has affected all those who have not gotten legal status, including those who crossed the southern border illegally and those who came with a legal visa and now apply for asylum,' Wang said. Asylum applications typically have two steps: a pretrial hearing with an average waiting time of about three years and an individual hearing with a waiting time of less than five years. At present, Wang has passed the pretrial hearing, and his personal hearing is scheduled for February. His case is moving relatively faster and smoother than other Chinese migrants, said immigration lawyers, but he does not know what changes may occur under the new Trump administration.

China looks to expand global influence with Xi’s Latin America tour	Taipei, Taiwan — Chinese President Xi Jinping departs on a nine-day diplomatic tour to Latin America on Wednesday, during which he will inaugurate a Chinese-financed megaport in Peru and attend the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation Summit in Lima and the G20 Summit in Brazil. Analysts say the trip is part of China’s attempt to expand its global influence and present itself as 'a responsible global power' at a time when countries around the world brace for uncertainties following U.S. President-elect Donald Trump’s victory on November 5. 'The trip is especially significant since Latin America is viewed as ‘the backyard’ of the United States; and [since] the next U.S. president is likely to return to a unilateral approach in world affairs, it provides China with the opportunity to expand its influence around the world as a champion for global development and multilateral cooperation,' said Zhiqun Zhu, an expert on Chinese foreign policy at Bucknell University. During his state visit to Peru, Xi will inaugurate the $3.5 billion Chancay port with his Peruvian counterpart Dina Boluarte on Thursday. Situated 80 kilometers north of the Peruvian capital Lima, the port has a maximum depth of 17.8 meters and is expected to become a major trading hub between Latin America and China. 'The port will become the largest deep-water port in South America and it will drastically reduce the time needed to ship products from Peru to China,' Leland Lazarus, associate director of national security at Florida International University, told VOA in a video interview. China’s state-run Cosco Shipping Corporation has a majority 60% stake in the port and a 30-year concession to operate the terminal. According to China’s official data, the port can handle up to one million containers and 160,000 vehicles in the first year of operation. The port is among 17 ports globally where China holds a majority stake, according to the Council on Foreign Relations and is one of more than 100 port projects built globally under China’s flagship Belt and Road Initiative. The port is expected to become a major hub for exporting critical commodities such as lithium, copper, iron and soybeans to China more efficiently. Latin American countries including Peru, Chile, Brazil, Colombia, and Ecuador, which had a combined export of $135 billion to China in 2023, could all benefit from the launch of the Chancay Port. 'There is a huge gap in infrastructure development in Global South countries and Western powers are not active in helping [to] fill the gap. [As a result,] China’s investments in such large infrastructure projects are welcomed by host countries,' Zhu at Bucknell University told VOA in a written response. While Latin American countries will likely welcome the inauguration of the Chancay Port, the U.S. has warned about the potential for the port to be used for military purposes by China. That Washington claims could threaten its interests in Latin America. 'It could be used as a dual-use facility, it’s a deepwater port,' said Laura Richardson, the outgoing chief of the U.S. Southern Command told the Financial Times in a recent interview, adding that the Chinese navy could use the port in a scenario that, she said, fits 'Beijing’s playbook.' Some experts say it’s difficult for China to deploy its naval vessels to Latin America in the near future and that Peru is unlikely to let Beijing militarize the Chancay port. 'Currently, the Chinese navy is not capable of projecting its power across the Pacific, and since Peru still needs to maintain its relationship with the U.S., Peruvian authorities won’t allow the port to be militarized,' Kung Kwo-Wei, an expert of Latin American affairs at Tamkang University in Taiwan, told VOA by phone. However, Lazarus told VOA that Beijing’s activities in other ports around the world suggest it could still use the Chancay port for military purposes in the future. 'When looking at Chinese behaviors [at other ports around the world], such as the Port of Bata in Equatorial Guinea and the Ream Naval Base in Cambodia, Chinese state-owned enterprises would promise to expand the ports for commercial purposes, yet there have been allegations that there’s been construction for what looks like military purposes on these areas,' said Lazarus. In addition to the Chancay Port, Peruvian Foreign Minister Elmer Schialer told Reuters news agency in an exclusive interview that Beijing and Lima plan to sign around 30 agreements, including an updated free trade agreement, during Xi’s visit. Kung in Taiwan said these developments show that China’s investment in Latin America is now focusing on logistical infrastructure and access to minerals from Latin America. 'China relies heavily on ports and logistical infrastructure to ensure it can export and import commodities at a steady pace, and as Beijing continues to expand its renewable energy industries, its appetite for minerals from Latin America will also grow,' Kung told VOA. As the U.S. could possibly adopt a more isolationist foreign policy approach during Trump’s second term, Lazarus said Xi will use the upcoming APEC and G20 summits to amplify the message that China is a more consistent global power than the U.S. 'While the U.S. is going to potentially look inward with another Trump administration, [the summits] are Xi’s big opportunities to show that China is playing a much more global role,' he told VOA. However, some experts say it remains unclear whether China will achieve its intended goals. 'Beijing will double down on the image of being the leader of the Global South and some countries will be attracted by that message,' said Ian Chong, a political scientist at the National University of Singapore. 'But others who are more clear-eyed and who have followed developments from the Belt and Road Initiative and other Chinese projects will recognize that China is just another great power,' he told VOA in a phone interview.	https://www.voanews.com/a/china-looks-to-expand-global-influence-with-xi-s-latin-america-tour/7862449.html	2024-11-13T07:39:38-08:00	
Bike trek by thousands of Chinese students sparks tough response	Authorities in China are cracking down on a popular new fad – nighttime bike riding – after tens of thousands of students and others clogged highways and streets between the cities of Zhengzhou and Kaifeng in central Henan province. Kaifeng is known for its historic sites and famous dumplings, and the trend of making the 80-kilometer (50-mile) trek between the two cities peaked in popularity over the past week with some estimating that as many as 200,000 set out on a 'Night Ride to Kaifeng' last Friday. In response, schools are instituting curfews, police are shutting down bike lanes in the name of public safety and many on social media are debating whether the mass movement was just an expression of youthful lust for life, government policy gone wrong or a subtle form of protest. Or perhaps a mix of all of the above. In video posts on social media, many waved Chinese flags and sang the national anthem while Kaifeng residents lined up along the route to welcome them. No anti-government or other signs or slogans could be seen. Some observers compared the scale of 'Night Ride to Kaifeng' gatherings to the 'White Paper Movement' during the pandemic, when thousands took to the streets holding up blank sheets of paper to voice their frustration with China's stringent COVID-19 lockdowns and policies. On the rides, one rider was seen flying a flag that read 'Freedom' while others waved China's flag or held signs that read: 'The reunification of the motherland is essential and inevitable.' There were no protests during the rides, but when many cyclists finished the trek they abandoned their bicycles, clogging city streets. Chen, a student in Zhengzhou who did not want to give his full name for fear of government reprisal, said he saw the cycling convoy on Nov. 8 as it left the capital. He told VOA that while students on the surface were showing their patriotism, the overall atmosphere was rather 'eerie.' 'Indeed, many people were holding the [Chinese] national flag and singing the national anthem, but they didn't look proud; instead, most of them were expressionless,' Chen said. 'And it wasn't even a particularly significant day, so why this display? It's very thought-provoking.' Chen said that while the students should have cycled the bikes back to Zhengzhou after reaching Kaifeng, they didn't. Bikeshare services allow users to pick up and drop off bicycles anywhere but typically they are used in a set place such as a town or city. 'My friends in Kaifeng told me that after sunrise, the city was filled with abandoned shared bikes,' he said. Online many were critical of the cyclists and the chaos the nighttime bike ride created. Others noted that Kaifeng residents welcomed the cyclists. One Weibo user, Fan Jianchuan, said everyone has their own opinion of the trend. 'Students, parents, teachers, local residents, tourism bureaus, police departments, traffic police, education bureaus, urban management, municipal authorities, shared bike companies, tourist spots, restaurants and so on all have their own perspectives and statements on it,' Fan wrote. 'As someone who was once young, I understand the enthusiasm of youth. If I were a university student, I would join my classmates for a carefree ride too. But as an experienced 'mayor' (honorary), I am more concerned with public order, public safety, public transportation and public hygiene. So, there's no problem with cycling as long as it's done in an orderly manner.' The night cycling activity has been fully halted, and many universities in Henan have implemented curfews, sparking strong backlash among students. Several universities in Henan notified students to return to campus by a set deadline and announced lockdown measures prohibiting students from leaving. Some universities informed students that the Henan Provincial Department of Education and school administrators believed a large number of people and even 'anti-social elements' or 'foreign adversaries' had joined last week's night ride. There were also unsubstantiated claims circulating on China's social media that authorities characterized the students' actions as a 'political movement,' and some universities compared the night ride to the past 'riots in Hong Kong.' To 'cool down' the situation, many universities in Henan reportedly imposed strict closed management, with some even implementing full lockdowns, according to social media posts on Weibo and X. Online posts suggested that Henan University of Engineering introduced a temporary exit pass system that bars students from leaving campus unless absolutely necessary. Staff at Henan Institute of Economics and Trade told VOA that parents need to contact school counselors for students to gain approval to leave campus. The Henan Provincial Department of Education did not answer the phone when VOA reached out for comment. A graduate student from Shandong, surnamed Sun, criticized the response from Henan universities saying it was as if they were returning to pandemic-style lockdown measures. Sun did not want to give his full name while speaking freely to foreign media. 'The school's management during the pandemic actually created many aftereffects. Every student had to scan their face to leave, which certainly made students uncomfortable. Why should I be subjected to this control just for going off-campus? The school's management is irrational and lacks justification.' On Nov. 9, traffic police in Zhengzhou and Kaifeng issued notices temporarily banning nonmotorized vehicles on Zhengkai Avenue — a main road that links the two cities. They also cited the need to clear roads occupied by shared bikes and other items to ensure safe passage. Henan's three major bike-sharing platforms, Hello, Qingju and Meituan, have announced that users may 'not ride beyond designated areas.' If a user exceeds a set time limit, the bike will be automatically locked and a dispatch fee will be applied, according to regulations, the companies said in statements posted online. Despite the government lockdown, some students say they feel proud when recalling their participation in the 'Night Ride to Kaifeng.' In a post on Weibo, HH's Spiritual Wilderness wrote: 'This journey might be absurd, but I'm glad we have the courage to go whenever we feel like it. After all, we'll never be younger than we were yesterday. I dedicate this absurd trip to the memory of my irretrievable twenties. 2024.11.8-9 #NightRideToKaifeng#'	https://www.voanews.com/a/bike-trek-by-thousands-of-chinese-students-sparks-tough-response/7862413.html	2024-11-13T07:39:16-08:00	
Doctors Without Borders ambulance in Haiti attacked, two patients killed	PORT-AU-PRINCE — Doctors Without Borders (MSF) said on Wednesday that at least two patients were killed when its ambulance was stopped and attacked earlier this week in Haiti's capital Port-au-Prince. The MSF staff said they were violently attacked on Monday after 'members of a vigilante group and law enforcement officers' stopped the ambulance. The ambulance, transporting three young people with gunshot wounds, was halted about 100 meters from the MSF hospital in the Drouillard area of the capital and forced to transfer the patients to a public hospital, MSF said. The group said police attempted to arrest the patients before escorting the ambulance to the hospital, where 'law enforcement officers and members of a self-defense group surrounded the ambulance, slashed the tires, and tear-gassed MSF staff inside the vehicle to force them out.' The wounded patients were taken a short distance away and at least two were executed, the group said. 'The act is a shocking display of violence and it seriously calls into question MSF's ability to continue delivering essential care to the Haitian people,' said Christophe Garnier, MSF's head of mission.	https://www.voanews.com/a/doctors-without-borders-ambulance-in-haiti-attacked-two-patients-killed-/7862438.html	2024-11-13T07:38:13-08:00	
In Brussels, Blinken pledges support for Ukraine ahead of Trump transition	Brussels — U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken assured Ukraine and its NATO allies on Wednesday that Washington remains committed to putting Ukraine 'in the strongest possible position' in the final months of President Joe Biden’s administration, before President-elect Donald Trump takes office in January. At the same time, the United States expressed alarm about Russia possibly bolstering North Korea’s capabilities, including its 'nuclear capacity.' 'President Biden has committed to making sure that every dollar we have at our disposal will be pushed out the door between now and January 20th,' Blinken told reporters at NATO headquarters on Wednesday. 'We’re making sure that Ukraine has the air defenses it needs, that has the artillery it needs, that has the armored vehicles it needs,' he added. Blinken told VOA he expects U.S. allies' support for Ukraine to increase and emphasized that it’s critical for Washington’s partners to 'continue to more than pick up their share of the burden.' Speaking alongside NATO Secretary General Mark Rutte, Blinken reiterated that Washington will 'continue to shore up everything' to enable Ukraine to defend itself effectively against Russian aggression. Rutte and other European leaders voiced serious concerns over North Korea’s active support for Russia in its war on Ukraine. 'These North Korean soldiers present an extra threat to Ukraine and will increase the potential for Putin to do harm,' Rutte told reporters. The U.S. State Department had disclosed that over 10,000 North Korean troops have been deployed to eastern Russia, and most of them have moved to the far western Kursk oblast. On Wednesday, Blinken described the military collaboration between Pyongyang and Moscow as 'a two-way street.' 'There is deep concern about what Russia is or may be doing to strengthen North Korea’s capacities: its missile capacity, its nuclear capacity,' as well as the battlefield experience North Korean forces are gaining, he told reporters. In Brussels, Blinken held talks with Ukrainian Foreign Minister Andrii Sybiha, European Union foreign policy chief Josep Borrell, and Britain’s foreign secretary, David Lammy, among others. In Washington, officials say President Biden is expected to ask President-elect Trump not to walk away from Ukraine during their talks at the White House Wednesday. Trump’s political allies have indicated that the incoming administration will prioritize achieving peace in Ukraine over enabling the country to reclaim Crimea and other territories occupied by Russia.	https://www.voanews.com/a/in-brussels-blinken-pledges-support-for-ukraine-ahead-of-trump-transition/7862441.html	2024-11-13T07:34:50-08:00	
US government worker charged with leaking classified documents on Israel's plans to strike Iran	Washington — A man who worked for the U.S. government has been charged with leaking classified information assessing Israel's earlier plans to attack Iran, according to court papers filed Wednesday. The man, identified as Asif William Rahman, was arrested by the FBI this week in Cambodia and was due to make his first court appearance in Guam. He was indicted last week in U.S. court in Virginia on two counts of willful transmission of national defense information — felony charges that can can carry significant prison sentences. It was not immediately clear whether Rahman had a lawyer or which federal agency employed him, but officials say he had top secret security clearance. The charges stem from the documents, attributed to the National Geospatial-Intelligence Agency and National Security Agency, appearing last month on a channel of the Telegram messaging app. The documents noted that Israel was still moving military assets in place to conduct a military strike in response to Iran's blistering ballistic missile attack on Oct. 1. Israel carried out a retaliatory attack on multiple sites in Iran in late October. The documents were sharable within the 'Five Eyes,' which are the United States, Britain, Canada, New Zealand and Australia. The New York Times was first to report his arrest.	https://www.voanews.com/a/us-government-worker-charged-with-leaking-classified-documents-on-israel-s-plans-to-strike-iran/7862391.html	2024-11-13T07:02:26-08:00	
Poland hails opening of US missile base as sign of its security	The United States opened a new air defense base in northern Poland on Wednesday, an event the European nation's president said showed the country was secure as a member of NATO even as Russia wages war in neighboring Ukraine. Situated in the town of Redzikowo near the Baltic coast, the base has been in the works since the 2000s. At a time when Donald Trump's election victory has caused jitters among some NATO members, Warsaw says the continued work on the base by successive U.S. presidents shows Poland's military alliance with Washington remains solid whoever is in the White House. 'The United States... is the guarantor of Poland's security,' President Andrzej Duda said. He said the permanent presence of U.S. troops at the base showed that Poland, a communist state until 1989, was 'not in the Russian sphere of influence.' The Kremlin on Wednesday called the base a bid to contain Russia by moving American military infrastructure nearer its borders. The opening comes amid a nervous reaction among some NATO members to the election of Trump, who has vowed not to defend countries that do not spend enough on defense. However, Poland says it should have nothing to fear as it is the alliance's biggest spender on defense relative to the size of its economy, and conservative Duda has stressed his warm ties with Trump. The U.S. base at Redzikowo is part of a broader NATO missile shield, dubbed 'Aegis Ashore,' which the alliance says can intercept short- to intermediate-range ballistic missiles. Other key shield elements include a site in Romania, U.S. navy destroyers based in the Spanish port of Rota and an early-warning radar in Kurecik, Turkey. Moscow had already labeled the base a threat as far back as 2007, when it was still being planned. NATO says the shield is purely defensive. Military sources told Reuters the system in Poland can now only be used against missiles fired from the Middle East and the radar would need a change in direction to intercept projectiles from Russia, a complex procedure entailing a change of policy. Polish Defense Minister Wladyslaw Kosiniak-Kamysz said on Monday the scope of the shield needed to be expanded, which Warsaw would discuss with NATO and the United States. NATO Secretary General Mark Rutte will meet Duda and Prime Minister Donald Tusk in Warsaw later on Wednesday.	https://www.voanews.com/a/poland-hails-opening-of-us-missile-base-as-sign-of-its-security/7862393.html	2024-11-13T07:01:46-08:00	
Germany to hold February election amid fears political turmoil imperils Ukraine aid	London — Germany's plan to hold a snap election in February has raised uncertainties over the country's military aid program for Ukraine, as the government has not yet approved its 2025 budget. Berlin is the second biggest donor of weapons and equipment to Kyiv, after the United States. The political turmoil in Europe's biggest economy comes as allies prepare for a second term for President-elect Donald Trump in the United States. Trump has repeatedly questioned U.S. support for Ukraine. February vote Germany's main political parties agreed to hold the election on February 23, following the collapse of the ruling three-party coalition government earlier this month. Chancellor Olaf Scholz is due to introduce a confidence motion in parliament next month, which he is expected to lose, paving the way for a general election. Scholz has said he will stand again as the Social Democrats' candidate, although some in the party have questioned whether he is the best choice amid low approval ratings. The chairman of the Social Democrats in the German parliament, Rolf Mützenich, insisted Tuesday that Scholz was the right candidate. 'I am firmly convinced that Olaf Scholz has done this country good in the last three years under the most difficult conditions. He has done everything to ensure that the coalition stays together. We have not only experienced the attack by Russian troops on Ukraine, but we have also helped Ukraine. We have also created important economic stabilization effects in Germany,' Mützenich told reporters in Berlin. Opposition poll lead However, the main opposition Christian Democrats have a big lead in the polls. The party's leader, Friedrich Merz, argued for a quicker election. 'We are basically losing around a month for the election to the next German parliament and thus also for the formation of a government after the next election,' Merz told reporters Tuesday. 'I just want to remind you that we do not have a federal budget for 2025. We are going into 2025 with this serious omission, with this heavy burden. And that is why it is completely unknown what will become of it,' he added. Debt dispute The current government — a coalition between the Social Democrats, the Green party and the Free Democrats — collapsed last week following disagreements over raising new debt to finance the 2025 budget, including the provision of military aid to Ukraine. A so-called debt brake in Germany's constitution restricts the government's ability to take on new loans. Berlin has given Kyiv around $11 billion in weapons and equipment since Russia's February 2022 full-scale invasion. The outgoing government had planned to cut that aid to just over $4 billion next year. 'Broadly speaking, there was a consensus that supporting Ukraine remains a priority for Germany. The question was just where and how to get and raise the finances for that,' said Mattia Nelles, founder of the German-Ukraine Bureau, a political consultancy based in Düsseldorf, who said the February election was 'bad timing for Ukraine, bad timing for Europe.' 'Leadership vacuum' 'It means Germany will be preoccupied with itself for a few months before we have a new government with a hopefully strong mandate — a coalition that could take literally until next summer, or in the worst case, even until autumn. So that is a leadership vacuum in Europe, and that's bad news for everyone involved,' Nelles said. The election is due to take place just weeks after the January 20 inauguration of Donald Trump as the next U.S. president. 'The worst case that many fear in Berlin and Kyiv [is] an incoming Trump administration taking power in January then slashing or ending the Ukraine aid, that will force the German government, the lame duck Scholz government with the current parliament, to increase the funding for Ukraine.' 'It's important to note that there is still a majority in the old parliament, even before the new parliament is elected, to increase the aid, to take new debt and amend the constitution for that, to take new debt to support Ukraine ... but it's going to be difficult politically to implement that,' Nelles said. European security Trump's presidency could have wider implications for European security, including the deployment of U.S. forces and equipment, such as long-range missile systems, says analyst Marina Miron, a defense analyst at Kings College, London. 'What else might be reversed is the placement of Tomahawk [U.S. missiles] in Germany. So, we have quite a situation where, let's say, Trump might pursue an anti-globalist agenda and push NATO countries to invest more of their GDP into defense,' Miron told VOA. Russian assets Europe froze around $200 billion in Russian assets following Moscow's invasion of Ukraine. The interest is being used to help fund weapons for Kyiv, while the G7 group of rich nations has implemented a loan plan for Ukraine using the Russian assets as collateral. At a time of fiscal pressures in Europe, some argue it's time to seize the assets entirely and give them to Ukraine. 'Europe is sitting on a war chest of 200 billion U.S. dollars of frozen Russian assets,' said analyst Mattia Nelles. 'And I think the incoming Trump administration will push the Europeans to go further. And that's welcome news from the Ukrainian side — to not just give loans and credit based on frozen Russian assets, but to move to confiscate the assets themselves. And that's certainly something many in Germany also support,' he added. Economic pressures Chancellor Scholz oversaw German efforts to end reliance on cheap Russian energy. However, analysts say that has driven inflation and undermined confidence in Europe's biggest economy. Scholz also was seen as reluctant to make bolder decisions on arming Ukraine, including the supply of long-range Taurus missiles, something Kyiv has repeatedly requested. Ukraine may be hoping that a change in leadership in Berlin could unblock more military aid, said Nelles. 'We are looking at a new, potentially stronger government, which, if it's led by [Christian Democrat leader] Friedrich Merz, might be taking some of the bolder decisions which Scholz had hesitated to take, including the delivery of Taurus. But everyone hoping for that, I would urge caution,' he said. Germany's economic constraints won't disappear with new leadership, said analyst Marina Miron. 'Let's assume, for a moment, there is somebody who would drive this policy forward and who would have much more resolve than Scholz. The problem is the German budget. The problem is also that defense contractors in Europe are now affected, as other companies, by the disruption in the global supply chain,' she told VOA. Germany is also struggling to overcome decades of underinvestment in its armed forces, something the next government will have to address, Miron added. 'The dictates of German strategic culture just go against the grain of the current threat landscape, when it comes to bigger investment in defense,' she said.	https://www.voanews.com/a/germany-to-hold-february-election-amid-fears-political-turmoil-imperils-ukraine-aid-/7862227.html	2024-11-13T04:48:29-08:00	
Taliban publicly execute Afghan murder convict	ISLAMABAD — Taliban authorities in eastern Afghanistan publicly executed an alleged murderer Wednesday, citing the Islamic concept of retributive justice, or qisas. The early morning punishment took place at a sports stadium in Gardez, the capital of the Paktia province, the Taliban supreme court announced through the social media platform X. The provincial government invited the public, and senior civilian, judicial, and military officials, including Taliban Interior Minister Sirajuddin Haqqani, to witness the execution. Authorities had barred onlookers from bringing cameras or mobile devices. The convict, identified as Mohammad Ayaz Asad, had reportedly shot dead a Taliban security force member. The top Taliban court did not specify how the death penalty was implemented. Social media videos showed crowds heading to the sports stadium to witness the event. 'The case was meticulously examined and scrutinized by the three-stage military court of the Islamic Emirate in multiple iterations before the order of retaliation (Qisas) was issued and approved,' the statement said, using the official title of the Taliban government, which is officially not recognized by any country. It was the sixth public execution of a murder convict in Afghanistan since the Taliban regained power in August 2021 and implemented in a criminal justice system based on their interpretation of Islamic law, Sharia. Previously, such executions were carried out by gunshot. Despite the United Nations condemning the practice as 'inconsistent with the fundamental right to life' and 'a form of cruel, inhuman, or degrading treatment or punishment,' de facto Afghan leaders continue to carry out these executions. The Taliban also have flogged hundreds of men and women in packed sports stadiums across Afghanistan for committing 'immoral crimes,' such as adultery, homosexuality, theft, and robbery. In October alone, nearly 100 Afghans, including women, were lashed in front of onlookers and received jail terms ranging from six months to two years for such offenses, according to the Taliban Supreme Court data. U.N. experts and human rights organizations have decried corporal punishment as a breach of human rights and international law, urging the Taliban to stop it immediately. Women’s rights in Afghanistan have declined sharply under the Taliban rule, according to U.N. assessments. They cite a series of decrees and directives issued by Taliban leader Hibatullah Akhundzada, which are designed to 'systematically' exclude women from public life in nearly every sector. The edicts have banned Afghan girls and young women from pursuing secondary and university-level education. Women are banned from public and private workplaces except for health, immigration, and police departments. A recent decree has deemed the sound of women’s voices in public a moral violation and requires them to cover their entire bodies and faces when outdoors. It also forbids women from looking at men to whom they are not related and vice versa. The Taliban have defended their Islamic governance and rejected international calls to reverse restrictions on Afghan women’s freedom. No country has officially recognized Taliban leaders as legitimate rulers of Afghanistan, mainly citing their harsh treatment of women.	https://www.voanews.com/a/taliban-publicly-execute-afghan-murder-convict/7862189.html	2024-11-13T03:57:13-08:00	
Iran hangs man 'for second time' after previous execution halted	Iran hanged a 26-year-old man for a second time Wednesday months after a previous execution was halted half a minute in, an NGO said. Ahmad Alizadeh was arrested in October 2018 on a murder charge, which he denied, and was sentenced to death, Norway-based Iran Human Rights (IHR), which tracks executions in Iran, said in a statement. His death sentence was carried out on April 27 in Ghezel Hesar prison in Karaj outside Tehran. But just 28 seconds into the hanging he was brought down from the gallows when the victim's family suddenly shouted 'forgiveness'. His 'lifeless' body was successfully resuscitated and the execution was halted, IHR said. Under Iran's sharia law, a victim's family can ask for blood money to spare the life of the perpetrator or also decide to forgive. However, in many cases the family of the condemned person cannot afford the sum set and the execution goes ahead, according to activists. Alizadeh remained under the threat of the death penalty in the absence of any deal with the victim's family for blood money. He was executed again in the Ghezel Hesar prison on Wednesday morning, IHR said. 'Ahmad Alizadeh, a talented student, was hanged for the second time on charges of murder, which he denied and claimed he confessed to under torture,' said IHR director Mahmood Amiry-Moghaddam, denouncing the 'execution machine of the Iranian regime'. Activists accuse Iran of using the death penalty to instill fear throughout society, particularly in the wake of 2022-2023 nationwide protests which shook the Islamic authorities. According to IHR, 2024 is seeing a new surge in executions, with at least 166 executions recorded in October alone, the highest number recorded in a single month since the group began documenting executions in 2007. Activists including Amnesty International say Iran carries out more annual executions than any country other than China, for which no reliable figures are available.	https://www.voanews.com/a/iran-hangs-man-for-second-time-after-previous-execution-halted/7862184.html	2024-11-13T03:51:09-08:00	
US Military says it hit Iran-backed group in Syria	American forces on Tuesday carried out strikes against targets linked to an Iran-backed group in Syria, the U.S. military said, with a war monitor saying the attacks killed five fighters. The raids were in response to a rocket attack on U.S. troops in the country, the U.S. Central Command (CENTCOM) said. The strikes targeted the group's 'weapons storage and logistics headquarters facility... in response to a rocket attack on U.S. personnel,' CENTCOM said in a post on social media that did not identify the group by name. 'There was no damage to U.S. facilities and no injuries to US or partner forces during the attack,' CENTCOM added. The Syrian Observatory for Human Rights war monitor said 'five pro-Iranian fighters were killed and others injured, after American jets targeted' one of their bases in the city of Albukamal, in Syria's eastern Deir Ezzor province. The previous day, U.S. forces bombed nine targets associated with Iran-backed groups in response to recent drone and rocket attacks, according to the Pentagon. The Observatory said those strikes killed four members of groups loyal to Iran. The U.S. military has around 900 troops in Syria and 2,500 in Iraq as part of the international coalition that was established in 2014 to help combat the Islamic State jihadist group. Since war broke out in the Gaza Strip after Hamas attacked Israel on October 7, 2023, pro-Iran groups have repeatedly targeted US forces in Iraq and Syria in response to Washington's support for Israel. The United States has on multiple occasions responded to such attacks with strikes on Iran-backed groups.	https://www.voanews.com/a/us-military-says-it-hit-iran-backed-group-in-syria/7862161.html	2024-11-13T03:22:30-08:00	
Israeli airstrike kills 6, wounds 15 near Beirut	Six people were killed in an Israeli airstrike in an area south of Beirut Wednesday, and the Israeli army issued another warning for people in parts of the southern suburbs to leave. Lebanon’s health ministry said an additional 15 people were wounded in the airstrike, which followed heavy pounding by Israel on Tuesday. Overnight attacks in Lebanon were 'intelligence-based strikes on Hezbollah weapons storage facilities and command centers in the Dahieh area, a key Hezbollah terrorist stronghold in Beirut,' Israel Defense Forces stated in a post on the Telegram messaging app Wednesday. The Israeli military said before the strikes, 'numerous steps were taken to mitigate the risk to civilians, including issuing advance warnings to the population in the area.' IDF also stated Wednesday that several Hezbollah field commanders have been killed in recent strikes in Lebanon. 'At the beginning of the month of October, the IAF struck and eliminated Hezbollah's Commander of the Khiam area, Muhammad Musa Salah, in the area of Khiam,' IDF posted. 'Salah directed many terror attacks against the State of Israel, and was responsible for the launches of more than 2,500 projectiles toward the areas of the Golan Heights, the Upper Galilee, the Galilee Panhandle, and toward IDF troops operating in southern Lebanon.' On Sunday, the commander of an anti-tank missile array in Hajir was killed, and field commanders of the Ghajar and Tebnit areas were also killed 'during additional precise strikes,' IDF stated. Russia’s request in Syria Russia asked Israel to avoid launching airstrikes near one of its bases in Syria, Agence France-Presse reported. In October, Israel reportedly hit the port city of Latakia, a stronghold of President Bashar al-Assad, who is supported by Russia and backs Hezbollah. Latakia, is close to the town of Hmeimim, which hosts a Russian air base. 'Israel actually carried out an airstrike in the immediate vicinity of Hmeimim,' Alexander Lavrentiev, Russian President Vladimir Putin's special envoy in the Near East, told the RIA Novosti press agency. 'Our military has of course notified Israeli authorities that such acts that put Russian military lives in danger over there are unacceptable,' he added. U.S. response to aid in Gaza The United States said Tuesday that Israel has made limited progress on increasing the flow of humanitarian aid into the Gaza Strip as Washington requested, so the Biden administration will not limit arms transfers to Israel. State Department deputy spokesperson Vedant Patel told reporters that 'we at this time have not made an assessment that the Israelis are in violation of U.S. law.' The administration told its ally on October 13 that it had one month to increase aid to Gaza, where the situation after 13 months of war between Israel and Hamas militants has unleashed a catastrophic humanitarian situation, or face a reduction in military aid. The deadline was Tuesday. 'We are not giving Israel a pass,' Patel said, adding that 'we want to see the totality of the humanitarian situation improve, and we think some of these steps will allow the conditions for that to continue to progress.' Secretary of State Antony Blinken met with Israel’s top national security adviser, Ron Dermer, in Washington on Monday to go over the steps that Israel has taken. At the United Nations, U.S. envoy Linda Thomas-Greenfield told the Security Council that Israel has taken some important steps, including restoring aid deliveries to the north, but that it must ensure its actions are 'fully implemented and its improvements sustained over time.' 'And we continue to reiterate, there must be no forcible displacement nor policy of starvation in Gaza, which would have grave implications under U.S. and international law,' she said. A senior U.N. human rights official said at the same meeting that the entry and distribution of aid into Gaza has fallen to 'some of the lowest levels in a year' and criticized Israel’s conduct of military operations in the north. Israel denies it is limiting aid to Gaza, blaming the U.N. and aid agencies for slow distribution and Hamas for stealing it. The war in Gaza was triggered when Hamas-led militants stormed into southern Israel on October 7, 2023, killing about 1,200 people, mostly civilians, and abducting about 250. Some 100 hostages are still inside Gaza, although about one-third of them are believed to be dead. Israel's counteroffensive has killed more than 43,000 Palestinians, more than half of them women and children, according to local health authorities. The Israeli military says the death toll includes thousands of Hamas militants. The war spread to Lebanon in mid-September, after months of rocket fire from Hezbollah into Israel and drone and airstrikes by Israel’s military in south Lebanon escalated. More than 3,200 Lebanese have been killed, most of them in the past six weeks. Both Hamas and Hezbollah have been designated as terrorist organizations by the United States.

Development bank financing pledge gives COP29 summit early boost	BAKU, Azerbaijan — COP29 negotiators welcomed as an early boost to the two-week summit a pledge by major development banks to lift funding to poor and middle-income countries struggling with global warming. A group of lenders, including the World Bank, announced a joint goal on Tuesday of increasing this finance to $120 billion by 2030, a roughly 60% increase on the amount in 2023. 'I think it's a very good sign,' Irish Climate Minister Eamon Ryan told Reuters on Wednesday. 'It's very helpful. But that on its own won't be enough,' Ryan said, adding countries and companies must also contribute. The chief aim of the conference in Azerbaijan is to secure a wide-ranging international climate financing agreement that ensures up to trillions of dollars for climate projects. Developing countries are hoping for big commitments from rich, industrialized countries that are the biggest historical contributors to global warming, and some of which are also huge producers of fossil fuels. 'Developed countries have not only neglected their historical duty to reduce emissions, they are doubling down on fossil-fuel-driven growth,' said climate activist Harjeet Singh. Wealthy countries pledged in 2009 to contribute $100 billion a year to help developing nations transition to clean energy and adapt to the conditions of a warming world. But those payments were only fully met in 2022 and the pledge expires this year. With 2024 on track to be the hottest year on record, scientists say global warming and its impacts are unfolding faster than expected. Climate-fueled wildfires forced evacuations in California and triggered air quality warnings in New York. In Spain, survivors are coming to terms with the worst floods in the country's modern history. Albania's Prime Minister Edi Rama said he was concerned that the international process to address global warming, now decades old, was not moving swiftly enough. 'This seems exactly like what happens in the real world everyday,' he told the conference. 'Life goes on with its old habits, and our speeches, filled with good words about fighting climate change, change nothing,' Rama added.	https://www.voanews.com/a/development-bank-financing-pledge-gives-cop29-summit-early-boost/7862109.html	2024-11-13T01:46:58-08:00	
Millions of Nigerians go hungry as floods compound hardship	GUBIO, Nigeria — Unrelenting price rises and a brutal insurgency had already made it hard for Nigerians in northeastern Borno State to feed their families. When a dam collapsed in September, flooding the state capital and surrounding farmland, many people ran out of options. Now they queue for handouts in camps for those displaced by fighting between extremist Boko Haram rebels and the military. When those run out, they seek work on local farms where they risk being killed or raped by local bandits. 'I can't even cry anymore. I'm too tired,' said Indo Usman, who tried to start again in the state capital Maiduguri, rearing animals for the two annual Muslim holy days, after years of repeatedly fleeing rebel attacks in rural Borno. The flood washed that all away, driving her, her husband and their six children to a bare room at Gubio, an unfinished housing project about 96 km northwest of Maiduguri that has become a displacement camp. Torrential rains and floods in 29 of Nigeria's 36 states this year have destroyed more than 1.5 million hectares of cropland, affecting more than 9 million people, according to the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations. Climate change is a factor, as is Nigeria's poorly maintained or non-existent infrastructure as well as vulnerabilities caused by the weakening Naira currency and the scrapping of a government fuel subsidy. The cost of staples like rice and beans has doubled, tripled or even quadrupled in a year, depending on location — an unmanageable shock for millions of poor families. Mass kidnappings for ransom in the northwest and conflict between farmers and pastoralists in the central belt, traditionally the nation's bread basket, have also disrupted agriculture and squeezed food supplies. 'Hungriest of the hungry' Roughly 40% of Nigeria's more than 200 million people live below the international poverty line of $2.15 per person per day, the World Bank estimates. Already, 25 million people live in acute food and nutrition insecurity - putting their lives or livelihoods in immediate danger, according to a joint analysis by the government and U.N. agencies. That number is expected to rise to 33 million by next June-August. 'The food crisis in Nigeria is immense because what we are seeing is a crisis within a crisis within a crisis,' said Trust Mlambo, head of program for the northeast at the World Food Program, in an interview with Reuters in Maiduguri. With international donors focused on emergencies in Gaza, Ukraine and Sudan, Mlambo said there was not enough funding to fully meet Nigeria's growing need for food aid. 'We are really prioritizing the hungriest of the hungry,' he said. In Borno, the Alau dam, upriver from Maiduguri, gave way on Sept. 9, four days after state officials had told the public it was secure. Local residents and engineers had been warning that it was under strain. Hundreds of people were killed in the resulting flood, according to aid workers who did not wish to be identified for fear of offending the state government. A spokesperson for the state government did not respond to requests for comment. Zainab Abubakar, a self-employed tailor in the city who lived in relative comfort with her husband and six children in a house with a refrigerator, was awoken at midnight by water rushing into her bedroom. They ran for their lives while the flood destroyed their house and carried everything away, including her sewing machine. Now, they are sheltering at Gubio and collecting rice from aid agencies in a plastic bucket. 'There is no alternative,' she said. In Banki, on Nigeria's border with Cameroon about 133 km southeast of Maiduguri, Mariam Hassan lost crops of maize, pepper and then okra in repeated flooding of her subsistence farm this year, leaving her with nothing to eat or sell. 'I beg the neighbors or relatives to give me food, not even for me but for my children, for us to survive,' said Hassan, who has eight children. 'The situation has turned me into a beggar.'	https://www.voanews.com/a/millions-of-nigerians-go-hungry-as-floods-compound-hardship/7862106.html	2024-11-13T01:36:35-08:00	
At UN climate talks, nations big and small get chance to bear witness to climate change	BAKU, Azerbaijan — When more than two dozen world leaders deliver remarks at the United Nations' annual climate conference on Wednesday, many have detailed their nations' firsthand experience with the catastrophic weather that has come with climate change. 'Over the past year, catastrophic floods in Spain, Bosnia and Herzegovina as well as well as in southern Croatia have shown the devastating impact of rising temperatures,' said Croatia's prime minister, Andrej Plenkovic. 'The Mediterranean, one of the most vulnerable regions, calls for urgent action.' The Greek prime minister said Europe and the world needs to be 'more honest' about the trade-offs needed to keep global temperatures down. 'We need to ask hard questions about a path that goes very fast, at the expense of our competitiveness, and a path that goes some much slower, but allows our industry to adapt and to thrive,' he said. His nation this summer was hammered by successive heat waves after three years of below-average rainfall. In Greece, the misery included water shortages, dried-up lakes and the death of wild horses. Other speakers on the list include Pakistan Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif, whose nation has seen deadly flooding this year from monsoon rains that scientists say have become heavier with climate change. Just two years ago, more than 1,700 people died in widespread flooding. Pakistan has also suffered from dangerous heat, with thousands of people hospitalized with heatstroke this spring as temperatures soared to 47 degrees Celsius. Also on the list of speakers Wednesday is Bahamas Prime Minister Philip Edward Davis. Like many other countries in the Global South, the Bahamas has piled up debt from warming-connected weather disasters it did little to cause, including Hurricanes Dorian in 2019 and Matthew in 2016. Leaders have been seeking help and money from the Global North and oil companies. Early on Wednesday, ministers and officials from African nations called for initiatives to advance green development on the continent and strengthen resilience to extreme weather events — from floods to droughts — across the region. Plenty of big names and powerful countries are noticeably absent from COP29 this year. That includes the 13 largest carbon dioxide-polluting countries — a group responsible for more than than 70% of the heat-trapping gases emitted last year — were missing. The world’s biggest polluters and strongest economies — China and the United States — didn't send their No. 1s. Neither did India and Indonesia. But U.K. Prime Minister Keir Starmer was there, and he announced an 81% emissions reduction target on 1990 levels by 2035, in line with the Paris Agreement goal to limit warming to 1.5 degrees Celsius above pre-industrial times. That’s up from the 78% the U.K. had already pledged. The main focus of this year’s talks is climate finance — wealthier nations compensating poor countries for damages from climate change’s weather extremes, helping them pay to transition their economies away from fossil fuels and helping them with adaptation.	https://www.voanews.com/a/at-un-climate-talks-nations-big-and-small-get-chance-to-bear-witness-to-climate-change-/7862090.html	2024-11-13T00:28:43-08:00	
UN nuclear chief heads to Iran for crucial talks	Tehran, Iran — International Atomic Energy Agency chief Rafael Grossi is set to visit Tehran on Wednesday for crucial talks on Iran's nuclear program, warning just ahead of his trip that room for maneuver is narrowing. His visit comes only two days after the defense minister of Iran's nemesis Israel warned the Islamic republic was 'more exposed than ever to strikes on its nuclear facilities'. Israel has long accused Iran of seeking to acquire nuclear weapons, a claim Tehran denies. The two countries have traded missile strikes this year, as tensions soar over Israel's war with Iran's allies, Hamas in Gaza and Hezbollah in Lebanon. The strikes have brought to the surface their years-long shadow war and fueled fears of a wider Middle East conflict. 'The margins for maneuver are beginning to shrink,' Grossi said in an interview with AFP ahead of his visit, adding that 'it is imperative to find ways to reach diplomatic solutions'. While the IAEA is allowed to carry out inspections in Iran, Grossi stressed the need for 'more visibility' into Iran's nuclear program, given its scale and ambition. 'They have a lot of nuclear materials that could be used eventually to make a nuclear weapon, the IAEA chief told CNN on Tuesday, adding: 'They do not have a nuclear weapon at this point.' Trump's warning Grossi's trip comes after Donald Trump -- who pulled out of a hard-won nuclear deal with Iran negotiated under Barack Obama -- was voted back into the White House. Trump said last week that he was not seeking to harm Iran and instead wanted its people to have 'a very successful country', while insisting 'they can't have a nuclear weapon'. In 2015, major world powers including the United States reached an agreement with Iran on its nuclear program after 21 months of talks. The text provided for an easing of international sanctions on Iran in exchange for guarantees that it would not seek nuclear weapons. But Trump withdrew from the agreement in 2018 before re-imposing US sanctions on Iran. A year later, Iran started to gradually roll back its commitments to the nuclear deal, which only allowed Tehran to enrich uranium to 3.65 percent purity. The IAEA says Iran has considerably increased its reserves of enriched uranium to 60 percent, close to the 90 percent needed to develop an atomic bomb. It is against this backdrop that Grossi is schedule to visit Iran for the first time since May. In a statement, the IAEA said it would hold 'high-level meetings with the Iranian government' and conduct 'technical discussions on all aspects'. Cameras unplugged Iranian President Masoud Pezeshkian, who came to office in July with hopes of improving ties with the West and having sanctions lifted, favors a revival of the nuclear deal. But all efforts to get the nuclear agreement off life support have so far failed. The IAEA chief has repeatedly called for more cooperation from Iran. In recent years, Tehran has decreased its interaction with the UN agency by deactivating surveillance devices needed to monitor the nuclear program and effectively barring its inspectors. The foundations of Iran's nuclear program date back to the late 1950s, when the United States signed a civil cooperation agreement with Iran's then Shah Mohammad Reza Pahlavi. In 1970, Iran ratified the Non-Proliferation Treaty, which requires signatory states to declare and place their nuclear materials under the IAEA control. But with Iran threatening to hit back at Israel for its latest missile strikes, some lawmakers in the Islamic republic have called on the government to revise its nuclear doctrine to pursue nuclear weapons. The parliamentarians called on supreme leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, who wields ultimate authority in Iran, to reconsider his long-standing religious edict or fatwa banning nuclear weapons. The Islamic republic has maintained its policy against acquiring nuclear weapons, insisting its nuclear activities were entirely peaceful.	https://www.voanews.com/a/un-nuclear-chief-heads-to-iran-for-crucial-talks-/7862085.html	2024-11-13T00:21:54-08:00	
Russia launches missile attack on Kyiv	Blasts were heard in Kyiv Wednesday after Ukraine’s air force put the nation under an air raid alert. 'Putin is launching a missile attack on Kyiv right now,' the president’s chief of staff, Andriy Yermak, said on the social media platform Telegram, referring to Russian President Vladimir Putin. The air force earlier warned that a missile had entered the country's airspace. 'Attention! Missile in Chernihiv region heading for Kyiv region,' it said on Telegram. Russia launched cruise missiles from aircraft and ballistic missiles, the Ukrainian military said. 'Explosions in the city. Air defense forces are working. Stay in shelters!' Kyiv city administration said on the Telegram messenger. The attack came after a U.S. State Department spokesperson said North Korea troops have begun fighting alongside Russians. 'Over 10,000 DPRK (North Korean) soldiers have been sent to eastern Russia, and most of them have moved to the far western Kursk Oblast, where they have begun engaging in combat operations with Russian forces,' spokesperson Vedant Patel told reporters during a Tuesday briefing in Washington. U.S. Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin spoke Tuesday with his Ukrainian counterpart Rustem Umerov 'to discuss battlefield dynamics and provide an update on U.S. security assistance' for the Eastern European country, according to Pentagon press secretary Major General Pat Ryder. Ryder said, 'the secretary reaffirmed President [Joe] Biden's commitment to surge security assistance to Ukraine.' The Pentagon also clarified the amount of money that remains available for Ukraine's military assistance. There is about $7.1 billion left in the Presidential Drawdown Authority, which includes $4.3 billion approved by Congress in April, plus $2.8 billion that became available after recalculations. Additionally, there is about $2.2 billion available under the Ukraine Security Assistance Initiative program. Ryder again underscored that the United States would rush aid to Ukraine and use all available funds. Ryder said the two defense leaders also talked about the implications of the thousands of North Korean troops now assessed to be mostly in western Kursk Oblast. Information from The Associated Press, Reuters and Agence France-Presse was used in this report.	https://www.voanews.com/a/russia-launches-missile-attack-on-kyiv/7862080.html	2024-11-12T23:48:40-08:00	
China clears memorial to mass killing victims as government scrambles to respond	ZHUHAI, China — Authorities in the southern Chinese city of Zhuhai removed wreaths, candles and even bottles of Chinese alcohol laid at the scene of the deadliest mass killing in the country in a decade, as the government scrambled to respond and censor the outrage online. On Monday, a male driver angry at his divorce settlement rammed his car into a crowd at a sports center in the city of 2.5 million, killing 35 people and injuring 43, but the government took almost a day to announce the death toll. This prompted an outrage on Chinese social media, where posts complaining about the government's slow response and raising questions about the mental health of a nation shaken by a recent spate of similar killings, were being quickly removed. Despite the efforts to clear the site in Zhuhai, which is near Macau, delivery drivers on motorbikes kept dropping off fresh flowers on Wednesday morning, even as authorities erected temporary barriers around the makeshift vigil area and deployed security personnel. 'The authorities hadn’t released any information - some colleagues mentioned it and I couldn’t believe it at first, but it was confirmed later,' said a 50-year-old man who identified himself as Zheng who brought flowers to the site. 'It’s just a spontaneous feeling I had. Even though I don’t know them personally, I had family members who passed away in the past, so I understand that feeling,' said Zheng. Some wreaths carried handwritten notes: 'Strangers travel well. May there be no demons in heaven,' read one. On another: 'May there be no thugs in heaven. Good will triumph over evil. Rest in peace.' After initially allowing journalists to briefly speak to the people laying the flowers, a handful of security personnel sporting light blue uniforms and caps told reporters not to talk to the people or to film specific messages on the bouquets. The attack happened as Zhuhai captured China's attention with the People's Liberation Army's largest annual airshow, where a new stealth jet fighter is on display for the first time. China’s state broadcaster CCTV did not mention the attack in its 30-minute midday news bulletin. Instead, the program led with President Xi Jinping's departure for the APEC summit in Peru and devoted a portion of the airtime to the airshow. Other state media, such as China Daily's Chinese language website, also prominently displayed the news of Xi's upcoming visit to Peru. The current affairs part of China Daily's website and the local area page did not mention the incident either. Hundreds of rescue personnel were deployed to provide emergency treatment, and more than 300 healthcare workers from five hospitals worked around the clock to save lives, state media's Beijing Daily reported on Tuesday. There was no indication that the attack was related to the airshow. But it was the second such incident to occur during the Zhuhai airshow: in 2008, at least four people were killed and 20 injured when a man drove a truck into a crowded schoolyard during the airshow. Police said that attacker had been seeking revenge over a traffic dispute. Xi, cited by CCTV on Tuesday, ordered all-out efforts to treat the injured and demanded severe punishment for the perpetrator. The central government has dispatched a team to provide guidance on handling of the case, CCTV said. Violent crime is rare in China due to tight security and strict gun laws. However, a rise in reports of knife attacks in large cities has drawn public attention to safety in public spaces. The deadliest attack Reuters was able to identify in recent years in China took place in Urumqi, in China's western Xinjiang region, in 2014, in which suicide bombers killed 39 people and four of the five attackers also died.	https://www.voanews.com/a/china-clears-memorial-to-mass-killing-victims-as-government-scrambles-to-respond/7862071.html	2024-11-12T23:04:30-08:00	
Ex-Philippine President Duterte says ICC should 'hurry up' on drug war investigation	Manila, Philippines — Former Philippine President Rodrigo Duterte said the International Criminal Court (ICC) should 'hurry up' with its probe of his war on drugs, remaining firm in his defense of the brutal campaign as he said the investigation should start immediately. 'I'm asking the ICC to hurry up, and if possible, they can come here and start the investigation tomorrow,' Duterte said in a congressional inquiry on his war on drugs. 'If I am found guilty, I will go to prison.' According to police data, more than 6,200 people died in anti-drug operations under Duterte's presidency, during which police typically said they had killed suspects in self-defense. Human rights groups believe the real toll to be far greater, with thousands more users and small-time peddlers killed in mysterious circumstances by unknown assailants. 'I assume full responsibility for whatever happened in the actions taken by law enforcement agencies of this country to... stop the serious problem of drugs affecting our people,' said Duterte, who served as president from 2016 to 2022.

US Senate Democrats rush to confirm judges before Trump takes office	The U.S. Senate's Democratic majority began a crusade on Tuesday to confirm as many new federal judges nominated by President Joe Biden as possible to avoid leaving vacancies that Republican Donald Trump could fill after taking office on Jan. 20. With Republicans set to take control of the chamber on Jan. 3, the Senate on Tuesday held a confirmation vote on one of Biden's judicial nominees - former prosecutor April Perry - for the first time since Trump won the Nov. 5 presidential election. The Senate voted 51-44 in favor of her becoming a U.S. district court judge in Illinois. All told, Biden has announced another 30 judicial nominees who are awaiting Senate confirmation votes. Sixteen have already have been reviewed by the Senate Judiciary Committee and are awaiting a final confirmation vote by the full Senate. Another 14 nominees are awaiting committee review. The U.S. Constitution assigns to the Senate the power to confirm a president's nominees for life-tenured seats on the federal judiciary. 'We are going to get as many done as we can,' Democratic Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer said in a statement. Trump made 234 judicial appointments during his first four years in office, the second most of any president in a single term, and succeeded in moving the judiciary rightward - including building a 6-3 conservative majority on the U.S. Supreme Court with three appointees. Biden has appointed a host of liberal judges. Since the beginning of his presidency in 2021, the Senate has confirmed 214 Biden judicial nominees, including liberal Supreme Court Justice Ketanji Brown Jackson. About two-thirds were women, and the same share were racial minorities. Senate Democrats are under pressure to swiftly confirm the remaining nominees, along with any new picks Biden may name in the waning weeks of his presidency. How many nominees Senate Democrats will be able to confirm remains to be seen. Trump in a social media post on Sunday called on the Senate to halt approving Biden's nominees, saying, 'Democrats are looking to ram through their Judges.' Billionaire Trump backer Elon Musk on Tuesday wrote on social media that 'activist' judicial nominees are 'bad for the country.' Mike Davis, a Trump ally at the conservative judicial advocacy group Article III Project, in another post urged Senate Republicans to vote down all judicial appointments until January. 'The American people voted for monumental change,' Davis wrote on social media last week. 'Grind the Senate to a halt.' Current Senate Republican leader Mitch McConnell's office declined comment. McConnell has consistently opposed Biden's nominees and, as majority leader, was instrumental in getting Trump's previous nominees confirmed. Trump's judicial appointees have been involved in major decisions welcomed by conservatives including Supreme Court rulings rolling back abortion rights, widening gun rights, rejecting race-conscious collegiate admissions and limiting the power of federal regulatory agencies. Judicial nominees require a simple majority for confirmation. Democrats currently hold a slim 51-49 majority, meaning that they can ill afford any defections or absences if Republicans show up in force to oppose Biden's nominees during the chamber's post-election 'lame duck' session. West Virginia Senator Joe Manchin, an independent who caucuses with the Democrats, has said he would not vote for any nominee who does not garner at least one Republican vote. Must-pass legislation like a spending bill to avert a government shutdown also may consume precious time during the session. 'Every possible nominee' Biden's allies have said a concerted push to confirm his remaining nominees would allow him to build on his legacy of helping to diversify a federal bench long dominated by white men. He is not done nominating judges. On Friday, Biden announced his first post-election nominee, Tali Farhadian Weinstein, who after unsuccessfully running in the 2021 Democratic primary to be Manhattan district attorney was picked for a job as a federal district judge in New York. A spokesperson for Senator Dick Durbin, the No. 2 Senate Democrat and chair of the Judiciary Committee, said in a statement that he 'aims to confirm every possible nominee before the end of this Congress.' White House spokesperson Andrew Bates on Monday noted that during Trump's first term, the Republican-controlled Senate confirmed 18 judges after Biden had won the 2020 election but before he took office. Pending nominees include five to the influential federal appeals courts. Republicans said before the election that they had the votes to block two of them: Adeel Mangi, who would become the first Muslim federal appellate judge, and North Carolina Solicitor General Ryan Park, who unsuccessfully defended the race-conscious admissions policies before the Supreme Court. There are several others nominated to serve as trial court judges like Perry, a former prosecutor now working at Chicago-headquartered GE HealthCare who would join the bench in Illinois. Biden nominated her to a judgeship in April after her prior nomination to become Chicago's top federal prosecutor was blocked by Republican Senator JD Vance. Vance began placing a hold on Biden's nominees to the U.S. Justice Department in 2023 after Special Counsel Jack Smith secured the first of two federal indictments against Trump, who subsequently picked the senator as his vice presidential running mate.	https://www.voanews.com/a/us-senate-democrats-rush-to-confirm-judges-before-trump-takes-office/7862062.html	2024-11-12T21:38:25-08:00

British writer Samantha Harvey's space-station novel 'Orbital' wins Booker Prize for fiction	LONDON — British writer Samantha Harvey won the Booker Prize for fiction on Tuesday with 'Orbital,' a short, wonder-filled novel set aboard the International Space Station that ponders the beauty and fragility of the Earth. Harvey was awarded the 50,000-pound ($64,000) prize for what she has called a 'space pastoral' about six orbiting astronauts, which she began writing during COVID-19 pandemic lockdowns. The confined characters loop through 16 sunrises and 16 sunsets over the course of a day, trapped in one another's company and transfixed by the globe's ever-changing vistas. 'To look at the Earth from space is like a child looking into a mirror and realizing for the first time that the person in the mirror is herself,' said Harvey, who researched her novel by reading books by astronauts and watching the space station's live camera. 'What we do to the Earth we do to ourselves.' She said the novel 'is not exactly about climate change, but implied in the view of the Earth is the fact of human-made climate change.' She dedicated the prize to everyone who speaks 'for and not against the Earth, for and not against the dignity of other humans, other life.' 'All the people who speak for and call for and work for peace — this is for you,' she said. Writer and artist Edmund de Waal, who chaired the five-member judging panel, called 'Orbital' a 'miraculous novel' that 'makes our world strange and new for us.' Gaby Wood, chief executive of the Booker Prize Foundation, noted that 'in a year of geopolitical crisis, likely to be the warmest year in recorded history,' the winning book was 'hopeful, timely and timeless.' Harvey, who has written four previous novels and a memoir about insomnia, is the first British writer since 2020 to win the Booker. The prize is open to English-language writers of any nationality and has a reputation for transforming writers' careers. Previous winners include Ian McEwan, Margaret Atwood, Salman Rushdie and Hilary Mantel. De Waal praised the 'crystalline' writing and 'capaciousness' of Harvey's succinct novel — at 136 pages in its U.K. paperback edition, one of the shortest-ever Booker winners. 'This is a book that repays slow reading,' he said. He said the judges spent a full day picking their winner and came to a unanimous conclusion. Harvey beat five other finalists from Canada, the United States, Australia and the Netherlands, chosen from among 156 novels submitted by publishers. American writer Percival Everett had been the bookies' favorite to win with 'James,' which reimagines Mark Twain's 'Huckleberry Finn' from the point of view of its main Black character, the enslaved man Jim. The other finalists were American writer Rachel Kushner's spy story 'Creation Lake'; Canadian Anne Michaels' poetic novel 'Held'; Charlotte Wood's Australian saga 'Stone Yard Devotional'; and 'The Safekeep' by Yael van der Wouden, the first Dutch author to be shortlisted for the Booker. Harvey is the first female Booker winner since 2019, though one of five women on this year's shortlist, the largest number in the prize's 55-year history. De Waal said issues such as the gender or nationality of the authors were 'background noise' that did not influence the judges. 'There was absolutely no question of box ticking or of agendas or of anything else. It was simply about the novel,' he said before the awards ceremony at Old Billingsgate, a grand former Victorian fish market in central London. Founded in 1969, the Booker Prize is open to novels originally written in English published in the U.K. or Ireland. Last year's winner was Irish writer Paul Lynch for post-democratic dystopia 'Prophet Song.' Lynch handed Harvey her Booker trophy at the ceremony, warning her that her life was about to change dramatically because of the Booker publicity boost. Harvey said she was 'overwhelmed' but remained down-to-earth about spending her prize money. She said she'd disburse 'some of it on tax. I want to buy a new bike. And then the rest — I want to go to Japan.'	https://www.voanews.com/a/british-writer-samantha-harvey-s-space-station-novel-orbital-wins-booker-prize-for-fiction/7862027.html	2024-11-12T18:55:42-08:00	
Hezbollah, Hamas down but not out, US says	WASHINGTON — Israel's war against Hezbollah and Hamas, while inflicting considerable damage, has yet to strike a crippling blow to either of the Iran-backed terror groups, according to a top U.S. counterterrorism official. The acting director of the U.S. National Counterterrorism Center (NCTC) said Tuesday that the impact of Israeli intelligence operations, along with repeated military airstrikes and ground offensives in Lebanon and Gaza, have severely diminished the ability of both groups to launch new attacks on Israel. But he cautioned that both groups remain resilient, and in the case of Hezbollah, retain significant capabilities. 'Before the conflict, they [Hezbollah] had built up unprecedented numbers of rockets and missiles and other munitions,' the NCTC's Brett Holmgren told an audience in Washington, adding that the Lebanese group was starting at a 'very strong point.' And he said while Israeli strikes have decimated Hezbollah leadership, the group's ground forces in southern Lebanon 'remain somewhat intact.' Additionally, Israel's actions have done little to damage Hezbollah's reach beyond the Middle East. 'Their external capabilities have largely been untouched,' Holmgren said, noting the U.S. and its allies are on alert for any indication Hezbollah may seek to retaliate outside the region. Hamas' staying power Hamas, which touched off the war in Gaza when it launched its October 7, 2023, terror attack that killed about 1,200 mostly Israeli civilians, has also suffered greatly, according to the latest U.S. assessments. 'Militarily, they have been significantly diminished,' Holmgren said. 'They're essentially morphing into an insurgent force on the ground.' Yet despite being forced to keep a low profile and resort to hit-and-run-type tactics, U.S. intelligence sees few indications Hamas has lost its appeal. 'Hamas has been able to recruit new members to its ranks and will likely continue its ability to do so, so long as there is not another viable political option on the ground for these disaffected young men in Gaza to turn to,' Holmgren said. 'There has to be a more viable political actor on the ground in Gaza to give these new recruits for Hamas, to give them a better option,' he added. Hamas, Hezbollah numbers Prior to Hamas' October 7 attack on Israel, U.S. intelligence estimated that the U.S.-designated terror group had between 20,000 and 25,000 fighters, though some estimates put the number at 30,000 or more, citing support from about a dozen other terror groups that had pledged to fight under the Hamas banner. Hezbollah, according to U.S. estimates, had about 40,000 fighters with 'state-like military capabilities.' Holmgren on Tuesday did not elaborate on how many fighters from either group had been eliminated. Israeli officials, however, have said their forces have killed upward of 14,000 Hamas fighters and more than 2,550 Hezbollah fighters. The Israel Defense Forces earlier this month said it estimates that about 80% of Hezbollah's arsenal of medium- and short-range rockets has been destroyed. Health officials in Gaza have said the Israeli offensive there has killed more than 43,000 Palestinians, more than half of them women and children. Lebanon's Health Ministry said more than 3,000 people have been killed during the conflict, though it does not differentiate between civilians and Hezbollah fighters. Terror spreading There are growing concerns, though, that the death tolls in Lebanon and Gaza are serving as a spark for other terror groups around the world. Less than a month after Hamas' October 7 attack on Israel, U.S. counterterrorism officials warned that the event had begun to galvanize other terror groups, including Islamic State and al-Qaida. Holmgren said it appears the Hamas attack, combined with growing political and economic turmoil, has in fact helped to reenergize other groups. Islamic State 'ISIS exploited reduced counterterrorism pressure last year to recover and to rebuild as governments shifted attention and resources to the conflict in Gaza,' Holmgren said, using an acronym for the Islamic State terror group, also known as IS or Daesh. Central Syria, he said, had become an epicenter for IS plotting against the U.S. and the West, at large. And although a series of recent operations by the U.S. and the U.S.-backed Syrian Democratic Forces have again weakened IS, the group continues to benefit from improved finances and resurgent media campaigns, Holmgren said. The IS affiliate in Afghanistan known as IS-Khorasan has likewise shown resilience. State Department officials, in a recent inspector general's report, admitted that serious questions remain about whether Afghanistan's ruling Taliban 'have the will and capability to fully eliminate terrorist safe havens or control the flow of foreign terrorist fighters in and through Afghanistan.' And although key elements of IS-Khorasan have fled Afghanistan for Pakistan, there are fears the group may be poised for a resurgence. 'Sustained pressure will be needed to prevent the group from expanding further,' Holmgren said. Africa Holmgren further warned that groups affiliating themselves with IS and al-Qaida are also seeing their fortunes rise in Africa. IS and al-Qaida attacks in West Africa and the Sahel alone are set to surpass more than 3,000 by the end of the year, he said, doubling the total number of attacks from 2021. And it could get worse. Holmgren said IS and al-Qaida affiliates have capitalized on turmoil in countries such as Mali, Burkina Faso and the Central African Republic, where governments have turned to the Russian military and Russian paramilitary groups to boost security. The situation in Africa, 'if left unchecked, could become a much more acute long-term threat to U.S. interests,' he said. Younger terrorists U.S. counterterrorism analysts have also picked up on several other trends that they say bear watching. One is a propensity for younger people to join terror movements. 'The rising number of juveniles engaging in terrorism is a global phenomenon, and it may well worsen in the near term as the effects of the Israel-Hamas conflict take hold,' Holmgren said. Vulnerable young people the world over, he said, are turning to groups like IS for a sense of belonging and accomplishment. 'A lot of the propaganda — it's easily accessible on the social media platforms' he said. 'A lot of it [is in] English.' Iran and Trump There is also concern about how Iran will respond to Israel's degradation of Hezbollah and Hamas, and to the reelection of former U.S. President Donald Trump. U.S. intelligence officials warned in the run-up to last week's election that Iran was engaged in a series of influence operations aimed at hurting Trump's chance of returning to power. And late last week, the U.S. shed light on another in a series of efforts by Tehran to assassinate the once and future president. In the short term, Holmgren said, Iran could try to leverage its proxy forces in Iraq and Syria to launch additional attacks against U.S. interests and against Israel. But he also expressed concern that Iran continues to play host to al-Qaida's de facto leader, Saif al-Adel. 'I won't speculate on what the Iranian intentions are, but suffice to say, it is unhelpful with his presence there,' Holmgren said Tuesday in response to a question from VOA. Trump transition Holmgren promised Tuesday to work with the incoming Trump administration to keep the U.S. and its allies safe. 'I look forward to engaging with the Trump administration's national security team to conduct an orderly transition and to ensure that they are ready on Day One to address a dynamic threat environment,' Holmgren said. 'The U.S. counterterrorism community will be working diligently, as they do each and every day, to keep threats at bay so that our democracy may continue to shine as a beacon of freedom and hope in the world,' he added.	https://www.voanews.com/a/hezbollah-hamas-are-down-but-not-out-us-says/7862018.html	2024-11-12T18:38:55-08:00	
At White House, Indonesia's new leader straddles US-China rivalry	white house — President Joe Biden and President Prabowo Subianto met Tuesday at the White House, marking the 75th anniversary of U.S.-Indonesia relations, part of a multination visit by the newly inaugurated leader of Southeast Asia's largest economy. 'I will work very hard to strengthen Indonesia and United States relationship,' said Prabowo, who goes by his first name. Biden said he looks forward to deepening the Comprehensive Strategic Partnership, the highest level among nontreaty allies, which the two countries signed in 2023. 'That includes deepening our security cooperation,' he said before their meeting. In brief remarks to the press, Biden twice raised an issue of concern for Washington: freedom of navigation in the South China Sea. He said he wanted to strengthen the U.S. partnership with Indonesia, 'by advancing [a] free and open Indo-Pacific.' 'We'll discuss, also, global challenges, including in Gaza and the South China Sea,' he said. China's nine-dash line The White House meeting came days after Prabowo's meeting with Chinese President Xi Jinping in Beijing, where Indonesia and China signed a series of agreements valued at about $10 billion and focusing on infrastructure, green energy, digital technology and agriculture. 'In the present situation, geopolitical and geoeconomic, Indonesia and China have become very close partners in many, many fields,' Prabowo said. One of the deals is to jointly develop fisheries, and oil and gas exploration in waters around Indonesia's Natuna Islands where China's 'nine-dash line' marking its expansive claims in the South China Sea overlaps with Indonesia's Exclusive Economic Zone. Critics say the agreement risks implicitly validating China's territorial claims in the South China Sea, which, according to the United Nations, has no basis in international law. VOA asked the White House whether Biden was specifically referring to this deal in his meeting with Prabowo. 'We continue to encourage Indonesia to work with their legal experts to make sure any agreement they make with the PRC [People's Republic of China] is in accordance with international law, especially the U.N. Convention on the Law of the Sea,' said White House press secretary Karine Jean-Pierre. Beijing claims the major shipping route almost entirely, infringing into the EEZs of Indonesia, Vietnam, Malaysia, Brunei and the Philippines. All but Indonesia formally dispute the Chinese claim while Taiwan makes a claim to the sea similar to Beijing's. 'It's a big deal for Indonesia,' as a non-claimant country in the South China Sea dispute that supports the concept of a 'free and open Indo-Pacific,' said Klaus Heinrich Raditio, author on South China Sea issues and lecturer at Indonesia's Driyarkara School of Philosophy. 'People will question our position,' he told VOA. The Indonesian Foreign Ministry clarified Sunday that it remains firm in rejecting China's nine-dash line. Beijing's claim, Jakarta said, 'does not comply' with the 1982 United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea and 'therefore has no bearing' on Indonesia's sovereignty and jurisdiction over the North Natuna Sea. Jakarta's agreement with Beijing highlights a 'new phase of building the China-Indonesia community with a shared future,' according to the joint statement. This reference supports 'China's vision of a new global order that is anti-Western hegemony,' Raditio said. It's unclear whether this language was an intentional signaling of a geopolitical shift or merely an overlook from a new administration eager to bolster ties with great powers. The Indonesian Embassy in Washington has not responded to VOA's queries. 'Most likely, it is a bureaucratic mistake,' Raditio said. 'We put too much attention on economic cooperation. How many investments that we can attract from China? We kind of sideline other important issues.' Prabowo's outreach to Trump Just as important to Jakarta as the White House meeting is Prabowo's outreach to U.S. President-elect Donald Trump. Jakarta is gearing up for Trump's new administration that begins in January. 'Wherever you are, I'm willing to fly to congratulate you personally, sir,' Prabowo said in a call to Trump that was posted Monday on his social media. The Trump team has not responded to VOA's queries on the conversation. U.S. foreign policy under Trump 'may become more transactional and more focused on elements related to U.S.-China, competition,' said Andreyka Natalegawa, associate fellow for the Southeast Asia Program at the Center for Strategic and International Studies. 'The downside risk of this as it relates to Southeast Asian countries, is that it may limit some of the decision-making space they have in their diplomatic affairs,' Natalegawa said. Prabowo has voiced ambitions to raise Indonesia's international profile and has made early foreign policy moves, including a surprise decision to join Southeast Asia's largest economy to the BRICS bloc. BRICS, which stands for Brazil, Russia, India, China and South Africa, is a growing group of emerging economies seen as a counterweight to the West. In October, BRICS added Indonesia as one of the group's 13 new 'partner countries.' The move could be a shift away from the position taken by Prabowo's predecessor, Joko Widodo, who took in massive amounts of infrastructure investments from Beijing but remained mostly nonaligned geopolitically. The White House visit marks a milestone for Prabowo, who was barred from entering the U.S. under the Clinton, Bush and Obama administrations over his role in abducting activists of the 1998 'Reformasi' movement that ousted President Suharto, Prabowo's then father-in-law. The Trump administration lifted the visa ban for then-Defense Minister Prabowo, for his visit in 2020.	https://www.voanews.com/a/at-white-house-indonesia-s-new-leader-straddles-us-china-rivalry/7862008.html	2024-11-12T18:35:18-08:00

Jack Teixeira, who leaked Pentagon documents, sentenced to 15 years in prison	boston — A federal judge on Tuesday sentenced a Massachusetts Air National Guard member to 15 years in prison after he pleaded guilty to leaking highly classified military documents about the war in Ukraine. Jack Teixeira pleaded guilty earlier this year to six counts of willful retention and transmission of national defense information under the Espionage Act following his arrest in the most consequential national security case in years. Brought into court wearing an orange jumpsuit, he showed no visible reaction as he was sentenced by U.S. District Judge Indira Talwani. Before being sentenced, he apologized for his actions. 'I wanted to say I'm sorry for all the harm that I brought and caused,' Texeira said, referencing the 'maelstrom' he caused to friends, family, and anyone affected overseas. 'I understand all the responsibility and consequences fall upon my shoulders alone and accept whatever that will bring,' he said, standing as he addressed the judge. Afterward, Teixeira hugged one of his attorneys and looked toward his family and smiled before he was led out of court. The security breach raised alarm over America's ability to protect its most closely guarded secrets and forced the Biden administration to scramble to try to contain the diplomatic and military fallout. The leaks embarrassed the Pentagon, which tightened controls to safeguard classified information and disciplined members found to have intentionally failed to take required action about Teixeira's suspicious behavior. Earlier in Tuesday's hearing, Assistant U.S. Attorney Jared Dolan argued that 200 months — or a little more than 16 1/2 years — was appropriate given the 'historic' damage caused by Teixeira's conduct that aided adversaries of the United States and hurt the country's allies. He also said that the recommendation by prosecutors would send a message to anyone in the military who might consider similar conduct. 'It will be a cautionary tale for the men and women in the U.S. military,' Dolan said. 'They are going to be told this is what happens if you break your promise, if you betray your country. ... They will know the defendant's name. They will know the sentence the court imposes.' But Teixeira's attorney Michael Bachrach told the judge in court Tuesday that 11 years was sufficient. 'It is a significant, harsh and difficult sentence, one that will not be easy to serve,' Bachrach said. 'It will serve as an extreme deterrent to anyone, particularly young servicemen. That is enough to keep them deterred from committing serious conduct.' 'His intent was to educate' Teixeira, of North Dighton, Massachusetts, had pleaded guilty in March to six counts of the willful retention and transmission of national defense information under the Espionage Act. That came nearly a year after he was arrested in the most consequential national security leak in years. The 22-year-old admitted that he illegally collected some of the nation's most sensitive secrets and shared them with other users on the social media platform Discord. When Teixeira pleaded guilty, prosecutors said they would seek a prison term at the high end of the sentencing range. But the defense wrote in their sentencing memorandum earlier that the 11 years is a 'serious and adequate to account for deterrence considerations and would be essentially equal to half the life that Jack has lived thus far.' His attorneys described Teixeira as an autistic, isolated individual who spent most of his time online, especially with his Discord community. They said his actions, though criminal, were never meant to 'harm the United States.' He also had no prior criminal record. 'Instead, his intent was to educate his friends about world events to make certain they were not misled by misinformation,' the attorneys wrote. 'To Jack, the Ukraine war was his generation's World War II or Iraq, and he needed someone to share the experience with.' Prosecutors, though, had countered that Teixeira does not suffer from an intellectual disability that prevents him from knowing right from wrong. They argued that Teixeira's post-arrest diagnosis as having 'mild, high-functioning' autism 'is of questionable relevance in these proceedings.' Teixeira, who was part of the 102nd Intelligence Wing at Otis Air National Guard Base in Massachusetts, worked as a cyber transport systems specialist, which is essentially an information technology specialist responsible for military communications networks. He remains in the Air National Guard in an unpaid status, an Air Force official said. Authorities said he first typed out classified documents he accessed and then began sharing photographs of files that bore SECRET and TOP SECRET markings. Prosecutors also said he tried to cover his tracks before his arrest, and authorities found a smashed tablet, laptop and an Xbox gaming console in a dumpster at his house. The leak exposed to the world unvarnished secret assessments of Russia's war in Ukraine, including information about troop movements in Ukraine, and the provision of supplies and equipment to Ukrainian troops. Teixeira also admitted posting information about a U.S. adversary's plans to harm U.S. forces serving overseas.	https://www.voanews.com/a/jack-teixeira-who-leaked-pentagon-documents-sentenced-to-15-years-in-prison-/7861615.html	2024-11-12T17:39:02-08:00	
Economists wonder whether Trump will follow through on campaign vows	U.S. President-elect Donald Trump has left little question about the sort of economic policies he will pursue when he is sworn in for a second term as president in January. The once-and-future president has promised to extend existing tax cuts and implement new ones; to pursue a deregulation agenda, particularly when it comes to energy production; to reinstate a strong protectionist trade policy, including substantial tariffs on imports; and to undertake a 'mass deportation' program that would remove a large number of the millions of undocumented immigrants currently residing in the United States. While there may be little doubt about the kind of policies Trump will implement, the degree to which he will pursue them is an open question. 'The problem that all economists are dealing with is they don't know how much of what Trump said on the campaign trail to take seriously,' Steven B. Kamin, a senior fellow at the conservative-leaning American Enterprise Institute, told VOA. 'They don't know if he's going to do a lot of these things, or if he is, how far he'll take it.' When it comes to tariffs, Trump has promised across-the-board 10%-20% levies on all imports, and charges of up to 60% on goods coming from China, which experts warn would be economically ruinous. His rhetoric about fossil fuel extraction suggests he will drive up oil and gas production, even though the U.S. is currently producing more energy than it ever has. On immigration, he and his advisers have vacillated between suggesting that all undocumented people will be forcibly removed and describing a much more targeted operation. Tax policy One thing that appears certain is that Trump will work with Congress — which seems likely to be fully controlled by the Republican Party — to extend the tax cuts that became law as part of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act, which he signed into law in 2017. Those tax cuts reduced the income taxes paid by many American workers and reduced taxable income by increasing the standard deduction. They also sharply cut the top business income tax bracket from 39% to 21%. Those provisions are all scheduled to expire over the next several years, some as soon as 2025, and Trump has proposed making them permanent. Trump has also floated the idea of other tax cuts, including further reducing the business income tax to a maximum of 15%, and making income from overtime wages, tips and Social Security payments nontaxable, all of which would reduce government revenues. Kamin said the stimulative impact of Trump's proposed additional tax changes would likely not be great, but the impact on the country's debt might be, because they will virtually guarantee additional government borrowing to finance deficit spending. 'The real concern for folks that are concerned about the fiscal balance — and I'm one of them — is that by cementing in place large fiscal deficits as far as the eye can see, even in environments of strong economic activity when we should be running surpluses, that leads to increases in the debt,' he said. 'That, eventually, should lead to crowding out of private investment, rising interest rates, and more worries about the government's sustainability position,' Kamin added. 'But when the debt will reach a level that will be worrisome in that respect, nobody knows.' Cost-cutting In theory, some of the deficit spending made necessary by large tax cuts could be offset by a reduction in government spending, something Trump has also floated on the campaign trail. In particular, the president-elect has proposed creating a Department of Government Efficiency, to be headed by Elon Musk, the billionaire founder of the electric car company Tesla and the rocket builder SpaceX, and the owner of X, the social network formerly known as Twitter. For his part, Musk has mused that it should be possible to slash federal spending by as much as $2 trillion per year, or about 30%. Reductions of that magnitude would require deep cuts to a vast array of programs, including elements of the social safety net such as Social Security and federal health programs like Medicaid. However, it is unclear how Trump would persuade even a Republican Congress to enact such a wide-ranging reduction in government services. Immigration policy If Trump follows through on a policy of mass deportation of undocumented immigrants, it is virtually certain to have a negative impact on economic sectors where they are present as laborers in significant concentrations, especially agriculture and construction, said Marcus Noland, executive vice president and director of studies at the Peterson Institute for International Economics. 'If you take lots of people out of the labor force, you reduce the amount of output, because there's less labor available, and you raise prices,' Noland told VOA. 'These people are not distributed evenly across the United States economy,' he said. 'They're concentrated in agriculture and construction, so you would disrupt those sectors the most, especially if you combine it with tariffs.' Trade policy Trump's tariff proposals, especially if he follows through with his maximalist proposals from the campaign trail, could be significantly damaging. While theoretically meant to stimulate American manufacturing, Noland warned that they could have the opposite effect. 'Some modeling that I worked on suggest that those tariff policies, instead of reviving the industrial sector, will actually reduce industrial activity in the United States,' he warned. Blanket tariffs on imports, and especially high levies on Chinese goods, would create severe challenges for U.S. manufacturers. 'The reason is that you would increase the price of industrial inputs, and so, the United States would become a high-cost place to produce,' he said. 'Investment would fall — and investment is intensive in industrial materials — so, ironically, it has the opposite effect of what its proponents say.'	https://www.voanews.com/a/economists-wonder-whether-trump-will-follow-through-on-campaign-vows/7861691.html	2024-11-12T16:50:59-08:00	
Germany to hold snap February election amid fears political turmoil imperils Ukraine aid	Germany's main political parties have agreed to hold a general election in February, following the collapse of the ruling coalition government earlier this month. As Henry Ridgwell reports, the vote could have big implications for Ukrainian military aid — just as Europe prepares for U.S. President-elect Donald Trump's second term.	https://www.voanews.com/a/germany-to-hold-snap-february-election-amid-fears-political-turmoil-imperils-ukraine-aid-/7861665.html	2024-11-12T16:38:39-08:00	
Teen in critical condition with Canada's first presumptive human case of bird flu	TORONTO, canada — A teenager is in critical condition in a British Columbia children's hospital, sick with Canada's first presumptive human case of avian influenza. 'This was a healthy teenager prior to this, so no underlying conditions,' said provincial health officer Bonnie Henry in a news conference on Tuesday. 'It just reminds us that in young people this is a virus that can progress and cause quite severe illness, and the deterioration that I mentioned was quite rapid.' British Columbia health officials said on Saturday the province had detected Canada's first human case of H5 bird flu in a teenager. Henry said the province is still identifying the exact strain but assumes the case is H5N1. The World Health Organization says H5N1's risk to humans is low because there is no evidence of human transmission, but the virus has been found in an increasing number of animals, including cattle in the United States. Henry would not disclose the teen's gender or age but said the patient had first developed symptoms on November 2 and was tested on November 8, when admitted to a hospital. Symptoms included conjunctivitis, fever and coughing. As of Tuesday, the teen was hospitalized with acute respiratory distress syndrome, she said. The teen had no farm exposure but had been exposed to dogs, cats and reptiles, Henry said. No infection source had been identified. 'That is absolutely an ongoing investigation.' More severe illness takes place when the virus binds to receptors deep in the lungs, she said. Public health officials had identified and tested about three dozen contacts and had not found anyone infected with the virus. There has been no evidence that the disease is easily spread between people. But if that were to happen, a pandemic could unfold, scientists have said. Earlier in November, the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention asked that farm workers exposed to animals with bird flu be tested for the virus even if they did not have symptoms. Bird flu has infected nearly 450 dairy farms in 15 U.S. states since March, and the CDC has identified 46 human cases of bird flu since April. In Canada, British Columbia has identified at least 26 affected premises across the province, Henry said Tuesday, and numerous wild birds have tested positive. Canada has had no cases reported in dairy cattle and no evidence of bird flu in samples of milk.	https://www.voanews.com/a/teen-in-critical-condition-with-canada-s-first-presumptive-human-case-of-bird-flu-/7861646.html	2024-11-12T15:31:41-08:00	
US 'looks forward to working with' Haiti’s new president	The United States recognized businessman Alix Didier Fils-Aime as the newly appointed prime minister of Haiti, a State Department spokesman said in a statement Tuesday. Matthew Miller said the U.S. 'looks forward to working with' Fils-Aime and the Transitional Presidential Council 'to advance progress against urgent priorities in the coming months.' Fils-Aime, the former chairman of the board of Haiti’s Chamber of Commerce and Industry, was sworn in Monday, replacing Garry Conille, who served as the country’s prime minister for only six months. Conille is a doctor who previously ran UNICEF’s Latin American regional office. The TPC and Conille had been at odds. Several organizations recently tried to mediate the disagreements, according to the Miami Herald. The transitional council was created in April to choose the Caribbean country’s prime minister and Cabinet, paving the way to the restoration of the democratic process to the gang violence-plagued country. Democratic elections have not been held in Haiti since the assassination of President Jovenel Moise in 2021. 'The United States welcomes the commitment of the TPC and the new prime minister to release a joint action plan that outlines their vision to improve security and governance, and to set a path toward free and fair elections,' Miller’s statement said. 'The United States views it as vital that they clearly delineate the roles and responsibilities of the TPC vis-à-vis the prime minister and include measures to hold one another accountable as appropriate while preventing further gridlock,' the spokesman said. As Fils-Aime was being sworn in, gangs shot at a Spirit Airlines airplane as it was attempting to land at Toussaint L'Ouverture International Airport in Port-au-Prince, Haiti’s capital. The flight was diverted to the Dominican Republic, where it landed. The U.S. Embassy in Haiti said in an alert Monday that it was 'aware of gang-led efforts to block travel to and from Port-au-Prince which may include armed violence, and disruptions to roads, ports and airports.' The alert also said the U.S. Embassy was 'aware of a temporary pause in operations at the Toussaint L'Ouverture airport.' In addition to the gang violence that has clung to Haiti, the country has never fully recovered from a devastating earthquake in 2010. Some information for this report was provided by The Associated Press.	https://www.voanews.com/a/us-looks-forward-to-working-with-haiti-s-new-president/7861640.html	2024-11-12T15:07:05-08:00	
Pentagon secrets leaker Jack Teixeira sentenced to 15 years in prison	boston — A federal judge on Tuesday sentenced a Massachusetts Air National Guard member to 15 years in prison after he pleaded guilty to leaking highly classified military documents about the war in Ukraine. Jack Teixeira pleaded guilty earlier this year to six counts of willful retention and transmission of national defense information under the Espionage Act following his arrest in the most consequential national security case in years. Brought into court wearing an orange jumpsuit, he showed no visible reaction as he was sentenced by U.S. District Judge Indira Talwani. Before being sentenced, he apologized for his actions. 'I wanted to say I'm sorry for all the harm that I brought and caused,' Texeira said, referencing the 'maelstrom' he caused to friends, family, and anyone affected overseas. 'I understand all the responsibility and consequences fall upon my shoulders alone and accept whatever that will bring,' he said, standing as he addressed the judge. Afterward, Teixeira hugged one of his attorneys and looked toward his family and smiled before he was led out of court. The security breach raised alarm over America's ability to protect its most closely guarded secrets and forced the Biden administration to scramble to try to contain the diplomatic and military fallout. The leaks embarrassed the Pentagon, which tightened controls to safeguard classified information and disciplined members found to have intentionally failed to take required action about Teixeira's suspicious behavior. Earlier in Tuesday's hearing, Assistant U.S. Attorney Jared Dolan argued that 200 months — or a little more than 16 1/2 years — was appropriate given the 'historic' damage caused by Teixeira's conduct that aided adversaries of the United States and hurt the country's allies. He also said that the recommendation by prosecutors would send a message to anyone in the military who might consider similar conduct. 'It will be a cautionary tale for the men and women in the U.S. military,' Dolan said. 'They are going to be told this is what happens if you break your promise, if you betray your country. ... They will know the defendant's name. They will know the sentence the court imposes.' But Teixeira's attorney Michael Bachrach told the judge in court Tuesday that 11 years was sufficient. 'It is a significant, harsh and difficult sentence, one that will not be easy to serve,' Bachrach said. 'It will serve as an extreme deterrent to anyone, particularly young servicemen. That is enough to keep them deterred from committing serious conduct.' 'His intent was to educate' Teixeira, of North Dighton, Massachusetts, had pleaded guilty in March to six counts of the willful retention and transmission of national defense information under the Espionage Act. That came nearly a year after he was arrested in the most consequential national security leak in years. The 22-year-old admitted that he illegally collected some of the nation's most sensitive secrets and shared them with other users on the social media platform Discord. When Teixeira pleaded guilty, prosecutors said they would seek a prison term at the high end of the sentencing range. But the defense wrote in their sentencing memorandum earlier that the 11 years is a 'serious and adequate to account for deterrence considerations and would be essentially equal to half the life that Jack has lived thus far.' His attorneys described Teixeira as an autistic, isolated individual who spent most of his time online, especially with his Discord community. They said his actions, though criminal, were never meant to 'harm the United States.' He also had no prior criminal record. 'Instead, his intent was to educate his friends about world events to make certain they were not misled by misinformation,' the attorneys wrote. 'To Jack, the Ukraine war was his generation's World War II or Iraq, and he needed someone to share the experience with.' Prosecutors, though, had countered that Teixeira does not suffer from an intellectual disability that prevents him from knowing right from wrong. They argued that Teixeira's post-arrest diagnosis as having 'mild, high-functioning' autism 'is of questionable relevance in these proceedings.' Teixeira, who was part of the 102nd Intelligence Wing at Otis Air National Guard Base in Massachusetts, worked as a cyber transport systems specialist, which is essentially an information technology specialist responsible for military communications networks. He remains in the Air National Guard in an unpaid status, an Air Force official said. Authorities said he first typed out classified documents he accessed and then began sharing photographs of files that bore SECRET and TOP SECRET markings. Prosecutors also said he tried to cover his tracks before his arrest, and authorities found a smashed tablet, laptop and an Xbox gaming console in a dumpster at his house. The leak exposed to the world unvarnished secret assessments of Russia's war in Ukraine, including information about troop movements in Ukraine, and the provision of supplies and equipment to Ukrainian troops. Teixeira also admitted posting information about a U.S. adversary's plans to harm U.S. forces serving overseas.	https://www.voanews.com/a/pentagon-secrets-leaker-jack-teixeira-sentenced-to-15-years-in-prison-/7861615.html	2024-11-12T15:05:01-08:00	
After Trump's reelection, calls grow to renew US focus on Uyghur rights	Washington — Following President-elect Donald Trump’s victory, leaders in the Uyghur American community are advocating for renewed U.S. attention on human rights abuses in Xinjiang in northwest China, where Uyghurs and other ethnic minorities have reportedly faced severe repression. Advocates urge Trump to continue his administration’s previous measures against China, citing the impact of his first-term policies on Uyghur rights. During Trump’s first term, his administration formally labeled China’s actions in Xinjiang as genocide, leading to sanctions on Chinese officials and entities connected with alleged abuses, including mass detentions, forced labor and sterilizations. China has consistently denied accusations of abuses against ethnic minorities, asserting its policies aim to combat extremism and terrorism. Nury Turkel, a senior fellow at the Hudson Institute and former chairman of the U.S. Commission on International Religious Freedom, pointed to the bipartisan support for Uyghur rights, underscoring that these concerns resonate across both U.S. legislative and executive branches. '[Uyghur rights] concerns extend beyond typical human rights issues. They have profound national security implications tied to America’s long-term economic and strategic security,' Turkel told VOA. Turkel expressed cautious optimism that Trump’s new administration will build on its previous actions, referencing the Uyghur Human Rights Policy Act and the genocide designation. 'I am optimistic that the incoming administration will take concrete steps to address these urgent concerns affecting Uyghurs, as it had previously,' he said. VOA contacted the Trump campaign for a comment regarding the new administration’s plans for Uyghur rights in China but did not receive a response at the time of publication. Renewed calls for action Uyghur American leaders plan to press Trump’s administration to bolster sanctions on Chinese officials and entities involved in abuses against Uyghurs, with the hope of strengthening the U.S. response. 'I anticipate that the Trump administration will impose additional sanctions on Chinese officials and entities responsible for atrocity crimes against the Uyghurs, potentially strengthening U.S. efforts to confront these abuses,' Turkel added. Rushan Abbas, executive director of the Washington-based Campaign for Uyghurs, emphasized the need for strict enforcement of the Uyghur Forced Labor Prevention Act of 2021. 'Uyghurs are enduring a genocide, and Americans should know that addressing the genocide of Uyghurs is not just a foreign policy matter; it’s about preventing the U.S. from becoming complicit through the consumption of Chinese products tainted by forced labor,' Abbas told VOA. '[I]t’s about stopping China from using Americans’ hard-earned money to fuel their imperial ambitions and undermine the United States, and rejecting foreign intimidation on U.S. soil.' Salih Hudayar, prime minister of the Washington-based East Turkistan Government in Exile, echoed these sentiments, urging the Trump administration to formally recognize the region — referred to as Xinjiang by China but called East Turkistan by many Uyghurs —as an occupied nation. 'An independent East Turkistan would directly challenge China’s ambitions for dominance across Central Asia and the Indo-Pacific, safeguarding American and broader global interests,' Hudayar told VOA. He suggested appointing a special coordinator for Uyghur issues to demonstrate U.S. support for Uyghur rights and those of other minorities in the region. Current policy challenges Despite calls for stronger actions, Uyghur American advocates remain concerned that economic and strategic interests with China may take precedence. Turkel highlighted that various advocacy groups have influenced the U.S. response to Uyghur issues in recent years. 'Climate activists have lobbied for closer cooperation with China on environmental initiatives; pro-engagement China watchers have advocated a softer, more conciliatory approach to 'lower the temperature' in U.S.-China relations; and business interests have warned of the economic risks of escalating tensions, pushing for policies that protect U.S.-China trade relations,' he said. 'These pressures have contributed to a more nuanced stance and a quieter approach to human rights and Uyghur-related policies.' Turkel added, 'While steps like the Uyghur Forced Labor Prevention Act were commendable [during the Biden administration], the focus on Uyghur rights has often been eclipsed by broader geopolitical priorities,' pointing to how shifting U.S. economic priorities have impacted the response. Addressing transnational repression In addition to actions on Uyghur rights, Uyghur American leaders are urging the Trump administration to address transnational repression by China, specifically targeting covert operations that intimidate Uyghur Americans on U.S. soil. 'The administration should take immediate steps to multiply the efforts to counter transnational repression by Chinese authorities, particularly targeting the presence of covert Chinese police stations and agents who monitor and intimidate Uyghur Americans and China dissidents in the U.S.,' Abbas said. Abbas noted Trump’s efforts in securing hostage releases in his first term, urging him to prioritize Uyghur detainees held in China. 'China continues to detain Uyghur [American] family members and community leaders as a tactic to silence Uyghurs abroad … with many forced to self-censor to protect their families,' she said, advocating for strong U.S. efforts to secure their release and end repression tactics targeting Uyghurs in the diaspora.	https://www.voanews.com/a/after-trump-s-reelection-calls-grow-to-renew-us-focus-on-uyghur-rights/7861590.html	2024-11-12T14:40:13-08:00	
FAA prohibits US airlines from flying to Haiti; UN suspends flights	PORT-AU-PRINCE, Haiti — The Federal Aviation Administration announced Tuesday that it will prohibit U.S. airlines from flying to Haiti for 30 days after gangs shot a Spirit Airlines flight. The United Nations also said it will suspend flights, 'obviously limiting the flow of humanitarian aid and humanitarian personnel into the country.' The bullets hit the plane when it was about to land Monday in the country's capital, Port-au-Prince, injuring a flight attendant. It was part of a wave of violence that erupted in Haiti as the country swore in its new prime minister after a politically tumultuous process. Life in much of Haiti's capital was frozen after the wave of violence, which came to a head when gangs shot the Spirit Airlines airplane Monday, forcing the airport to shut down. Photos and videos obtained by The Associated Press show bullet holes dotting the interior of a plane. A number of airlines suspended flights to Haiti through Thursday, but it was unclear how long closures could drag on. Neither the former interim prime minister, Garry Conille, nor the newly inaugurated Alix Didier Fils-Aime commented on the violence. But Luis Abinader, who as president of the neighboring Dominican Republic has cracked down on Haitian migration, called firing on the airplane terrorism. 'This was a terrorist act; the countries that are following and helping Haiti should declare these armed gangs as terrorist groups,' Abinader said in a news conference. On Tuesday, heavily armed police in armored cars outside the airport checked trucks used for public transportation passing by. Schools were closed, as were banks and government offices. The streets, where just a day before gangs and police were locked in a fierce firefight, were eerily empty. The sound of heavy gunfire was heard in the streets in the afternoon — a reminder that despite political maneuvering by Haiti's elites and a strong push by the international community to restore peace, the country's toxic slate of gangs kept its firm hold on much of the Caribbean nation. The United Nations estimates that gangs control 85% of the capital. A U.N.-backed mission led by Kenyan police to quell gang violence struggles with a lack of funding and personnel, prompting calls for a U.N. peacekeeping mission.	https://www.voanews.com/a/faa-prohibits-us-airlines-from-flying-to-haiti-un-suspends-flights/7861576.html	2024-11-12T13:39:48-08:00

How could US-China rivalry in Africa play out under Trump 2.0?	Johannesburg — President-elect Donald Trump talked tough on China during his campaign, vowing to impose higher and sweeping tariffs on imports from the Asian giant. Beijing will now also be closely watching the incoming administration’s movements further afield, in Africa, where U.S.-China rivalry is high. Experts disagree on what a second Trump term will mean for Beijing’s ambitions on the continent, with some saying it could be a boon for China – Africa’s biggest trade partner – if the U.S. pursues an isolationist, 'America First' agenda that mostly ignores the region. But Tibor Nagy, who served as Trump’s Assistant Secretary of State for African Affairs from 2018 to 2021 has a different perspective. He said Trump grasped how powerful a player China had become on the continent. 'It was the Trump administration that was the first to kind of recognize the existential threat that China poses,' Nagy told VOA. 'We were on the front lines of that in Africa, and we saw what the Chinese were doing,' said Nagy, who also served as the U.S. ambassador to Guinea and Ethiopia during the administrations of presidents Bill Clinton and George W. Bush. Nagy told VOA he does not think the incoming Republican administration will neglect Africa because it sees China as a threat to U.S interests there. He also said the continent is a major source of critical minerals attractive to both superpowers. Nagy credits the first Trump administration with introducing policies on the continent intended to counter China's influence. 'We had … the right focus because we made it about the youth. You know, our premise was that Africa is going to be undergoing a youth tsunami with the population doubling by 2050. And that more than anything, what the youth really wanted was jobs,' he said. To this end, Nagy says, the first Trump administration set up Prosper Africa in 2018, an initiative designed to assist American companies doing business in Africa, and he expects the incoming administration will remain engaged there. 'Africa remains very much the front lines,' he said. 'The United States is extremely concerned about our strategic minerals, and when a hostile power has a lock on strategic minerals, that's really not very good when you need the strategic minerals for your top-end technology and for weapon systems.' But Christian-Geraud Neema, Africa editor for the China-Global South Project, is skeptical and said a second term for Trump could be an opportunity for Beijing. 'Looking at his first term, Trump didn't show much interest in Africa, which is likely to be the case still now,' he told VOA. 'Only a few countries will matter — countries whose resources or position matter to the U.S. national security interests.' 'China will have room to maneuver and increase its influence in so many ways,' he added. Yun Sun, director of the China program at the Stimson Center, echoed this. 'I doubt that Africa will be a featured priority for Trump,' she told VOA in an emailed response, adding that the United States’ absence on the continent 'will boost the prominence of the Chinese position by its presence.' Lobito corridor future Views on how successfully President Joe Biden’s administration has engaged with Africa are also mixed. Many analysts said regardless of whether the Democrats or the Republicans are in office, the continent is usually an afterthought in U.S. foreign policy, which does not differ much from one administration to the next. The current administration said it was 'all in on Africa,' when Biden hosted dozens of heads of state at his first African Leaders Summit in 2022, an event seen as an attempt at reasserting U.S. influence in the face of a rising China. Yet, 'African leaders or the African Union were not consulted about the agenda of the 2022 US-Africa Leaders Summit. This was also the case with the US’s Africa strategy,' wrote Christopher Isike, the director of African Centre for the Study of the United States at the University of Pretoria, in an article co-signed by Samuel Oyewole, political science postdoctoral research fellow at the university While Trump never traveled to Africa as president, top Biden administration officials did visit the continent, including the vice president. Biden is also expected to travel to Angola before the end of his term in December. Under Biden, the U.S. agreed to develop the Lobito Corridor and Zambia-Lobito rail line, a project described by the State Department as 'the most significant transport infrastructure that the United States has helped develop on the African continent in a generation.' The rail line is seen as part of a transcontinental vision connecting the Atlantic and Indian oceans. The undertaking is to be financed through a joint agreement calling for the U.S., African Development Bank, Africa Finance Corporation (AFC) and the European Union to support Angola, the Democratic Republic of Congo, and Zambia. Observers see it as an attempt to compete with Chinese President Xi Jinping’s global infrastructure project the Belt and Road Initiative, which has built railways, ports and roads across Africa. There is concern among some analysts that Trump could pull back from this. 'Existing bilateral and multilateral business partnerships … such as the Lobito Corridor … might wane significantly during the next Trump administration,' said Oluwole Ojewale, a Nigerian analyst with the Institute for Security Studies, in an email to VOA. 'When that happens China will gain significant mileage in areas where the US Government’s exit creates a vacuum on the continent,' he added. But Nagy disagreed, saying the Lobito Corridor is the 'kind of project which would have come right out of the Trump administration.' Therefore, there’s likely to be continuity, he added, noting: 'The deal is done. Again, I can't speak for President Trump, or the people who are going to be coming in … but it's logical.' ‘Other Friends’ When asked how African leaders will navigate the next Trump administration, Sun said they could play the U.S. and China against each other. 'Africa could highlight its role in the US-China great power competition in order to strengthen its position in the US grand strategy,' she said in an email to VOA. But she is doubtful African leaders will take that route because it 'will carry the effect of being forced to choose, which I doubt that Africa will want to do.' However, at least one African politician has already alluded to this option. Kenya’s Raila Odinga, who is in the running to take over as chair of the African Union Commission next year, was blunt in his assessment of how African governments would handle a more isolationist U.S. under Trump. 'If he does not want to work with Africa,' Odinga told Agence France-Presse last week, 'Africa has got other friends.'	https://www.voanews.com/a/7861526.html	2024-11-12T12:34:38-08:00	
UN appeals for Sudan cease-fire as fighting spreads	United Nations — The United Nations renewed its appeal for an immediate cease-fire in Sudan on Tuesday, with officials warning that civilians are paying a high price for the fighting, as external parties fuel the conflict by supplying weapons. 'It is long past time for the warring parties to come to the negotiating table,' said U.N. political chief Rosemary DiCarlo. 'The only path out of this conflict is a negotiated political solution.' DiCarlo said that in the absence of a nationwide cease-fire, local ones could give civilians some respite and create openings for dialogue for a more comprehensive agreement. She told a meeting of the U.N. Security Council that the rival leaders of the Sudanese Armed Forces (SAF) and the Rapid Support Forces (RSF) appear convinced that they can each win on the battlefield and have escalated their military operations and attacks. 'This is possible thanks to considerable external support, including a steady flow of weapons into the country,' she said. 'To put it bluntly, certain purported allies of the parties are enabling the slaughter in Sudan. This is unconscionable, it is illegal, and it must end.' Russia and Egypt are reported to be among the countries providing the SAF with arms and equipment. Meanwhile, Sudanese officials have publicly accused the United Arab Emirates of funneling weapons to the RSF militia through neighboring Chad. The UAE vehemently denies the accusation, but a U.N. panel of experts said earlier this year there was substance to media reports that cargo planes originating in the UAE capital had landed in eastern Chad with arms, ammunition and medical equipment destined for the paramilitary group. Sudan’s ambassador stood by the claim on Tuesday, telling the council that the RSF is using humanitarian convoys to smuggle both weapons and foreign mercenaries through the Adre border crossing with Chad. Sudan’s authorization for that crossing is about to expire and humanitarians — and most council members — want it to remain open. 'We commend the Sudanese authorities for opening the Adre border crossing in mid-August,' U.S. Ambassador Linda Thomas-Greenfield said. 'This single route allowed aid organizations to bring enough food, health and nutrition supplies to serve more than 1.9 million people. Now, Sudanese authorities must keep Adre border crossing open indefinitely. Millions of lives depend on it.' Eleven million people have been displaced and half of Sudan’s population, an estimated 25 million people, are struggling with crisis-level food insecurity, according to the U.N. Famine was confirmed in August in the northern part of Sudan’s Darfur region. 'In North Darfur, fighting in and around El Fasher continues to intensify and block the movement of aid supplies into the area,' said Ramesh Rajasingham, director of the coordination division of the U.N. office on humanitarian affairs. El Fasher is the capital of North Darfur and has been the epicenter of a battle for the last seven months between the RSF, who are poised to capture the city, and the SAF, which are trying to hold on to it. More than 1.5 million civilians in El Fasher, many of them displaced from other parts of Sudan, are caught in the crossfire. Humanitarians have confirmed famine conditions in parts of El Fasher, including at the Zamzam camp for displaced persons, which houses more than 400,000 people. Rajasingham said about a third of the children in the camp are malnourished, including 10% who are severely malnourished. Since Oct. 20, tens of thousands of civilians have been displaced from eastern Al Jazirah state, following a wave of RSF attacks on villages there that reportedly killed more than 120 civilians. Women and girls were raped, markets looted, and homes and farms were burned to the ground. 'The international community must take what’s happening in Sudan seriously and must take urgent action to address it,' Rajasingham said of the spreading conflict. On Friday, the U.N. Security Council’s sanctions committee for Sudan designated RSF commanders Abdel Rahman Juma Barkalla and Osman Mohamed Hamid Mohamed for sanctions for their roles in the violence in Darfur. The United States said Tuesday that it is adding Barkalla to its own sanctions list and noted it had already designated Hamid in May 2024. The U.N. Security Council is working on a draft resolution focused on the protection of civilians through the implementation of commitments both parties made last year in Jeddah, Saudi Arabia, as well as supporting mediation that would lead to a cease-fire. No date for a vote has been announced.	https://www.voanews.com/a/un-appeals-for-sudan-cease-fire-as-fighting-spreads/7861485.html	2024-11-12T12:24:18-08:00	
Taliban announce scheduled public execution for Afghan murder convict	Islamabad — Taliban authorities in eastern Afghanistan are scheduled to publicly execute a convicted murderer on Wednesday, citing the Islamic concept of retributive justice, or qisas. The early morning punishment will be carried out at a sports stadium in Gardez, the capital of the Paktia province, according to a local language official announcement Tuesday through the X social media platform. It invited the public, religious scholars, and civilian and military officials to attend the event, instructing them not to bring cameras or cell phones. If the death penalty is implemented as scheduled, it will be the sixth public execution of a murder convict in Afghanistan since the Taliban regained power in August 2021 and implemented a criminal justice system based on their interpretation of Islamic law, Sharia. The announcement did not specify how the execution will be implemented. Previously, such executions were carried out by gunshot. Despite the United Nations condemning the practice as 'inconsistent with the fundamental right to life' and 'a form of cruel, inhuman, or degrading treatment or punishment,' de facto Afghan leaders continue to carry out these executions. The Taliban also have flogged hundreds of men and women in packed sports stadiums across Afghanistan for committing 'immoral crimes,' such as adultery, homosexuality, theft, and robbery. In October alone, nearly 100 Afghans, including women, were lashed in front of onlookers and received jail terms ranging from six months to two years for such offenses, according to the Taliban Supreme Court data. U.N. experts and human rights organizations have decried corporal punishment as a breach of human rights and international law, urging the Taliban to stop it immediately. Women’s rights in Afghanistan have declined sharply under the Taliban rule, according to U.N. assessments. They cite a series of decrees and directives issued by Taliban leader Hibatullah Akhundzada, which are designed to 'systematically' exclude women from public life in nearly every sector. The edicts have banned Afghan girls and young women from pursuing secondary and university-level education. Women are banned from public and private workplaces with exceptions for health, immigration, and police departments. A recent decree has deemed the sound of women’s voices in public a moral violation and requires them to cover their entire bodies and faces when outdoors. It also forbids women from looking at men to whom they are not related and vice versa.

Jury awards Abu Ghraib detainees $42 million, holds contractor responsible	ALEXANDRIA, Virginia — A U.S. jury on Tuesday awarded $42 million to three former detainees of Iraq's notorious Abu Ghraib prison, holding a Virginia-based military contractor responsible for contributing to their torture and mistreatment two decades ago. The decision from the eight-person jury came after a different jury earlier this year couldn't agree on whether Reston, Virginia-based CACI should be held liable for the work of its civilian interrogators who worked alongside the U.S. Army at Abu Ghraib in 2003 and 2004. The jury awarded plaintiffs Suhail Al Shimari, Salah Al-Ejaili and Asa'ad Al-Zubae $3 million each in compensatory damages and $11 million each in punitive damages. The three testified that they were subjected to beatings, sexual abuse, forced nudity and other cruel treatment at the prison. They did not allege that CACI's interrogators explicitly inflicted the abuse themselves, but argued CACI was complicit because its interrogators conspired with military police to 'soften up' detainees for questioning with harsh treatment. CACI's lawyer, John O'Connor, did not comment after Tuesday's verdict on whether the company would appeal. Baher Azmy, a lawyer for the Center for Constitutional Rights, which filed the lawsuit on the plaintiffs' behalf, called the verdict 'an important measure of Justice and accountability' and praised the three plaintiffs for their resilience, 'especially in the face of all the obstacles CACI threw their way.' The $42 million fully matches the amount sought by the plaintiffs, Azmy said. 'Today is a big day for me and for justice,' said Al-Ejaili, a journalist, in a written statement. 'I've waited a long time for this day. This victory isn't only for the three plaintiffs in this case against a corporation. This victory is a shining light for everyone who has been oppressed and a strong warning to any company or contractor practicing different forms of torture and abuse.' Al-Ejaili traveled to the U.S. for both trials to testify in person. The other two plaintiffs testified by video from Iraq. The trial and subsequent retrial were the first time a U.S. jury heard claims brought by Abu Ghraib survivors in the 20 years since photos of detainee mistreatment — accompanied by smiling U.S. soldiers inflicting the abuse — shocked the world during the U.S. occupation of Iraq. None of the three plaintiffs were in any of the notorious photos shown in news reports around the world, but they described treatment very similar to what was depicted. Al Shimari described sexual assaults and beatings during his two months at the prison. He also said he was electrically shocked and dragged around the prison by a rope tied around his neck. Al-Ejaili said he was subjected to stress positions that caused him to vomit black liquid. He was also deprived of sleep, forced to wear women's underwear and threatened with dogs. CACI had argued it wasn't complicit in the detainees' abuse. It said its employees had minimal interaction with the three plaintiffs in the case, and CACI questioned parts of the plaintiffs' stories, saying that military records contradict some of their claims and suggesting they shaded their stories to support a case against the contractor. Fundamentally, though, CACI argued that any liability for their mistreatment belonged to the government. As in the first trial, the jury struggled to decide whether CACI or the Army should be held responsible for any misconduct by CACI interrogators. The jury asked questions in its deliberations about whether the contractor or the Army bore liability. CACI, as one of its defenses, argued it shouldn't be liable for any misdeeds by its employees if they were under the control and direction of the Army, under a legal principle known as the 'borrowed servants' doctrine. Lawyers for the plaintiffs argued that CACI was responsible for its own employees' misdeeds. They said provisions in CACI's contract with the Army, as well as the Army Field Manual, make clear that CACI is responsible for overseeing its own workers. The lawsuit was first filed in 2008 but was delayed by 15 years of legal wrangling and multiple attempts by CACI to have the case dismissed. Lawyers for the three plaintiffs argued that CACI was liable for their mistreatment even if they couldn't prove that CACI's interrogators were the ones who directly inflicted the abuse. The evidence included reports from two retired Army generals, who documented the abuse and concluded that multiple CACI interrogators were complicit in the abuse. Those reports concluded that one of the interrogators, Steven Stefanowicz, lied to investigators about his conduct and that he likely instructed soldiers to mistreat detainees and used dogs to intimidate detainees during interrogations. Stefanowicz testified for CACI at trial through a recorded video deposition and denied mistreating detainees.	https://www.voanews.com/a/jury-awards-abu-ghraib-detainees-42-million-holds-contractor-responsible/7861333.html	2024-11-12T11:04:37-08:00	
Head of UN nuclear watchdog: 'Dire straits dynamic' with Iran's nuclear program amid Mideast wars	BAKU, Azerbaijan — The head of the United Nations' nuclear watchdog said Tuesday he's hopeful that meetings this week with Iranian officials, including the country's new president, can lead to a breakthrough in monitoring the country's nuclear program, a longstanding issue that has gained new urgency as Israel has twice struck Iran amid rising tensions in the Middle East. Rafael Mariano Grossi, director general of the International Atomic Energy Agency, will travel to Iran on Wednesday to meet for the first time with President Masoud Pezeshkian, who was elected in July. Grossi said he hopes to build on positive discussions he had with Iranian Foreign Minister Abbas Araghchi during the U.N. General Assembly in September. 'We have a problem that we need to solve,' Grossi said in an interview at the U.N. climate conference in Azerbaijan. 'That is this gap, this lack of confidence, which we should not allow to grow into a self-fulfilling prophecy of using nuclear facilities as targets.' He added: 'There has been a bit of a dire straits dynamic with Iran that we want to go beyond.' Iran is rapidly advancing its atomic program while increasing stockpiles of uranium enriched to near weapons-grade levels, all in defiance of international demands, according to the IAEA. Iran says its program is for energy purposes, not to build weapons. Grossi's visit comes as Israel and Iran have traded missile attacks in recent months after more than a year of war in Gaza, which is governed by Hamas, a group supported by Iran. Grossi noted that international law prohibits the attack of nuclear facilities and 'it's obvious that is something that can have radiological consequences.' The Biden administration said last month that it had won assurances from Israel that it would not attack nuclear or oil sites. A 2015 nuclear agreement between Iran and world powers put limits on Iran's nuclear program, which the West fears could be used to make nuclear weapons. The deal included the lifting of economic sanctions on Iran. But that deal collapsed after Donald Trump's administration in 2018 pulled the United States from it. That led Iran to abandon all limits put on its program and enrich uranium to up to 60% purity. When asked if the IAEA feared Iran may be developing a bomb, Grossi said he didn't 'have any information that would sustain that.' He added that inspectors' job was not to 'judge intentions,' but rather verify that what Iran says about its nuclear program was true. Trump's reelection last week raises questions about whether and how the incoming administration and Iran may engage. Grossi said he had worked with the first Trump administration, which he said engaged in 'seamless, professional work,' and looked forward to looking with Trump's second administration. 'Circumstances have changed in that the problem has grown bigger than it was,' said Grossi. 'The problem of not finding a solution.'	https://www.voanews.com/a/head-of-un-nuclear-watchdog-dire-straits-dynamic-with-iran-s-nuclear-program-amid-mideast-wars-/7861364.html	2024-11-12T10:54:27-08:00	
Trump picks key political loyalists for top jobs	U.S. President-elect Donald Trump is moving quickly to fill his nascent administration with Republican officials who have been the most politically loyal to him in the four years he was out of office. Trump, according to various U.S. news accounts, has decided to name Florida Senator Marco Rubio as secretary of state, the country's top diplomat, and South Dakota Governor Kristi Noem as the Homeland Security chief. Both Rubio and Noem were on Trump's short list of possible vice-presidential running mates several months ago. While Trump later picked first-term Ohio Senator JD Vance, now the vice president-elect, to join him on the Republican national ticket, both Rubio and Noem remained Trump stalwarts as he easily won the election last week over Democratic Vice President Kamala Harris. Other news accounts say that Trump has settled on Michael Waltz, a Florida congressman, as his national security adviser. Waltz earlier this year supported a long-shot Republican legislative effort to rename Washington's international airport for Trump. Trump on Monday also named Thomas Homan, his former acting immigration chief, to be his 'border czar' to head efforts to deport undocumented migrants living in the U.S., possibly millions, back to their home countries. News accounts reported that Stephen Miller, another vocal anti-migrant adviser who served in Trump's first term, would be named as Trump's deputy chief of staff for policy. The president-elect also named another ardent supporter, Elise Stefanik, a New York congresswoman, as the new U.S. ambassador to the United Nations. Just ahead of the election, Trump, who only rarely publicly admits making any mistakes, told podcaster Joe Rogan that his biggest error during his term from 2017 to 2021 was hiring 'bad people, or disloyal people.' 'I picked some people that I shouldn't have picked,' he said. Some of the top officials Trump chose then, including former chief of staff John Kelly and national security adviser John Bolton, became sharp public Trump critics after he ousted them. Kelly said during this year's campaign that Trump met the definition of a fascist ruler. Trump attacked both former officials, calling Kelly 'a bully but a weak person' and disparaging Bolton as 'an idiot.' Ahead of the election, Bolton said, 'What Trump will look for in senior nominees in a second term is fealty. He wants 'yes men' and 'yes women.'' Rubio sparred sharply with Trump during their 2016 run for the Republican presidential nomination, which Trump captured enroute to his first term as president. Rubio mocked Trump as having small hands and sporting an orange spray tan, while Trump derided Rubio as 'little Marco.' But Rubio, like numerous other one-time Trump critics, was a staunch Trump supporter in this year's campaign. In recent years, Rubio has proved to be an outspoken foreign policy hawk, taking hard lines on U.S. relations with China, Iran, Venezuela and Cuba. He has at times been at odds with Republicans who were skeptical about U.S. involvement in overseas conflicts, such as helping to fund Ukraine's fight against Russia's 2022 invasion. But more recently, he voted against sending more U.S. military aid to Ukraine, while Trump has also voiced skepticism about the extent of U.S. assistance to Kyiv. Rubio told NBC News in September, 'I think the Ukrainians have been, such incredibly brave and strong in standing up to Russia. But at the end of the day, what we are funding here is a stalemate war, and it needs to be brought to a conclusion, or that country is going to be set back 100 years.' 'I'm not on Russia's side — but unfortunately, the reality of it is that the way the war in Ukraine is going to end is with a negotiated settlement,' Rubio said. Noem rose to national prominence and won conservative plaudits after refusing to impose a statewide mask mandate during the COVID-19 pandemic in 2021. Trump was reportedly considering her as his vice-presidential running mate. But she faced widespread criticism and fell in the stakes to be Trump's No. 2 in April when she wrote in a memoir that she shot to death an 'untrainable' dog that she 'hated' on her family farm. Waltz is a former Army Green Beret who shares Trump's views on illegal immigration and skepticism of America's continued support for Ukraine. Waltz, who also has served in the National Guard as a colonel, has criticized Chinese activity in the Asia-Pacific and said the United States needs to be ready for a potential conflict in the region. Just as notable as Trump's initial selections are two former officials he has rejected for top jobs in his new administration: Nikki Haley, his former U.S. ambassador to the United Nations, and former Secretary of State Mike Pompeo. Haley ran against Trump for the 2024 Republican presidential nomination and Pompeo considered opposing Trump before backing off. Trump is heading to Washington on Wednesday to meet with President Joe Biden, who defeated Trump in the 2020 election, about the transfer of power when Trump is inaugurated on January 20. Trump is also planning to meet with Republicans in the House of Representatives.	https://www.voanews.com/a/trump-picks-key-political-loyalists-for-top-jobs/7861380.html	2024-11-12T10:52:54-08:00	
US sanctions Sudan RSF commander over human rights abuses	Washington — The United States sanctioned a senior Sudanese paramilitary official on Tuesday, accusing him of overseeing human rights abuses in his country's West Darfur region. The Treasury Department announced the sanctions on Abdel Rahman Joma'a Barakallah, a commander with Sudan's paramilitary Rapid Support Forces (RSF), which it accused of being 'a primary party responsible for the ongoing violence against civilians in Sudan.' Sudan has been gripped by a deadly conflict since April 2023 between the army, led by General Abdel Fattah al-Burhan, and the RSF, led by his former deputy, General Mohamed Hamdan Dagalo, who is also known as Hemedti. In a statement, the Treasury said the RSF's campaign in West Darfur 'was marked by credible claims of serious human rights abuses, including targeting of civilians, conflict-related sexual violence (CRSV), and ethnically motivated violence.' U.N. experts have estimated that the RSF, with the support of Arab militias, have killed between 10,000 and 15,000 people in the West Darfur town of El-Geneina alone. 'Today's action underscores our commitment to hold accountable those who seek to facilitate these horrific acts of violence against vulnerable civilian populations in Sudan,' Treasury acting under secretary for terrorism and financial intelligence Bradley Smith said in a statement. 'The United States remains focused on supporting an end to this conflict and calls on both sides to participate in peace talks and ensure the basic human rights of all Sudanese civilians,' he added.	https://www.voanews.com/a/us-sanctions-sudan-rsf-commander-over-human-rights-abuses/7861144.html	2024-11-12T08:29:28-08:00	
Federal judge blocks Louisiana law that requires classrooms to display Ten Commandments	BATON ROUGE, Louisiana — A new Louisiana law that requires the Ten Commandments to be displayed in every public classroom by Jan. 1 has been temporarily blocked after a federal judge granted a preliminary injunction on Tuesday. The judge said the law is 'unconstitutional on its face' and plaintiffs are likely to win their case with claims that the law violates the First Amendment. The ruling marks a win for opponents of the law, who argue that it is a violation of the separation of church and state and that the poster-sized display of the Ten Commandments would isolate students, especially those who are not Christian. Proponents say that the measure is not solely religious, but that it has historical significance to the foundation of U.S. law. U.S. District Judge John W. deGravelles in Baton Rouge issued the order in an ongoing lawsuit filed by a group of parents of Louisiana public school children. They say that the legislation violates First Amendment language forbidding government establishment of religion and guaranteeing religious liberty. The new law in Louisiana, a reliably Republican state that is ensconced in the Bible Belt, was passed by the state's Republican-dominated Legislature earlier this year. The legislation, which has been touted by Republicans including President-elect Donald Trump, is one of the latest pushes by conservatives to incorporate religion into classrooms — from Florida legislation allowing school districts to have volunteer chaplains to counsel students to Oklahoma's top education official ordering public schools to incorporate the Bible into lessons. In recent years, similar bills requiring the Ten Commandments be displayed in classrooms have been proposed in other states including Texas, Oklahoma and Utah. However, with threats of legal battles over the constitutionality of such measures, none have gone into effect. In 1980, the U.S. Supreme Court ruled that a similar Kentucky law was unconstitutional and violated the establishment clause of the U.S. Constitution, which says Congress can 'make no law respecting an establishment of religion.' The high court found that the law had no secular purpose but rather served a plainly religious purpose. Louisiana's legislation, which applies to all public K-12 school and state-funded university classrooms, requires the Ten Commandments to be displayed on a poster or framed document at least 28 by 36 centimeters where the text is the central focus and 'printed in a large, easily readable font.' Each poster must be paired with the four-paragraph 'context statement' describing how the Ten Commandments 'were a prominent part of American public education for almost three centuries.' Tens of thousands of posters would likely be needed to satisfy the new law. Proponents say that schools are not required to spend public money on the posters, and instead that they can be bought using donations or that groups and organizations will donate the actual posters.	https://www.voanews.com/a/federal-judge-blocks-louisiana-law-that-requires-classrooms-to-display-ten-commandments/7861115.html	2024-11-12T08:29:07-08:00	
Supreme Court rejects push to move Georgia case against ex-Trump chief of staff Meadows	WASHINGTON — The Supreme Court refused Tuesday to let former Trump White House chief of staff Mark Meadows move the election interference case against him in Georgia to federal court. Meadows was one of 19 people indicted in Georgia and accused of participating in an illegal scheme to keep then-president Donald Trump in power after he lost the 2020 election. Trump was also charged, though after he won reelection last week to a second term any trial appears unlikely, at least while he holds office. Both men have denied wrongdoing. It's unclear what effect the election results could have on others charged in the case, which is largely on hold after an appeals court agreed to review whether to remove Fulton County District Attorney Fani Willis over her romantic relationship with the special prosecutor she had hired to lead the case. Meadows had gone to the Supreme Court in an effort to move the charges out of Georgia courts. He argues the case belongs in federal court because it relates to his duties as a federal official, and he pointed to the Supreme Court ruling giving Trump broad immunity from criminal prosecution to support his argument. 'A White House chief of staff facing criminal charges based on actions relating to his work for the president of the United States should not be a close call — especially now that this court has recognized that federal immunity impacts what evidence can be considered, not just what conduct can form the basis for liability,' his attorneys wrote. But prosecutors said that Meadows failed to show he was carrying out official duties during the alleged scheme, including participating in a phone call where Trump suggested Georgia Secretary of State Brad Raffensperger could help 'find' votes he needed to win the state. They argued the case should stay with Georgia courts, and Meadows can raise immunity defenses there. Prosecutors also pushed back against the contention that the charges could have ripple effects on other federal officials. 'His references to the overheated words of opinion editorials cannot suffice to demonstrate that a new era of ubiquitous prosecution of former federal officials is at hand,' government attorneys wrote. A U.S. district judge and the 11th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals both ruled that the case against Meadows and some of his co-defendants should remain in state court. A federal judge has also refused to move an Arizona fake elector case against him there to federal court. Four people have already pleaded guilty in the Georgia election case after reaching deals with prosecutors. The remaining 15, including Trump and Meadows, have pleaded not guilty.	https://www.voanews.com/a/supreme-court-rejects-push-to-move-georgia-case-against-ex-trump-chief-of-staff-meadows/7861084.html	2024-11-12T07:48:13-08:00	
Judge delays ruling on whether to scrap Trump's conviction in hush money case	New York — A judge is postponing a decision on whether to undo President-elect Donald Trump's conviction in his hush money case because of a U.S. Supreme Court ruling on presidential immunity. New York Judge Juan M. Merchan had been set to rule Tuesday. Instead, he told Trump's lawyers Tuesday he'd delay the ruling until Nov. 19. According to emails filed in court, Trump lawyer Emil Bove asked for the delay over the weekend, arguing that putting the case on hold — and then ending it altogether — is 'necessary to avoid unconstitutional impediments to President Trump's ability to govern.' Prosecutors agreed to the delay. Trump won back the White House a week ago but the legal question concerns the Republican's status as a past president, not an impending one. A jury convicted Trump in May of falsifying business records related to a $130,000 payment to porn actor Stormy Daniels in 2016. The payout was to buy her silence about claims that she had sex with Trump. He says they didn't, denies any wrongdoing and maintains the prosecution was a political tactic meant to harm his latest campaign. Just over a month after the verdict, the Supreme Court ruled that ex-presidents can't be prosecuted for actions they took in the course of running the country, and prosecutors can't cite those actions even to bolster a case centered on purely personal conduct. Trump's lawyers cited the ruling to argue that the hush money jury got some evidence it shouldn't have, such as Trump's presidential financial disclosure form and testimony from some White House aides. Prosecutors disagreed and said the evidence in question was only 'a sliver' of their case. Trump's criminal conviction was a first for any ex-president. It left the 78-year-old facing the possibility of punishment ranging from a fine or probation to up to four years in prison. The case centered on how Trump accounted for reimbursing his personal attorney for the Daniels payment. The lawyer, Michael Cohen, fronted the money. He later recouped it through a series of payments that Trump's company logged as legal expenses. Trump, by then in the White House, signed most of the checks himself. Prosecutors said the designation was meant to cloak the true purpose of the payments and help cover up a broader effort to keep voters from hearing unflattering claims about the Republican during his first campaign. Trump said that Cohen was legitimately paid for legal services, and that Daniels' story was suppressed to avoid embarrassing Trump's family, not to influence the electorate. Trump was a private citizen — campaigning for president, but neither elected nor sworn in — when Cohen paid Daniels in October 2016. He was president when Cohen was reimbursed, and Cohen testified that they discussed the repayment arrangement in the Oval Office. Trump has been fighting for months to overturn the verdict and could now seek to leverage his status as president-elect. Although he was tried as a private citizen, his forthcoming return to the White House could propel a court to step in and avoid the unprecedented spectacle of sentencing a former and future president. While urging Merchan to nix the conviction, Trump also has been trying to move the case to federal court. Before the election, a federal judge repeatedly said no to the move, but Trump has appealed.	https://www.voanews.com/a/judge-delays-ruling-on-whether-to-scrap-trump-s-conviction-in-hush-money-case/7861087.html	2024-11-12T07:47:54-08:00	
Chad says Boko Haram fighters fleeing to neighboring states	Yaoundé, Cameroon — The government of Chad said Tuesday that hundreds of Boko Haram fighters are fleeing the central African state’s territory and crossing over into Cameroon, Niger and Nigeria. State TV reports the fighters fled after clashes with Chadian forces over the weekend that killed more than 100 Boko Haram fighters as well as close to 20 Chadian soldiers. Chad state TV reports that assaults have continued against Boko Haram strongholds after the central African state’s military saw almost 20 soldiers killed and 32 others injured in a Saturday battle with Boko Haram terrorists in the Lake Chad basin. A government statement said about 100 Boko Haram fighters were killed and a dozen others injured during the clashes, and that Boko Haram fighters are now fleeing to Cameroon, Nigeria and Niger. Earlier this month, Chad's military launched an operation aimed at dislodging Boko Haram terrorists from areas around Lake Chad, according to the central African state’s president, General Mahamat Idriss Deby. Deby said the operation – named Haskanite -- is to avenge the killing of 40 government troops in October and to improve security for civilians in the area. The offensive hit a complication last week, when Deby said the fighting forces of Cameroon, Nigeria and Niger, who all contribute troops to a regional anti-terrorism joint task force, had decided to not collaborate with the Chadian offensive. Cameroon, Nigeria and Niger have made no public statements confirming or denying Deby’s claim, and VOA could not independently verify if the three countries have chosen not to participate in the Chadian operation. Cameroon’s military said it is security the country’s borders and protecting its civilians. Deby has said he planned to withdraw his troops from the multi-national force, which has about 11,000 troops, because of the absence of what he calls coordinated efforts among member states to fight Boko Haram terrorism. Remadji Hoinathy is a lecturer at the University of N'Djamena in Chad and a researcher on strategic development in central Africa and the Lake Chad Basin Commission. He said it is imperative for neighboring states to strategize and join Chad in fighting Boko Haram because the terrorist group has a high capacity to infiltrate communities in Cameroon, Nigeria and Niger when attacked by forces from Chad. Remadji says fighters that survive onslaughts from Chad government forces will escape to safety areas in Cameroon, Niger and Nigeria and return to Chad to commit more atrocities when Operation Haskanite ends. Chad has not said when it might withdraw its troops from the U.N.-assisted joint fighting force. Chad civil society groups and political parties say they are surprised that officials of the joint task force have neither reacted to Chad's threat to withdraw nor announced plans to cooperate with the offensive against Boko Haram. Hisseine Abdoulaye is spokesperson of The Patriots, one of Chad’s political parties. He spoke to VOA via a messaging app from Chad's capital N'djamena. Abdoulaye said although it is the right of any state or party to pull out of an organization if its interests are not protected and respected, he disagrees with Chad's announced plan to withdraw its troops from the Multinational Joint Task Force of the Lake Chad Basin Commission. He saif Chad's military alone cannot stop militants from attacking government troops and communities. Boko Haram launched an armed rebellion against the Nigerian government in 2009 to establish an Islamic state. Fighting has since spread to neighboring countries and has killed more than 40,000 people, displacing over 3 million according to the United Nations.	https://www.voanews.com/a/chad-says-boko-haram-fighters-fleeing-to-neighboring-states/7861044.html	2024-11-12T07:36:18-08:00	
Church of England head Justin Welby resigns over handling of sex abuse scandal	London — Archbishop of Canterbury Justin Welby, head of the Church of England and spiritual leader of the global Anglican Communion, resigned Tuesday after an investigation found that he failed to tell police about serial physical and sexual abuse by a volunteer at Christian summer camps as soon as he became aware of it. Pressure on Welby had been building since Thursday, when release of the inquiry's findings kindled anger about a lack of accountability at the highest reaches of the church. Helen-Ann Hartley, the bishop of Newcastle, said Monday that his position was 'untenable' after some members of the church's national assembly started a petition calling on Welby to step down because he had 'lost the confidence of his clergy.' 'I believe that stepping aside is in the best interests of the Church of England, which I dearly love and which I have been honored to serve,' Welby said in a statement. The strongest outcry came from the victims of John Smyth, a prominent attorney who abused teenage boys and young men at Christian summer camps in Britain, Zimbabwe and South Africa over five decades. Andrew Morse, who was repeatedly beaten by Smyth over a period of five years, said that resigning was a chance for Welby to start repairing the damage caused by the church's handling of historical abuse cases more broadly. 'I believe that now is an opportunity for him to resign,'' Morse told the BBC before Welby stepped down. 'I say opportunity in the sense that this would be an opportunity for him to stand with the victims of the Smyth abuse and all victims that have not been treated properly by the Church of England in their own abuse cases.' Welby's resignation comes against the backdrop of widespread historical sexual abuse in the Church of England. A 2022 report by the Independent Inquiry Child Sexual Abuse found that deference to the authority of priests, taboos surrounding the discussion of sexuality and a culture that gave more support to alleged perpetrators than their victims helped make the Church of England Church of England 'a place where abusers could hide.'	https://www.voanews.com/a/church-of-england-head-justin-welby-resigns-over-handling-of-sex-abuse-scandal/7861013.html	2024-11-12T07:36:02-08:00

Sri Lanka set to vote for new parliament as president seeks majority for reforms	New Delhi — Sri Lanka will choose a new parliament Thursday in an election that is seen as crucial for the country’s new left-leaning president, Anura Kumara Dissanayake, who swept to power in September on an anti-corruption platform amid a wave of dissatisfaction with established political parties. Dissanayake’s National People's Power (NPP) coalition currently has only three seats in the 225-member parliament, constraining his ability to usher in the systemic changes he says are necessary to tackle corruption and improve economic conditions for the working class. Aiming to boost the NPP’s representation, Dissanayake dissolved parliament soon after he was voted into power and called for snap polls a year ahead of schedule. Analysts say the strong support that Dissanayake secured in the presidential election seven weeks ago will likely stay with his party in Thursday’s election. 'He got 42 percent of the vote, which is a dramatic leap for a representative of a fringe party which had only secured three to four per cent vote share in any election in the past,' Kusal Perera, political analyst in Colombo told VOA. 'That vote will come back in the parliamentary elections, though it may be slightly lesser this time.' Current cabinet: 3 The 55-year-old president, popularly known as AKD, is seeking a two-thirds parliamentary majority so he can push through his promised reforms. Currently, the Sri Lankan leader has the smallest cabinet in the country’s history — Prime Minister Harini Amarasuriya, and two ministers. In Sri Lanka, only lawmakers can be appointed as ministers. His hopes of gaining a much bigger share of parliamentary seats for his coalition rest on voters rejecting parties that governed the country for decades but are blamed by many people for misgovernance and corruption. The country is still grappling with a severe economic downturn two years ago. Although former president Ranil Wickremesinghe is credited with stabilizing the economy after securing a $2.9 billion loan from the International Monetary Fund, the austerity measures he introduced – mainly an end to public subsidies – led to sharp price hikes in food and fuel that have caused hardship for millions of Sri Lankans. Dissanayake has said he will renegotiate the terms of the IMF bailout package to ease the austerity measures that were imposed to secure the loan. Ahead of Thursday’s elections, the new president has sounded an optimistic note. 'In past elections, people did not have confidence in us but in September people gave us victory and proved that we are a winning party and we can form a government,' he said during a campaign rally on Sunday. 'The next task is to unite people from the four corners of this country and build a powerful people's movement.' The NPP’s main challengers are the Samagi Jana Balawegaya, led by opposition leader Sajith Premadasa, and the New Democratic Front (NDF), which is backed by former president Ranil Wickremesinghe. But the opposition has run a lackluster campaign. 'There has been no focus on what they want or the program that they want to push,' said Perera. The country’s powerful Rajapaksa political dynasty, which played a key role in Sri Lanka over the last two decades, has not fielded a candidate in the parliamentary polls. Gotabaya Rajapaksa, who was the president when the economy collapsed, was ousted by a massive popular protest movement in the country that demanded, among other things, that people guilty of corruption be punished. Just like the presidential polls, the parliamentary election is seen as a referendum on people’s desire for change in the political landscape. However, there is less enthusiasm this time around, according to some residents. 'Nobody is very excited about the election partly because most people think that it is a given that Dissanayake’s NPP is going to win,' says Chameera Dedduwage, a professional based in Colombo who took part in the protest movement against Rajapaksa. 'They feel that they deserve to be given a chance to prove themselves and bring about the system change they have promised.'	https://www.voanews.com/a/sri-lanka-set-to-vote-for-new-parliament-as-president-seeks-majority-for-reforms/7860897.html	2024-11-12T05:41:06-08:00	
Blinken heads to Brussels to push for Ukraine aid	State Department — U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken is heading to Brussels, Belgium, on Tuesday as Washington looks for ways to 'surge' military aid to Ukraine in the final days of President Joe Biden’s term. After Brussels, Blinken will proceed to Lima, Peru, for Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation meetings, followed by stops in Manaus and Rio de Janeiro, Brazil, for a summit of the 20 largest economies, the G20. He will join Biden in Peru and Brazil. President Biden and Chinese President Xi Jinping are expected to hold face-to-face talks on Saturday on the sidelines of the APEC summit, a meeting anticipated to last about one-and-a-half hours, according to sources familiar with the plans who spoke to VOA on the condition of anonymity. On Wednesday, Blinken will engage in discussions with his NATO and European Union counterparts to coordinate continued support for Ukraine, while President Biden meets with President-elect Donald Trump at the White House. Officials said Biden will ask Trump not to 'walk away' from Ukraine. North Korea’s direct support for Russia’s war in Ukraine is expected to be a focal point during Blinken’s discussions with European counterparts and will likely feature on the agenda in talks between U.S. officials and their counterparts at APEC. Ukraine has reported that North Korean troops are actively engaged in combat operations in Russia’s Kursk region, prompting condemnation from several European nations over the increasing military collaboration between Russia and North Korea. Meanwhile, Ukraine remained on high alert for air attacks on Monday, with the country’s top military commander reporting that tens of thousands of Russian troops were prepared to advance on Russia’s Kursk region, where Ukraine seized territory in August this year. Charles Kupchan, a senior fellow at the Council on Foreign Relations, told VOA that Trump might attempt to 'broker a cease-fire in Ukraine,' a prominent foreign policy pledge he made during his campaign. Kupchan, however, noted, 'It will not be as easy as he promised... It will take a long time to bring [Ukrainian President Volodymyr] Zelenskyy and [Russian President Vladimir] Putin to common ground,' as the conflict has stretched on for more than two-and-a-half years. Trump’s political allies have indicated that the incoming administration will prioritize achieving peace in Ukraine over enabling the country to reclaim Crimea and other territories occupied by Russia. After the U.S. presidential election, the State Department said that Blinken spoke with his European counterparts. They included the French minister for Europe and foreign affairs, Jean-Noël Barrot, German Foreign Minister Annalena Baerbock, and the United Kingdom’s foreign secretary, David Lammy, among others. Officials say talks covered the situation in Ukraine and the implications and threats posed by Russia’s decision to introduce North Korean troops into the war on Ukraine. Blinken’s coming meetings in Brussels also follow a gathering of European leaders Thursday in Budapest, where they addressed transatlantic relations, support for Ukraine, and other pressing issues in light of Trump’s victory in last week’s U.S. presidential election.	https://www.voanews.com/a/blinken-heads-to-brussels-to-push-for-ukraine-aid-/7860178.html	2024-11-12T05:03:08-08:00	
Trump sets sights on Gaza, Ukraine as early foreign policy goals	Beyond promising a return to the America First doctrine, President-elect Donald Trump has not provided details on what U.S. foreign policy will look like under his incoming administration. But his early conversations with leaders following his election victory indicate he aims to fulfill his promises to quickly end the conflicts in the Middle East and Ukraine.

35 dead as driver hits crowd at sports center in southern Chinese city	BANGKOK — A driver killed 35 people and injured another 43 when he deliberately rammed his car into people exercising at a sports center in the southern Chinese city of Zhuhai, police said Tuesday. Police had detained a 62-year-old man at the sports center in the southern Chinese city of Zhuhai following the ramming late Monday, on the eve of the country’s premier aviation exhibition by the People’s Liberation Army that's hosted annually in the city. One of the four hospitals that took in people for treatment said it had more than 20 injured, state media reported Monday. No motive was mentioned, and police said investigations continued. Police identified the man only by his family name of Fan, consistent with the practice by Chinese authorities. The police statement said the vehicle knocked down 'a number of' of pedestrians Monday evening. Videos showed a firefighter performing CPR on a person, as people were told to leave the scene. They were shared by news blogger and dissident Li Ying, who is better known on X as Teacher Li. His account posts daily news based on user submissions. Dozens of people were lying prone on the running track in the sports center in the videos. In one, a woman says 'my foot is broken.' By Tuesday morning, searches for the incident on Chinese social media were heavily censored on Chinese social media platforms. A search on Weibo for the sports center only turned up a few posts, with only a couple referring to the fact something had happened, without pictures or details. Articles by Chinese media about the incident from Monday night were taken down. Chinese internet censors take extra care to scrub social media ahead of and during major events, such as the meeting of the National People’s Congress, where the government announces its major policy initiatives for the coming year. The sports center for the city district of Xiangzhou regularly attracts hundreds of residents, where they can run on the track field, play soccer and social dance. Following the incident, the center announced it would be closed until further notice. China has seen a number of attacks in which suspects appear to target random people such as schoolchildren. In October, a 50-year-old man was detained after he allegedly used a knife to attack children at a school in Beijing. Five people were injured. In September, three people were killed in a knife attack in a Shanghai supermarket.	https://www.voanews.com/a/dead-as-driver-hits-crowd-at-sports-center-in-southern-chinese-city-/7860804.html	2024-11-12T04:15:30-08:00	
Spain's Valencia struggles to get children back to school after deadly floods	CATARROJA, Spain — Thousands of students in Spain's eastern Valencia region returned to classes on Monday, two weeks after floods killed over 200 people and devastated towns in the area. Controversy over the regional government's handling of the floods still rages, and a teachers' union accused it of exaggerating the number returning and leaving the clean-up to teachers and pupils. Twenty-three people remain missing in the Valencia region after heavy rains caused rivers to overflow, sending tides of muddy water through densely populated city suburbs, drowning people in cars and underground car parks, and collapsing homes. A total of 47 schools in 14 affected municipalities reopened to more than 22,000 children on Monday, the region's education department said. Last week, it said it expected around 70% of students in the worst-affected areas to return this week. 'The schools that have opened their doors today have followed cleaning and disinfection protocols to ensure maximum safety for students, teachers and staff,' it added. But the regional teachers' union STEPV said it believed that the numbers returning on Monday were lower, without providing an alternative figure. Spokesperson Marc Candela said many schools were not ready to resume lessons, adding: 'Teachers and parents are cleaning the schools with their own materials such as brooms.' Educators wanted professional cleaning crews to sanitize facilities, as was done during the COVID-19 pandemic, he said. Parents are also worried about their children's emotional states, said Ruben Pacheco, head of the regional federation of parents' associations, FAMPA: 'Families are exhausted, suffering psychologically, and nothing should be decided without consulting them so as not to generate more discomfort than they've already suffered.' Candela said the department had held an online course for teachers last week with recommendations for psychological care, but had not dispatched additional counselors. Carolina Marti, head teacher at a school in Castellar-Oliveral, said it had received 60 children from neighboring towns, while five teachers were on medical leave. She said children and teachers were struggling to reach the school as many roads remained impassable.	https://www.voanews.com/a/spain-s-valencia-struggles-to-get-children-back-to-school-after-deadly-floods-/7860784.html	2024-11-12T04:02:04-08:00	
Ishiba survived rare runoff to remain Japan's prime minister but will face turmoil	TOKYO — Japanese Prime Minister Shigeru Ishiba, battered in parliamentary elections last month, has survived a rare runoff vote against the opposition to remain the country's leader but he still faces turmoil ahead. One of his top priorities is dealing with the aftermath of a major corruption scandal in the long-ruling Liberal Democratic Party, in which dozens of lawmakers from the party are alleged to have pocketed profits from event ticket sales as kickbacks. Ishiba also now has a much-emboldened, opposition eager to push through policies long stymied by the LDP. Support ratings for his Cabinet have fallen to about 30%. Here is a look at what's happening in Japan's tumultuous politics, and what it might mean for Ishiba and his government as they prepare to navigate a second term of U.S. President-elect Donald Trump. Why did the vote in parliament take place? A parliamentary vote for a new leader is mandatory within 30 days of a general election. In the past that was mostly ignored as the head of the LDP usually enjoyed a majority in the Lower House, the more powerful of Japan’s two-chamber parliament. This time, though, because Ishiba's LDP and its junior coalition partner lost its majority in the recent election, the runoff on Monday couldn't be avoided — the first in 30 years. What's next for the prime minister? Opposition's top leader, Yoshihiko Noda, has noted that nearly half of all lower house steering committees are now headed by the opposition. That’s a huge change from the pre-election domination of the LDP, which controlled all but three of the 27 committees. 'We are going to have a new landscape in Japanese politics,' Noda said. Twelve of the committees in key areas, including budget, political reforms, national security and legal affairs, will be headed by Noda’s Constitutional Democratic Party of Japan and two other main opposition groups. What's certain is that the era of LDP’s one-sided rule is over, for now, and the opposition has a chance to achieve policies long opposed by the ruling conservatives, including on issues like gender equality and diversity. Noda last Friday said a legal committee that is now headed by his party’s gender equality chief, Chinami Nishimura, is aiming to achieve a civil code revision to allow married couples the option of keeping separate surnames. That change has been stalled by LDP conservatives for 30 years despite widespread support by the public and a United Nations panel on discrimination against women. Who is the opposition kingmaker? Yuichiro Tamaki is head of the conservative Democratic Party for the People, which quadrupled its seats to 28 in the election. The vote elevated his party from a fringe group to a major player. He is now being cast as a potential key to Ishiba’s survival. A Harvard-educated former Finance Ministry bureaucrat, the 55-year-old Tamaki has seen success by pushing for the raising of a basic tax-free income allowance and an increase of take-home wages. His messages on social media have appealed to younger voters, who have long been ignored by LDP policies catering to conservative elderly. Ishiba apparently seems to find Tamaki’s 28-member DPP an attractive partner to secure a majority. The two parties, which have common ground in some areas — including support for greater nuclear energy use and a stronger military — have started policy talks. Ishiba met with both Tamaki and Noda on Monday but Tamaki may be cautious about moving too close to a scandal-plagued LDP ahead of another election next year. Noda is struggling to form a unified opposition to force a change of government, which he says is his next goal. What does this mean for Ishiba's government? For Ishiba, the 'hung parliament' requires him to win over opposition forces so he can push his policies. While considered unstable, it might also provide a chance for a more consensus-based policy making process, experts say. 'I’m taking the current situation positively as a chance to get our opposition voice heard more carefully,' Tamaki said. Ishiba also faces challenges of restoring unity in his own party. A number of senior LDP lawmakers are waiting to overthrow Ishiba, though their priority is to resolidify their footholds, not infighting — and nobody is eager to do damage control at this difficult time anyway. 'The [Ishiba] administration is quite unstable. ... He will have to get opposition parties' cooperation every time he wants to get a bill approved, which could stall policies,' said University of Tokyo political science professor Yu Uchiyama. And even if Ishiba survives politically in the coming months, there could be a call for his replacement ahead of next elections. 'Japan is likely to return to a period of short-lived government,' Uchiyama said. How does this affect Japan's diplomacy, security and ties with Trump? Ishiba congratulated Trump hours after his victory and in a brief telephone conversation, they agreed to closely work together to further elevate their alliance. While experts say Trump understands the importance of U.S.-Japan relations, he may — as he did in his first administration — pressure Japan to pay more for the cost of 50,000 U.S. troops in Japan or to buy more expensive American weapons. Trump's possible tariff proposals could also hurt Japanese exporters. Ishiba on Saturday renewed his pledge to pursue an ongoing military buildup plan under a strategy that calls for a counter-strike capability with long-range cruise-missiles. He has long advocated a more equal Japan-U.S. security alliance but could face difficulty pursuing those plans. ‘’It will be a fantastic experiment to see if a national unity government can get Japan through until the next election,' said Michael Cucek, an expert in Japanese politics at Temple University in Japan.	https://www.voanews.com/a/ishiba-survived-rare-runoff-to-remain-japan-s-prime-minister-but-will-face-turmoil-/7860768.html	2024-11-12T03:40:02-08:00	
At least 14 killed in Gaza, airstrikes in Beirut	Israeli strikes killed at least 14 people in Gaza, Palestinian authorities said, and plumes of smoke were rising above the southern Beirut’s suburbs less than an hour after Israeli forces told residents to evacuate. While fighting continues, international aid groups issued a report saying Israel has not met a Tuesday deadline set by the U.S. to allow more aid into the Gaza Strip. But the Israeli military said hundreds of packages of food and water have been brought to an area in northern Gaza where it has been focusing operations. Last month, the Biden administration told Israel to 'surge' more food and supplies into Gaza or risk a cut in military aid. On Tuesday, a group of eight international aid organizations said that of 19 measures of compliance with the U.S. demands, Israel failed to comply with 15 and only partially complied with four. 'Israel not only failed to meet the U.S. criteria that would indicate support to the humanitarian response, but concurrently took actions that dramatically worsened the situation on the ground, particularly in Northern Gaza,' the report said. 'That situation is in an even more dire state today than a month ago.' The U.N. Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs said 85% of its attempts to coordinate aid convoys and humanitarian visits to northern Gaza were denied or impeded last month. The office made 98 requests to Israeli authorities for authorization to go through the checkpoint along Wadi Gaza but only 15 made it, U.N. spokesman Stephane Dujarric said Monday. On Monday night, the Israeli security Cabinet approved more aid for Gaza, which will increase the number of trucks that enter each day, an official familiar with the matter told The Associated Press. Air strikes in Gaza, Beirut A late Monday strike killed at least 11 people in a cafeteria west of Khan Younis, according to officials at Nasser Hospital. A strike early Tuesday hit a house at a refugee camp in central Gaza, killing three people, according to al-Awda Hospital, which received the casualties. Early Tuesday, the Israeli army told residents in Beirut's southern suburbs to leave immediately, warning that it would strike Hezbollah targets there. 'You are located near facilities and interests affiliated with Hezbollah, against which the Israel Defense Forces will act in the near future,' military spokesman Avichay Adraee said in a post on X that included a map showing the buildings it would target in the Lebanese capital. Less than an hour later, according to Agence France-Presse, two strikes hit the area and plumes of gray smoke were rising. Witnesses told AFP gunfire could be heard in the area ahead of the strikes — warning shots by residents for people to leave following the evacuation call. Israel's Defense Minister, Israel Katz, said on X on Tuesday that during a meeting with military officials, he reiterated that Israel will continue hitting Hezbollah with full force and that there will be no cease-fire. Summit in Riyadh On Monday, Arab and Muslim leaders met in the Saudi capital of Riyadh and demanded that Israel withdraw from occupied Palestinian territories as a precondition for regional peace. The summit also denounced what it described as 'shocking' Israeli crimes in Gaza. The summit's closing statement said 'a just and comprehensive peace in the region... cannot be achieved without ending the Israeli occupation of all occupied Arab territories to the line of June 4, 1967,' referring to the occupied West Bank and east Jerusalem as well as Gaza and the Golan Heights. The international community should 'launch a plan with specific steps and timing under international sponsorship' to make a sovereign Palestinian state a reality, the statement said. However, the Israeli government of Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu remains opposed to Palestinian statehood and Israel's new foreign minister, Gideon Saar, dismissed the prospect as not 'realistic.' The war in Gaza was triggered when Hamas-led militants stormed into southern Israel on Oct. 7, 2023, killing about 1,200 people, mostly civilians, and abducting about 250. Some 100 hostages are still inside Gaza, although about one-third of them are believed to be dead. Israel's counteroffensive has killed more than 43,000 Palestinians, more than half of them women and children, according to local health authorities. The Israeli military says the death toll includes thousands of Hamas militants. Both Hamas and Hezbollah have been designated as terrorist organizations by the United States. Information from The Associated Press, Reuters and Agence France-Presse was used in this report.	https://www.voanews.com/a/at-least-14-killed-in-gaza-airstrikes-in-beirut-/7860755.html	2024-11-12T03:21:51-08:00	
Russian airstrike kills 4, injures 14	A Russian airstrike on Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy’s hometown killed a mother and her three children and left 14 people wounded, officials said Tuesday. Interior Minister Igor Klymenko said rescue and recovery operations were complete after the residential building in Kryvyi Rig was hit a day earlier. The office of the prosecutor general said a 32-year-old woman and children who were 10, 2 and 2 months old were killed. In Russia’s Belgorod region, a Ukrainian drone attack started a fire at an oil depot, regional governor Vyacheslav Gladkov posted on the Telegram messaging app. He said a tank caught fire and 10 fire crews responded in the Starkooskolsky District near the Ukrainian border. The Russian defense ministry also said 13 Ukrainian drones were destroyed overnight, all in regions bordering Ukraine. Ukraine’s air force said it shot down 46 Russian drones overnight. In addition, Ukrainian’s military was 'holding back a fairly large grouping of Russian troops – 50,000 of the occupier’s army personnel,' in the Kursk region, Zelenskyy said in his address to the nation Monday. 'Our forces' strikes on Russian arsenals have reduced the amount of artillery used by the occupier, and this is noticeable at the front. That is why we need decisions from our partners – America, Britain, Germany – on long-range capabilities,' Zelenskyy said. 'This is vital. The further our missiles and drones can hit, the less real combat capability Russia will have.' North Korea defense pact The forces in Kursk include 11,000 North Korean troops deployed by Russia to Kursk, Zelenskyy has said, although Moscow will neither confirm nor deny their involvement. State media in North Korea reported that country ratified a defense agreement with Russia on Tuesday, formalizing months of deepening security ties. The deal 'was ratified as a decree' of leader Kim Jong Un, the Korean Central News Agency (KCNA) said Tuesday. The notice comes after Russian lawmakers voted unanimously last week to ratify the deal, which President Vladimir Putin later signed. 'The treaty will take effect from the day when both sides exchanged the ratification instruments,' KCNA said. Putin and Kim signed the strategic pact in June, during Putin’s visit to North Korea. Material from The Associated Press, Reuters and Agence France-Presse was used in this report.	https://www.voanews.com/a/russian-airstrike-kills-4-injures-14/7860744.html	2024-11-12T03:08:15-08:00	
Biggest name world leaders missing at UN climate talks, others fill the void	BAKU, Azerbaijan — World leaders are converging Tuesday at the United Nations annual climate conference in Baku, Azerbaijan although the big names and powerful countries are noticeably absent, unlike past climate talks which had the star power of a soccer World Cup. But 2024's climate talks are more like the International Chess Federation world championship, lacking recognizable names but big on nerd power and strategy. The top leaders of the 13 largest carbon dioxide-polluting countries will not appear. Their nations are responsible for more than 70% of 2023's heat-trapping gases. The world's biggest polluters and strongest economies — China and the United States — aren't sending their No. 1s. India and Indonesia's heads of state are also not in attendance, meaning the four most populous nations with more than 42% of all the world's population aren't having leaders speak. 'It’s symptomatic of the lack of political will to act. There’s no sense of urgency,' said climate scientist Bill Hare, CEO of Climate Analytics. He said this explains 'the absolute mess we’re finding ourselves in.' Transition to clean energy The world has witnessed the hottest day, months and year on record 'and a master class in climate destruction,' United Nations Secretary-General Antonio Guterres told the world leaders who did show up. But Guterres held out hope, saying, in a veiled reference to Donald Trump's re-election in the United States, that the 'clean energy revolution is here. No group, no business, no government can stop it.' United Nations officials said in 2016, when Trump was first elected, there were 180 gigawatts of clean energy and 700,000 electric vehicles in the world. Now there are 600 gigawatts of clean energy and 14 million electric vehicles. Host Azerbaijan President Ilham Aliyev kicked off two scheduled days of world leaders' speeches by lambasting Armenia, western news media, climate activists and critics who highlighted his country's rich oil and gas history and trade, calling them hypocritical since the United States is the world's biggest oil producer. He said it was 'not fair' to call Azerbaijan a 'petrostate' because it produces less than 1% of the world's oil and gas. Oil and gas are 'a gift of the God' just like the sun, wind and minerals, Aliyev said. 'Countries should not be blamed for having them. And should not be blamed for bringing these resources to the market because the market needs them.' As the host and president of the climate talks, called COP29, Aliyev said his country will push hard for a green transition away from fossil fuels, 'but at the same time, we must be realistic.' Lack of star power Aliyev, United Kingdom’s Prime Minister Keir Starmer and Turkey’s President Recep Tayyip Erdogan are the headliners of around 50 leaders set to speak on Tuesday. There'll also be a strong showing from the leaders of some of the world’s most climate-vulnerable countries. Several small island nations presidents and over a dozen leaders from countries across Africa are set to speak over the two-day World Leaders’ Summit at COP29. As a sense of how the bar for celebrity has lowered, on Tuesday morning photographers and video cameras ran alongside one leader walking through the halls of the meeting. It was the emergency management minister for host country Azerbaijan. United Nations officials downplayed the lack of head of state star power, saying that every country is represented and active in the climate talks. One logistical issue is that next week, the leaders of the most powerful countries have to be half a world away in Brazil for the G20 meetings. The United States recent election, Germany's government collapse, natural disasters and personal illnesses also have kept some leaders away. The major focus of the negotiations is climate finance, which is rich nations trying to help poor countries pay for transitioning their economies away from fossil fuels, coping with climate change's upcoming harms and compensating for damages from weather extremes. Nations are negotiating over huge amounts of money, anywhere from $100 billion a year to $1.3 trillion a year. That money 'is not charity, it's an investment,' Guterres said. 'Developing countries must not leave Baku empty-handed,' Guterres said. 'A deal is a must.'	https://www.voanews.com/a/biggest-name-world-leaders-missing-at-un-climate-talks-others-fill-the-void/7860741.html	2024-11-12T02:43:32-08:00	
Russia and China must counter any U.S. attempt at containment, Shoigu says	MOSCOW — The key task for Russia and China is to counter any attempt by the United States to contain their countries, an ally of Russian President Vladimir Putin told China's foreign minister on Tuesday. U.S. President-elect Donald Trump has threatened to impose steep tariffs on China and other countries, raising fears of a trade war and the United States casts China as its biggest competitor and Russia as its biggest nation-state threat. China's Xi Jinping and Putin in May pledged a 'new era' of partnership between the two most powerful rivals of the United States, which they cast as an aggressive Cold War hegemon sowing chaos across the world. Russian Security Council Secretary Sergei Shoigu told Chinese Foreign Minister Wang Yi in Beijing that the strong relations between Moscow and Beijing were a stabilizing influence on the world. 'I see the most important task as countering the policy of 'dual containment' of Russia and China pursued by the United States and its satellites,' Shoigu was quoted as saying by Russian state news agencies. Xi and Putin believe the post-Cold War era of extraordinary U.S. dominance is crumbling after the perceived humiliations of the 1991 Soviet collapse and centuries of European colonial dominance of China.	https://www.voanews.com/a/russia-and-china-must-counter-any-u-s-attempt-at-containment-shoigu-says/7860692.html	2024-11-11T23:50:31-08:00	
China's largest air show takes off with fighter jets, attack drones	Zhuhai, China — Stealth fighter jets and attack drones took center stage as China's largest air show officially opened on Tuesday, an opportunity for Beijing to showcase its growing military might to potential customers and rivals alike. China has poured resources into modernizing and expanding its aviation capabilities as it faces off against the United States and others around regional flashpoints like Taiwan. Record numbers of Chinese warplanes have been sent around the self-ruled democratic island, which Beijing claims as its territory, over the past few years. The star of Airshow China, which showcases Beijing's civil and military aerospace sector every two years in the southern city of Zhuhai, is the new J-35A stealth fighter jet. Its inclusion in the airshow suggests it is nearly ready to enter operation, which would make China the only country other than the United States to have two stealth fighters in action, experts said. The J-35A is lighter than China's existing model, the J20, and looks more similar in design to a US F-35. A group of J20s performed a display flight on Tuesday morning, flying in a diamond formation across a grey sky. State news agency Xinhua quoted military expert Wang Mingzhi as saying the combination of the two models greatly enhances the People's Liberation Army Air Force (PLAAF)'s 'ability to conduct offensive operations in high-threat and contested environments.' Attack drones The airshow will feature a dedicated drone zone for the first time, reflecting their increased prominence in warzones, including Ukraine. The SS-UAV -- a massive mothership that can rapidly release swarms of smaller drones for intelligence gathering, as well as strikes -- will be on display in Zhuhai, according to the South China Morning Post. In October the United States unveiled sanctions targeting China-based companies linked to the production of drones that Russia has deployed in Ukraine. Moscow and Beijing have deepened military and defense ties since Russia's invasion of its neighbor three years ago, and the secretary of its Security Council, Sergei Shoigu, is due to visit Zhuhai. This year the show's focus is squarely on the military sector, as it coincides with the 75th anniversary of the PLAAF, but China's burgeoning space industry will also be showcasing developments. A model of a homegrown reusable space cargo shuttle will debut at the show, Xinhua reported on Monday. Named Haoloong, the shuttle is designed to be launched on a commercial rocket, and then dock with China's space station Tiangong. 'It can re-enter the atmosphere, fly and land horizontally at a designated airport, allowing for recovery and reuse,' Xinhua said. Beijing has poured huge resources into its space program over the past decade in an effort to catch up to traditional space powers the United States and Russia.	https://www.voanews.com/a/china-s-largest-air-show-takes-off-with-fighter-jets-attack-drones-/7860664.html	2024-11-11T22:23:40-08:00	
NYC Mayor Eric Adams requests earlier trial date so he can focus on reelection campaign	NEW YORK — New York City Mayor Eric Adams is seeking to move up the start of his trial on corruption and bribery charges so he can focus on his campaign for reelection this spring. In a letter sent to the federal judge on Monday, an attorney for Adams, Alex Spiro, requested the trial begin on April 1 rather than the current planned date of April 23. 'An earlier trial date will ensure that Mayor Adams's speedy trial rights are upheld, that the Mayor will be able to fully participate in his reelection campaign and that this City's voters can be rid of the distraction of this misguided indictment as they hear from and evaluate the Democratic candidates for Mayor on their merits,' Spiro wrote. Adams, a Democrat, was indicted in September on charges that he accepted luxury travel perks and illegal campaign contributions from a Turkish official seeking political favors. He has pleaded not guilty to the charges and insisted he will remain in office as he fights the case. He is expected to face a contested Democratic primary in June, with several opponents already announcing their interest in challenging him. Inquiries to the U.S. Attorney's Office in Manhattan were not returned. At a hearing earlier this month, prosecutors said they would be ready for a trial whenever it is scheduled, but noted they were still making their way through reams of seized records and had not yet accessed Adams' personal cellphone. According to his indictment. Adams changed his password just before giving the phone to authorities, then claimed he forgot it. In his letter on Monday, Spiro said he would waive access to certain discovery materials if it meant speeding up the date of the trial. Under the current schedule, he predicted a verdict would come in late May, giving the mayor only a short window of time to clear his name among voters. 'Given the realities of the news and election cycle, this earlier trial date is not only feasible, but essential here,' Spiro wrote.	https://www.voanews.com/a/nyc-mayor-eric-adams-requests-earlier-trial-date-so-he-can-focus-on-reelection-campaign/7860639.html	2024-11-11T20:33:42-08:00	
Breakaway Somaliland to hold general elections	The breakaway region of Somaliland in East Africa is due to hold general elections on November 13th. As the self-declared republic pushes for recognition from the international community and begins to play a larger role in the wider region, what could the outcome mean for Somalia, the Horn of Africa and beyond?

Church of England head under pressure to resign amid abuse scandal	LONDON — The head of the Church of England, spiritual leader of the global Anglican Communion, is under pressure to resign after an investigation found that he failed to inform police about serial physical and sexual abuse by a volunteer at Christian summer camps as soon as he became aware of it. Some members of the General Synod, the church's national assembly, have started a petition calling on Archbishop of Canterbury Justin Welby to step down, saying he had 'lost the confidence of his clergy.' The petition had garnered more than 1,800 signatures on Change.org by late morning London time on Monday. Compounding the pressure, a senior cleric added her voice to those who believe he should resign. Helen-Ann Hartley, the bishop of Newcastle, told the BBC that Welby's position is 'untenable.'' Calls for Welby's resignation have grown since Thursday, when the church released the results of an independent review into John Smyth, who sexually, psychologically and physically abused about 30 boys and young men in the United Kingdom and 85 in Africa over five decades. The 251-page report concluded that Welby failed to report Smyth to authorities when he was informed of the abuse in August 2013, soon after he became Archbishop of Canterbury. Welby last week took responsibility for not ensuring that the allegations were pursued as 'energetically' as they should have been after he learned of the abuse but said he had decided not to resign. On Monday, his office issued a statement reiterating Welby's 'horror at the scale of John Smyth's egregious abuse.' 'As he has said, he had no awareness or suspicion of the allegations before he was told in 2013 — and therefore, having reflected, he does not intend to resign,' the statement said. 'He hopes the Makin Review supports the ongoing work of building a safer church here and around the world.' Church officials were first made aware of the abuse in 1982, when they received the results of an internal investigation into Smyth. The recipients of that report 'participated in an active cover-up' to prevent its findings from coming to light, the Makin Review found. Between 1984 and 2001, Smyth moved to Zimbabwe and subsequently relocated to South Africa. He continued to abuse boys and young men in Zimbabwe and there is evidence that the abuse continued in South Africa until he died in August 2018. Smyth's abuse wasn't made public until a 2017 investigation by Britain's Channel 4 television, which led Hampshire Police to start an investigation. Police were planning to question Smyth at the time of his death and had been preparing to extradite him. The Makin Review found that if Smyth had been reported to police in 2013, it could have helped to uncover the truth, prevented further abuse and led to a possible criminal conviction. 'In effect, three and a half years was lost, a time within which John Smyth could have been brought to justice and any abuse he was committing in South Africa discovered and stopped,' the review found. The Archbishop of Canterbury is the head of the Church of England and is seen as the spiritual leader of the Anglican Communion, which has more than 85 million members in 165 countries. He is considered first among equals with respect to the communion's other primates.	https://www.voanews.com/a/church-of-england-head-under-pressure-to-resign-amid-abuse-scandal/7860634.html	2024-11-11T19:40:26-08:00	
ICC confirms probe into alleged misconduct by war crimes prosecutor	AMSTERDAM — The International Criminal Court's governing body will launch an external probe into its chief prosecutor Karim Khan over alleged sexual misconduct, it said in a statement on Monday, confirming a previous report by Reuters. 'An external investigation is ... being pursued in order to ensure a fully independent, impartial and fair process,' the statement said, also calling upon all parties to cooperate fully. Khan said in a statement that he would stay on in his key function of overseeing investigations into alleged war crimes, including in the Israel-Gaza conflict, while any issues relevant to the investigation would be handled by deputy prosecutors. Khan has previously denied allegations of misconduct that were reported to the court's governing body last month. At that time, he asked the court's own internal oversight body to investigate them. ICC judges are reviewing Khan's May request for arrest warrants against Israeli Prime Minister Netanyahu, his defense chief and Hamas leaders. Khan said the misconduct allegations aligned with a misinformation campaign against his office. The ICC is a permanent court that can prosecute individuals for war crimes, crimes against humanity, genocide and the crime of aggression in member states or by their nationals.	https://www.voanews.com/a/icc-confirms-probe-into-alleged-misconduct-by-war-crimes-prosecutor/7860629.html	2024-11-11T19:20:55-08:00	
Voters in Oakland oust Mayor Sheng Thao just 2 years into her term	OAKLAND, Calif. — Voters in Oakland, California, have ousted Mayor Sheng Thao just two years after she narrowly won office to lead the liberal San Francisco Bay Area city. The Associated Press called the race Monday. 'Thank you for choosing me to serve as your Mayor. As the first Hmong American woman to become the mayor of a major American City, it has been the honor of my lifetime,' she said in a statement last week. She committed to ensuring a smooth transition. Thao must vacate the office as soon as election results are certified Dec. 5 and the Oakland City Council declares a vacancy at its next meeting, which would be Dec. 17, Nikki Fortunato Bas, City Council president, said in a statement. A special election for a new mayor will be held within 120 days, or roughly four months. Until then, Bas — as president of the City Council — would serve as interim mayor unless she wins a seat on the Alameda County Board of Supervisors. As of Monday, Bas was trailing in that race. Thao was elected mayor in November 2022 and became the first Hmong American to lead a major city. She faced criticism almost immediately after taking office for firing popular Oakland Police Chief LeRonne Armstrong. Frustrated voters, including the local NAACP, blamed Thao for a long list of city woes related to public safety, homelessness and the city's budget. In her statement, Thao said she was proud of her administration's accomplishments. Thao was not the only official booted from office in Tuesday's election. Pamela Price, district attorney for Alameda County, which includes Oakland, also was ousted by voters in a recall election. Critics of both Thao and Price disagreed with the officials' progressive politics. Thao went into Tuesday's election weakened by an FBI raid in June of her home — along with properties owned by a politically influential family that controls the city's recycling contract. Thao has maintained her innocence and authorities have not said what they are investigating. Oakland uses a ranked choice voting system that allows voters to list multiple choices in order of preference. Thao narrowly beat Loren Taylor in 2022 despite getting fewer first-place votes than Taylor. Oakland has about 400,000 residents and is, at times, more politically liberal than San Francisco. It is Vice President Kamala Harris' hometown. In recent years, Oakland has lost three professional sports franchises, including Major League Baseball's Oakland Athletics. California Gov. Gavin Newsom has sent state highway patrol officers, state prosecutors, and surveillance cameras to help Oakland battle crime.	https://www.voanews.com/a/voters-in-oakland-oust-mayor-sheng-thao-just-2-years-into-her-term/7860610.html	2024-11-11T18:50:34-08:00	
Dutch tram set on fire while tensions are high after violence targeting Israeli fans	the hague, netherlands — Dozens of people armed with sticks and firecrackers set a tram on fire in Amsterdam on Monday, police said, while the city is facing tensions following violence last week targeting fans of an Israeli soccer club. Police said the fire was quickly extinguished and riot officers cleared the square. Images online showed people damaging property and setting off firecrackers. Police said it was not clear who started the unrest or whether it was related to what happened last week. But they noted the tense atmosphere since five people were treated in the hospital and dozens detained Thursday following a Maccabi Tel Aviv-Ajax match. Youths on scooters and on foot went in search of Israeli fans, punching and kicking them and then fleeing to evade police, according to Amsterdam’s mayor. Dutch police announced five new arrests Monday in their investigation into that earlier violence. The suspects are men aged 18 to 37 and are from Amsterdam or surrounding cities. Four are still in custody; the fifth has been released but remains a suspect. Earlier, police said that four other men who had been arrested last week would remain in custody while the investigation continued. Two of those are minors, a 16-year-old and a 17-year-old from Amsterdam. The other two men are from Amsterdam and a nearby city. Police said they have identified over 170 witnesses and have taken forensics evidence from dozens. Prime Minister Dick Schoof said they were also examining videos posted to social media. Reports of antisemitic speech, vandalism and violence have been on the rise in Europe since the start of the war in Gaza, and tensions mounted in Amsterdam ahead of Thursday night’s match. Pro-Palestinian demonstrators were banned by local authorities from gathering outside the stadium. Before the match, Maccabi fans also tore a Palestinian flag off a building in Amsterdam and chanted anti-Arab slogans on their way to the stadium. There were also reports of Maccabi fans starting fights. The mayor has banned all demonstrations in the city and declared several parts of Amsterdam risk zones where police can stop and check anyone. Dozens were detained on Sunday for taking part in a pro-Palestinian demonstration in central Amsterdam that had been outlawed. Israeli Foreign Minister Gideon Saar rushed to the Netherlands on Friday and offered Israel’s help in the police investigation. He met on Saturday with the Dutch prime minister and said in a statement that the attacks and demands to show passports 'were reminiscent of dark periods in history.'	https://www.voanews.com/a/dutch-tram-set-on-fire-while-tensions-are-high-after-violence-targeting-israeli-fans-/7860585.html	2024-11-11T17:10:35-08:00	
New Zealand's leaders formally apologize to survivors of abuse in state and church care	wellington, new zealand — New Zealand's Prime Minister Christopher Luxon made a 'formal and unreserved' apology in Parliament on Tuesday for the widespread abuse, torture and neglect of hundreds of thousands of children and vulnerable adults in care. 'It was horrific. It was heartbreaking. It was wrong. And it should never have happened,' Luxon said, as he spoke to lawmakers and a public gallery packed with survivors of the abuse. An estimated 200,000 people in state, foster and faith-based care suffered 'unimaginable' abuse over seven decades, a blistering report released in July said at the end of the largest inquiry ever undertaken in New Zealand. 'For many of you it changed the course of your life, and for that, the government must take responsibility,' Luxon said. 'Words do matter, and I say these words with sincerity: I have read your stories, and I believe you,' he added. The prime minister was apologizing on behalf of previous governments too, he said. The results were a 'national disgrace,' the inquiry’s report said, after a six-year investigation believed to be the widest-ranging of comparable probes worldwide. Of 650,000 children and vulnerable adults in state, foster and church care between 1950 and 2019 — in a country that today has a population of 5 million — nearly a third endured physical, sexual, verbal or psychological abuse. Many more were exploited or neglected. They were disproportionately Maori, New Zealand's Indigenous people. In response to the findings, New Zealand’s government agreed for the first time that historical treatment of some children in a notorious state-run hospital amounted to torture and pledged an apology to all those abused in state, foster and religious care since 1950. Luxon's government was decried by some survivors and advocates earlier Tuesday ahead of the apology for not yet having divulged plans for the financial compensation of those abused.	https://www.voanews.com/a/new-zealand-s-leaders-formally-apologize-to-survivors-of-abuse-in-state-and-church-care-/7860562.html	2024-11-11T16:50:13-08:00	
Somaliland prepares for presidential polls amid regional tension	WASHINGTON — According to the Somaliland National Electoral Commission, more than 1 million registered and eligible voters head to the polls Wednesday to elect their president for the next five years. Three candidates, including incumbent President Muse Bihi Abdi, seek to consolidate the region’s fragile democracy, boost economic growth and gain international recognition that the Somali enclave has struggled to secure for 33 years. Abdi, of the ruling Peace, Unity and Development Party, also known simply as Kulmiye, seeks a second term in Wednesday’s polls. He is running against Abdirahman Mohamed Abdullahi, known as 'Irro,' of the Waddani party and Faisal Ali Warabe of the Justice and Development Party, or UCID. Promises In an interview with VOA Somali, each of the three candidates promised to strengthen democracy, boost economic growth and seek international recognition for the breakaway region. Abdi, 76, who was elected head of the region in 2017, has pledged there will be progress on a controversial maritime deal that Ethiopia signed with Somaliland earlier this year. 'On our side, we [Somaliland] are free, we are ready to implement the MOU [Memorandum of Understanding], and we are waiting from the Ethiopian side so that we can go ahead with it,' Abdi said. 'Ethiopia needs access to sea, and we need recognition, and this MOU is about these needs.' This is the fourth presidential election since the region on the northwestern tip of Somalia broke away from the rest of the country, following the collapse of the Siad Barre regime in 1991. The territory declared independence that year but has never achieved international recognition. Despite this, Somaliland has a functioning government and institutions, a political system that has allowed democratic transfers of power between rival parties, its own currency, passport and armed forces. According to Freedom House's 2024 flagship annual report, which assesses the condition of political rights and civil liberties around the world, Somaliland experienced an erosion of political rights in the past several years. The report said, 'Journalists and public figures face pressure from authorities. Minority clans are subject to political and economic marginalization, and violence against women remains a serious problem.' Talks between Somaliland, which is seeking full statehood, and Mogadishu, which fiercely opposes the move, have been held on and off between 2012 and 2020 but failed to bear fruit. Irro, of the Waddani party, who also served as speaker of the House of Representatives of Somaliland’s lower chamber of parliament for more than 11 years, said he would resume talks with Somalia. 'It was not our choice to talk to Somalia because our goal has always been getting recognition, but the international community urged us to talk. If I am elected, I will resume the talks if the Somaliland interest lies there, and [at] the same time we will review the previous failed talks,' said Irro. Warabe, of the Justice and Development Party, said that if elected, he would seek recognition through the establishment of a national unity government in Somaliland. 'The return of Bihi [Abdi], who has been for seven years in power, and his party, which has been in power since 2010, is not [an] option for Somaliland voters,' Warabe said. 'If I am elected, I will lead Somaliland to recognition and [a] more prosperous road.' Regional tension Somaliland’s Wednesday vote comes at a time when tensions remain high between Somalia and Ethiopia over the controversial Memorandum of Understanding that Ethiopia signed with Somaliland. The deal would grant Ethiopia a 50-year lease of access to 20 kilometers of the Red Sea coastline in exchange for the potential recognition of Somaliland's independence, which Somalia views as a violation of its sovereignty and territorial integrity. The deal signed on January 1 in Addis Ababa by Abdi and Ethiopia Prime Minister Abiy Ahmed sparked anger in Mogadishu, which considers Somaliland as part of its national territory. The opposition to the deal plunged the two neighboring countries into a deadlocked situation. In April, Somalia expelled Ethiopian Ambassador Muktar Mohamed Ware, alleging 'internal interference' by Ethiopia. Somalia also ordered the closure of Ethiopia's consulates in Somaliland and Puntland, although they remained open. Last month, Somalia expelled Mogadishu-based Ethiopian diplomat Ali Mohamed Adan, who was a counselor at Ethiopia's embassy in Mogadishu. In July and August 2024, two rounds of talks between Ethiopia and Somalia, mediated by Turkey, failed to solve the dispute, with Somalia demanding Ethiopia withdraw from the deal and Ethiopia insisting that it does not infringe on Somalia’s sovereignty. On Saturday, Somali Defense Minister Abdulkadir Mohamed Nur repeated the Somali government position against Ethiopian troop involvement in a new African Union peacekeeping mission in Somalia starting in January. 'I can say that Ethiopia is the only government we know of so far that will not participate in the new AU mission because it has violated our sovereignty and national unity,' Nur said Saturday in a government-run television interview. Somaliland’s last presidential elections were held in 2017. The current presidential election was originally set to take place in 2022 but was postponed until 2023 and then again pushed back to November 2024, following a controversial extension of Abdi’s mandate by the parliament’s upper house. The Somaliland National Election Commission, or NEC, said at the time that the delays were due to 'time, technical and financial constraints.' Opposition parties vehemently denounced the delays. The president is directly elected for a maximum of two five-year terms and appoints the Cabinet.

First emperor penguin known to reach Australia found on tourist beach	MELBOURNE, Australia — An emperor penguin found malnourished far from its Antarctic home on the Australian south coast is being cared for by a wildlife expert, a government department said Monday. The adult male was found on November 1 on a popular tourist beach in the town of Denmark in temperate southwest Australia — about 3,500 kilometers (2,200 miles) north of the icy waters off the Antarctic coast, according to a statement from the Western Australia state’s Department of Biodiversity, Conservation and Attractions. The largest penguin species has never been reported in Australia before, University of Western Australia research fellow Belinda Cannell said, though some had reached New Zealand, nearly all of which is farther south than Western Australia. Cannell said she had no idea why the penguin traveled to Denmark. Cannell is advising seabird rehabilitator Carol Biddulph, who is caring for the penguin, spraying him with a chilled water mist to help him cope with his alien climate. The penguin is 1 meter (39 inches) tall and initially weighed 23 kilograms (51 pounds). A healthy male can weigh more than 45 kilograms (100 pounds). The department said its efforts were focused on rehabilitating the penguin. Asked if the penguin could potentially be returned to Antarctica, the department replied that 'options are still being worked through.'	https://www.voanews.com/a/first-emperor-penguin-known-to-reach-australia-found-on-tourist-beach/7860554.html	2024-11-11T16:07:16-08:00	
US carried out strikes against Iranian-linked targets in Syria	washington — The U.S. military said Monday that it had carried out strikes against nine targets associated with Iranian groups in Syria. In a statement, the U.S. military said the strikes were made against two locations in Syria and were a response to several attacks on U.S. personnel in Syria in the past 24 hours. The U.S. has occasionally carried out strikes against targets linked to Iran in both Iraq and Syria. In February, the U.S. launched airstrikes in Iraq and Syria against more than 85 targets linked to Iran's Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps and militias it backs, in retaliation for a deadly attack on U.S. troops. 'These strikes will degrade the Iranian backed groups' ability to plan and launch future attacks on U.S. and coalition forces,' the U.S. military said after the most recent strikes. The U.S. has 900 troops in Syria and 2,500 in neighboring Iraq, on a mission to advise and assist local forces trying to prevent a resurgence of Islamic State, which in 2014 seized large swaths of both countries but was later defeated. The U.S. has sent warships and fighter aircraft to the region since the Israel-Hamas conflict erupted on October 7, 2023, to try to deter Iran and Iran-backed groups from getting involved in the conflict. U.S. forces have also helped shoot down projectiles that Iran launched toward Israel this year.	https://www.voanews.com/a/us-carried-out-strikes-against-iranian-linked-targets-in-syria/7860288.html	2024-11-11T15:43:23-08:00	
Polish president urges sustained US commitment to Europe's security	warsaw, poland — Polish President Andrzej Duda marked Independence Day on Monday with a call for sustained U.S. commitment to Europe's security in view of Russian aggression in the region and argued that Ukraine's pre-2014 borders should be restored. Weighing on the minds of many is the war across Poland's border in Ukraine, and an expectation that Donald Trump's return to the White House will bring a change in the security situation in the region. Some fear Trump could end the U.S. commitment to NATO or make a deal with Russian President Vladimir Putin that could result in a permanent loss of territory for Ukraine and encourage Russia to attack other nations. Others believe Trump could persuade Putin to stop the fighting. Duda, who has had friendly relations with Trump, said in a speech in Warsaw that Europe will continue to need U.S. protection. 'It is a pipe dream — as some people think — that Europe can ensure its own security today,' Duda said. He emphasized that the security guarantees of successive U.S. presidents are extremely important in times of resurgent Russian imperialism. 'Today we have no doubts that for the security of Europe and the world, it is necessary to strengthen Euro-Atlantic ties,' Duda said. He said the territorial integrity of all countries, especially Ukraine, should be respected and it 'must return to its borders from before the Russian attack, not only the one in 2022 but also the first one, in 2014.' Russia annexed Ukraine's Crimean Peninsula in 2014 and launched its full-scale invasion in 2022. Later in a news conference, Duda said he had spoken to Trump and that they would meet before the inauguration in January. Duda spoke as Poland marked the 106th anniversary of its restored independence at the end of World War I after more than a century of being partitioned and ruled by Russia, Germany and Austro-Hungary. The date of Nov. 11 carries powerful weight for a nation where the trauma of losing national sovereignty endures. In Warsaw, tens of thousands of people took part in a march organized by nationalist groups that has sometimes seen violent clashes in past years but passed without major incident Monday. Organizers estimated turnout at 250,000 while city hall put it at 90,000. Police said they detained 75 people and seized banned items from participants, including pyrotechnic materials, knives, telescopic batons and brass knuckles. Jaroslaw Kaczynski, leader of the conservative Law and Justice party, which governed Poland from 2015-2023 and is seeking a comeback, joined the march with other party members.	https://www.voanews.com/a/polish-president-urges-sustained-us-commitment-to-europe-s-security/7860285.html	2024-11-11T15:28:52-08:00	
Niger rebels fighting for ousted president's release hand over weapons	Niamey, Niger — Nine members of an armed rebel movement seeking the release of Niger's ousted president surrendered Monday, officials in the north of the military-ruled country said. The rebel Patriotic Liberation Front (FPL) was set up in August 2023, a month after Niger's democratically elected president, Mohamed Bazoum, was overthrown in a military coup. Since then, Bazoum has been imprisoned with his wife, Hadiza, at the presidential palace in Niamey. An official from Agadez governorate told AFP, 'Nine FPL fighters repented and handed over their weapons and ammunition on Monday during a ceremony in the presence of General Ibra Boulama,' who is the governor of the region. FPL members began surrendering at the start of the month after discreet negotiations by 'influential local personalities,' the Air-Info media outlet reported. On November 1, FPL spokesman Idrissa Madaki and three other members turned themselves in separately in two towns near the Libyan border, according to Niger's army and national television. Last week, FPL leader Mahmoud Sallah was 'provisionally stripped' of his nationality as were seven members of the Bazoum regime who were suspected of 'terrorist bomb attacks.' Sallah had claimed responsibility for attacking the army in the north and disabling part of a crucial pipeline carrying crude oil to Benin in June. He had also threatened to attack strategic sites. Another rebel movement also demanding Bazoum's release, the Patriotic Front for Justice (FPJ), has held since June the military prefect of northeastern Bilma and four of his security team, who were kidnapped after an ambush. Authorities in Niger, which is also battling attacks by jihadist groups, have stepped up security in recent weeks, with military patrols, checks and searches of vehicles.	https://www.voanews.com/a/niger-rebels-fighting-for-ousted-president-s-release-hand-over-weapons/7860269.html	2024-11-11T14:58:36-08:00	
Jailed Swedish Eritrean journalist wins rights prize	stockholm — A Swedish Eritrean journalist held incommunicado without charge in Eritrea for more than 23 years won a Swedish rights prize on Monday for his fight for freedom of expression, the jury said. Dawit Isaak was among a group of around two dozen people, including senior cabinet ministers, members of parliament and independent journalists, who were seized in a purge in September 2001. He was awarded the Edelstam Prize 'for his outstanding contribution and exceptional courage in standing up for freedom of expression, one's beliefs, and in the defense of human rights,' the Edelstam Foundation said in a statement. Amnesty International considers Isaak a prisoner of conscience, and press freedom group Reporters Without Borders (RSF) says he and his colleagues detained at the same time are the longest-held journalists in the world. U.N. rights experts have demanded Asmara immediately release him. Eritrea has provided no news about him, and there are fears he may no longer even be alive. He would be 60 years old. His daughter Betlehem Isaak will accept the award on his behalf in Stockholm on November 19. Isaak fled to Sweden in 1987 during Eritrea's struggle against Ethiopia, which eventually led to independence in 1993. After obtaining Swedish citizenship, he returned to Eritrea in 2001 to help shape the media landscape, and co-founded Setit, the country's first independent newspaper. He was arrested shortly after the paper published articles demanding political reforms. Asmara has not provided any information about his whereabouts or health over the years, which U.N. experts in 2021 deemed 'extremely concerning.' But they said a credible source had indicated Isaak was still alive in September 2020. The Edelstam Prize is awarded in memory of Swedish diplomat Harald Edelstam, who as ambassador to Chile at the time of Augusto Pinochet's 1973 military coup granted thousands of Chileans and other Latin Americans safe conduct to, and political asylum in, Sweden.	https://www.voanews.com/a/jailed-swedish-eritrean-journalist-wins-rights-prize/7860249.html	2024-11-11T14:51:15-08:00	
Iran calls to expel Israel from UN after strike on Syria	Tehran, Iran — Iran's foreign ministry is calling for an arms embargo on Israel and the expulsion of its arch-foe from the United Nations, following a deadly strike in Syria. Foreign ministry spokesperson Esmaeil Baghaei said Tehran 'strongly condemned the aggressive attack carried out by the Zionist regime against a residential building' in the Damascus area. The strike on an apartment Sunday belonging to the Lebanese armed group Hezbollah, which is backed by Iran, killed nine people including a Hezbollah commander, the Syrian Observatory for Human Rights war monitor said. Baghaei called for measures against Israel, including 'an arms embargo' and its 'expulsion from the United Nations.' Regional tensions have soared since the outbreak of the Gaza war in October 2023, triggered by the Palestinian Hamas militant group's unprecedented attack on Israel. The conflict has drawn in Tehran-aligned militants in the region and included rare direct attacks between Iran and Israel. Since Syria's civil war broke out in 2011, Israel has carried out hundreds of strikes in Syria, mainly targeting army positions and fighters including from Hezbollah. Israeli authorities rarely comment on the strikes but have repeatedly said they will not allow arch-enemy Iran to expand its presence in Syria.	https://www.voanews.com/a/iran-calls-to-expel-israel-from-un-after-strike-on-syria-/7860263.html	2024-11-11T14:47:54-08:00	
Trump set to go after measures mitigating climate change	WASHINGTON — The election of Donald Trump as president for a second time and the Republican takeback of the U.S. Senate could undo many of the national climate policies that are most reducing planet-warming greenhouse gas emissions, according to climate solutions experts. When they list measures that are making the most difference, it lines up with policies Trump has said he'll target. These rollbacks will come as more lives are being lost in heat waves, record amounts of climate pollution are accumulating in the atmosphere, the United States has been hit with what may be two of its most expensive hurricanes, and nations, which will meet in Baku, Azerbaijan for climate negotiations, have failed to take strong action to change these realities. Here are some of the measures The Inflation Reduction Act, the nation's landmark climate law This law is significant because it is expected to reduce U.S. emissions by about 40% by 2030, if it unfolds as planned in the coming years. It funnels money to measures that substitute clean energy for dirty. One major way it does so is by giving credits to businesses people who build new solar and wind farms. But it's not limited to that. It encourages developers of geothermal energy and businesses that separate the carbon dioxide from their smokestacks and bury it underground. It incentivizes the next generation of nuclear power. It gives a $7,500 tax credit to people who buy electric cars. People who buy their cars used can get a credit too, as long as they don't earn too much to qualify. Trump, by contrast, has summed up his energy policy as 'drill, baby, drill' and pledged to dismantle what he calls Democrats’ 'green new scam' in favor of boosting production of fossil fuels such as oil, natural gas and coal, the main causes of climate change. He vows to end subsidies for wind power that were included in the landmark 2022 climate law. If Trump does target the climate law, there are provisions that are likely safe. One is a credit for companies in advanced manufacturing, because it is perceived as 'America first and pro-U.S. business,' said David Shepheard, partner and energy expert at the global consultant Baringa. Incentives for electric vehicles are likely most at risk, he added. Pollution from electric power plants The main U.S. rule aimed at reducing climate change that comes from making electricity at power plants that burn coal is also considered vulnerable. This rule from the Environmental Protection Agency, announced in April, would force many coal-fired plants to capture 90% of their carbon emissions or shut down within eight years, Shepheard said. It was projected to reduce roughly 1.38 billion metric tons of carbon dioxide through 2047, along with tens of thousands of tons of other harmful air pollutants. The United States has been reducing carbon dioxide emissions primarily by replacing coal-fired power plants with clean, renewable power, said Stanford University climate scientist Rob Jackson, who chairs the Global Carbon Project, a group of scientists that tracks countries’ carbon dioxide emissions. 'I hope that we don’t lose sight of the benefits of clean energy,' he said. 'It’s not just about the climate. It’s about our lives and our health.' Limiting leaks from damaging methane, or natural gas The Biden administration was under pressure to reduce one of the main pollutants contributing to drought, heat waves, flooding and stronger hurricanes — methane or natural gas. It leaks out of oil and gas equipment, sometimes deliberately when companies consider it too expensive to transport. The Biden administration issued the first national rules on this. Industry groups and Republican-leaning states challenged the rule in court. They say the Environmental Protection Agency overstepped its authority and set unattainable standards. The EPA said the rules are within its legal responsibilities and would protect the public. Fuel-efficient vehicles The EPA issued its strongest rules on tailpipe emissions from cars and trucks under the Biden administration. Under Trump, the EPA is considered likely to begin a lengthy process to repeal and replace a host of standards including the one on tailpipe emissions, which Trump falsely calls an electric vehicle 'mandate.' Trump has said EV manufacturing will destroy jobs in the auto industry and has falsely claimed that battery-powered cars don’t work in cold weather and aren’t able to travel long distances. Trump softened his rhetoric in recent months after Tesla CEO Elon Musk endorsed him and campaigned heavily for his election. Even so, industry officials expect Trump to try to slow a shift to electric cars. Drilling in Alaska refuge Trump is almost certain to reinstate oil drilling in Alaska’s Arctic National Wildlife Refuge, continuing a partisan battle that has persisted for decades. Biden and other Democratic presidents have blocked drilling in the sprawling refuge, which is home to polar bears, caribou and other wildlife. Trump opened the area to drilling in a 2017 tax cut law enacted by congressional Republicans. No drilling has occurred in the refuge, although the U.S. Bureau of Land Management on Wednesday proposed a lease sale by the end of December that could lead to oil drilling. The sale is required under the 2017 law. Transition to cleaner energy, transport will continue Trump, who has cast climate change as a 'hoax,' has said he will also eliminate regulations by the Biden administration to increase the energy efficiency of lightbulbs, stoves, dishwashers and shower heads. Dan Jasper, a senior policy advisor at Project Drawdown said climate action will continue to move forward at the state and local level. Zara Ahmed, who leads policy analysis and science strategy at Carbon Direct, agreed. While there may be an abdication of leadership at the federal level on climate, she’s optimistic that states including California will continue to lead. Clean Air Task Force Executive Director Armond Cohen said Wednesday that states, cities, utilities and businesses that have committed to net zero emissions will keep working toward those goals, driving record installations of wind and solar energy. Governors of both parties are also interested in ramping up nuclear energy as a carbon-free source of electricity, Cohen said. Trump has said he, too, is interested in developing the next generation of nuclear reactors that are smaller than traditional reactors. Gina McCarthy, a former EPA administrator who was Biden’s first national climate adviser, said Trump will be unable to stop clean energy such as wind, solar and geothermal power. 'No matter what Trump may say, the shift to clean energy is unstoppable and our country is not turning back,' McCarthy said.	https://www.voanews.com/a/7860262.html	2024-11-11T14:40:38-08:00	
Nigerian military, Reuters at odds over reports on alleged mass abortion program	Abuja, Nigeria — The Nigerian military welcomed a report by a human rights group that found 'no evidence' the military secretly carried out thousands of illegal abortions as part of its fight against Islamist insurgency. The Reuters news agency says it stands by its three reports in 2022 which lodged the allegations. In a statement over the weekend, Nigerian Defense Chief General Christopher Musa praised the report by the seven-member investigative panel set up by the National Human Rights Commission of Nigeria. Musa said no amount of false accusations will distract the armed forces from defending Nigeria's integrity. On Friday, the Nigerian investigative panel said it found 'no evidence' that the Nigerian military secretly carried out illegal abortions or had such a policy in its operations against terror groups. The panel's probe lasted 18 months and was based on 199 testimonies from witnesses including Musa, who was leading the counterinsurgency campaign at the time. In December 2022, Reuters news agency published three reports alleging that the Nigerian military ran a mass abortion program for victims of the long-running Boko Haram insurgency and massacred children in the northeast. The report alleged that the military had carried out more than 10,000 abortions since 2013. 'The panel made its findings meticulously on each of the issues,' said Hillary Ogbonna, secretary to the investigative panel. 'For the abortion assault, the panel did not find evidence that the Nigerian armed forces committed a systematic, secret or policy-driven abortion in the northeast to the tune of 10,000 abortions.' The committee, however, agreed with a Reuters report alleging the military committed human rights violations, including infanticide, during a military operation in June 2016. 'The panel found the military culpable of infanticide and the killing of community members in the village of Abisare in Borno State. We've received witness testimonies including those of the survivors and relations of the deceased,' Ogbonna said. Responding to the panel's report, Reuters said it stands by its investigation, stating that it satisfied their standards for independence, accuracy and impartiality. On Monday, a Nigerian human rights group, Women Concerns, called on Reuters to withdraw the report and apologize to the Nigerian military. But security analyst Chidi Omeje said when there's disagreement between two parties, an independent committee can be set up to review the reports. 'I don't know how the human rights commission went about the investigation. I really cannot say whether it was a thorough job done or whether there was some influence somewhere. Maybe some other independent organizations should be able to wade in,' Omeje said. 'I know that [the] human rights commission, even though I'm not trying to doubt their integrity, it has some allegiance to the government because it's a government agency.' Years of military offensives against terror groups in Nigeria have been embroiled in allegations of human rights violations. Soldiers have been accused of mistreating civilians and carrying out extrajudicial killings. 'It tells you how it is very difficult to maintain or stick to that professionalism if you're dealing with this kind of asymmetric warfare. Sometimes it is difficult to distinguish who the adversaries are,' Omeje said. Recently, the military launched a public relations campaign, seeking to repair its reputation.	https://www.voanews.com/a/nigerian-military-reuters-at-odds-over-reports-on-alleged-mass-abortion-program/7860239.html	2024-11-11T14:25:20-08:00	
Trump breaks Republican losing streak in nation's largest majority-Arab city	DEARBORN, Michigan — Faced with two choices she didn't like, Suehaila Amen chose neither. Instead, the longtime Democrat from the Arab American stronghold of Dearborn, Michigan, backed a third-party candidate for president, adding her voice to a remarkable turnaround that helped Donald Trump reclaim Michigan and the presidency. In Dearborn, where nearly half of the 110,000 residents are of Arab descent, Vice President Kamala Harris received over 2,500 fewer votes than Trump, who became the first Republican presidential candidate since former President George W. Bush in 2000 to win the city. Harris also lost neighboring Dearborn Heights to Trump, who in his previous term as president banned travel from several mostly-Muslim countries. Harris lost the presidential vote in two Detroit-area cities with large Arab American populations after months of warnings from local Democrats about the Biden-Harris administration’s unwavering support for Israel in the war in Gaza. Some said they backed Trump after he visited a few days before the election, mingling with customers and staff at a Lebanese-owned restaurant and reassuring people that he would find a way to end the violence in the Middle East. Others, including Amen, were unable to persuade themselves to back the former president. She said many Arab Americans felt Harris got what she deserved but aren’t 'jubilant about Trump.' 'Whether it’s Trump himself or the people who are around him, it does pose a great deal of concern for me,' Amen said. 'But at the end of the day when you have two evils running, what are you left with?' As it became clear late Tuesday into early Wednesday that Trump would not only win the presidency but likely prevail in Dearborn, the mood in metro Detroit’s Arab American communities was described by Dearborn City Council member Mustapha Hammoud as 'somber.' And yet, he said, the result was 'not surprising at all.' The shift in Dearborn — where Trump received nearly 18,000 votes compared with Harris' 15,000 — marks a startling change from just four years ago when Joe Biden won in the city by a nearly 3-to-1 margin. No one should be surprised The results didn't come out of nowhere. For months, in phone calls and meetings with top Democratic officials, local leaders warned, in blunt terms, that Arab American voters would turn against them if the administration’s handling of the Israel-Hamas war didn’t change. The Biden-Harris administration has remained a staunch ally of Israel since the brutal Oct. 7, 2023, attack by Hamas, which killed 1,200 Israelis and took over 200 hostages. The war between Israel and Hamas has killed more than 43,000 people in Gaza, Palestinian health officials say. They do not distinguish between civilians and combatants. While Harris softened her rhetoric on the war, she didn't propose concrete policies toward Israel or the war in Gaza that varied from the administration’s position. And even if she had, that might not have made much of a difference in places like Dearborn. 'All she had to do was stop the war in Lebanon and Gaza and she would receive everyone’s votes here,' said Hammoud. More voters thought Trump would be better able to handle the situation in the Middle East than Harris, according to AP VoteCast, a survey of more than 120,000 voters nationwide. About half of voters named Trump as better suited, compared with about a third who said Harris. Among those who opposed more aid for Israel, 58% backed Harris in the presidential election; 39% supported Trump. Even some Harris voters had their doubts. About three-quarters of Harris voters in Michigan said she was the better candidate to handle the situation. Few preferred Trump, but about 2 in 10 Harris voters said they were equivalent or neither would be better. In the absence of support for Harris in the Arab American community, Trump and his allies stepped in. A key part of Michigan’s electorate — a state Trump won by nearly 11,000 votes in 2016 before he lost it by nearly 154,000 to Biden in 2020 — Arab Americans spent months meeting with Trump allies, who encouraged community leaders to endorse him. Things began to move in September, when Amer Ghalib, the Democratic Muslim mayor of the city of Hamtramck, endorsed Trump. Shortly afterwards, Trump visited a campaign office there. That was a turning point, said Massad Boulos, who led Trump's outreach with Arab Americans. Boulos' son Michael is married to Trump's daughter Tiffany. 'They very, very much appreciated the president’s visit and the respect that they felt,' said Massad Boulos. 'That was the first big achievement, so to speak. After that, I started getting endorsements from imams and Muslim leaders.' An apparent shift toward Trump in final week While support for Harris had been declining for months — especially after her campaign did not allow a pro-Palestinian speaker to take the stage at August’s Democratic National Convention — some voters say the last week of the campaign was pivotal. At an October 30 rally in Michigan, former President Bill Clinton said Hamas uses civilians as shields and will 'force you to kill civilians if you want to defend yourself.' 'Hamas did not care about a homeland for the Palestinians, they wanted to kill Israelis and make Israel uninhabitable,' he said. 'Well, I got news for them, they were there first, before their faith existed, they were there.' The Harris campaign wanted Clinton to visit Dearborn to speak in the days following the rally, according to two people with direct knowledge of the discussions who spoke on condition of anonymity because they were not authorized to speak publicly about them. The potential visit never materialized after backlash over Clinton’s comments. 'That comment was the talk of the town. It hurt many like me, who loved him,' said Amin Hashmi, who was born in Pakistan and lives in suburban Detroit. A self-proclaimed 'die-hard Dem,' Hashmi said casting a ballot for Trump 'was a seismic move' that came after he stood in the voting booth for 25 minutes. On the Friday before the election, Trump visited The Great Commoner in Dearborn, a Lebanese-owned restaurant. That stood in sharp contrast with Harris, who met with Dearborn’s Democratic mayor, Abdullah Hammoud — who didn’t endorse in the race — but never came to Dearborn herself. 'He came up to Dearborn. He spoke with residents. Whether some people say it wasn’t genuine, he still made the effort. He did reach out and try to work with them, at least listen to them,' said Samia Hamid, a Dearborn resident.	https://www.voanews.com/a/trump-breaks-republican-losing-streak-in-nation-s-largest-majority-arab-city/7860230.html	2024-11-11T13:49:25-08:00	
Young Black, Latino men say they chose Trump because of economy, jobs	WASHINGTON — Brian Leija, a 31-year-old small-business owner from Belton, Texas, was not surprised that a growing number of Latino men of his generation voted for Donald Trump for president this year. Leija had voted for the Republican in 2016 and 2020. Leija's rationale was simple: He said he has benefited from Trump's economic policies, especially tax cuts. 'I am a blue-collar worker,' Leija said. 'So, tax breaks for small businesses are ideal for what I do.' For DaSean Gallishaw, a consultant in Fairfax, Virginia, a vote for Trump was rooted in what he saw as Democrats' rhetoric not matching their actions. 'It's been a very long time since the Democrats ever really kept their promises to what they're going to do for the minority communities,' he said. Gallishaw, 25, who is Black, also voted for Trump twice before. This year, he said, he thought the former president's 'minority community outreach really showed up.' Trump gained a larger share of Black and Latino voters than he did in 2020, when he lost to Democrat Joe Biden, and most notably among men under age 45, according to AP VoteCast, a nationwide survey of more than 120,000 voters. Even as Democrat Kamala Harris won majorities of Black and Latino voters, it wasn't enough to give the vice president the White House, because of the gains Trump made. Economy, jobs made men under 45 open to Trump Voters overall cited the economy and jobs as the most important issue the country faced. That was true for Black and Hispanic voters as well. About 3 in 10 Black men under age 45 went for Trump, roughly double the share he got in 2020. Young Latinos, particularly young Latino men, also were more open to Trump than in 2020. Roughly half of young Latino men voted for Harris, compared with about 6 in 10 who went for Biden. Juan Proano, CEO of the League of United Latin American Citizens, the nation's largest and oldest civil rights organization for Hispanic Americans, said the election results make it clear that Trump's messaging on the economy resonated with Latinos. 'I think it's important to say that Latinos have a significant impact in deciding who the next president was going to be and reelected Donald Trump,' Proano said. '[Latino] men certainly responded to the populist message of the president and focused primarily on economic issues, inflation, wages and even support of immigration reform.' The Rev. Derrick Harkins, a minister who has served Abyssinian Baptist Church in New York, has overseen outreach to Black American religious communities for more than a decade. He said that Trump's hypermasculine appeal worked to win over some younger men of color. 'I think that Trump with this bogus machismo has been effective amongst the young men, Black, white, Hispanic,' Harkins said. 'And I think unfortunately, even if it's a very small percentage, you know, when you're talking about an election like we just had, it can be very impactful.' Black, Latino voters' priorities changed from 2020 While about 4 in 10 young voters under 45 across racial and ethnic groups identified the economy as the top issue facing the country, older white and Latino voters were likely to also cite immigration, with about one-quarter of each saying that was the top issue. A clear majority of young Black voters described the economy as 'not so good' or 'poor,' compared with about half of older Black voters. Majorities of Latino voters, regardless of age, said the economy is in bad shape. That belief made it more difficult for Harris to highlight the actual numbers in the economy, which show that inflation has receded dramatically, unemployment remains low and wages have risen. These voters simply did not feel that progress. This is the first time Alexis Uscanga, a 20-year-old college student from Brownville, Texas, voted in a presidential election. The economy and immigration are the issues that drove him to vote for Trump, he said. 'Everything just got a lot more expensive than it once was for me,' Uscanga said. 'Gas, grocery shopping, even as a college student, everything has gone up in price, and that is a big concern for me, and other issues like immigration.' Having grown up washing cars and selling tamales and used cars, Uscanga knows how hard it can be to make a living. When Trump was president, he said, it did not feel that way, he said. 'I was not very fond of President Trump because of his rhetoric in 2016, but I look aside from that and how we were living in 2018, 2019.' Uscanga said. 'I just felt that we lived a good life no matter what the media was saying, and that's why I started supporting him after that.' Though the shift of votes to Trump from Black and Latino men was impactful, Trump could not have won without the support of a majority of white voters. 'Men of color are really beginning to emerge as the new swing voters,' said Terrance Woodbury, co-founder of HIT Strategies, a polling and research firm that conducted studies for the Harris campaign. 'For a long time, we talked about suburban women and soccer moms who can swing the outcome of elections. Now men of color are really beginning to emerge as that, especially younger men of color, who are less ideological, less tied to a single party, and more likely to swing either between parties or in and out of the electorate,' Woodbury said. Desire for strong leadership A majority of voters nationally said Trump was a strong leader; slightly fewer than half said the same about Harris. Among Hispanic voters, even more saw Trump as strong in this election. Roughly 6 in 10 Hispanic men described Trump as a strong leader, compared with 43% who said that in 2020. About half of Hispanic women said Trump was a strong leader, up from 37%. Black men and women were about twice as likely as in 2020 to describe Trump as a strong leader. David Means, a purchasing manager in Atlanta who is Black, abstained from voting in the election because he did not feel either Harris or Trump was making the right appeals to Black men. But the results of the election did not disappoint him. 'I'm satisfied with the result. I don't feel slighted. I wasn't let down. I wasn't pulling for Trump or Kamala, but I did not want a woman in that position,' he said. And if it were to be a woman, Means said, 'I'd rather have a really strong and smart woman, for example, like Judge Judy.'	https://www.voanews.com/a/young-black-latino-men-say-they-chose-trump-because-of-economy-jobs/7860225.html	2024-11-11T13:45:30-08:00	
California voters reject measure to ban forced prison labor	Sacramento, California — California voters have rejected a measure on the November ballot that would have amended the state constitution to ban forced prison labor. The constitution already prohibits so-called involuntary servitude, but an exception allows it to be used as a punishment for crime. That exemption became a target of criminal justice advocates concerned that prisoners are often paid less than $1 an hour for labor such as fighting fires, cleaning cells and doing landscaping work at cemeteries. The failed Proposition 6 was included in a package of reparations proposals introduced by lawmakers this year as part of an effort to atone and offer redress for a history of discrimination against Black Californians. Democratic Governor Gavin Newsom signed a law in the package in September to issue a formal apology for the state's legacy of racism against African Americans. But state lawmakers blocked a bill that would have created an agency to administer reparations programs, and Newsom vetoed a measure that would have helped Black families reclaim property taken unjustly by the government through eminent domain. Abolish Slavery National Network co-founder Jamilia Land, who advocated for the initiative targeting forced prison labor, said the measure and similar ones in other states are about 'dismantling the remnants of slavery' from the books. 'While the voters of California did not pass Proposition 6 this time, we have made significant progress,' she said in a statement. 'We are proud of the movement we have built, and we will not rest until we see this issue resolved once and for all.' George Eyles, a retired teacher in Brea who voted against Prop 6, said he found it confusing that the initiative aimed to ban slavery, which was outlawed in the U.S. in the 19th century. After finding out more about the measure, Eyles decided it likely would not be economically feasible since prison labor helps cut costs for upkeep, he said. 'I really couldn’t get any in-depth information about ... the thinking behind putting that whole Prop 6 forward, so that made me leery of it,' Eyles said. 'If I really can’t understand something, then I’m usually going to shake my head, ‘No.’' Multiple states — including Colorado, Tennessee, Alabama and Vermont — have voted to rid their constitutions of forced labor exemptions in recent years, and this week they were joined by Nevada, which passed its own measure. In Colorado — the first state to get rid of an exception for slavery from its constitution in 2018 — incarcerated people alleged in a 2022 lawsuit filed against the corrections department that they were still being forced to work. Proposition 6’s ballot language did not explicitly include the word 'slavery' like measures elsewhere, because the California Constitution was amended in the 1970s to remove an exemption for slavery. But the exception for involuntary servitude as a punishment for crime remained on the books. The 13th Amendment of the U.S. Constitution bans slavery and involuntary servitude except as a punishment for crime. Proposition 6 saw the second-least campaign spending among the 10 statewide initiatives on the ballot this year, about $1.9 million, according to the California Secretary of State’s office. It had no formal opposition.	https://www.voanews.com/a/california-voters-reject-measure-to-ban-forced-prison-labor/7860226.html	2024-11-11T13:41:27-08:00	
Fire crews on both US coasts battle wildfires	RINGWOOD, New Jersey — Fire crews battled small wildfires across the Northeast U.S. on Monday, including a blaze in New York and New Jersey that killed a parks employee over the weekend and postponed Veterans Day plans. Just over half a centimeter (1/4 inch) of rain fell overnight from Sunday into Monday in a forest area straddling the border between the two states, giving a slight respite to firefighters. The fire is one of several burning on the East Coast amid a lack of much rainfall since September. An employee of the New York State Parks, Recreation, and Historic Preservation Department who was assisting firefighting crews died Saturday when he was hit by a falling tree. The East Coast fires were burning as much larger wildfires raged in California. Firefighters continued making progress against a wildfire northwest of Los Angeles in Ventura County that broke out Wednesday and quickly exploded in size due to dry, warm and gusty Santa Ana winds. The Mountain Fire in Ventura County prompted thousands of residents to flee their homes and was 36% contained as of Monday. The fire's size remains about 83 square kilometers (around 32 square miles). The Mountain Fire has destroyed more than 170 structures, most of them homes, officials said. The cause is under investigation. Across the country on the New Jersey and New York border, the 12.2 square-kilometer (4.7 square-mile) fire dubbed the Jennings Creek Wildfire was 10% contained as of midmorning Monday, and 25 structures were considered threatened, although no evacuations had been ordered, according to the New Jersey Forest Fire Service. Officials said the overnight rainfall was far less than what was needed to extinguish numerous brush fires that have broken out around New Jersey since the middle of last week. At least four other wildfires in central to northern New Jersey were mostly or completely contained as of Monday. In order to find and fight the fires, crews are navigating a maze of country roads, lakes and steep hills amid dense forests. Trees there have dropped most of their leaves onto parched ground, masking a potential danger. 'Beneath the surface leaf litter that falls off the trees, that stuff is bone dry,' Bryan Gallagher, a forest ranger with the New York State Department of Environmental Conservation, said at a media briefing. 'So right now you get a little bit of rain that puts that surface fire out. But if it's in the duff it's going to stay there. It's going to smolder like a cigar until it gets dry enough and then that fire can pop up again.' In some areas, narrow columns of white smoke could be seen creeping out of a lakeside tree canopy Monday afternoon. With the smell of smoke permeating the air in some areas, residents negotiated a string of road closures, and even some firefighters struggled driving on winding roads with weak cellphone signals. A firefighting helicopter capable of dropping 1,325 liters (350 gallons) at a time was being used to help combat the Jennings Creek fire. In West Milford, New Jersey, a Veterans Day ceremony was postponed to later in the month because of the firefighting effort, said Rudy Hass, the local Veterans of Foreign Wars of the U.S. commander. 'Many of those personnel currently engaged with the fires are veterans themselves, and right now we need to keep them in our thoughts as they spend many hours, day and night, doing all they can in order protect our great communities in that area,' he posted online. Meanwhile, New York State Police said they were investigating the death of Dariel Vasquez, the 18-year-old state parks employee killed Saturday while fighting a fire near New York state's Greenwood Lake. Health advisories had been issued over the weekend for parts of New York, including New York City, and northeastern New Jersey due to unhealthy air quality produced by smoke from the fires, but conditions improved after the rainfall and changes in wind direction. In Massachusetts, one wildfire among several fueled by powerful wind gusts and dry leaves has burned around 400 acres (162 hectares) in the Lynn Woods Reservation, a municipal park extending across about 8.8 square kilometers (3.4 square miles) in the city some 16 kilometers (10 miles) north of Boston. The Lynn Fire Department cited 'a dry spell we have not seen during this time of year in many years.' 'We believe we have the fire contained using the main fire roads. We will maintain a presence to ensure the fire doesn't spread further,' Lynn Fire Chief Dan Sullivan said in a statement late Sunday. The Northeast has been experiencing prolonged dry conditions. In New Jersey, the state Department of Environmental Protection is planning a hearing on Tuesday to review its water supply conditions. Before Sunday night, the last measurable rainfall in New Jersey occurred on Sept. 28.	https://www.voanews.com/a/fire-crews-on-both-us-coasts-battle-wildfires/7860219.html	2024-11-11T13:32:59-08:00	
Haiti swears in new PM as gangs shoot at flight landing at airport	PORT-AU-PRINCE, Haiti — Haiti’s international airport shut down temporarily Monday after gangs opened fire at a Spirit Airlines flight landing in Port-Au-Prince, the U.S. State Department and the airline said. The latest violence came as a new prime minister was sworn in. The flight, headed from Fort Lauderdale to Port-Au-Prince, was hit multiple times by gunfire as it was set to land in Haiti’s capital, striking a flight attendant, who suffered minor injuries. Photos and videos obtained by The Associated Press show bullet holes dotting the interior of a plane. The flight was diverted and landed in the Dominican Republic, according to Spirit Airlines. It appeared to be part of what the U.S. Embassy called 'gang-led efforts to block travel to and from Port-au-Prince which may include armed violence, and disruptions to roads, ports, and airports.' In other parts of Haiti’s capital, firefights between gangs and police broke out. Rounds of gunfire echoed through the streets as heavily armed officers ducked behind walls and civilians ran in terror. In other upper-class areas, gangs set fire to homes. Schools closed as panic spread in a number of areas. The turmoil comes a day after a council meant to reestablish democratic order in the Caribbean nation fired the interim Prime Minister Garry Conille, replacing him with businessman Alix Didier Fils-Aime. The council has been marked by infighting and three members were recently accused of corruption. On Monday, suit-clad diplomats and security officials flocked to the swearing-in ceremony, set to take place in the afternoon. The country has seen weeks of political chaos, which observers warned could result in even more violence in a place where bloodshed has become the new normal. The country's gangs have long capitalized on political turmoil to make power grabs, shutting down airports, shipping ports and stirring chaos. The transitional council was established in April, tasked with choosing Haiti’s next prime minister and Cabinet with the hope that it would help quell violence, which exploded after Haitian President Jovenel Moise was assassinated in 2021. The council was meant to pave the way to democratic elections, which haven’t been held in years in Haiti. Gangs have capitalized on that power vacuum to make their own power grabs. But the council has been plagued with politics and infighting, and has long been at odds with Garry Conille, the interim prime minister they handpicked six months ago, who they fired yesterday. Organizations including the Organization of American States tried and failed last week to mediate disagreements to save the fragile transition.	https://www.voanews.com/a/haiti-swears-in-pm-as-gangs-shoot-at-flight-landing-at-airport/7860208.html	2024-11-11T13:14:57-08:00	
Abolitionist Harriet Tubman posthumously named 'general' in Veterans Day ceremony	CHURCH CREEK, Maryland — Revered abolitionist Harriet Tubman, who was the first woman to oversee an American military action during a time of war, was posthumously awarded the rank of general on Monday. Dozens gathered on Veterans Day at the Harriet Tubman Underground Railroad State Park in Maryland's Dorchester County for a formal ceremony making Tubman a one-star brigadier general in the state's National Guard. Gov. Wes Moore called the occasion not just a great day for Tubman's home state but for all the U.S. 'Today, we celebrate a soldier and a person who earned the title of veteran,' Moore said. 'Today we celebrate one of the greatest authors of the American story.' Tubman escaped slavery herself in 1849, settling in Philadelphia in 1849. Intent on helping others achieve freedom, she established the Underground Railroad network and led other enslaved Black women and men to freedom. She then channeled those experiences as a scout, spy and nurse for the Union Army during the Civil War, helping guide 150 Black soldiers on a gunboat raid in South Carolina. Nobody would have judged Tubman had she chosen to remain in Philadelphia and coordinate abolitionist efforts from there, Moore said. 'She knew that in order to do the work, that meant that she had to go into the lion’s den,' Moore said. 'She knew that leadership means you have to be willing to do what you are asking others to do.' The reading of the official order was followed by a symbolic pinning ceremony with Tubman's great-great-great-grandniece, Tina Wyatt. Wyatt hailed her aunt's legacy of tenacity, generosity and faith and agreed Veterans Day applied to her as much as any other service member. 'Aunt Harriet was one of those veterans informally, she gave up any rights that she had obtained for herself to be able to fight for others,' Wyatt said. 'She is a selfless person.' Tubman's status as an icon of history has only been further elevated within the last few years. The city of Philadelphia chose a Black artist to make a 14-foot (4.3-meter) bronze statue to go on display next year. In 2022, a Chicago elementary school was renamed for Tubman, replacing the previous namesake, who had racist views. However, plans to put Tubman on the $20 bill have continued to stall.	https://www.voanews.com/a/abolitionist-harriet-tubman-posthumously-named-general-in-veterans-day-ceremony/7860197.html	2024-11-11T12:56:41-08:00	
Former UK soldier accused of helping Iran pleads guilty to prison escape	London — A British soldier accused of passing sensitive information to Iran's Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps pleaded guilty Monday to escaping from prison while awaiting trial. Daniel Abed Khalife is on trial at London's Woolwich Crown Court, accused of collecting sensitive information between May 2019 and January 2022. Khalife, who is no longer a member of the British armed forces, also denies leaving a fake bomb on a desk and absconding from his barracks in 2023. Prosecutors had also alleged Khalife escaped from London's Wandsworth prison in September 2023 by tying himself to the bottom of a delivery van, sparking a brief nationwide manhunt. The 23-year-old had originally pleaded not guilty to escaping from lawful custody but changed his plea to guilty Monday after having given evidence for several days earlier this month. Khalife is also charged with gathering information that might be useful to an enemy, namely Iran, obtaining information likely to be useful for terrorism and perpetrating a bomb hoax.

Palau’s president secures 2nd term amid attempt to navigate US-China competition	Taipei, Taiwan — Palau’s President Surangel Whipps Jr. has secured another term in office after defeating former President Tommy Remengesau Jr. in its Nov. 5 election that was closely monitored. Palau sits on the front line of competition for geopolitical influence between the United States and China in the Pacific Ocean. While election authorities still haven’t finished counting absentee ballots, Whipps has won the vote with one of the biggest margins in Palau’s electoral history, 57.5%. Remengesau, who is Whipps’ brother-in-law, took 41.3%. Whipps thanked supporters for allowing him to continue 'building on the progress' that his administration has achieved over the last four years. 'Your decision to grant me a second term as president is a responsibility I hold with the utmost respect,' he said in a statement shared with VOA on Monday. The president can only have two consecutive four-year terms and must step down after that, but he can run again after a four-year gap in between. Remengesau has served a total of four terms already. Separately, the spokesperson for Palau’s election commission told Radio New Zealand the following day that it was 'highly unlikely' that Whipps would lose the election. Meanwhile, in a concession speech broadcast by a local radio station, the Palau Wave Productions, on November 7, Remengesau said the election is finished and the Palauan people have 'spoken through a peaceful and free election.' Analysts say the outcome shows more Palauan voters support Whipps’ policy agenda, which includes tax reforms and deeper engagement with the United States. 'It seems Palau’s closer relationship with the United States under Whipps Jr.’s leadership makes sense for the majority of Palauans,' said Henryk Szadziewski, an expert on Pacific affairs at the University of Hawaii at Manoa. Palau has a population of around 20,000 people and is situated around 890 kilometers (550 miles) east of the Philippines. It is one of three Pacific Island countries that receive significant economic support from the U.S. under agreements known as the Compacts of Free Association, or COFA. Under the accords, the U.S. provides economic aid worth billions of dollars, while Palau, the Marshall Islands, and the Federated States of Micronesia give the U.S. exclusive military access to their land, water and airspace, as well as the right to deny China access to their ports and territorial waters. In September, U.S. lawmakers passed funding for key provisions in COFA for Palau. The U.S. military is also helping to repair a runway on a World War II-era Japanese airfield on the island of Peleliu and installing two radar systems on Palau. Experts say they expect Palau to keep deepening ties with the U.S. during Whipps’ second term and relevant efforts will likely include increasing the frequency of U.S. military visits and enhancing connectivity with Palau. 'There’s going to be a much stronger U.S. presence in terms of military visits, joint actions to combat transnational crime and illegal fishing, and boost transport and digital connectivity,' Meg Keen, a senior fellow at the Lowy Institute in Australia, told VOA by phone. During his first term, Whipps repeatedly said 'presence is deterrence,' referring to the increased U.S. military presence in Palau, and characterized the Pacific island country as 'part of the U.S. homeland' when it comes to security. In an interview with VOA last month, Whipps said U.S. protection plays a key role in safeguarding Palau’s territorial integrity. 'Since Palau is small, having the protection of the United States is important because we see what’s happening now in the South China Sea between the Philippines and China,' he said during an interview at his office in Koror, Palau. Since 2023, the Chinese and Philippine coast guards have repeatedly confronted each other at several disputed shoals that both sides claim to be their territories. While Beijing views almost the entire South China Sea as its territorial water, a 2016 ruling by an international arbitration court found that most Chinese claims in the South China Sea were invalid. Beijing refuses to abide by the ruling. While many Palauans support the Whipps administration’s efforts to deepen security ties with the U.S., some political observers say some Palauans are still concerned about the negative impacts associated with the increased U.S. military presence across the Pacific island country. 'Some Palauan people hold this apprehensiveness about the implication of increased U.S. military presence in Palau because they rarely saw U.S. soldiers in military uniforms in the past,' Kambes Kesolei, editor of one of Palau’s main newspapers, Tia Belau, told VOA by phone. 'Some Palauans wonder what they can do to prevent Palau from becoming over-militarized,' he added. In addition to deepening ties with the U.S., some analysts say Palau will maintain its diplomatic ties with Taiwan, which could lead to 'increased coercive pressure' from China. Beijing considers Taiwan part of its territory and has repeatedly vowed to reunite with the island, by force if necessary. 'I expect ties between Palau and Taiwan to remain robust but increasing coercive pressure from the People’s Republic of China, [PRC,] may increase risks for Palau, which will need strong support from the U.S. and like-minded partners to maintain resiliency against PRC coercion,' Parker Novak, a nonresident fellow at the Atlantic Council's Global China Hub, told VOA in a written response. Whipps has accused China of weaponizing tourism against Palau and posing a wide range of threats to the Pacific island country’s national security, including cyberattacks and illegal incursion of Palau’s territorial water by Chinese vessels. 'In 2015 and 2016, tourism numbers from China went through the roof, which helped Palau’s economy grow 30%, but since Palau never switched diplomatic recognition [from Taiwan] to China, that number just basically collapsed in the following years,' Whipps told VOA. In response to questions about Whipps’ claim that China has pressured Palau to sever diplomatic ties with Taiwan, Chinese foreign ministry spokesperson Mao Ning said during a regular press conference on November 4 that only a small number of countries, including Palau, still maintain diplomatic relations with Taiwan. 'China urges these countries to fulfill their obligations under international law, stand on the right side of history, and make right decisions that truly serve their fundamental and long-term interests at an early date,' she said. While Whipps is likely to remain critical of China’s attempt to coerce Palau, Keen in Australia said the Palauan president is not going to completely 'shut the door for China.' 'He is very much wary of how China has used land and tourism to build pressure, but if the investment is in the national interests of Palau, he is willing to consider,' she told VOA.	https://www.voanews.com/a/palau-s-president-secures-2nd-term-amid-attempt-to-navigate-us-china-competition/7859923.html	2024-11-11T09:15:32-08:00	
Human Rights Watch calls for protection force in Sudan as attacks on civilians escalate	Nairobi — A prominent human rights group is calling for the deployment of peacekeepers in Sudan, following a recent wave of attacks on civilians in Al Jazirah state widely blamed on the Rapid Support Forces, one of the warring sides in the country’s ongoing conflict. Human Rights Watch says the situation has become so grim that a mission is needed to protect the population. According to a local pro-democracy group, the Wad Madani Resistance Committee, 169 people have been killed since the violence started in southeastern Jazirah state on Oct. 20. The attacks began after a commander for the Rapid Support Forces defected and joined the Sudanese army. Rights groups report that in response, RSF forces entered villages and towns in the area where the commander was from and carried out targeted killings and abuse. Laetitia Bader, deputy director of Human Rights Watch's Africa division, said the violations have added more problems for a population reeling from more than 18 months of war. 'Sudanese women's rights groups have been documenting cases of sexual violence against women and girls in these towns and villages. And we're talking here about over 30 towns and villages which have been attacked in recent weeks, and these attacks are ongoing,' Bader said. 'It led to massive displacement of the civilian population in an area where people had already fled to and from. So it's just adding to the layers of suffering.' The RSF has denied attacking communities in Jazirah state and has accused Sudanese forces of arming local communities. The RSF and Sudan’s military have been at war since April of last year. Rival generals lead the parties and are locked in a power struggle. Meanwhile, Human Rights Watch and other observers are calling for the deployment of peacekeepers to Jazirah and other parts of Sudan, in hopes of protecting civilians. Getting a presence on the ground could deter further attacks and help monitor humanitarian obstruction, Bader said, and also play a role in bolstering local cease-fire efforts and efforts by emergency response teams to provide assistance. 'Right now the problem is that what is happening at the local level cannot act alone,' Bader added. Ahmed Hashi, a Horn of Africa political and security commentator, said troops are needed, and strong action must be taken against the leaders of the warring groups. 'There is a need to send at least 50,000 United Nations soldiers. There is a need to take the criminal generals to the International Criminal Court and issue a warrant for their arrest,' Hashi said. 'It is important for the United Nations to put its foot down on conflicts because they are going to metastasize into a massive humanitarian catastrophe.' In a report issued last month, the office of U.N. Secretary-General Antonio Guterres expressed shock at the human rights violations often witnessed in Sudan’s western Darfur region being repeated in the Jazirah area. The United Nations Security Council is slated to discuss the report on Sudan later this month.	https://www.voanews.com/a/human-rights-watch-calls-for-protection-force-in-sudan-as-attacks-on-civilians-escalate/7859918.html	2024-11-11T09:11:21-08:00	
Harris appears with Biden for first time since election loss	U.S. President Joe Biden laid a wreath Monday to honor the nation's fallen soldiers on Veterans Day, an event marking his first appearance with Vice President Kamala Harris since her election defeat last week. The ceremony, at historic Arlington National Cemetery across the Potomac River from Washington, is also the first time Harris has been seen in public since her Nov. 6 speech in which she conceded the presidential election to Donald Trump. Democrats, facing a painful reckoning over their drubbing, have begun soul-searching internal discussions — and some not-so-private blaming — over what caused Harris's loss, with some pointing to Biden's initial insistence on running again at age 81, despite having promised to be a bridge president to the next generation. Criticism of Harris herself has been more muted, and Biden heaped praise on Harris last Thursday in a televised White House address. Earlier Monday, Biden hosted veterans at the White House to mark the holiday before heading to Arlington, the final resting place of two presidents, generals from all major U.S. wars, and thousands of other military personnel. Biden and Harris, both dressed in dark suits, placed their hands on their hearts before participating in a wreath-laying ceremony at the Tomb of the Unknown Soldier. The president was to deliver remarks at the cemetery's Memorial Amphitheater. The ceremony comes ahead of Biden hosting Trump at the White House on Wednesday. The Republican has begun naming loyalists to his new administration. He announced he is bringing a hard-line immigration official, Tom Homan, back into the fold to serve as his so-called 'border czar,' and congresswoman Elise Stefanik to be U.S. ambassador to the United Nations. Trump himself has long claimed he is a fierce supporter of America's military, but he has made a series of controversial comments about veterans. His longest-serving White House chief of staff, retired general John Kelly, has said the Republican leader privately disparaged U.S. service members, including describing those who died or were imprisoned defending America as 'suckers' and 'losers.' Trump denies the accusation. But the soon-to-be 47th president has been on record expressing contempt for late American war hero and senator John McCain, who spent years in a Hanoi prison during the Vietnam war.	https://www.voanews.com/a/harris-appears-with-biden-for-first-time-since-election-loss/7859912.html	2024-11-11T09:04:46-08:00	
Israel sees progress in Lebanon cease-fire talks, says Russia can help	Jerusalem/Beirut — Israel said on Monday there was progress in talks about a Lebanon cease-fire and indicated Russia could play a part by stopping Hezbollah rearming via Syria, although the Iran-backed group said it had not received any new truce proposals. Pummeled by Israel's offensive, Hezbollah said diplomatic contacts were under way involving its backers in Tehran, Washington and Moscow, whilst reiterating its readiness to fight on, saying it had enough weapons for a 'long war.' In Jerusalem, Israeli Foreign Minister Gideon Saar said the war against Hezbollah was not yet over. The main challenge facing any cease-fire deal would be enforcement, he said, though there was 'a certain progress' in talks. After previous rounds of fruitless U.S.-led diplomacy to secure a Lebanon truce, the comments indicate renewed focus on the issue as President Joe Biden prepares to leave office in January, with President-elect Donald Trump set to replace him. Hopes of a Gaza truce have meanwhile suffered a setback, with Qatar suspending its mediation role. Ignited by the war in Gaza, the conflict at the Lebanese-Israeli border had been rumbling on for a year before Israel went on the offensive in late September, pounding wide areas of Lebanon with airstrikes and sending troops into the south. Saar, addressing a Jerusalem news conference, said Israel was working with the United States on a cease-fire. Israel wants Hezbollah north of the Litani river – some 30 km from the border - and unable to rearm, he said. Saar said a basic principle for any agreement had to be that Hezbollah would not be able to bring weapons into Lebanon from Syria. 'It is vital to the success of any arrangement in Lebanon,' he said. 'And the Russians are, as you know, present in Syria. And if they are in agreement with this principle, I think they can contribute effectively to this objective.' Russia deployed forces into Syria nearly a decade ago to support President Bashar al-Assad in the civil war there. Hezbollah also sent fighters to help Assad, and carved out big sway on the ground alongside other Iran-backed groups. Syria is widely seen as a major conduit for Iran to supply weapons to Hezbollah in Lebanon, and Israel has struck targets in Syria regularly during the conflict. An Israeli airstrike temporarily cut Syria's main Homs-Damascus highway on Monday, Syrian media reported. In Lebanon, relatives held funerals for 20 people killed in a strike on the southern town of Deir Qanoun-Ras al-Ain, including seven medics from rescue groups affiliated with Hezbollah and its Shiite ally Amal. 'Testing the waters' In Beirut, Hezbollah official Mohammad Afif linked intensified political contacts to the looming change of U.S. leadership. 'There is a great movement between Washington and Moscow and Tehran and a number of capitals,' he said. 'We hear a lot of talk, but so far, according to my information, nothing official has reached Lebanon or us in this regard,' he told a news conference. The contacts were 'in the phase of testing the waters and presenting initial ideas.' Israel Hayom reported on Sunday that substantial progress has been made in diplomatic negotiations over a proposed Lebanon cease-fire that would require Hezbollah to withdraw north of the Litani River, barring its military presence near the Israeli border, while the IDF would return to the international border. Yedioth Ahronoth, Israel's best-selling newspaper, reported on Monday that Israel and Lebanon have exchanged drafts through U.S. envoy Amos Hochstein, signaling progress in efforts to reach a final agreement. The Lebanese government, which includes Hezbollah, has repeatedly called for a cease-fire based on the full implementation of a U.N. resolution that ended a war between the group and Israel in 2006. The resolution calls for the area south of the Litani river to be free of all weapons other than those of the Lebanese state. Lebanon and Israel have accused each other of violating the resolution. Israel says its campaign aims to secure the return home of tens of thousands of people forced to evacuate the north due to rockets fired by Hezbollah, which opened fire on Oct. 8, 2003, in solidarity with Hamas. Israel's offensive has forced more than 1 million people to flee their homes in Lebanon in the last seven weeks. Since the eruption of hostilities a year ago, Israeli attacks have killed more than 3,189 people in Lebanon, the majority of them since late September, according to health ministry figures, which do not distinguish between civilians and combatants. Hezbollah attacks have killed roughly 100 civilians and soldiers in northern Israel, the Israeli-occupied Golan Heights, and southern Lebanon over the last year.	https://www.voanews.com/a/israel-sees-progress-in-lebanon-cease-fire-talks-says-russia-can-help/7859720.html	2024-11-11T07:15:26-08:00	
Trump taps Stefanik to be UN Ambassador	Washington — Donald Trump has chosen Republican Representative Elise Stefanik to serve as U.S. ambassador to the United Nations, the president-elect said in a statement shared with Reuters on Monday. 'I am honored to nominate Chairwoman Elise Stefanik to serve in my Cabinet as U.S. Ambassador to the United Nations. Elise is an incredibly strong, tough, and smart America First fighter,' Trump said. Stefanik, a New York representative and House Republican Conference chair, has been a fierce Trump ally. She could not be immediately reached for comment. Trump said Saturday that former Republican presidential contender Nikki Haley and former Secretary of State Mike Pompeo will not be asked to join his administration. Haley served as the U.S. ambassador to the United Nations under Trump during his previous term and had endorsed Trump for president despite having criticized him harshly when she ran against him in the party primaries. Trump is meeting with potential candidates to serve in his administration before his Jan. 20 inauguration as president. Reuters reported Friday that Trump has also met with prominent investor Scott Bessent, who is a potential U.S. Treasury Secretary nominee.	https://www.voanews.com/a/trump-taps-stefanik-to-be-un-ambassador-/7859706.html	2024-11-11T06:59:43-08:00

Locals move to protect Chile's giant desert geoglyphs scarred by off-roaders	IQUIQUE, Chile — Over a thousand years ago, the hundreds of giant geoglyphs carved into the desert in northern Chile were a bustling scene. They marked sources of water in the vast arid landscape and were where locals came together to trade skins, animals and fish. Now the carvings are scarred with hundreds of tire tracks from motorcycles and off-road vehicles tearing through the art creations in the landscape and permanently disfiguring them. 'It's practically destroyed by motorcycles, off-roaders,' said Jose Barraza, general director of the regional national patrimony office. He said various groups were trying to preserve the site to prevent any more destruction - but also without restoring it to its former glory, to show the error of people's ways in the future. '[It] will be an example that shows future generations what not to do with our heritage, no matter how painful or how much anger, discomfort or resentment we feel towards it,' he said. Local resident Angelo Araya says the community has been working with a local museum and authorities to try and 'put an end to the destruction.' The goal, Araya says, is to stop motorcycle and off-road vehicles from damaging the site further and 'to make everyone aware that this is not just a heritage site, but that it belongs to all of us.' The site has gone through many phases, going from a place to barter, to an abandoned site, to one where people were looking for gold. Eventually Chile's national forests association CONAF turned the area into part of the Pampa del Tamarugal National Reserve. Sand board instructor Franco Diaz said the government should physically close off access to the sites as the geoglyphs are difficult to spot. 'If a jeep driver goes behind the hill, he won't notice if there's a geoglyph,' Diaz said. 'They should close the perimeter and protect these sites that are over 1,000 years old.'	https://www.voanews.com/a/locals-move-to-protect-chile-s-giant-desert-geoglyphs-scarred-by-off-roaders-/7859550.html	2024-11-11T04:32:17-08:00	
Mauritius prime minister says party is headed for defeat in Sunday's vote	PORT LOUIS — Mauritius incumbent prime minister Pravind Jugnauth said on Monday that his political alliance was headed for a huge defeat following Sunday's parliamentary election. 'L'Alliance Lepep is heading towards a huge defeat. I have tried to do what I can for the country and the population. The population has decided to choose another team. I wish good luck to the country,' Jugnauth told reporters. Voters went to the polls to elect lawmakers for the 62 seats in parliament for the next five years, from a list of 68 parties and five political alliances. Whichever party or coalition gets more than half the seats in parliament also wins the prime minister's post.	https://www.voanews.com/a/mauritius-prime-minister-says-party-is-headed-for-defeat-in-sunday-s-vote/7859534.html	2024-11-11T04:05:22-08:00	
17 Chadian soldiers and 96 rebels killed in a Boko Haram attack, army says	N'DJAMENA — Boko Haram insurgents killed 17 Chadian soldiers in a weekend attack on a military post that also left 96 of the assailants dead in the country's west, Chad's army said. The attack in the Lake Chad region happened on Saturday, army spokesperson Gen. Issakh Acheikh said on national television Sunday night. He did not provide details. The Lake Chad region has been plagued this year by frequent attacks from insurgents, including Boko Haram and the Islamic State in West Africa. It has revived fears of violence after a period of peace following a successful operation launched in 2020 by the Chadian army to destroy the extremist groups' bases. Last month, 40 soldiers were killed during an attack on a military base, prompting President Mahamat Deby Itno to launch an operation to dislodge Boko Haram militants from Lake Chad. In March, an attack the government blamed on Boko Haram killed seven soldiers. Boko Haram, which launched an insurgency more than a decade ago against Western education, seeks to establish Islamic law in Nigeria’s northeast. The insurgency has spread to West African neighbors including Cameroon, Niger and Chad. Chad, a country of nearly 18 million people, has been reeling from political turmoil before and after a controversial presidential election that resulted in Deby Itno’s victory. He had led the country as interim president during the period of military rule that followed the death of his father in 2021.	https://www.voanews.com/a/chadian-soldiers-and-96-rebels-killed-in-a-boko-haram-attack-army-says/7859520.html	2024-11-11T03:52:19-08:00	
Pakistan limits outdoor activities, market hours to curb air pollution-related illness	LAHORE, Pakistan — Pakistan's Punjab province banned most outdoor activities and ordered shops, markets and malls in some areas to close early from Monday to curb illnesses caused by intense air pollution. The province has already closed educational institutions and public spaces like parks and zoos until Nov. 17 in places including Lahore, the world's most polluted city in terms of air quality, according to Swiss group IQAir's live ratings. The districts of Lahore, Multan, Faisalabad, and Gujranwala have seen an unprecedented rise in patients with respiratory diseases, eye and throat irritation, and pink eye disease, the Punjab government said in an order issued late on Sunday. The new restrictions would also remain in force until Nov. 17, it said. 'The spread of conjunctivitis/ pink eye disease due to bacterial or viral infection, smoke, dust or chemical exposure is posing a serious and imminent threat to public health,' it said. While outdoor activities including outdoor sports events, exhibitions and festivals, and outdoor dining at restaurants have been prohibited, 'unavoidable religious rites' are exempt from this direction, the order said. Some outlets like pharmacies, oil depots, dairy shops, and fruit and vegetable shops have similarly been exempted from the broad directions, and to close by 8 p.m. local time. Lahore's air quality remained hazardous on Monday, with an index score of more than 600, according to IQAir, but this was significantly lower than the 1,900 that it touched in some places earlier this month. A score of 0-50 is considered 'good.' Several parts of South Asia are engulfed by a toxic haze each winter as cold air traps dust, emissions, and smoke from farm fires. Punjab has blamed its particularly toxic air this year on pollution wafting in from India, where northern parts have also been battling hazardous air, and has said it will take the issue up with the neighboring country through its foreign ministry. India's Supreme Court on Monday directed the Delhi government to decide by Nov. 25 on imposing a 'perpetual ban' on firecrackers, legal news portal Bar and Bench reported. Firecrackers set off by revelers on Diwali, the Hindu festival of lights that was celebrated on Oct. 31 this year despite a ban, has aggravated the region's pollution problem.	https://www.voanews.com/a/pakistan-limits-outdoor-activities-market-hours-to-curb-air-pollution-related-illness-/7859510.html	2024-11-11T03:35:52-08:00	
Houthis fire missile toward Israeli base	An intercepted missile fired from Yemen sparked blazes near Jerusalem Monday, and later the Houthi rebels said they carried out a successful attack on central Israel. The Iran-backed militant group said it executed a 'military operation targeting the Nahal Sorek military base' southeast of Jaffa, and that the 'hit was accurate and led to a fire.' Meanwhile, the main television news outlet operated by the Houthis said U.S. and British forces carried out a series of airstrikes targeting the Amran and Saada governorates in Yemen. The Israeli military told Agence France-Presse a projectile from Yemen was intercepted in the Bet Shemesh area west of Jerusalem, and debris from that interception caused fires. In a statement to the AFP, it said: 'Following the sirens that sounded in the Shfelat Yehuda, Yehuda, and Lakhish areas of central Israel, the IAF (Israeli Air Force) intercepted one projectile that approached Israel from the direction of Yemen. 'The projectile did not cross into Israeli territory. Sirens were sounded in accordance with protocol.' An Iran-backed coalition, the Islamic Resistance in Iraq, claimed to have carried out four drone attacks on 'vital targets' in Israel Monday, but did not disclose details about the targets in a series of Telegram posts. Strikes in Gaza, Lebanon At least three people were killed Sunday when an Israeli strike hit a tent sheltering a displaced family in the central Gaza Strip, Palestinian health officials reported. Palestinians reported heavy bombing late Sunday in the western areas of Nuseirat camp, and least 24 people were wounded and taken to the Awda hospital in Nuseirat, the head of the hospital’s ambulance service told the Associated Press. Earlier Sunday in northern Gaza, an Israeli strike on a home sheltering displaced people in the urban refugee camp of Jabaliya killed at least 17 people including nine women, according to Dr. Fadel Naim, director of Al-Ahly Hospital in Gaza City. An Israeli airstrike killed at least 23 people, including seven children, in Aalmat village north of Beirut, far from the areas in the east and south where Hezbollah militants have a major presence. Lebanon's health ministry said another six people were wounded. There was no Israeli evacuation warning and no immediate Israeli comment on the attack. The United Nations children’s agency says the war between Israel and Hezbollah has killed more than 200 children in Lebanon. Lebanon’s Health Ministry said at least 3,189 people have been killed and over 14,000 wounded in Lebanon in more than a year of conflict between Israel and the Hezbollah militant group. Some 1.2 million people have been displaced. The war in Gaza was triggered when Hamas-led militants stormed into southern Israel on Oct. 7, 2023, killing about 1,200 people, mostly civilians, and abducting about 250. Some 100 hostages are still inside Gaza, although about one-third of them are believed to be dead. Israel's counteroffensive has killed more than 43,000 Palestinians, more than half of them women and children, according to local health authorities. The Israeli military says the death toll includes thousands of Hamas militants. Hamas has been designated as a terrorist organization by the United States, the United Kingdom, European Union and others. Israeli President Isaac Herzog is scheduled to meet with outgoing U.S. President Joe Biden on Tuesday in Washington as the mid-month deadline approaches for Israel to meet a Biden administration ultimatum that it allow more humanitarian aid into Gaza to assist Palestinians or risk possible restrictions on U.S. military funding. Information from The Associated Press, Agence France-Presse and Reuters was included in this report.	https://www.voanews.com/a/houthis-fire-missile-toward-israeli-base-/7859492.html	2024-11-11T03:24:06-08:00	
Taiwan closes exploding pagers case, says not made by Taiwanese firms	Taipei, Taiwan — Taiwan on Monday said it had closed a probe into pagers that exploded in Lebanon in September and caused a deadly blow to Iran-backed Hezbollah, saying no Taiwanese citizens or companies were involved. Israeli media reported that Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu claimed responsibility for the attack during a cabinet meeting, telling ministers that senior defense officials and political figures were opposed to the detonation of the pagers but that he went ahead with the operation. Security sources have previously said the pagers carried the name of Taiwan-based Gold Apollo, a company which has asserted that it did not make them. Taiwan's government has also said the pagers were not made in Taiwan. Taipei prosecutors, who were investigating the case, said in a statement the AR-924 pager model that exploded in Lebanon was manufactured, traded, and shipped by a firm called Frontier Group Entity, and made outside of Taiwan. They added, however, that Gold Apollo had authorized the company to use the Apollo trademark. 'There is no evidence indicating that any domestic manufacturers or individuals were accomplices in the relevant explosions, violating the Counter-Terrorism Financing Act, or engaging in other illegal activities,' the prosecutors said in a statement. 'No concrete evidence of criminal activity has been discovered in this case, nor have any specific individuals been implicated in any criminal activity, following a comprehensive investigation.' Prosecutors have previously confirmed that they questioned Gold Apollo's president and founder Hsu Ching-kuang and a woman called Teresa Wu, the sole employee of a company called Apollo Systems Ltd. In their statement, the prosecutors said Wu acted as a liaison with Frontier, but there was no evidence she 'had prior knowledge or participated in any conspiracy or collaboration related to the explosion incidents.' The prosecutors said there was some information they did not know, including the exact identities of the Frontier employees Wu communicated with. It said one person was called 'T' and was presumably the head of Frontier, while another was called 'M' and was presumably the sales director. Gold Apollo told Reuters it had also just seen the prosecutor’s statement, and that it was not immediately able to comment further.	https://www.voanews.com/a/taiwan-closes-exploding-pagers-case-says-not-made-by-taiwanese-firms/7859489.html	2024-11-11T03:10:19-08:00

Ukraine on high alert, Russian troops amass near Kursk	While Ukraine was on high alert for air attacks on Monday, the country’s top military commander said tens of thousands of Russian troops were ready to advance on the Kursk region. 'Following the order of their military leadership, they are trying to dislodge our troops and advance deep into the territory we control,' Ukraine’s General Oleksandr Syrskyi wrote on the Telegram messaging app. Ukraine launched an incursion into Kursk in August, taking control of a number of towns and villages in the border region. Meanwhile, at least six people were killed in air attacks in southern Ukraine – five in Mykolaiv and one in Zaporizhzhia, where a residential building was destroyed, regional governors reported. At least a dozen people were injured in Zaporizhzhia, including five children between the ages of 4 and 17. Earlier, the Ukrainian air force put the nation on high alert for a large-scale missile attack, reporting that a large number of bombers were taking off from Russia and heading to Ukraine. 'The air alert is related to the launch of cruise missiles from Tu-95MS strategic bombers,' the air force said on its Telegram channels. Power was cut to prevent further damage from attacks, and people were encouraged to seek shelter – including in Kyiv’s metro stations. But by 0630 GMT the missiles had not arrived. According to some Ukrainian military bloggers, the Russian bombers performed flights imitating the launch of missiles, Reuters reported. Report: Trump urges Putin not to escalate The Washington Post and Reuters reported that U.S. President-elect Donald Trump spoke to Russian leader Vladimir Putin and urged him not to escalate the war in Ukraine. Trump, calling from his Mar-a-Lago estate in Florida on Thursday, reminded Putin of America's sizable military presence in Europe, the Washington Post reported. Sources familiar with the call told the newspaper Trump expressed an interest in further conversations to discuss 'the resolution of Ukraine's war soon.' Steven Cheung, Trump's communications director, did not confirm the exchange, saying in a written statement to AFP that 'we do not comment on private calls between President Trump and other world leaders.' The Russian embassy in Washington did not immediately respond to a request for comment, Reuters reported. Information from Reuters and Agence France-Presse was included in this report.	https://www.voanews.com/a/ukraine-on-high-alert-russian-troops-amass-near-kursk/7859440.html	2024-11-11T01:21:38-08:00	
The Singles' Day shopping festival loses its shine under China's lagging economy	HONG KONG — Merchants and consumers alike found the Singles' Day shopping festival Monday less shiny than in years past as e-commerce firms look abroad for growth. The annual event named by the numeric form of its Nov. 11 date was started by e-commerce platform Alibaba, which offered attractive discounts to entice shoppers to spend big. The extravaganza has since expanded to other platforms like JD.com and Pinduoduo in China as well as abroad. While Singles’ Day was previously a one-day event, shopping platforms in China now kickstart the festival weeks ahead to drum up sales volume. The festival has also traditionally been regarded as a barometer of consumer sentiment. But amid China’s lagging domestic economy, dragged down by a real estate crisis and deflationary pressures, consumers no longer go all out on purchases during the shopping extravaganza. 'I only spent a few hundred yuan on daily necessities,' said Wang Haihua, who owns a fitness center in Beijing. Wang said that the prices offered on e-commerce platforms during Singles’ Day are not necessarily cheaper than usual. 'They’re all tricks and we’ve seen through it over the years,' she said. Zhang Jiewei, a 34-year-old who runs a barber shop in Xi’an city, echoed Wang’s sentiments, saying that he no longer trust Singles’ Day promotions as some merchants tend to raise the usual price of a product before offering a discount, giving consumers the illusion they are getting a deal. 'I used to buy a lot two or three years ago and I even purchased a mobile phone (during Singles’ Day),' he said. 'I stopped doing that following the pandemic because of less income. I am not going to buy anything this year,' Zhang added. Some experts say that Beijing’s recent stimulus measures have had little impact to boost consumer confidence. 'People are not interested in spending and are cutting back on big-ticket items,' said Shaun Rein, founder and managing director of China Market Research Group in Shanghai. 'Since October 2022, the weak economy means that everything has been on discount year-round, 11.11 is not going to bring in more discounts that the month before.' Rein said he expects low growth for the Singles’ Day shopping festival as consumers tighten their spending in anticipation of difficult economic times ahead. Categories such as sportswear and fitness, however, have been doing well as customers 'trade down a Gucci bag for Lululemon sportswear,' he said. Platforms like JD.com and Alibaba, which operates e-commerce platforms Taobao and Tmall, previously used to publish the value of transactions made during the festival, but have since stopped revealing the total figure. While yearly growth used to be in the double digits, estimates of recent figures have dwindled to low single-digit growth. Syntun, a data provider, estimated that last year’s gross merchandising volume sales across major e-commerce platforms grew just 2% to $156.40 billion, a far cry from double-digit growth before COVID-19. Merchants who typically take part in the Singles’ Day shopping festivals say the costs of participation no longer pay off, amid high advertising fees and unsatisfactory sales. Zhao Gao, who owns a garment factory in eastern Zhejiang province, said that after paying advertising costs to e-commerce platforms he would only break even after sales. 'The platforms have so many rules for promotions and customers have become more skeptical,' he said. 'As a merchant, I no longer participate in the Singles’ Day promotions.' Another merchant, Du Baonian who runs a food company processing mutton in Inner Mongolia, said that overall sales in the past year have fallen 15% as consumers downgraded and reduced consumption. Du said that while he still takes part in the Singles’ Day promotions, the higher expenses do not typically generate returns because of sluggish sales. 'We are seeing shrinking revenue, but advertisement on the platform can help us to maintain our leading sales position,' he said, adding that he was considering advertising on more e-commerce platforms to target more consumers. Meanwhile, e-commerce platforms grappling with a slowing domestic market have also turned to overseas markets to seek new growth, offering promotions like global free shipping and allowing merchants to sell globally with ease. Alibaba, for example, said in a blog post on its Alizila site that some 70,000 merchants saw sales double with global free shipping. In markets like Singapore and Hong Kong, new customers also doubled, Alibaba said.	https://www.voanews.com/a/the-singles-day-shopping-festival-loses-its-shine-under-china-s-lagging-economy-/7859428.html	2024-11-11T00:36:28-08:00	
I got my life back': Veterans with PTSD making progress thanks to service dog program	KANSAS CITY, Kan. — After working at a crowded and dangerous internment camp in Iraq, Air Force Staff Sgt. Heather O'Brien brought home with her anxiety and post-traumatic stress disorder. A bouncy labradoodle and a Kansas City-area program helped her get back on her feet. Dogs 4 Valor, operated through the Olathe, Kansas-based organization called The Battle Within, helps retired veterans and first responders work with their service dogs to help manage depression, anxiety and other challenges. 'A lot of times the veteran with severe PTSD is homebound,' said Sandra Sindeldecker, program manager for Dogs 4 Valor. 'They’re isolated. They’re very nervous. They won’t make eye contact. Some won’t leave the house at all.' The program involves both group and one-on-one training. The goal is to get the veteran and the dog comfortable with each other and understanding each other. The group takes outings to help the veterans regain their footing in public places like airports. Program leaders also provide mental health therapy at no cost. The veterans and dogs graduate in six to nine months, but group gatherings continue. O'Brien, 40, recalled that the camp where she worked in Iraq sometimes had over 20,000 detainees. Violence and rioting were common and it left her with severe anxiety. 'When I got out of the military, I just assumed that you’re supposed to be on edge all the time as a veteran,' O’Brien said. O’Brien’s mother spotted the frisky lab-poodle mix on Facebook and convinced her daughter to adopt the dog she named Albus. Months later, O'Brien learned about Dogs 4 Valor, and the pair joined the program in October 2023. Now, O’Brien said she can get back out in public — she even went on vacation to Branson, Missouri, 'things that I never would have thought I would do really, probably ever again.' Mark Atkinson, 38, served in Afghanistan as a corporal in the Marine Corps. He returned home with PTSD and major depressive disorder, causing sleeplessness and anxiety. He adopted Lexi, now 5, in 2020. Lexi, a muscular cane corso breed, needed Atkinson as much as he needed her. Her previous owner had kept Lexi on chains before surrendering her. Since joining Dogs 4 Valor, the two can get out together and enjoy life. 'I don’t really like leaving the house because I’m safe there, you know?' Atkinson said. 'And having Lexi has just made me get out to be more social.' Having a group of fellow veterans facing the same challenges has also helped, Atkinson said. 'We come from the same backgrounds, different branches,' Atkinson said. 'Same issues. You know, PTSD or traumatic brain injuries. And they’re all very welcoming as well. There’s no judgment.' O’Brien compared living with Albus to a relationship with a sometimes pushy best friend who often wants to go out. 'The best friend constantly wants to make you do things that make you nervous,' O’Brien laughed, acknowledging that it is ultimately up to her. 'I have to decide to walk out and just deal with life,' O'Brien said. 'And so that has been hard. And it still is hard from time to time, but it’s it’s getting manageable.' Some veterans said their family relationships have improved since they started the program. 'I’m able to talk, not fly off the handle and just get along with people and not be as stressed, not have as much anxiety,' Atkinson said. 'Or even if I do, she (Lexi) is right there with me.' Timothy Siebenmorgen, 61, said his relationships also are better with help from his 1-year-old American bulldog, Rosie, and Dogs 4 Valor, which he joined in July. He served in both the Marines and Army, deploying 18 times. 'You’re in the military, kind of taught not to show weakness,' Siebenmorgen said. 'So you figure you can tackle everything yourself and you honestly believe that. And then you realize you can’t do it on your own.' Veterans said the dogs, and the program, have given them new hope and a renewed ability to move forward. 'I got my life back,' O’Brien said.	https://www.voanews.com/a/i-got-my-life-back-veterans-with-ptsd-making-progress-thanks-to-service-dog-program-/7859423.html	2024-11-11T00:13:05-08:00	
Web Summit kicks off in Lisbon as tech leaders weigh Trump’s return	LISBON, PORTUGAL — Lisbon will this week play host to Europe’s biggest annual tech conference, Web Summit, where industry leaders and lawmakers will weigh the pros and cons of Donald Trump’s return to the White House. Senior executives from firms such as Apple, Microsoft, and Meta will join high-ranking officials from Europe for debates about the future of artificial intelligence, social media regulation, and the impact a second Trump presidency may have on the continent. Trump has previously promised he could end the war between Ukraine and Russia within 24 hours of taking office. Days after Trump's re-election, two senior Ukrainian government officials, Alex Bornyakov and Mykhailo Fedorov, will take to the stage to discuss how the country has continued innovating in the face of conflict. John Adam, chief revenue officer at software development firm Aimsoftpro, is among those attending. About 70% of the company’s workforce is still based in Ukraine, with the rest having relocated around Europe after the war’s outbreak in 2022. 'There’s mixed feelings because the Trump approach looks like it’s more geared towards the present lines of conflict, which is not an ideal scenario for Ukraine, and there’s a reluctance to accept that. At the same time, we would like this to have an endpoint,' he said. The X factor While not expected to attend, tech billionaire and vocal Trump supporter Elon Musk will be a recurring theme, from his role in Ukraine via satellite service Starlink to his success with space exploration firm SpaceX and controversial stewardship of social media platform X, formerly Twitter. One panel will debate how Europe might develop a homegrown rival to SpaceX; another whether Musk 'destroyed Twitter.' Joe Benarroch, who quit his role as X’s de facto spokesperson and head of business operations in June, will join a panel titled 'What to do about social media.' While the EU has tried forcing online platforms to clamp down on harmful content, Trump’s election may lead to them reducing moderation efforts, according to Mark Weinstein, founder of privacy-focused social media platform MeWe, who will share the stage with Benarroch on Wednesday. 'Historically, Trump has been highly critical of online moderation,' he said. 'To avoid political retribution, major social networks are likely to continue the trend of becoming significantly more permissive with content they allow on their platforms.'	https://www.voanews.com/a/web-summit-kicks-off-in-lisbon-as-tech-leaders-weigh-trump-s-return/7859398.html	2024-11-10T22:51:48-08:00	
Vietnam says Temu, Shein must register with government or be blocked	HANOI, VIETNAM — Vietnam said Chinese online retailers Shein and Temu need to register with the government before the end of November or it will block their internet domains and apps from being used in the country. Vietnam's government and local businesses have expressed concern about the impact of Chinese online platforms on local markets due to deep discounting. The trade ministry has also said it is worried about the potential for the sale of counterfeit items. Nguyen Hoang Long, Vietnam's deputy trade minister, told a government meeting at the weekend that the ministry had worked with both Shein and Temu on the licensing matter. 'After the ministry's notification, if these platforms do not comply, the Ministry of Industry and Trade will coordinate with relevant agencies to implement technical measures such as blocking applications and domains,' Long said in a government statement. Shein and Temu did not respond immediately to a request for comment. Fast-fashion retailer Shein has been selling into Vietnam for at least two years, while Temu, owned by Chinese e-commerce giant PDD Holdings, started allowing users in Vietnam to shop last month. Vietnam allows imported goods of up to $40 to be exempt from a value-added tax. The finance ministry said most items benefiting from this tax break are imported via e-commerce platforms and it is considering terminating the tax break. Both Temu and Shein are also facing increased scrutiny and legal challenges elsewhere. Last month, Indonesia requested Apple and Google block Temu from their app stores to protect small merchants from competing with ultra-cheap items. Vietnam's e-commerce market has grown 18% this year to be worth $22 billion, the third-largest in Southeast Asia behind Indonesia and Thailand, according to a report by Google, Temasek and Bain & Company released last week. Other e-commerce platforms that operate in Vietnam include Singapore-based Shoppe, Alibaba-backed Lazada and domestic companies Tiki and Sendo.	https://www.voanews.com/a/vietnam-says-temu-shein-must-register-with-government-or-be-blocked/7859396.html	2024-11-10T22:42:57-08:00	
Trump and trade worries cloud COP29 climate summit in Azerbaijan	Baku, Azerbaijan — The annual U.N. climate summit kicks off Monday with countries readying for tough talks on finance and trade, following a year of weather disasters that have emboldened developing countries in their demands for climate cash. Delegates gathering in Azerbaijan's capital of Baku are hoping to resolve the summit's top agenda item – a deal for up to $1 trillion in annual climate finance for developing countries. The summit's negotiating priorities, however, are competing for governments' resources and attention against economic concerns, wars in Ukraine and Gaza and last week's U.S. re-election of Donald Trump, a climate-change denier, as president of the world's biggest economy. COP29 host Azerbaijan will be tasked with keeping countries focused on agreeing to a new global finance target to replace the current $100 billion pledge expiring this year. The Caspian Sea nation, often proud of being home to the world's first oil wells, will also be under pressure to show progress from last year's COP28 pledge to transition away from fossil fuels. The country's oil and gas revenues accounted for 35% of its economy in 2023, down from 50% two years prior. The government says these revenues will continue to decline, to roughly 32% of its GDP this year and 22% by 2028. Before the summit talks can even begin, countries will need to agree on an agenda by consensus – including an 11th-hour proposal by China to bring trade disputes into the mix. The Chinese proposal - made on behalf of the fast-developing 'BASIC' group of countries including Brazil, India and South Africa - asked for the summit to address 'restrictive trade measures' such as the EU's carbon border tariffs going into effect in 2026. Those concerns have been compounded by Trump's campaign promise to impose 20% tariffs on all foreign goods – and 60% on Chinese goods. China's request showed it was flexing power following Trump's re-election, which signaled the United States' likely disengagement from global climate cooperation, said Li Shuo, director of China Climate Hub at the Asia Society Policy Institute. Trump has called climate change a hoax and vowed to withdraw the U.S. from the Paris Agreement, the global treaty to reduce planet-warming emissions. The European Union, along with current U.S. President Joe Biden's administration, have been pressing China and Gulf oil nations to join the pool of climate finance donor countries. 'If the EU wants to talk about climate finance with China, if it wants to talk NDCs, part of the conversation should be how to resolve our differences on trade and your tariffs,' Shuo said. Extreme pressure With this year on track to be the hottest on record, experts noted that climate extremes were now challenging rich and poor countries alike – from flooding disasters in Africa, coastal Spain and the U.S. state of North Carolina, to drought gripping South America, Mexico and the U.S. West. Most countries are not prepared. 'Election results don't alter the laws of physics,' said Kaveh Guilanpour, vice president for international strategies at the nonprofit Center for Climate and Energy Solutions. 'Unless the world collectively steps up its efforts, the impacts of climate change will become increasingly severe and frequent and will be felt by an increasing number of people in all countries, including in the United States.' Many in Baku were worried that a U.S. disengagement could lead other countries to backpedal on past climate pledges or to scale back future ambitions.	https://www.voanews.com/a/trump-and-trade-worries-cloud-cop29-climate-summit-in-azerbaijan/7859394.html	2024-11-10T22:35:24-08:00	
Taiwan businessman Tsao to sue Chinese officials over sanctions	TAIPEI, TAIWAN — Taiwanese businessman Robert Tsao said on Monday he would sue in a Taiwan court senior Chinese officials over sanctions they had placed on him, saying he was seeking to counter China's intimidation of lawful activity. China, which claims Taiwan as its own territory, last month said it would punish and sanction Tsao, the retired founder of chipmaker UMC, for alleged criminal and pro-Taiwan independence activities. China's Taiwan Affairs Office said the 'Black Bear Academy' that Tsao has helped fund was seeking to incite separatism that would endanger cross-strait ties. Tsao, one of Taiwan's richest men who has pledged to provide millions to two civilian defense training programs, told a press conference that China was threatening the lawful holding of political views in Taiwan, and his personal safety. The lawsuit will be lodged in a Taipei court against Song Tao, head of China's Taiwan Affairs Office, and also the office's spokesperson Chen Binhua. Taiwan courts have no jurisdiction in China and senior Chinese officials do not visit the island. China's Taiwan Affairs Office did not respond to a request for comment. Cheng Wen-lung, one of Tsao's lawyers, said they understood that neither Song nor Chen would come to Taiwan and there would be no way of enforcing any judgment, but the case was about sending a message to Beijing, given it has been seeking to use legal means to put pressure on Taiwanese persons it does not like. 'Legally, we have to do this,' Cheng said. 'Taiwan is in a difficult spot, but we have to work hard. You cannot not do anything.' Tsao's team is also looking at suing in a U.S. court under that country's Alien Tort Claims Act. China's announcement against Tsao came as the country's military staged a day of war games around Taiwan it said were a warning to 'separatist acts.' Taiwan's government rejects Beijing's sovereignty claims. UMC says Tsao has nothing to do with the company any longer having retired a decade ago.	https://www.voanews.com/a/taiwan-businessman-tsao-to-sue-chinese-officials-over-sanctions/7859378.html	2024-11-10T21:23:02-08:00	
China clamps down on quest for soup dumplings by 'Night Riding Army'	BEIJING — Police in central China imposed traffic curbs at the weekend to halt a viral craze in which thousands of university students borrowed shared bikes to ride overnight to the city of Kaifeng in search of breakfast. The 'Night Riding Army,' as some participants described it, clogged a highway on Friday, pictures posted on social media showed, a surge in turnout for a rolling flash mob that had been gathering riders for months. 'Last night's 'Night Riding Army' was spectacular!' one rider posted. 'Two lanes were opened, but that simply was not enough: The cycling army accounted for four!' The event was part of a trend of young Chinese traveling on the cheap - 'like special forces' - and spending as little as possible at a time of scarce job prospects, when wages are under pressure. The riders traveled on a straight road more than 60 km (37 miles) long beside the Yellow River that links Zhengzhou, the largest city in Henan province, with Kaifeng, an ancient capital famed for its soup dumplings. The trend was set off in June, Chinese media said, after four women college students chronicled their ride on social media to eat dumplings in the morning. 'The Night Ride to Kaifeng: Youth is priceless, enjoy it in time,' was the hashtag on social media for the ride, which state broadcaster CMG said tens of thousands of students had completed by the weekend. Key to its success was a glut of shared bikes, which can be rented for as little as $1.95 a month. Pictures posted by riders showed thousands of the bikes had overrun downtown Kaifeng by Saturday. In addition to the traffic controls, the largest bike-sharing platforms, Hellobike, DiDi Bike, and Mobile, said their vehicles would lock down if ridden out of a designated zone, while media told the students to grow up. 'Youthful freedom does not mean following the trend and indulging oneself,' one news outlet admonished in a comment. 'Kaifeng is worth arriving slowly and savoring carefully,' read the headline of another. Chinese authorities have cracked down on other spontaneous gatherings. Last month, police turned out in force in the commercial hub of Shanghai to deter a repeat of 2023 Halloween celebrations in which some revelers wore costumes poking fun at issues such as the stock market, youth unemployment and tough COVID-19 curbs.	https://www.voanews.com/a/china-clamps-down-on-quest-for-soup-dumplings-by-night-riding-army-/7859376.html	2024-11-10T21:08:46-08:00	
Storm-weary Philippines evacuates thousands as another typhoon hits	MANILA, Philippines — A new typhoon barreled across an agricultural region in the northeastern Philippines on Monday after thousands were evacuated to safety while still struggling to recover from the devastation caused by three successive storms in the last three weeks. Typhoon Toraji slammed into northeastern Aurora province and was forecast to blow over the mountainous Luzon region, where President Ferdinand Marcos Jr. — just the day before — inspected the damage from the last storm and led the distribution of food packs to residents in Cagayan and Ilocos provinces. Marcos skipped this week's Asia-Pacific Cooperation forum in Peru to oversee recovery efforts from back-to-back storms. After making landfall in Aurora on Monday morning with sustained winds of up to 130 kilometers (81 miles) per hour and gusts of up to 180 kph (112 mph), the typhoon was expected to barrel northwestward across Luzon, weaken as it crosses a mountain range and then blow into the South China Sea. Interior Secretary Jonvic Remulla on Sunday ordered the forcible evacuation of people in 2,500 villages expected to be lashed by Toraji, locally named Nika, warning that the rain-soaked Luzon mountains, valleys and plains were more susceptible to flash floods and landslides. With the typhoon approaching fast, there was little time to move large numbers of people to safety, he said. 'We understand if some would want to stay, but we have to get them out,' Remulla told reporters. The military said its disaster-response forces have been deployed near high-risk areas and were standing by for new contingencies. It added that it suspended combat drills in the north due to the weather. 'Our commitment remains steadfast in safeguarding and assisting our countrymen specially in times of disaster,' Armed Forces of the Philippines spokesperson Col. Francel Margareth Padilla said. Schools were shut down, inter-island ferry services and domestic flights were suspended in provinces in or near the path of the typhoon, the 14th weather disturbance to batter the Philippine archipelago this year. Forecasters said they were monitoring another brewing storm in the Pacific that could affect the country if it strengthens. The last two typhoons and a tropical storm caused more than 160 deaths, damaged thousands of houses and farmlands and affected more than 9 million people, including hundreds of thousands who fled to emergency shelters, after dumping from one to two months' worth of rain in just 24 hours in some cities and towns. Overwhelmed, the Philippines received help from Southeast Asian countries led by Singapore, along with longtime treaty ally the United States, to transport food, water and other aid to hard-hit northern provinces. The Philippine archipelago is often battered by typhoons and earthquakes and has more than a dozen active volcanoes, making it one of the most natural disaster-prone countries in the world. In 2013, Typhoon Haiyan, one of the strongest recorded tropical cyclones, left more than 7,300 people dead or missing, flattened entire villages and caused ships to run aground and smash into houses in the central Philippines.	https://www.voanews.com/a/storm-weary-philippines-evacuates-thousands-as-another-typhoon-hits/7859360.html	2024-11-10T19:32:53-08:00

Trump pressures candidates for Senate Republican leader to fill Cabinet quickly	WASHINGTON — Days before Senate Republicans pick their new leader, President-elect Donald Trump is pressuring the candidates to change the rules and empower him to appoint some nominees without a Senate vote. Republican Sens. John Thune of South Dakota, John Cornyn of Texas and Rick Scott of Florida are running in a secret ballot election Wednesday to lead the GOP conference and replace longtime Republican leader Mitch McConnell, who is stepping aside from the job after almost two decades. All three have courted Trump's support in the race, vying to show who is the closest to the president-elect as they campaign to become majority leader. Trump has not endorsed any candidate in the race, but Sunday he made clear that he expects the new leader to go around regular Senate order, if necessary, to allow him to fill his Cabinet quickly. In a statement on X and Truth Social, Trump said that the next leader 'must agree' to allow him to make appointments when the chamber is on recess, bypassing a confirmation vote. 'Any Republican Senator seeking the coveted LEADERSHIP position in the United States Senate must agree to Recess Appointments (in the Senate!), without which we will not be able to get people confirmed in a timely manner,' Trump posted, adding that positions should be filled 'IMMEDIATELY!' The Senate has not allowed presidents to make so-called recess appointments since a 2014 Supreme Court ruling limited the president's power to do so. Since then, the Senate has held brief 'pro-forma' sessions when it is out of town for more than 10 days so that a president cannot take advantage of the absence and start filling posts that have not been confirmed. But with Trump's approval paramount in the race, all three candidates quickly suggested that they might be willing to reconsider the practice. Scott replied to Trump, '100% agree. I will do whatever it takes to get your nominations through as quickly as possible.' And Thune said in a statement that they must 'quickly and decisively' act to get nominees in place and that 'all options are on the table to make that happen, including recess appointments.' Cornyn said that 'It is unacceptable for Senate Ds to blockade President @realDonaldTrump 's cabinet appointments. If they do, we will stay in session, including weekends, until they relent.' He noted that recess appointments are allowed under the Constitution. The social media exchange Sunday became a first test for the three candidates since Trump was decisively elected last week to a second term. Trump's relationship with Congress — especially the advice and consent role afforded to the Senate when it comes to nominations — was tumultuous in his first term as he chafed at resistance to his selections and sought ways to work around lawmakers. With Trump now entering a second term emboldened by his sweeping election victory, he is already signaling that he expects Senate Republicans, and by extension, their new leader, to fall in line behind his Cabinet selections. Trump also posted Sunday that the Senate should not approve any judges in the weeks before Republicans take power next year — a more difficult demand to fulfill as Democrats will control the floor, and hold most of the votes, until the new Congress is sworn in on Jan. 3. Trump posted that 'Democrats are looking to ram through their Judges as the Republicans fight over Leadership. THIS IS NOT ACCEPTABLE.' With days to go, the race for Senate Republican leader is deeply in flux. Thune and Cornyn are both well-liked, longtime senators who have served as deputies to McConnell and have been seen as the front-runners, despite past statements criticizing Trump. Scott — a longtime friend of Trump's and fierce ally — has been seen as more of a longshot, but he has mounted an aggressive campaign in recent days on social media and elsewhere with the aim of getting Trump's endorsement. Senators who are close to Trump, such as Mike Lee of Utah and Marco Rubio of Florida, have endorsed Scott, as have tech mogul Elon Musk and other people who have Trump's ear. 'We have to be the change,' Scott said on Fox News' 'Sunday Morning Futures.' 'That's what Donald Trump got elected to do, to be the change.' All three candidates are promising that they will be more open and transparent than McConnell was and that they would give senators more power to get their priorities to the floor. They have also tried to make clear that they would have a much different relationship with Trump than McConnell, who once called the former president a 'despicable human being' behind closed doors. As the Senate haggles over how to fill Trump's Cabinet, many of his allies are campaigning for the nominations. Former GOP presidential candidate Vivek Ramaswamy said on ABC's 'This Week' that there are 'a couple of great options on the table.' Sen. Bill Hagerty, a Republican from Tennessee who served as U.S. ambassador to Japan between 2017 and 2019, said on CBS's 'Face the Nation' that one of his greatest honors was to represent the Trump administration overseas. He said he would advance 'the positions that President Trump has articulated.' 'I'll do that in whatever role necessary,' said Hagerty, who has endorsed Scott in the leadership race. While Trump has made only one personnel move public so far, naming Susie Wiles his chief of staff, he has already ruled out two names for top positions. Trump said Saturday that he would not be inviting Mike Pompeo, his former U.S. Secretary of State and CIA chief, and Nikki Haley, a former South Carolina governor who served as his U.N. ambassador and challenged him for the Republican nomination. Pompeo rallied with Trump on the night before Election Day. 'I very much enjoyed and appreciated working with them previously, and would like to thank them for their service to our Country,' Trump posted on his network Truth Social. Trump's son, Donald Trump Jr., reposted on X a message by podcaster Dave Smith suggesting to put pressure to 'keep all neocons and war hawks out of the Trump administration.' 'The 'stop Pompeo' movement is great, but it's not enough,' Smith posted on X.

15 Chad soldiers killed in operation against Boko Haram, army says	N'DJAMENA, CHAD — At least 15 Chadian soldiers were killed and 32 others wounded in clashes between the army and Boko Haram fighters Saturday, the army's spokesperson said, adding that 96 Boko Haram members were also killed. General Issakh Acheikh on Sunday did not say where the operation took place or provide any details on the circumstances. He said on national television that the army also wounded 11 Boko Haram members and seized arms and equipment. 'The army assures the population that the situation is under control and that actions to track down residual elements continue as part of Operation Haskanite,' Acheikh said, referring to a military operation launched to dislodge Boko Haram militants from Lake Chad. The region has been attacked repeatedly by insurgencies including Islamic State in West Africa and Boko Haram, which erupted in northeast Nigeria in 2009 and spread to the west of Chad. Around 40 soldiers were killed in an attack on a military base in Chad's Lake region at the end of last month, after which interim President Mahamat Idriss Deby threatened to withdraw the Central African country from a multinational security force. Chad is an important ally for French and U.S. forces seeking to help fight a 12-year jihadi insurgency in West Africa's Sahel region. Military juntas that seized power in recent years in Mali, Burkina Faso and Niger — whose shared borders have become epicenters of jihadi violence — have turned their backs on the West in favor of Russian support.	https://www.voanews.com/a/chad-soldiers-killed-in-operation-against-boko-haram-army-says/7859312.html	2024-11-10T16:54:04-08:00

Swift, who is currently finishing up her Eras tour on the other side of the Atlantic, thanked the fans for the bounty of prizes via video message. The U.K. show opened with an acrobatic Benson Boone suspended in the air on a gold grand piano performing his viral hit 'Beautiful Things' and latest release 'Slow it Down.' Boone also accepted his first EMA for best new act. South African newcomer Tyla gave Swift a run for her money picking up three awards for best afrobeats, best R&B and best African act. Tyla performed her smash hit 'Water' for the EMA audience at the Co-op Live, Manchester, flanked by a host of dancers, as well as singing energetic new track 'Push 2 Start.' British singer Rita Ora, who hosted the show for a record third time, paid tribute to former One Direction star Liam Payne, who died last month after falling from a balcony in Buenos Aires. Ora had a close relationship with the singer and the pair recorded a song together in 2018, 'For You (Fifty Shades Freed).' She addressed the audience saying, 'I want to take a moment to remember someone. Liam Payne was one of the kindest people I knew.' Her voice broke as she asked the crowd to take a moment to remember Liam saying, 'He had the biggest heart and he left such a mark on this world.' Hip-hop legend Busta Rhymes was awarded the EMAs global icon award from British rapper Little Simz telling the crowd that in 34 years of professionally recording this was his first award from MTV and it felt incredible. The 12-time Grammy Award nominee, who has more than 10 million album sales under his belt, performed a mega medley of his greatest hits 'Break ya Neck,' 'Touch it' and 'Put Your Hands Where the Eyes can See' accompanied by dancers wearing tracksuits with giant dragon heads.

UK's Starmer, France's Macron to discuss Ukraine support after Trump win	London — British Prime Minister Keir Starmer will meet French President Emmanuel Macron on Monday to discuss ways to help Ukraine, after the election of Donald Trump has raised concerns of reduced U.S. support for the war against Russia. Days after Trump was elected to begin a second term as U.S. president in January, Starmer will travel to France, where he will talk with Macron and become the first British leader to attend French Armistice Day services since World War Two. Starmer and Macron will discuss 'Russia's ongoing barbaric invasion of Ukraine and the appalling humanitarian situation in Gaza,' Downing Street said. Trump has criticized the level of U.S. support for Ukraine's fight against Russia since the 2022 full-scale invasion and has promised to end the conflict without explaining how. Britain and France have said it is essential to keep supporting Ukraine against Russia to protect the European continent. Europe has been the biggest provider of aid to Ukraine, allocating 118 billion euros ($126 billion) since the start of the conflict, while the United States has provided 85 billion euros ($91 billion) in total, according to the Kiel Institute for the World Economy. Britain and the European Union are expected to begin talks next year on a post-Brexit security pact, covering areas such as defense and energy cooperation, as they look to take more responsibility for their own security. Some European politicians have said Europe cannot replace the financial and military aid from the United States, including military resources such as F-16 fighter jets and Army Tactical Missile Systems (ATACMS). On his visit to France, Starmer is scheduled to meet the new French Prime Minister Michel Barnier. The meeting will be their first since Barnier became prime minister in September. The last British leader to attend the French Armistice Day commemorations was Winston Churchill, who was hosted by Charles de Gaulle in 1944, Starmer's office said.	https://www.voanews.com/a/uk-s-starmer-france-s-macron-to-discuss-ukraine-support-after-trump-win/7859035.html	2024-11-10T15:59:25-08:00	
1 dead, 16 hurt after shooting at Alabama’s Tuskegee University	Atlanta, Georgia — A shooting early Sunday that marred homecoming weekend at Tuskegee University in Alabama left one person dead and left 16 others injured, a dozen of them by gunfire, authorities said. One arrest was announced hours later. The Alabama Law Enforcement Agency said Jaquez Myrick, 25, of Montgomery, was taken into custody while leaving the scene of the campus shooting and had been found with a handgun with a machine gun conversion device. The agency's statement said Myrick faces a federal charge of possession of a machine gun. It did not say whether he was a student at the historically Black university, where the shooting erupted in the early hours on Sunday as the school's 100th Homecoming Week was winding down. Authorities said an 18-year-old man who died was not a university student but that some of the injured were students. It was not immediately known if Myrick had an attorney who could speak on his behalf. Twelve people were wounded by gunfire, and four others sustained injuries not related to the gunshots, the state agency said earlier. Their conditions were not immediately released. The FBI joined the investigation and said it is seeking tips from the public, as well as any video witnesses might have. It set up a site online for people to upload video. Tuskegee University announced that classes Monday have been canceled. Grief counselors will be available to help students in the university's chapel. The parents of the victim were notified, and several of the injured were being treated at East Alabama Medical Center in Opelika and Baptist South Hospital in Montgomery, the university said in a statement. An autopsy on the 18-year-old was planned at the state's forensic center in Montgomery, Macon County Coroner Hal Bentley told The Associated Press on Sunday. Tuskegee city's police chief, Patrick Mardis, said the injured included a female student who was shot in the stomach and a male student who was shot in the arm. City police were responding to an unrelated double shooting off campus when officers got the call about the university shooting at the West Commons on-campus apartments, Mardis said. 'Some idiots started shooting,' Mardis told the news site Al.com. 'You couldn't get the emergency vehicles in there, there were so many people there.' A person who answered the phone at the office of Tuskegee's police chief said no other information was available. 'Special Agents are still in the process of gathering and examining information relative to the sequence of events which ultimately led to the shooting,' the state law enforcement agency said in a statement. In his 37 years as coroner, Bentley said he couldn't recall any shootings during the school's past homecoming celebrations. The mood around the small town of around 9,000 people was somber, he said. The shooting left everyone in the university community shaken, said Amare' Hardee, a senior from Tallahassee, Florida, who is president of the student government association. 'This senseless act of violence has touched each of us, whether directly or indirectly,' he said at the school's homecoming convocation Sunday morning. A pastor who leads the Tuskegee National Alumni Association told those at Sunday's convocation service that the shooting is a reminder of the fragility of life. 'It is in moments like these that we need to be reminded not to stand on our own understanding because in a moment like this, I don't have understanding,' said the Rev. James Quincy III. 'I can only rely on my faith, and my prayer for our entire family, this community, as we close out this marvelous family reunion that we shared this week,' Quincy said, 'and most importantly because of that faith walk and that trust in God, that we have resilience, resilience in the time of trouble.' Miles College in Fairfield, Alabama — the school's opponent for Tuskegee's homecoming football game on Saturday — released a statement expressing sympathy. 'Today, our hearts are with the Tuskegee family as they face the tragic aftermath of the recent shooting on campus,' the college said. 'We extend our deepest condolences to those impacted and pray for healing and justice. Miles College stands with you in this difficult time.' Sunday's shooting comes just over a year after four people were injured in a shooting at a Tuskegee University student housing complex. In that shooting, two visitors to the campus were shot and two students were hurt while trying to leave the scene of what campus officials described as an 'unauthorized party' in September 2023, the Montgomery Advertiser reported. About 3,000 students are enrolled at the university about 40 miles (64 kilometers) east of Alabama's capital city of Montgomery. The university was the first historically Black college to be designated as a Registered National Landmark in 1966. It was also designated a National Historic Site in 1974, according to the school's website. Norma Clayton, chairwoman of the board of the trustees, said at the Sunday morning service that 'we will get through this together because in tough times, tough people band together and they survive.'	https://www.voanews.com/a/shooting-alabama-tuskegee-university/7859031.html	2024-11-10T15:43:09-08:00	
Olaf Scholz signals willingness for earlier German confidence vote	Berlin — German Chancellor Olaf Scholz said Sunday that he would be willing to call a vote of confidence in parliament before Christmas, a move that would pave the way for snap elections following the collapse of his three-way governing coalition. The timing is earlier than the January date he had proposed last week and follows increasing pressure from politicians and the public for a quicker vote. Europe's largest economy was thrown into disarray last week with the collapse of Scholz's coalition and disagreements over how much money the government should spend to encourage growth and support Ukraine. 'I'm not clinging to my job,' he said in an interview on ARD television. Scholz had suggested holding a vote of confidence in his government on Jan. 15, with a snap election in March, but the conservative opposition led by Friedrich Merz wants an election in January. A confidence vote is a necessary precursor to an election. Earlier Sunday, Scholz came under increasing pressure to bring forward the vote of confidence. Two leading members of the Green party, which is sharing power with Scholz's Social Democrats (SPD) in a minority government, told Bild newspaper that the confidence vote should be held in December. The Green party's Anton Hofreiter and Irene Mihalic were the most prominent voices so far from the two parties still in power to back an earlier vote. Scholz said in the ARD interview that an earlier confidence vote would depend on SPD party official Rolf Mutzenich and the opposition's Merz reaching an agreement on timing. 'It is not a problem at all for me to call a vote of confidence before Christmas,' he said. Scholz on Friday demanded a calm debate among Germany's squabbling factions on setting a date for the snap election to pull the country out of its political crisis. Scholz called on parties to first agree on what legislation could be passed in what remained of the current parliament but denied trying to ram through his own policy agenda by delaying an election.	https://www.voanews.com/a/olaf-scholz-signals-willingness-for-earlier-german-confidence-vote/7859025.html	2024-11-10T14:55:10-08:00	
Australian gold company confirms arrest of CEO, 2 executives in Mali	Dakar, Senagal — The CEO and two executives of Australian gold mine Resolute in Mali have been arrested while in Bamako to discuss ongoing disputes with authorities, the company confirmed Sunday. CEO Terence Holohan and his two colleagues 'were in Bamako to discuss with mining and tax authorities the company's business practices in Mali generally and to make progress on ongoing claims against Resolute, which continues to claim they are unfounded,' Resolute said in a statement posted on its website. 'Unexpectedly, the three employees were arrested after the end of these meetings on Friday,' she reported. The three executives were taken the same day to the unit specializing in the fight against corruption and economic and financial delinquency — and were placed in police custody in a case of alleged forgery and damage to public property, AFP learned Saturday from a judicial and industrial source. Four employees of the Canadian company Barrick Gold, also in dispute with the Malian authorities, were detained for several days at the end of September, then released. Foreign mining companies are subject to increased pressure from the junta that came to power by force in 2020 and pays particular attention to the juicy revenues of the mining industry. 'Resolute is working to reach an agreement with the Malian government that secures the long-term future of the Syama gold mine; at the same time its top priority remains the safety and well-being of its employees,' the company said. The executives benefit from the support of the embassies and consulates of the United Kingdom and other countries present in Mali, she said. Resolute holds 80% of the shares in the subsidiary that owns the Syama mine, with the remaining 20% in the hands of the Malian state, according to the company's website. The Malian authorities have made the fight against corruption and the restoration of national sovereignty over natural resources their mantras. Mali, one of the poorest countries in the world, faces jihadis and a multidimensional crisis, and is also one of the leading gold producers in Africa. Gold contributes to a quarter of the national budget and three quarters of export revenues. The increased pressure on foreign companies coincided with the junta's strategic pivot toward Russia.	https://www.voanews.com/a/australian-gold-company-confirms-arrest-of-ceo-2-executives-in-mali/7859017.html	2024-11-10T14:31:05-08:00	
Haiti replaces PM, marking more turmoil in its democratic transition process	A transitionary council created to reestablish democratic order in Haiti signed a degree Sunday firing interim Prime Minister Garry Conille and replacing him with Alix Didier Fils-Aime, a businessman who was previously considered for the job. The decree, set to be published on Monday, was provided to The Associated Press by a government source. It marks even more turmoil in an already rocky democratic transition process for Haiti, which hasn't held democratic elections in years in large part due to the soaring levels of gang violence plaguing the Caribbean nation. The transitional council was established in April, tasked with choosing Haiti's next prime minister and Cabinet with the hope that it would help quell turmoil in Haiti. But the council has been plagued with politics and infighting, and in October a number of members on the council faced corruption accusations.	https://www.voanews.com/a/haiti-replaces-pm-marking-more-turmoil-in-its-democratic-transition-process/7859012.html	2024-11-10T14:11:50-08:00	
Biden to lobby Trump not to walk away from Ukraine	Washington — U.S. President Joe Biden will discuss top domestic and foreign policy priorities with President-elect Donald Trump when the two meet Wednesday, and will urge him not to abandon Ukraine, national security adviser Jake Sullivan said Sunday. Republican Trump will take office on Jan. 20 after defeating Vice President Kamala Harris in the Nov. 5 presidential election. Biden invited Trump to come to the Oval Office on Wednesday, the White House said. In an interview on CBS News' 'Face the Nation' show, Sullivan said Biden's top message will be his commitment to ensure a peaceful transfer of power, and he will also talk to Trump about what's happening in Europe, in Asia and the Middle East. 'The president will have the chance to explain to President Trump how he sees things, where they stand, and talk to President Trump about how President Trump is thinking about taking on these issues when he takes office,' Sullivan said. While Sullivan did not specify which topics the two would discuss, their conversation will almost certainly feature Ukraine's war with Russia, which Trump has pledged to end swiftly, although he did not say how. 'President Biden will have the opportunity over the next 70 days to make the case to the Congress and to the incoming administration that the United States should not walk away from Ukraine, that walking away from Ukraine means more instability in Europe,' Sullivan said. When asked if that means Biden will ask Congress to pass legislation to authorize more funding for Ukraine, Sullivan deferred. 'I'm not here to put forward a specific legislative proposal. President Biden will make the case that we do need ongoing resources for Ukraine beyond the end of his term,' Sullivan said. Ukraine funding Washington has provided tens of billions of dollars' worth of U.S. military and economic aid to Ukraine since it was invaded by Russia in February of 2022, funding that Trump has repeatedly criticized and rallied against with other Republican lawmakers. Sullivan's comments came as Ukraine attacked Moscow on Sunday with at least 34 drones, the biggest drone strike on the Russian capital since the beginning of the war. Trump insisted last year that Russian President Vladimir Putin never would have invaded Ukraine if he had been in the White House at the time. He told Reuters Ukraine may have to cede territory to reach a peace agreement, something the Ukrainians reject, and Biden has never suggested. Ukraine President Volodymyr Zelenskyy said Thursday he was not aware of any details of U.S. President-elect Donald Trump's plan to end the Ukraine war quickly and that he was convinced a rapid end would entail major concessions for Kyiv. According to the Government Accountability Office, Congress appropriated over $174 billion to Ukraine under Biden. The pace of the aid is almost sure to drop under Trump with Republicans set to take control of the U.S. Senate with a 52-seat majority. Control of the U.S. House of Representatives in the next Congress is not yet clear with some votes still being counted. Republicans have won 213 seats, according to Edison Research, just shy of the 218 needed for a majority. If Republicans win both chambers, it will mean most of Trump's agenda will have a significantly easier time passing through Congress. Republican U.S. Senator Bill Hagerty, a Trump ally who is considered a top contender for secretary of state, criticized U.S. funding for Ukraine in a CBS interview. 'The American people want sovereignty protected here in America before we spend our funds and resources protecting the sovereignty of another nation,' Hagerty said. The 2-1/2-year-old war in Ukraine is entering what some officials say could be its final act after Moscow's forces advanced at the fastest pace since the early days of the war. Any fresh attempt to end the war is likely to involve peace talks of some kind, which have not been held since the early months of the war. Moscow's forces occupy around a fifth of Ukraine. Russia says the war cannot end until its claimed annexations are recognized. Kyiv demands all of its territory back, a position that has largely been supported by Western allies.	https://www.voanews.com/a/biden-to-lobby-trump-not-to-walk-away-from-ukraine/7859007.html	2024-11-10T14:03:53-08:00	
As Russian forces close in on Kurakhove, hundreds of residents remain in front-line city	KURAKHOVE, Ukraine — Set on Ukraine's eastern front, Kurakhove is surrounded on three sides, with Russian forces just under 3 kilometers from the devastated city center. Yet between 700 and 1,000 local residents remain, most of them living in the basements of apartment buildings, without running water, heating or electricity. The only place to charge phones is in the basement of the building now housing the city administration. The exact number of people is impossible to determine because, since mid-October, no humanitarian volunteers have come to Kurakhove. Under attack from artillery, multiple rocket launchers, aerial bombs and drones, Kurakhove has become the new Bakhmut, as Russia continues its drive westward to capture all of the Donbas region. On Friday, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy called the situation in Kurakhove, as well as the key city of Pokrovsk, 'the most challenging.' The hospital, schools, kindergartens, water treatment plant, refugee center, post office, technical school and cultural center have all been destroyed. Smoke hangs in the air as bombed-out apartment buildings burn against a backdrop of artillery fire and drones. Artillerymen of the 33rd Brigade say they are firing around 50 shells per day on the Kurakhove front, indicating critical activity in the Russian army's offensive operations and the brigade's desperate attempts to stop Russian forces from encircling the city. Local authorities remain in the city, as well as representatives of the police and local Territorial Defense Forces. For Artem Shchus, head of police in Kurakhove, there is little hope of defending the city if it becomes surrounded. 'I don't think it is possible, considering the reality of modern war and modern technologies. In that case, the logistics could be performed only by drones,' he says. Shchus calls the road to Kurakhove, which is lined with burned-out civilian vehicles, the 'road of death,' due to persistent Russian drone attacks. Five civilians have been killed while trying to leave. The road of death No supplies would enter the city without the 'White Angels' evacuation group, made up of local police officers and volunteers. They provide first aid to the wounded and remove the bodies of those killed in shelling, all while operating the city's only functioning food store. The White Angels bring in vital supplies in an armored vehicle kitted out with electronic warfare equipment — the only way to enter the city, and still a journey fraught with risk. 'Without REB (jammers) it is just a lottery. With it, you might still have a chance to survive,' Shchus says. The only way to escape the city is to travel with the White Angels. Each day, they risk their lives to evacuate between six and 12 people from different parts of the city and surrounding villages. Although children are meant to have been evacuated, parents often hide them, both from the bombs and from law enforcement officers. Among the White Angels' key missions is to find children and persuade their parents to evacuate. When this mission is successful and children are removed from the basements, many are shocked by the state of the destroyed city, suggesting that they have been hiding underground for quite some time. After dressing the children in bulletproof vests and helmets, the White Angels take them to the nearby city of Kostiantynopil, from where other volunteers transport them to refugee registration points in the regional centers of Dnipro or Zaporizhzhia. 'We evacuate people every day without stopping. We just dropped people off in Kostiantynopil, and we still have addresses to go through today,' Shchus explains. Asked about adapting to work in such challenging and dangerous conditions, the police chief worries about the impact on his team. 'I think everyone has already adapted. I wouldn't even call it 'adaptation.' It's more like an unhealthy state of mind. I don't know how this will influence them socially in the future,' he says. 'These people are living in inhumane conditions, and they're surviving on adrenaline. The war is their life. These are hard conditions to work in, but everyone is working.'	https://www.voanews.com/a/as-russian-forces-close-in-on-kurakhove-hundreds-of-residents-remain-in-front-line-city/7859008.html	2024-11-10T14:02:29-08:00	
China delimits contested South China Sea shoal in dispute with Philippines	Beijing — China has published baselines for a contested shoal in the South China Sea it seized from the Philippines, a move that's likely to increase tensions over overlapping territorial claims. The Foreign Ministry on Sunday posted online geographic coordinates for the baselines around Scarborough Shoal. A nation's territorial waters and exclusive economic zone are typically defined as the distance from the baselines. Both China and the Philippines claim Scarborough Shoal and other outcroppings in the South China Sea. China seized the shoal, which lies west of the main Philippine island of Luzon, in 2012 and has since restricted access to Filipino fishermen there. A 2016 ruling by an international arbitration court found that most Chinese claims in the South China Sea were invalid but Beijing refuses to abide by it. Ships from China and the Philippines have collided several times as part of increased confrontations, and the Chinese coast guard has blasted Philippine vessels with water cannons. China's move came two days after Philippine President Ferdinand Marcos Jr. signed two laws demarcating the government's claims in the disputed waters. A Chinese Foreign Ministry statement said that the delimiting of the baselines was in accordance with a U.N. agreement and Chinese law. 'This is a natural step by the Chinese government to lawfully strengthen marine management and is consistent with international law and common practices,' it said. The statement added that one of the laws signed by Marcos, the Philippine Maritime Zones Act, violates China's sovereignty in the South China Sea. 'China firmly opposes it and will continue to do everything necessary in accordance with law to firmly defend its territorial sovereignty and maritime rights and interests,' the Foreign Ministry said. China stakes claim to almost the entirety of the South China Sea. It has a series of disputes with several Southeast Asian nations including the Philippines and Vietnam over territory in the waters, which are part of a key shipping route in Asia.	https://www.voanews.com/a/china-delimits-contested-south-china-sea-shoal-in-dispute-with-philippines/7859002.html	2024-11-10T13:54:08-08:00	
California farmers enjoy pistachio boom, with much of it headed to China	Lost Hills, California — In a sprawling plant in the heart of California's farmland, millions of shells rush down a metallic chute and onto a conveyor belt where they are inspected, roasted, packaged and shipped off to groceries around the world. Pistachios are growing fast in California, where farmers have been devoting more land to a crop seen as hardier and more drought-tolerant in a state prone to dramatic swings in precipitation. The crop generated nearly $3 billion last year in California and in the past decade the United States has surpassed Iran to become the world's top exporter of the nut. 'There has been an explosion over the last 10 or 15 years of plantings, and those trees are coming online,' said Zachary Fraser, president and chief executive of American Pistachio Growers, which represents more than 800 farmers in the southwestern U.S. 'You are starting to see the fruit of people's vision from 40 years ago.' California grows more than a third of the country's vegetables and three quarters of its fruit and nuts, according to state agricultural statistics. Pistachios have surged over the past decade to become the state's sixth-biggest agricultural commodity in value ahead of longtime crops such as strawberries and tomatoes, the data shows. Much of the crop is headed to China, where it is a popular treat during the Lunar New Year. But industry experts said Americans also are eating more pistachios, which were rarely in grocery stores a generation ago and today are a snack food found almost everywhere. They are sold with shells or without and flavors range from salt and pepper to honey roasted. The Wonderful Co., a $6 billion agricultural company known for brands such as Halo mandarins and FIJI Water, is the biggest name in pistachios. The company has grown pistachios since the 1980s, but it ramped up in 2015 after developing a rootstock that yields as much as 40% more nuts with the same soil and water, said Rob Yraceburu, president of Wonderful Orchards. Now, Wonderful grows between 15% and 20% of the U.S. pistachio crop, he said. Its pistachio orchards stretch across vast tracts of dust-filled farmland northwest of Los Angeles also lined with pomegranates and dairies. The trees are shaken each fall and the nuts hauled to a massive processing facility to be prepped for sale. 'There is an increasingly growing demand in pistachios,' Yraceburu said. 'The world wants more.' Pistachios are poised to weather California's dry spells better than its even bigger nut crop, almonds, which generated nearly $4 billion in the state last year, industry experts said. Pistachio orchards can be sustained with minimal water during drought, unlike almonds and other more sensitive crops. The trees also rely on wind instead of bees for pollination and can produce nuts for decades longer, Yraceburu said. Many California farmers who grow both nuts are applying lessons learned from almonds to the pistachio boom. Almond production, which is much bigger than pistachio, also soared in California, but prices fell amid a glut of post-pandemic supply while farmers grappled with drought and rising input costs, leading some to not replant aging orchards when it came time to take them out. Pistachio growers say they hope to avoid a similar fate and are striving to keep demand for the nut ahead of supply. For example, American Pistachio Growers recently inked an endorsement deal with a top cricket player in India hoping to help promote pistachios there, Fraser said. The rise of pistachios is part of California farmers' shift into perennial crops commanding higher returns than products such as cotton, according to a 2023 report by the Public Policy Institute of California. Perennial crops, which are not replanted annually, can't just be swapped out during dry years, which can be challenging during extensive drought, said Brad Franklin, a research fellow at the institute's Water Policy Center. But pistachios have benefits other perennial crops don't. They can go longer without water and grow in saline soils. That may make them appealing to California farmers who are facing limits on how much groundwater they can pump under a state law aimed at conserving the critical resource, he said. When farmers decide what to plant, 'I think the biggest thing is the market and where is the market,' Franklin said. 'And water is right below that.' Farmers across California are bracing for the impact of the 2014 state law aimed at ensuring a more sustainable use of groundwater after years of over pumping depleted basins and eroded water quality in some rural areas. About a fifth of California's pistachio crop is grown in areas that rely exclusively on groundwater for irrigation, Yraceburu said, adding he expects some of these orchards will eventually come out of production. But over the next few years, pistachio acreage is expected to continue to grow in the state as trees planted in recent years come into production. That is in contrast to almond and walnut acreage, which are stabilizing or declining as orchards are being pulled out, said David Magana, a senior analyst at Rabobank in Fresno, California. Pistachios require about 3,700 cubic meters (3 acre-feet) of water per 0.4 hectares (acre) compared with nearly 4 acre-feet (4,934 cubic meters) for almonds and produce more per acre than almonds while fetching a higher price, he said. 'You see all the value the pistachio industry is providing to California agriculture is approaching that of almonds with a lot less acreage,' Magana said. 'I haven't seen pistachio orchards being pulled out.'	https://www.voanews.com/a/california-farmers-enjoy-pistachio-boom-with-much-of-it-headed-to-china/7858996.html	2024-11-10T13:31:04-08:00	
Saudi armed forces chief of staff in Iran for talks with officials	Dubai, United Arab Emirates — The chief of staff of Saudi Arabia's armed forces, Fayyad al-Ruwaili, visited Tehran on Sunday to meet with his Iranian counterpart and discuss defense ties, state media reported the Iranian Armed Forces General Staff as saying. The visit follows the election of Donald Trump, who will take office for a second term as U.S. president in January, and who has promised to bring peace to the Middle East. During his first term, Trump initiated normalizations between Arab states and Iran's regional arch-enemy Israel, known as the Abraham Accords. Saudi Arabia has not established ties with Israel, but Trump's son-in-law Jared Kushner has discussed the possibility with Saudi Arabia’s Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman multiple times over the last years, a source familiar with the discussions told Reuters on the condition of anonymity. Iran's state media said al-Ruwaili headed a high-level Saudi military delegation in Tehran and met Armed Forces Chief of Staff Major General Mohammad Bagheri. Iranian state media said the two military officials discussed various issues, including 'the development of defense diplomacy and the expansion of bilateral cooperation.' State media added that Bagheri held a phone call with Saudi Arabia's Defense Minister Prince Khalid bin Salman Al Saud last year to discuss regional developments and improve defense cooperation between the two countries. Separately, Iranian President Masoud Pezeshkian spoke with Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman on the phone, Iranian media said. Pezeshkian told the crown prince he would not be able to attend a summit of the Organization of Islamic Cooperation (OIC) in Riyadh due to his busy schedule and would be dispatching the Iranian first vice president as a representative, the Mehr news agency said. Tehran and Riyadh agreed in March 2023, via Chinese intermediation, to reestablish relations after seven years of hostility that had threatened stability and security in the Gulf and helped to fuel conflicts in the Middle East from Yemen to Syria.	https://www.voanews.com/a/saudi-armed-forces-chief-of-staff-in-iran-for-talks-with-officials/7858992.html	2024-11-10T13:23:46-08:00	
Israeli airstrikes kill dozens in Lebanon, Gaza	Israeli airstrikes killed dozens of people in Lebanon and northern Gaza on Sunday, even as Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and U.S. President-elect Donald Trump have been discussing the way forward for when Trump takes office in January. The Israeli leader said he has spoken with Trump three times since the U.S. presidential election last week and that they 'see eye-to-eye on the Iranian threat in all its aspects, and on the dangers they reflect.' Netanyahu said he sees 'great opportunities facing Israel, in the area of peace and its expansion,' but did not expand on his statement. Before the election, Trump, according to Israeli news accounts, told Netanyahu that he wanted Israel to resolve its wars against two Iranian-supported groups, Hamas militants in Gaza and Hezbollah militants in Lebanon, before his inauguration as president on January 20. Israeli President Isaac Herzog is scheduled to meet with outgoing U.S. President Joe Biden on Tuesday in Washington as the mid-month deadline approaches for Israel to meet a Biden administration ultimatum that it allow more humanitarian aid into Gaza to assist Palestinians or risk possible restrictions on U.S. military funding. Israeli forces have encircled and largely isolated Jabaliya and the nearby northern Gaza towns of Beit Lahiya and Beit Hanoun for the past month, allowing in only a trickle of humanitarian aid. Experts from a panel that monitors food security say famine is imminent or may already be happening. In the Sunday fighting, an Israeli airstrike killed at least 23 people, including seven children, in Aalmat village north of Beirut, far from the areas in the east and south where Hezbollah militants have a major presence. Lebanon's health ministry said another six people were wounded. Watch related report by Arash Arabasadi: There was no Israeli evacuation warning and no immediate Israeli comment on the attack. In northern Gaza, an Israeli strike on a home sheltering displaced people in the urban refugee camp of Jabaliya killed at least 17 people including nine women, according to Dr. Fadel Naim, director of Al-Ahly Hospital in Gaza City. The Israeli military, without offering evidence, said it had targeted a site where militants were operating. It said the details of the strike are under review. A separate strike hit a house in Gaza City, killing Wael al-Khour, a minister in the Hamas-run government, as well as his wife and three children, according to the Civil Defense first responders who operate under the government. In Syria, the state news agency SANA said an Israeli airstrike hit a residential building in the Damascus suburb of Sayyida Zeinab, killing seven civilians. The Britain-based opposition war monitor, the Syrian Observatory for Human Rights, suggested Hezbollah was targeted, but Israel did not offer any immediate comment. The war in Gaza was triggered when Hamas-led militants stormed into southern Israel on Oct. 7, 2023, killing about 1,200 people, mostly civilians, and abducting about 250. Some 100 hostages are still inside Gaza, although about one-third of them are believed to be dead. Israel's counteroffensive has killed more than 43,000 Palestinians, more than half of them women and children, according to local health authorities. The Israeli military says the death toll includes thousands of Hamas militants. Some material in this report came from The Associated Press.	https://www.voanews.com/a/israeli-airstrikes-kill-dozens-in-lebanon-gaza/7858985.html	2024-11-10T13:11:30-08:00	
China, Indonesia seal $10 billion in deals focused on green energy and tech	Beijing — China and Indonesia signed deals worth $10 billion at the Indonesia-China Business Forum in Beijing on Sunday, spanning sectors including food, new energy, technology, and biotechnology, Chinese state media reported. The forum followed a meeting on Saturday between Chinese President Xi Jinping and Indonesian President Prabowo Subianto, who was in China through Sunday, the first country he has visited since taking office last month. Prabowo, who won Indonesia's presidential election in February, also chose China for his first visit as president-elect, underscoring Jakarta's commitment to stronger strategic ties with Beijing. In a joint statement after the leaders' meeting, the countries agreed to enhance collaboration in sectors such as new energy vehicles, lithium batteries, photovoltaics, and the digital economy. They also pledged to strengthen partnership on the global energy transition and jointly ensure the security of global mineral supply and industrial chains, the statement said. Prabowo, in a separate statement, said he was optimistic close cooperation between the two countries would improve regional stability. 'We must set an example that in this era, cooperation not confrontation is the path to peace and prosperity,' Prabowo said, adding Indonesia was committed to supporting Chinese investors. On Sunday, Chinese battery materials producer GEM signed a deal with PT Vale Indonesia to build a high-pressure acid leaching plant in central Sulawesi, partly to secure nickel resources, a Shenzhen filing showed. Prabowo witnessed the signing. The nickel industry in Indonesia, the world's largest producer of the metal, is dominated by Chinese companies including Tsingshan Holding Group and Zhejiang Huayou Cobalt. In the tech sector, Indonesian tech firm GoTo Gojek Tokopedia signed agreements with China's Tencent and Alibaba to develop cloud infrastructure and digital talent in Indonesia, Reuters reported earlier. The two countries will introduce visa measures, including multi-entry long-term visas, and encourage more direct flights and destinations based on demand, the joint statement showed. Other cooperation agreements signed during Prabowo's visit include collaboration in housing and the export of fresh coconuts from Indonesia to China.	https://www.voanews.com/a/china-indonesia-seal-10-billion-in-deals-focused-on-green-energy-and-tech/7858988.html	2024-11-10T13:08:55-08:00	
NY parks employee dies fighting fires; air quality warnings are issued in New York and New Jersey	POMPTON LAKES, N.J. — A New York parks employee died battling one of a number of wildfires in New Jersey and New York amid dry conditions that have prompted air quality warnings in both states, authorities said Sunday. The worker died when a tree fell on him Saturday afternoon as he battled a major brush fire along the New York-New Jersey border, according to reports from the Eastern Dutchess County Fire and Rescue and the New York state forestry services. 'Rip brother your shift is over job well done,' the New York State forestry services post said. New York State Police said they were investigating the death amid the fire in Sterling Forest located in Greenwood Lake and identified the victim as Dariel Vasquez, an 18-year-old state Parks and Recreation aide employed by the New York State Parks, Recreation, and Historic Preservation Department. The fires in New York and New Jersey come as firefighters are also battling a wildfire in California. The New Jersey Department of Environmental Protection's Forest Fire Service reported the sprawling blaze had spread to 10 square kilometers near the border in Passaic County’s West Milford and Orange County, New York. Officials said Sunday the blaze, dubbed the Jennings Creek wildfire, was now threatening 14 Greenwood Lake structures as well as two New Jersey homes and eight buildings in that state's Long Pond Ironworks Historic District. Health advisories were issued for parts of New York, including New York City, and northeastern New Jersey due to unhealthy air quality due to smoke from the fires. People were urged to limit strenuous outdoor physical activity if possible; those especially sensitive included the very young and very old and people with ailments such as asthma and heart disease. New Jersey officials, meanwhile, reported 75 percent containment of a 70-hectare fire in the Pompton Lakes area of Passaic County that was threatening 55 homes, although no evacuations had been ordered. Progress was also reported on fires in the Bethany Run area on the border of Burlington and Camden counties in Evesham and Voorhees townships; a blaze along the Palisades Interstate Parkway in Englewood Cliffs in Bergen County; and the Pheasant Run wildfire in the Glassboro wildlife protection area of Gloucester County. Prosecutors in Ocean County on late Saturday afternoon announced arson and firearms charges in connection with a 142-hectare Jackson Township fire that started Wednesday. They said it was sparked by magnesium shards from a shotgun round on the berm of a shooting range. Officials said firing that kind of 'incendiary or tracer ammunition' was barred in the state. The majority of the blaze has been contained, officials reported Friday. In Massachusetts, one wildfire among several fueled by powerful wind gusts and dry leaves burned more than 81 hectares in the Lynn Woods Reservation, a municipal park that comprises about 8.8 square kilometers in the city 16 kilometers north of Boston. 'This is a dry spell we have not seen during this time of year in many years,' the Lynn Fire Department said in a statement on social media as firefighters continued to battle the blaze, blaming its intensely on low humidity as well as winds and dry leaves on the ground. It was one of many brush fires that cropped up across the region. In Foxborough, fire crews said that containing a wildfire at the F. Gilbert Hills State Forest would be a 'a multi-day event.' Wind gusts topped 64 kph on Saturday, and less-powerful gusts continued Sunday. Firefighters and forest agencies warned against outdoor burning. The drier-than-normal weather is expected to continue, and virtually all of New England is categorized as being in drought or being abnormally dry. Most of the region was expected to see some light rain Sunday night, but there are no large rainfall events in the forecast, said National Weather Service meteorologist Jerry Combs. Firefighters in California were also battling a scattering of blazes over the weekend, including one north of Los Angeles that had burned more than 100 structures. Evacuation orders were downgraded to warnings for residents in several areas of Ventura County, where the Mountain Fire held at about 83 square kilometers and was 26% contained, authorities said.	https://www.voanews.com/a/ny-parks-employee-dies-fighting-fires-air-quality-warnings-are-issued-in-new-york-and-new-jersey/7858960.html	2024-11-10T11:43:15-08:00	
Iran says militant attack on Pakistani border leaves 5 security forces dead	Tehran, Iran — A militant attack near the Pakistani border with Iran left five Iranian forces dead, the state-run IRNA news agency reported Sunday. The report said the dead were ethnic Baluch members of the paramilitary Revolutionary Guard's volunteer Basij force and were killed in Saravan city in Sistan and Baluchistan province. Saravan is some 1,400 km (870 miles) southeast of the capital Tehran. No group immediately claimed responsibility for the attack. Earlier in the day, state TV reported that Revolutionary Guard forces killed three terrorists and arrested nine others in a military operation. The report did not specify which group the suspects belonged to. Last month, unknown gunmen killed four people, including the chief of the Revolutionary Guard in the province. In September, gunmen killed four border guards in Sistan and Baluchistan province in two separate attacks. The militant group Jaish al-Adl, which seeks greater rights for the ethnic Baluch minority, claimed responsibility for one attack in which one officer and two soldiers were killed. The province, which borders Afghanistan and Pakistan, has been the site of occasional deadly clashes involving militant groups, armed drug smugglers and Iranian security forces. It is one of the least developed parts of Iran. Relations between the predominantly Sunni Muslim residents of the region and Iran's Shiite theocracy have long been strained.	https://www.voanews.com/a/iran-says-militant-attack-on-pakistani-border-leaves-5-security-forces-dead/7858958.html	2024-11-10T11:31:33-08:00	
6.8 magnitude earthquake shakes Cuba after hurricanes and blackouts	Havana — A 6.8 magnitude earthquake shook eastern Cuba on Sunday, after weeks of hurricanes and blackouts that have left many on the island reeling. The epicenter of the quake was located approximately 40 km south of Bartolomé Masó, Cuba, according to a report by the United States Geological Survey. The rumbling was felt across the eastern stretch of Cuba, including in bigger cities like Santiago de Cuba. There were no immediate reports of damage or injuries. Residents in Santiago, Cuba's second largest city, were left shaken on Sunday. Yolanda Tabío, 76, said people in the city flocked to the streets and were still nervously sitting in their doorways. She said she felt at least two aftershocks following the quake, but that among friends and family she hadn't heard of any damages. 'You had to see how everything was moving, the walls, everything,' she told The Associated Press. The earthquake comes during another tough stretch for Cuba. On Wednesday, Category 3 Hurricane Rafael ripped through western Cuba, with strong winds knocking out power island-wide, destroying hundreds of homes and forcing evacuations of hundreds of thousands of people. Days after, much of the island was still struggling without power. Weeks before in October, the island was also hit by a one-two punch. First, it was hit by island-wide blackouts stretching on for days, a product of the island's energy crisis. Shortly after, it was slapped by a powerful hurricane that struck the eastern part of the island and killed at least six people. The blackouts and wider discontent among many struggling to get by has stoked small protests across the island.	https://www.voanews.com/a/magnitude-earthquake-shakes-cuba-after-hurricanes-and-blackouts-/7858936.html	2024-11-10T10:32:36-08:00

Donald Trump’s US presidential victory was sweeping	Washington — In the end, former U.S. President Donald Trump’s victory in last week’s 2024 national election for a new four-year presidential term in the White House was sweeping. Ahead of the Nov. 5 election, national polling showed Vice President Kamala Harris with a slight edge over Trump, maybe a percentage point or two, depending on the survey. Harris, the Democratic candidate, and Trump, a Republican, were virtually deadlocked, the surveys indicated, in seven political battleground states that election analysts viewed as critical to the election outcome. Trump, however, captured all seven states, leading to his lopsided edge in the state-by-state vote count in the Electoral College, 312 to 226, which determines the outcome of U.S. presidential elections. The number needed to clinch the presidency is 270. He won the seven battleground states by a range of just under 1% in Wisconsin to more than 6% in Arizona. On January 20, 2025, the 78-year-old Trump will take office as the country’s 47th president and the first president to win two nonconsecutive terms since Grover Cleveland in the 1890s. He is the oldest elected president in U.S. history. Trump also won the popular vote, the first Republican candidate to do so since former President George W. Bush in 2004. While the last ballots are still being counted, Trump already is the clear winner, capturing nearly 75 million votes so far to just under 71 million for Harris, a 50.5% to 47.9% edge for Trump. Trump’s 2024 vote tally was about the same as the 74 million he received in losing the 2020 election to Democratic President Joe Biden, but the vote for Harris was about 10 million fewer than Biden received. U.S. pollsters often like to say their surveys are just a snapshot in time, and not necessarily predictive. But over Trump’s three runs for the presidency since 2016, his level of support has consistently been underestimated in polling, no matter how many times pollsters have tried to adjust their published results to account for a hidden Trump vote from people unwilling to tell even anonymous surveyors that, yes, when they went to polling centers or cast mail-in ballots, he was their choice. Exit polls showed that women voters favored Harris and men Trump. More educated voters went for Harris, while those without college degrees voted for Trump, but nearly two-thirds of Americans do not have a college degree. In amassing his majority vote, Trump cut into two traditional Democratic constituencies, Black and Latino voters. According to The Associated Press’ VoteCast survey of voters, 16% of Black voters supported Trump in 2024, double that from his 2020 campaign. In comparison, 83% of Black voters supported Kamala Harris, down from the 91% who supported Biden in 2020. Democrats also lost ground among Latino voters, with 56% voting for Harris in 2024 compared to 63% for Biden in 2020. Trump’s support grew from 35% four years ago to 42% this year.	https://www.voanews.com/a/donald-trump-s-us-presidential-victory-was-sweeping-/7858897.html	2024-11-10T09:47:50-08:00	
Somalia insists Ethiopia not be part of new AU mission	A senior Somali official insisted Saturday that Ethiopia will not participate in a new African Union peacekeeping mission starting in January. The two nations remain deadlocked over a Memorandum of Understanding that Ethiopia signed with the breakaway region, Somaliland, earlier this year. 'I can say that Ethiopia is the only government we know of so far that will not participate in the new AU mission because it has violated our sovereignty and national unity,' Somalia Defense Minister Abdulkadir Mohamed Nur said Saturday in a government-run television interview. African Union troops from several countries have been operating in Somalia since 2007. They started with the African Union Mission in Somalia (AMISOM) before changing the mission and its name on April 1, 2022, to the African Union Transition Mission in Somalia (ATMIS). Its mandate ends at the end of this year. For 17 years, the African Union mission helped Somalia combat al-Shabab, a violent extremist organization that threatened to overthrow the government and impose a strict interpretation of Islamic law. The aim of past and upcoming missions is to hand over security responsibility to the Somali National Forces. The nation is preparing for a third peace support operation, set to begin January 1, 2025, when a new mission, the African Union Support Mission in Somalia (AUSSOM), replaces ATMIS. According to a United Nations report in August, ATMIS has been drawing down troops from about 20,000 to less than 13,000. The new mission is expected to number at least 12,000. AUSSOM is scheduled to operate until the end of 2028. It is not the first time Somalia has rejected the involvement of Ethiopian troops in a peacekeeping mission in the country. In August, Somalia Prime Minister Hamza Abdi Barre said Ethiopian forces would only join AUSSOM once Addis Ababa withdraws from the MoU with Somaliland. Mogadishu, which sees Somaliland as a part of Somalia, has described the agreement as an assault on its sovereignty and territorial integrity. Analysts say Somalia’s repeated demands that Ethiopia withdraw from the MoU have fallen on deaf ears, which further alienates Somalia. Professor Sonkor Geyre, a former director of the defense ministry, said Somalia has a right to choose the countries it wants and rejects others. 'Somalia has national sovereign rights to exclude Ethiopia from the upcoming AU mission because it sees Ethiopia’s actions, including its MoU with Somaliland, as a national threat,' Geyre told VOA Somali. Last month, the leaders of Somalia, Eritrea, and Egypt signed a security cooperation deal seen as an anti-Ethiopia front, and Mogadishu has also boosted its military ties with Cairo, which has offered troops for the new AU mission. 'There is an ongoing procedure that we will share and announce when the time comes regarding the new governments that will join and the previous ones who will not be part of the new mission,' Nur, the defense minister, said. Under the current AU mission, at least 3,000 Ethiopian soldiers officially operate as part of an African Union peacekeeping mission fighting al-Shabab. Another 5,000 to 7,000 Ethiopian soldiers are stationed in several regions under a bilateral agreement. Other countries contributing to the current AU forces in Somalia include Burundi, Djibouti, Kenya, and Uganda.	https://www.voanews.com/a/somalia-insists-ethiopia-not-be-part-of-new-au-mission-/7858887.html	2024-11-10T09:29:07-08:00	
Paris deploying extra police for France-Israel soccer match following Amsterdam violence	Paris — Paris police said Sunday that 4,000 officers and 1,600 stadium staff will be deployed for a France-Israel soccer match to ensure security in and around the stadium and on public transportation a week after violence against Israeli fans in Amsterdam. France and Israel are playing in a UEFA Nations League match Thursday. 'There's a context, tensions that make that match a high-risk event for us,' Paris police chief Laurent Nuñez said on French news broadcaster BFM TV, adding authorities 'won't tolerate' any violence. Nuñez said that 2,500 police officers would be deployed around the Stade de France stadium, north of the French capital, in addition to 1,500 others in Paris and on public transportation. 'There will be an anti-terrorist security perimeter around the stadium,' Nuñez said. Security checks will be 'reinforced,' he added, including with systematic pat-downs and bag searches. Nuñez said that French organizers have been in contact with Israeli authorities and security forces to prepare for the match. Israeli fans were assaulted last week after a soccer game in Amsterdam by hordes of young people apparently riled up by calls on social media to target Jewish people, according to Dutch authorities. Five people were treated at hospitals and dozens were arrested after the attacks, which were condemned as antisemitic by authorities in Amsterdam, Israel and across Europe. On Sunday, Dutch police detained several people for taking part in a demonstration in central Amsterdam that had been outlawed following the violence targeting Israeli fans, a local broadcaster reported. French Interior Minister Bruno Retailleau confirmed Friday that the France-Israel match would go ahead as planned. 'I think that for a symbolic reason we must not yield, we must not give up,' he said, noting that sports fans from around the world came together for the Paris Olympics this year to celebrate the 'universal values' of sports.	https://www.voanews.com/a/paris-deploying-extra-police-for-france-israel-soccer-match-following-amsterdam-violence-/7858875.html	2024-11-10T09:11:32-08:00	
Gunmen kill 10 in central Mexico bar attack	Mexico City — Gunmen in a truck pulled up to a bar in central Mexico and opened fire, killing 10 people, authorities said, in an area that had been spared the worst of the country's raging criminal violence. Security camera footage published by local media showed the perpetrators leaping from the vehicle and bursting into the venue as terrified customers fled or dived to the floor. The attack late Saturday on Los Cantaritos bar in Queretaro's downtown district left 10 people dead and at least seven injured, according to the city's public security department chief Juan Luis Ferrusca. 'Emergency services arrived at the scene and confirmed that at least four people armed with long weapons had arrived on board a pickup truck,' Ferrusca said in a video on social media. One suspect was detained and the vehicle used in the attack was found abandoned and set on fire, he said. The victims included three women, according to the Queretaro state prosecutor's office, which said forensic experts were examining the scene of the attack and the vehicle. Queretaro, the capital of Queretaro state, is considered one of the safer cities in Mexico, which has been plagued by years of drug cartel-related violence. 'The entire security system of Queretaro is mobilized to find the criminals' behind the attack, state governor Mauricio Kuri said on social media platform X. 'We will continue to shield our borders and maintain the security of our state,' he said, adding, 'Those responsible for this brutal act will be punished.' Queretaro, a city known more for its colonial architecture than for its crime, is around 200 kilometers northwest of Mexico City. Across Mexico, spiraling violence, much of it linked to drug trafficking and gangs, has seen more than 450,000 people murdered since 2006. Tackling the murders and kidnappings that are a daily occurrence is among the major challenges facing President Claudia Sheinbaum. The former Mexico City mayor, who became the country's first woman president on October 1, has ruled out declaring 'war' on drug cartels. Instead, she has pledged to continue her predecessor's strategy of using social policy to tackle crime at its roots, while also making better use of intelligence. The northwestern cartel stronghold of Sinaloa has seen a surge in violence since the July arrest of drug lord Ismael Zambada in the United States unleashed a wave of gang infighting. There has also been a spike in bloodshed in the southern state of Guerrero, the scene of long-running gang turf wars. Authorities said Thursday that the bodies of 11 people, including two minors, were found abandoned in a pickup truck in the state capital Chilpancingo. They were part of a group of 17 people -- reported to be traveling merchants -- who were declared missing last month.	https://www.voanews.com/a/gunmen-kill-10-in-central-mexico-bar-attack/7858882.html	2024-11-10T09:04:34-08:00

Opponents of ousted Bangladesh ex-premier Sheikh Hasina foil attempts to hold rally in Dhaka	Dhaka — Rival political groups of former Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina on Sunday thwarted a plan by her Awami League party to hold a rally in Bangladesh's capital, seen as a potential first effort to make a comeback on the streets since she fled the country in August amid a mass uprising. The rally in Dhaka by Hasina's party was to commemorate the death of a party activist on Nov. 10, 1987, which had sparked a mass protest against former military dictator H.M. Ershad. He was eventually ousted from office, ending his nine-year rule in 1990. The day is commemorated as 'democracy day.' In 1991, Bangladesh switched to a parliamentary democracy from a presidential form of government, and since then Hasina and her rival, former Prime Minister Khaleda Zia, became the most powerful political figures in the country. On Sunday, activists of the party headed by Zia, Hasina's main rival, and also members of the conservative Jamaat-e-Islami party took to the streets of Dhaka, filling up much of the area where the rally was scheduled to take place. Others, including hundreds of student protesters, also announced that they wouldn't allow Hasina's supporters to stand on the streets and hold the rally. The protesters said that they think Hasina's party was trying to make a comeback by holding a rally on the streets on Sunday. The protesters from the Anti-discrimination Student Movement, a group that led the mass uprising in July-August, aggressively hunted for supporters of Hasina. Groups of people surrounded the Awami League party's headquarters near the Noor Hossain Square in Dhaka where Hasina's supporters were supposed to gather to hold the rally. Security was tight in the area, but witnesses and local media said that the protesters attacked several supporters of Hasina when they attempted to reach there and chanted slogans in favor of the fallen leader. The Awami League party said that many of their activists were detained by police as they came under attacks. Tensions ran high throughout Sunday with the anti-Hasina protesters saying that they wouldn't allow the party to hold any public rally under any circumstances. The Awami League party posted a number of videos on Facebook on Sunday showing its supporters being manhandled. Its party headquarters had earlier been vandalized following Hasina's fall on Aug. 5, and on Sunday it was empty and there were signs of destruction. Outside, control was in the hands of Hasina's opponents. The political chaos in the South Asian nation went on as Zia's party was seeking quick reforms and a new election from an interim government headed by Nobel Peace laureate Muhammad Yunus. The party believes it will be able to form the new government in the absence of Hasina's party, while its other allies are also struggling. The Yunus-led government said it would seek extradition of Hasina and her close associates as they face charges of crimes against humanity involving deaths of hundreds of protesters during the uprising.	https://www.voanews.com/a/opponents-of-ousted-bangladesh-ex-premier-sheikh-hasina-foil-attempts-to-hold-rally-in-dhaka/7858817.html	2024-11-10T07:40:47-08:00	
Taliban delegation in Azerbaijan to make debut at UN climate summit	Islamabad — The Taliban in Afghanistan sent its representatives to Azerbaijan on Sunday to attend a major United Nations climate change conference, marking the first such participation since they seized power three years ago. State-run Afghan media reported that Muti-ul-Haq Khalis, head of the National Environmental Protection Agency, is leading the Taliban’s 'technical' delegation, which is expected to have observer status instead of full participation. The U.N. Climate Change Conference, commonly called COP29, is scheduled to start Monday in Baku, the capital city of Azerbaijan, and will run until November 22. The Taliban have been excluded from recent international climate change talks because no country has recognized them as the legitimate rulers of Afghanistan, nor have they been permitted to take the country’s seat at the U.N. General Assembly. Poverty-stricken Afghanistan is ranked as one of the most vulnerable countries to the climate crisis. It has recently encountered severe weather-related disasters like flash floods and prolonged droughts. Flash flooding earlier this year killed more than 350 Afghans, damaging close to 8,000 homes and displacing more than 5,000 families besides destroying crops and agricultural land. U.N. agencies report that the recent extreme weather in Afghanistan exhibits all the signs of the escalating climate crisis. Taliban authorities have sought to participate in U.N. climate summits, arguing that their political isolation should not prevent them from joining international climate talks and discussing the challenges facing their country. Host Azerbaijan invited the Afghan environment agency officials to COP29 as observers, enabling them to 'potentially participate in periphery discussions and potentially hold bilateral meetings,' the Reuters news agency quoted a diplomatic source familiar with the matter as saying. The Taliban’s restrictions on the freedoms of Afghan women have primarily deterred the world from formally engaging with their government. They have prohibited girls from receiving an education beyond the sixth grade and suspended female students from universities since regaining control of Afghanistan in August 2021, when the United States and NATO troops left the country. The Islamist leaders have enacted laws requiring Afghan women to cover their bodies and faces in public. Additionally, these laws prohibit women from undertaking long road or air trips unless accompanied by a male guardian. The Taliban say their governance is in line with their interpretation of the Islamic law of Sharia and reject international calls for reversing restrictions on women as an interference in the internal affairs of Afghanistan.	https://www.voanews.com/a/taliban-delegation-in-azerbaijan-to-make-debut-at-un-climate-summit/7858784.html	2024-11-10T07:09:50-08:00	
Dozens arrested after defying Amsterdam protest ban	Amsterdam — Dutch police arrested dozens of pro-Palestinian protesters in Amsterdam on Sunday after they defied a demonstration ban, put in place in the wake of clashes between Israeli football fans and groups of youths. Earlier in the day, the Amsterdam District Court upheld a decision by the mayor to ban protests in the city, three days after it was rocked by violence between Maccabi Tel Aviv football fans and men on scooters in several areas of the city. But hundreds of protesters nevertheless gathered in the city's Dam square, holding up placards that said 'We want our streets back' and chanting 'Free Palestine,' an AFP correspondent saw. Police in riot gear moved in on the protesters in the afternoon, shortly after the court upheld the ban on protests. In attacks that sparked outrage around the world, Maccabi Tel Aviv supporters were briefly hospitalized after coming under assault following a match with the local Ajax team on Thursday evening. The clashes came amid a rise in anti-Semitism globally since the start of the Israel-Hamas war in Gaza. 'The mayor has rightly decided that there will be a ban on demonstrating in the city this weekend,' the court announced on X. It therefore 'rejected the request' by protests to hold their demonstration. Dutch activist Frank van der Linde applied for an urgent permit to demonstrate on the city's famous Dam Square, despite a temporary ban on protests announced by mayor Femke Halsema on Friday. Van der Linde wanted to protest on the Dam against the 'genocide in Gaza, but also because our right to protest has been taken away,' Dutch national news agency ANP quoted him as saying. Friday's emergency measures also included heightened police protection and wearing of face masks, and will be in place until Monday morning. But on Sunday afternoon dozens of demonstrators started gathering at the square in the city's center, despite a heavy police presence. The protesters, who were peaceful, chanted slogans and carried placards including one that read: 'We can fight anti-Semitism and genocidal Zionism at the same time.' Tensions building Police said tensions already built ahead of a match between Ajax and Tel Aviv Maccabi at the Johann Cruyff Arena on Thursday. Maccabi fans burned a Palestinian flag on the Dam central square, and vandalized a taxi, Amsterdam police chief Peter Holla said. The Europa League game Thursday finished largely in a peaceful atmosphere, praised by the Ajax club. But sporadic incidents beforehand were linked to both Maccabi supporters, who were allegedly chanting anti-Palestinian slogans, and opposing groups of youths. After the match, groups of men on scooters engaged in 'hit-and-run' attacks on Maccabi fans in areas of the city. Police said the attackers were apparently mobilized by calls on social media to target Jewish people. Halsema described groups targeting fans of the Israeli club, beating and kicking them. 'This is an outburst of anti-Semitism that I hope to never see again,' Halsema said, adding that she was 'ashamed' by the violence. At least 63 people have been arrested so far, but only before and during the match. Four people remained in custody, prosecutors said. Police have launched a massive investigation and more arrests were expected.	https://www.voanews.com/a/dozens-arrested-after-defying-amsterdam-protest-ban/7858781.html	2024-11-10T07:09:10-08:00	
Philippines to evacuate 2,500 villages ahead of severe storm Toraji	Manila — The residents of 2,500 villages were ordered to evacuate their homes as severe tropical storm Toraji approached the northern Philippines, the government said Sunday, after three massive cyclones battered the country in less than a month. Nearly 700,000 people are still sheltering at evacuation centers or with relatives after their homes were destroyed by tropical cyclones Trami, Kong-rey and Yinxing, according to government figures given to AFP. The previous trio of storms killed 159 people and with Toraji due to make landfall on Monday, people living in 2,500 villages across the northern regions of Ilocos, Cagayan Valley and Cordillera have been ordered to evacuate, Interior and Local Government Secretary Jonvic Remulla said. 'The soil in those areas is now very saturated and the risk of landslides is very high,' Remulla said in a briefing on Sunday. 'We cannot stress it enough, the evacuation orders are important.' Toraji, packing maximum sustained wind speeds of 110 kilometers (68 miles) per hour, was expected to unleash torrential rains and strong winds when it makes landfall over the northern provinces of Aurora or Isabela, the state weather agency said. The military and police have also prepositioned at least 14 aircraft for rescue and transportation of food in areas that could be isolated. Sea travel has also been suspended and dams have started to release water in advance to prevent flooding, Remulla said. Toraji's approach has complicated recovery efforts from the three previous storms. On Thursday, Typhoon Yinxing slammed into the country's north coast. It left a 12-year-old girl dead and damaged houses and buildings. Around 51,000 people are still displaced in badly-hit Cagayan province north of Manila, with at least seven of its towns still without power, the provincial disaster agency said in a report Sunday. Weeks before that, Severe Tropical Storm Trami and Super Typhoon Kong-rey together left 158 people dead, the national disaster agency said, with most of that tally attributed to Trami. About 20 big storms and typhoons hit the archipelago nation or its surrounding waters each year. A recent study showed that storms in the Asia-Pacific region are increasingly forming closer to coastlines, intensifying more rapidly and lasting longer over land due to climate change.	https://www.voanews.com/a/philippines-to-evacuate-2-500-villages-ahead-of-severe-storm-toraji/7858725.html	2024-11-10T05:35:22-08:00	
King Charles III and Kate attend remembrance event as both slowly return to duty	London — King Charles III led the nation Sunday in a two-minute silence in remembrance of fallen service personnel in central London as the Princess of Wales looked on, a further sign the royal family is slowly returning to normal at the end of a year in which two of the most popular royals were sidelined by cancer. Remembrance Sunday is a totemic event in the U.K., with the monarch leading senior royals, political leaders, including Prime Minister Keir Starmer and his eight living predecessors, and envoys from the Commonwealth countries in laying wreaths at the Cenotaph, the Portland stone memorial that serves as the focal point for honoring the nation’s war dead. The service is held on the second Sunday of November to mark the signing of the armistice to end World War I 'on the eleventh hour of the eleventh day of the eleventh month' in 1918. Across the U.K., services are conducted at the same time in memory of the dead. After the two-minute silence, buglers from the Royal Marines played the Last Post and Charles led the wreath-laying part of the service. The 75-year-old king, dressed in his Royal Navy uniform of the Admiral of the Fleet, laid a wreath of poppies at the base of the Cenotaph in recognition of the fallen from conflicts dating back to World War I. His eldest son and the heir to the throne, William, left his own floral tribute — featuring the Prince of Wales’ feathers and a new ribbon in Welsh red. Dressed in somber black, his wife, Kate, watched on from a balcony of the nearby Foreign, Commonwealth & Development Office, as is tradition. Queen Camilla, who would normally be standing next to the princess, was not present as she recovered from a chest infection. It is the first time since the start of the year that Kate is carrying out two consecutive days of public official engagements. On Saturday, she attended the Royal British Legion Festival Of Remembrance at the Royal Albert Hall. Following the wreath-laying, around 10,000 veterans, including those who have fought in wars this century, notably in Afghanistan and Iraq, marched past the Cenotaph. With the passage of time, there were only a handful of World War II veterans present. Charles’ ceremonial role as commander in chief of the armed forces is a holdover from the days when the monarch led his troops into battle. But the link between the monarchy and the military is still very strong, with service members taking an oath of allegiance to the king and members of the royal family supporting service personnel through a variety of charities. Charles and William served on active duty in the military before taking up full-time royal duties. 'They are showing respect to us, as we’ve shown to them by serving,' said Victor Needham-Crofton, 91, an army veteran who served during the Suez Crisis of 1956 and later in Kenya. Charles was diagnosed with an undisclosed form of cancer in February, forcing him to step away from public appearances for two months as he focused on his treatment and recovery. Just a few weeks later, Kate announced her own cancer diagnosis, which sidelined her for much of the year as she underwent chemotherapy. The king has been in good form in recent months and recently completed a taxing trip to Australia and Samoa. Kate, who made her first post-diagnosis public appearance during the monarch's birthday parade in June, is slowly returning to public duties. Prince William reflected this week on the strain that the cancer scare has placed on the royal family. 'I’m so proud of my wife, I’m proud of my father, for handling the things that they have done,' William told reporters on Thursday as he wrapped up a four-day trip to South Africa. 'But from a personal family point of view, it’s been, yeah, it’s been brutal.' While the Cenotaph was the focus of the national remembrance service, communities throughout the U.K. held their own ceremonies on Sunday. Needham-Crofton, who served with the Royal Inniskilling Fusiliers before a truck accident ended his military career, planned to attend a local service in Eastbourne on the south coast of England. He has spent much of his time honoring veterans and trying to help them, including 20 years as a volunteer for the Taxi Charity for Military Veterans. Like some of his army tasks, raising cash was rather grueling as it involved standing in front of London subway stations collecting coins to help fund the group’s efforts. 'I like to respect all the veterans and do what I can for them,’’ he told The Associated Press. 'It’s a brotherhood really. Even if you don’t know a veteran that you meet, you feel a kinship toward them. That is very important to me. I shall be like that for the rest of my life.’’	https://www.voanews.com/a/princess-kate-makes-rare-consecutive-public-appearances-after-cancer-diagnosis-/7858709.html	2024-11-10T05:02:35-08:00	
IAEA chief to visit Iran on Wednesday	DUBAI, United Arab Emirates — U.N. nuclear watchdog chief Rafael Grossi will visit Iran next Wednesday and start consultations with Iranian officials the following day, state media reported on Sunday. The head of the International Atomic Energy Agency said on Wednesday he might head to Iran in the coming days to discuss its disputed nuclear program and that he expected to work cooperatively with U.S. President-elect Donald Trump. Long-standing issues between Iran, the IAEA, and Western powers include Tehran barring uranium-enrichment experts from IAEA inspection teams in the country and its failure for years to explain uranium traces found at undeclared sites. Iran has also stepped up nuclear activity since 2019, after then-President Trump abandoned a 2015 deal Iran reached with world powers under which it curbed enrichment -- seen by the West as a disguised effort to develop nuclear weapons capability -- and restored tough U.S. sanctions on the Islamic Republic. Tehran is now enriching uranium to up to 60% fissile purity, close to the roughly 90% required for an atom bomb. It has enough higher-enriched uranium to produce about four nuclear bombs, if refined further, according to an IAEA yardstick. Iran has long denied any nuclear bomb ambitions, saying it is enriching uranium for civilian energy uses only.	https://www.voanews.com/a/iaea-chief-to-visit-iran-on-wednesday/7858666.html	2024-11-10T02:27:03-08:00	
Vietnam detains pro-democracy activist: state media	Hanoi, Vietnam — Vietnamese authorities arrested a pro-democracy activist, state media said, the latest in a crackdown on political dissidents in the southeast Asian country. Tran Khac Duc, 29, was held on charges of 'creating, storing, distributing or disseminating information, documents and items aimed at opposing the Socialist Republic of Vietnam,' according to the publication Safeguarding the Law. He was arrested in September, but authorities only announced his detention through state media on Saturday. Duc is affiliated with the Assembly for Democracy and Pluralism organization, whose website says it aims to 'establish a multi-party democratic system' in the communist nation. Its website praised Duc as an 'intelligent, wise, dynamic and gentle young man' who 'firmly believes that Vietnam should progress towards a pluralistic democracy,' maintaining that he is an 'informal member' of the group. It reposted state media's announcement of Duc's arrest but did not directly comment on it. The ADP was founded in 1982 and is led by Nguyen Gia Kieng, an intellectual and former official of the U.S.-allied South Vietnamese government before the end of the Vietnam War in 1975. Kieng -- who lives in exile in France -- told Radio Free Asia Saturday that ADP members had previously been harassed and beaten by police, but that Duc's arrest was 'unusual.' It comes less than two weeks after a Vietnamese court sentenced a blogger who criticized the government to 12 years in jail on the same charges. The country ranks 174th out of 180 countries in the Reporters Without Borders campaign group's World Press Freedom Index.	https://www.voanews.com/a/vietnam-detains-pro-democracy-activist-state-media/7858662.html	2024-11-10T01:52:39-08:00	
Indonesia's new leader calls for collaboration with China before heading to US	BEIJING — Indonesia's new leader called for collaboration rather than confrontation with China after the signing of $10 billion in new deals at a business forum on Sunday in the Chinese capital before heading to the U.S. President Prabowo Subianto told the forum that his country wants to be part of China's emergence as not only an economic but also a 'civilizational power.' 'We must give an example that in this modern age, collaboration — not confrontation — is the way for peace and prosperity,' he said. Subianto wrapped up the first stop of his first overseas trip since taking office three weeks ago. He is headed next to Washington — where the U.S. government is confronting China's rise — and then to Peru and Brazil for the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation and Group of 20 summits. He and Chinese President Xi Jinping agreed Saturday to deepen ties, elevating security to a fifth 'pillar' of cooperation in addition to political, economic, maritime and people-to-people exchange. They agreed to hold a first-ever joint meeting of their foreign and defense ministers in 2025, a joint statement said. 'Indonesia is very clear,' Subianto said. 'We have always been nonaligned, we have always been respectful of all great powers in the world.' Indonesia has remained on the periphery of the territorial disputes between China and its Southeast Asian neighbors in the South China Sea. It doesn't have a formal dispute with Beijing though Indonesia said its patrol ships repeatedly drove a Chinese coast guard vessel away from an Indonesian energy company vessel conducting a seismic survey less than a month ago. Chinese companies have invested heavily in mining in Indonesia, as they have elsewhere in the world. China also helped build Indonesia's first high-speed railway, a 142-kilometer route between Jakarta and Bandung that opened last year. But a flood of low-priced Chinese products has hit Indonesia's garment makers hard, shuttering factories and prompting calls for import tariffs. The government has sought to placate domestic producers while not angering the country's biggest trading partner.	https://www.voanews.com/a/indonesia-s-new-leader-calls-for-collaboration-with-china-before-heading-to-us/7858656.html	2024-11-10T01:35:22-08:00	
1760 schoolhouse for Black U.S. children holds complicated history of slavery, resilience	WILLIAMSBURG, Virginia — A Virginia museum has nearly finished restoring the nation's oldest surviving schoolhouse for Black children, where hundreds of mostly enslaved students learned to read through a curriculum that justified slavery. The museum, Colonial Williamsburg, also has identified more than 80 children who lined its pinewood benches in the 1760s. They include Aberdeen, 5, who was enslaved by a saddle and harness maker. Bristol and George, 7 and 8, were owned by a doctor. Phoebe, 3, was the property of local tavern keepers. Another student, Isaac Bee, later emancipated himself. In newspaper ads seeking his capture, his enslaver warned that Bee 'can read.' The museum dedicated the Williamsburg Bray School at a large ceremony on Friday, with plans to open it for public tours this spring. Colonial Williamsburg tells the story of Virginia's colonial capital through interpreters and hundreds of restored buildings. 'An amazing mirror' Smithsonian Institution Secretary Lonnie Bunch told the crowd outside the refurbished school that it was one of the most important historic moments of the last decade. 'History is an amazing mirror,' Bunch added. 'It's a mirror that challenges us and reminds us that, despite what we've achieved, despite all our ideals, America still is a work in progress. But, oh, what an amazing work it is.' The Cape Cod-style home was built in 1760 and still contains much of its original wood and brick. It will anchor a complicated story about race and education, but also resistance, before the American Revolution. The school rationalized slavery within a religious framework and encouraged children to accept their fates as God's plan. And yet, becoming literate also gave them more agency. The students went on to share what they learned with family members and others who were enslaved. 'We don't shy away from the fact that this was a pro-slavery school,' said Maureen Elgersman Lee, director of William & Mary's Bray School Lab, a partnership between the university and museum. But she said the school takes on a different meaning in the 21st century. 'It's a story of resilience and resistance,' Lee said. 'And I put the resilience of the Bray School on a continuum that brings us to today.' To underscore the point, the lab has been seeking descendants of the students, with some success. They include Janice Canaday, 67, who also is the museum's African American community engagement manager. Her lineage traces back to the students Elisha and Mary Jones. 'It grounds you,' said Canaday, who grew up feeling little connection to history. 'That's where your power is. And those are the things that give you strength — to know what your family has come through.' Franklin's idea The Bray School was established in Williamsburg and other colonial cities at the recommendation of founding father Benjamin Franklin. He was a member of a London-based Anglican charity that was named after Thomas Bray, an English clergyman and philanthropist. The Bray School was exceptional for its time. White leaders across much of Colonial America forbade educating enslaved people, fearing literacy would encourage them to seek freedom. The white teacher at the Williamsburg school, a widow named Ann Wager, taught an estimated 300 to 400 students, whose ages ranged from 3 to 10. The school closed with her death in 1774. The schoolhouse became a private home before it was incorporated into William & Mary's growing campus. The building was moved and expanded for various purposes, including student housing. Historians identified the structure in 2020 through a scientific method that examines tree rings in lumber. Last year, it was transported to Colonial Williamsburg, which includes parts of the original city. The museum and university have focused on restoring the schoolhouse, researching its curriculum and finding descendants of former students. The lab has been able to link some people to the Jones and Ashby families, two free Black households that had students in the school, said Elizabeth Drembus, the lab's genealogist. But the effort has faced steep challenges: Most enslaved people were stripped of their identities and separated from their families, so there are limited records. And only three years of school rosters have survived. They 'weren't considered people' Drembus is talking to people in the region about their family histories and working backward. She also is sifting through 18th-century property records, tax documents and enslavers' diaries. 'When you're talking about researching formerly enslaved people, records were kept very differently because they weren't considered people,' Drembus said. Researching the curriculum has been easier. The English charity cataloged the books it sent to the schools, said Katie McKinney, an associate curator of maps and prints at the museum. Materials include a small spelling primer, a copy of which was located in Germany, that begins with the alphabet and moves on to syllables, such as 'Beg leg meg peg.' Students also received a more sophisticated speller, bound in sheepskin, as well as the Book of Common Prayer and other Christian texts. Meanwhile, the schoolhouse has been mostly restored. About 75% of the original floor has survived, allowing visitors to walk where the children and teacher placed their feet. Canaday, whose familial roots include two Bray School students, wondered on a recent visit if any of the children 'felt safe in here, whether they felt loved.' Canaday noted that the teacher, Wager, was the mother of at least two kids. 'Did some of her mothering bleed over into what she showed those children?' Canaday said. 'There are moments when we forget to go by the rules and humanity takes over. I wonder how many times that happened in these spaces.'	https://www.voanews.com/a/schoolhouse-for-black-u-s-children-holds-complicated-history-of-slavery-resilience-/7857921.html	2024-11-10T01:22:44-08:00	
Temple of Satan gains ground in Chile as faith in traditional religions wanes	SANTIAGO, Chile — It's Friday night in Santiago, and 15 people gather around a table, sharing a bottle of wine as the smell of tobacco and incense fill the air. Black candles burn on top of an altar decorated with chalices and knives. The members of the Temple of Satan are about to start a ritual. Five years after the Satanic Temple of the United States made headlines — and unleashed a wave of panic — when it was designated a church, a similar organization in Chile, a conservative country where half of its population of 18 million identifies as Catholic, is asking the government to be recognized legally as a religious association. Scholars, believers and residents consulted by The Associated Press note that Chile, where a long-lasting tradition of Catholicism has played a leading role in public discussions, is experiencing a crisis of faith, following revelations of multiple sexual abuse scandals within the Catholic Church over the years. 'These types of organizations now feel that they have greater support to challenge what was virtually impossible before,' said Luis Bahamondes, a professor at the Center for Judaic Studies at the University of Chile. And that's because, 'until very recently, the Catholic Church enjoyed an unprecedented power. It had an opinion on everything: politics, economics, geopolitics, sexuality and education.' No sacrifices, devil worship Despite its name, the Temple of Satan: Satanists and Luciferians of Chile does not embark on sacrifices nor ask its congregants to worship the devil. Among its 100 members are people who work as publicists, firefighters, police officers, lawyers and psychologists, and who have found in the organization a way to defy moral norms, dogmas and religious impositions. While they embrace the term Satanist, they don't revere or believe in Satan. Instead, they worship rationality, individualism, pleasure and the mundane life. Rather than gods, they praise humankind. 'You are the owner of your present and future, there is no God that makes decisions for you,' said Haborym, a spokesperson for the group, during a walk through tombs and mausoleums at the General Cemetery of Santiago. He noted that the figure of Satan is purely symbolic and their rituals are performed 'to bring out the emotions and leave the intellect aside.' Haborym and other members of the Temple of Satan in Chile spoke on condition their real names not be used, particularly with many holding public-facing jobs, citing growing threats. While Hollywood movies like 'Rosemary's Baby' and TV series such as 'True Detective' helped to portray the idea of Satanists as linked to sacrifice, evil, pain and death, modern groups like Chile's Temple of Satan are strongly against animal abuse, prohibit the affiliation of people with criminal records, see pleasures as a delight rather than a sin, and do not express their opinions unless asked. 'We don't want people killing in the name of Satan,' said Haborym. How to join In order to join Chile's Temple of Satan, applicants are requested to go through a lengthy process that includes filling out a form, showing proof of not having a criminal record, being interviewed by a special commission and, finally, being evaluated by a psychologist. Once they are accepted, members can choose a new name — normally that of a demon or fallen angel — with which they will be identified inside the temple and among other associates. Founded in 2021, Chile's Temple of Satan has 100 members, and more than 400 people applied to join in the past few weeks, said Haborym. The interest spiked at the end of July, when the group formally requested that the country's Ministry of Justice legally recognize it as a religious association. A media frenzy followed, unleashing a heated debate and causing a stir among Chile's main religious denominations. 'The history of Satanism is well known [and] it has often been the cause of tragedies,' the leaders of several churches in Chile, including the Catholic, Anglican, Jewish and Evangelical, said in a joint statement. Following in the steps of the Church of Satan, founded in 1966 by Anton Szandor LaVey, modern Satanists praise skepticism and logic over celestial or supernatural beings. Its followers are free to formulate their own beliefs, rites and spiritual practices. Many self-described Satanists and Luciferians are atheists. Others say they are witches or believe in the power of magic. 'We do accept that there are certain bases, both academic and esoteric, that give meaning to our existence and reality,' said Azazel, who quit Judaism four years ago and, one year later, founded the Temple of Satan of Chile. His words resonate in the darkness of the chamber and are interspersed with chants, clapping, mantras and readings of passages from the Satanic Bible and the Bible of the Adversary, the main guidelines of the group. Disappointed worshippers Just like Azazel, others have turned to the Temple of Satan out of disappointment with traditional religions. The new congregants include not only occultists and esotericists, but also Catholics, Jews, Protestants and Evangelicals. 'In Satanism there are no solutions or absolute truths. You are your own god and you create your own reality,' said Kali Ma, a dentistry student who was born and raised in a Jehovah's Witness family. 'If we compare both, Jehovah's Witnesses are the real sect,' she said. 'They don't let you do certain things, they tell you how to dress, what to do, how to behave, whether or not to grow a beard.' Nestor da Costa, an expert in secularism and religion at the Catholic University of Uruguay, said the influx of people seeking answers through different perspectives might be linked to the search for less dogmatic approaches. 'It may be a readjustment of the religious side of people who leave Catholicism but continue to believe in something,' he said. It is unclear if the Chilean government will legally recognize the Temple of Satan as a legitimate religious association, but its very existence has already helped to spark a discussion that until recently was unthinkable in this conservative society. Demanding recognition is the ultimate expression of everything praised by Satanic aesthetics: the rebellion against the status quo and the breakup with deep-rooted traditions. 'We comply with everything that is requested of us as a religious entity,' says Haborym. 'So there would be no reason to reject us beyond the fact that we're a controversial figure.'	https://www.voanews.com/a/temple-of-satan-gains-ground-in-chile-as-faith-in-traditional-religions-wanes-/7857905.html	2024-11-10T01:21:57-08:00	
With the holidays approaching, US stores stock more supersize TV sets	NEW YORK — For some television viewers, size apparently does matter. Forget the 165-centimeter TVs that were considered bigger than average a decade ago. In time for the holidays, manufacturers and retailers are rolling out more XXL screens measuring more than 2.4 meters diagonally. That's wider than a standard three-seat sofa or a king-size bed. Supersize televisions only accounted for 1.7% of revenue from all TV set sales in the U.S. during the first nine months of the year, according to market research firm Circana. But companies preparing for shoppers to go big for Christmas, Hanukkah and Kwanzaa have reason to think the growing ultra category will be a bright spot in an otherwise tepid television market, according to analysts. The 38,100 televisions of at least 246 centimeters sold between January and September represented a tenfold increase from the same period last year, Circana said. Best Buy, the nation's largest consumer electronics chain, doubled the assortment of hefty TVs — the 19 models range in price from $2,000 to $25,000 — and introduced displays in roughly 70% of its stores. 'It's really taken off this year,' Blake Hampton, Best Buy's senior vice president of merchandising, said. Analysts credit the emerging demand to improved technology and much lower prices. So far this year, the average price for TVs spanning at least 246 centimeters was $3,113 compared to $6,662 last year, according to Circana. South Korean electronics manufacturer Samsung introduced its first 249-centimeter TV in 2019 with a hefty price tag of $99,000; it now has four versions starting at $4,000, the company said. Anthony Ash, a 42-year-old owner of a wood pallet and recycling business, recently bought a 949-centimeter Sony for his 1,300-square-meter house in Bristol, Wisconsin. The device, which cost about $5,000 excluding installation fees, replaced an 216-centimeter TV in the great room off his kitchen. Ash now has 17 televisions at home and uses some to display digital art. 'We just saw that the price was affordable for what we were looking for and thought, 'Why not?'' he said of deciding to upsize to the Sony. 'You get a better TV experience with a bigger TV. You're sitting watching TV with a person on TV that is the same size as you. You can put yourself in the scene.' The amount of time that many people spend staring at their cellphones and tablets, including to stream movies and TV shows, is another factor driving the growth of widescreen TV screens. Overall TV sales revenue fell 4%, while the number of units sold rose 1% from the January through September period, Circana said. Most people only invest in a television every seven years, but when they do, they typically choose bigger ones, according to Rick Kowalski, the senior director of business intelligence at the Consumer Technology Association. In the past 15 years, the size of flat-panel TVs that were shipped to U.S. retailers and dealers grew an average of one inch a year, Kowalski said. The coronavirus pandemic accelerated the elongation trend as people spent more time at home. In fact, screen sizes increased an average of 5 centimeters in both 2021 and 2022, and 216-centimeter TVs began gaining traction with consumers, Kowalski said. Shipments of 249-centimeter TVs to the U.S. are picking up pace this year, and models as huge as 279-292 centimeters are on the market right now, he said. 'You get better resolution over time,' Kowalski said. 'You get better picture quality. And so just over time, it's easier to produce those sets and improve the technology.' Best Buy's Hampton said a benefit of a colossal TV is the viewer can watch multiple shows at once, an experience he described as 'incredible.' 'If you're watching YouTube TV content or ' NFL Sunday Ticket,' you can actually get four screens up, and that's four 48-inch (122-centimeter) screens on it,' he said. Manufacturers are also adding new features. Samsung said it designed its 249-centimeter lineup with a component that analyzes what the viewer is watching to increase sharpness and reduce visible noise across every scene. James Fishler, senior vice president of the home entertainment division of Samsung's U.S. division, said the way people watch TV and experience content is shifting. 'It's even more so about watching TV as a shared experience,' Fishler said. 'They want to host a watch party and gather around their TV to watch the big game, or set up a cinematic movie experience right at home. ' Walmart, the nation's largest retailer, its Sam's Club division, and Chicago retailer Abt Electronics, also say they are expanding their TV ranges to meet customer demand for supersize screens. TV industry experts say these monster TVs are beginning to encroach on home theater projectors, which create a 254- to 305-centimeter image that is less sharp and require rooms with blackout curtains or without windows. 'A dedicated viewing room for watching movies was exclusively the purview of projectors,' Andrew Sivori, vice president in the entertainment division of LG Electronics, another Korean manufacturer. 'But you can get a much better viewing experience with direct TV.' Retailers and TV makers said the buyers trading up range from millennials and members of Generation X to the tech-native Gen Z crowd. But as Jon Abt, co-president of Abt Electronics said, 'It's still a niche business.' 'A lot of people just don't have the space to put one of those in,' he added. Before dreaming big for the holidays, shoppers therefore should make sure a 249-centimeter TV will fit. Best Buy said its Geek Squad team asks if stairwells and entry halls are large enough to accommodate delivery and installation. An augmented reality feature on the Best Buy app that allows customers to see if products are the right size has been especially helpful for XXL TVs, the retailer said. But for those worried about having the space for viewing, the good news is that the recommended distance for a 249-centimeter TV is actually just 1.8-3.6 meters feet from the seating area. The rule of thumb is to multiple the diagonal length of the TV by 1.2 to determine the ideal viewing distance, Samsung's Fishler said. If bigger is better in the TV department, how big can they go? 'I think we'll have to wait and see,' Fishler said.	https://www.voanews.com/a/with-the-holidays-approaching-us-stores-stock-more-supersize-tv-sets-/7856294.html	2024-11-10T01:21:22-08:00	
Report finds Church of England covered up 'horrific' abuse at summer camps decades ago	london — The Church of England covered up 'horrific' abuse by a lawyer who volunteered at Christian summer camps in the 1970s and 1980s, and the ceremonial head of the Anglican Communion failed to report him to authorities when he learned of the abuse in 2013, according to an independent review released Thursday. John Smyth, who died in South Africa in 2018 at age 75, physically, sexually, psychologically and spiritually abused about 30 boys and young men in the U.K. and 85 in Africa over five decades, the 251-page report commissioned by the church found. Smyth is believed to be the most prolific serial abuser associated with the church. 'Many of the victims who took the brave decision to speak to us about what they experienced have carried this abuse silently for more than 40 years,' said Keith Makin, who led the review. 'Despite the efforts of some individuals to bring the abuse to the attention of authorities, the responses by the Church of England and others were wholly ineffective and amounted to a coverup.' The church said it was 'deeply sorry for the horrific abuse,' adding 'there is never a place for covering up abuse.' Smyth, who was an accomplished lawyer and charismatic speaker, was a volunteer leader at the Iwerne camps. The camps held in several locations were associated with the church and were developed to prepare young men from leading schools for high offices in the church and other parts of society. 14,000 strokes of the cane Smyth used a cane to punish campers for 'sins' that included 'pride,' making sexual remarks, masturbation or, in one case, looking at a girl too long, according to the report. The victims and Smyth were at least partly, if not fully, naked during the savage beatings. 'The scale and severity of the practice was horrific,' the report noted. 'Beatings of 100 strokes for masturbation, 400 for pride, and one of 800 strokes for some undisclosed 'fall' are recorded.' Eight of the victims received about 14,000 strokes of the cane and two reported 8,000 lashes over three years. Eight men said they often bled from the whippings and others reported bruising and scarring. A secret report of the abuse was compiled by a minister in 1982 and other church officers were aware of it, but police were never contacted. 'I thought it would do the work of God immense damage if this were public,' the now-deceased Rev. David Fletcher told people who worked on the new report. Smyth was strongly encouraged to leave and ended up moving to Zimbabwe with this wife and children, the report said. He received financial help from church officers. 'Church officers knew of the abuse and failed to take the steps necessary to prevent further abuse occurring,' the report said. Church officials, including Archbishop of Canterbury Justin Welby, the ceremonial head of the church, had another opportunity to report Smyth — and prevent any potential further abuse — when they learned of it in 2013, but didn't do so, the report said. Welby, who attended Iwerne camps and had known Smyth, said he was unaware of the abuse before 2013. 'Nevertheless the review is clear that I personally failed to ensure that after disclosure in 2013 the awful tragedy was energetically investigated,' Welby said. The report said that if Smyth had been reported to police at that time, it could have uncovered the truth and led to a possible criminal conviction. 'In effect, three and a half years was lost, a time within which John Smyth could have been brought to justice and any abuse he was committing in South Africa discovered and stopped,' the report said. Word of his abuse was not made public until a 2017 investigation by Channel 4, which led Hampshire Police to start an investigation. Police were planning to question Smyth at the time of his death and had been prepared to extradite him.	https://www.voanews.com/a/report-finds-church-of-england-covered-up-horrific-abuse-at-summer-camps-decades-ago/7856280.html	2024-11-10T01:20:45-08:00	
A Texas border county backed Democrats for generations; Trump won it decisively	RIO GRANDE CITY, Texas — Jorge Bazán's family has lived on the U.S.-Mexico border for generations and voted for Democrats as long as he can remember. He broke the family tradition this year and voted for Donald Trump because he doesn't trust the Democratic Party's economic policies. 'I think they forgot about the middle class,' said Bazán, who works for the utility company in Rio Grande City, seat of the most Hispanic county in the nation. 'People are suffering right now. Everything's very expensive.' The South Texas region — stretching from San Antonio to the Rio Grande Valley — has long been a Democratic stronghold. A slide toward Trump in 2020 rattled Democrats in the predominately Hispanic area, where for decades Republicans seldom bothered to field candidates in local races. However, few Democrats expected the dramatic realignment that happened Tuesday, when Trump flipped several counties along the border including Hidalgo and Cameron, the two most populous counties in the Rio Grande Valley. In Starr County, where Bazán lives, voters backed a Republican presidential candidate for the first time in a century. The predominantly Hispanic and working-class rural county, with a median household income of $36,000 that's one of the lowest in the nation, gave Trump a 16 percentage-point victory margin over Vice President Kamala Harris. Roughly 2 million residents live at Texas' southernmost point, among vast tracts of farmland and many state and federal agents patrolling the border. Trump's victories in the Rio Grande Valley starkly showed how working-class voters nationwide are shifting toward Republicans. That includes voters on the Texas border, where many Democrats long argued that Trump's promised crackdowns on immigration would turn off voters. 'I was always a lifelong Democrat, but I decided to change to Republican with the political landscape that it is now,' said Luis Meza, a 32-year-old Starr County voter. 'I felt that going Republican was the better choice, especially with the issues of immigration and everything like that that's going on.' Meza said that he was against Trump at first but noticed too few changes under President Joe Biden to justify voting for Harris. Biden won Hidalgo County by less than half the margin that Hillary Clinton did in 2016. Since then, Republicans have invested millions of dollars to persuade Hispanic and working-class voters soured by Democratic policies. A similar scenario played out in the state's three most competitive races in nearby counties. Republican Rep. Monica De La Cruz claimed a decisive victory in the 15th Congressional District. In the two other races, seasoned Democratic incumbents barely held on to their seats. Democratic Rep. Henry Cuellar narrowly escaped defeat against a political newcomer in the most competitive race of his two-decade career. Cuellar, whose district includes Rio Grande City, was indicted this year on bribery and other charges for allegedly accepting $600,000 from companies in Mexico and Azerbaijan. His support for abortion restrictions makes him one of the most conservative Democrats in the House. Democratic Rep. Vicente Gonzalez also narrowly escaped defeat by an opponent he comfortably beat two years ago. Nationally, Black and Latino voters appeared slightly less likely to support Harris than they were to back Biden four years ago, according to AP VoteCast data. More than half of Hispanic voters supported Harris, but that was down slightly from the roughly 6 in 10 who backed Biden in 2020. Trump's support among those groups appeared to rise slightly compared to 2020. In McAllen, Texas, Jose Luis Borrego said that inflation and the promise of tougher border restrictions made him vote for a Republican presidential candidate for the first time. 'I wanted to see change and that's why I did vote for Trump. I did vote red. I would not call myself a Republican' Borrego, 37, said. He said that he voted for Hillary Clinton and Independent Sen. Bernie Sanders in prior elections. Borrego's whole family voted Trump. 'We just (made) this choice, because we didn't have another choice that we felt comfortable with,' he said. Republican Sen. Ted Cruz said he had months of visits to the region during his campaign race against Democratic U.S. Rep. Colin Allred. In a victory speech on Election Day, Cruz said Hispanic voters are leaving the Democratic Party because of immigration. 'They are coming home to conservative values they never left. They understand something the liberal elites never will: There's nothing progressive about open borders,' Cruz said. 'There is nothing Latino about letting criminals roam free.' Michael Mireles, the director of civil engagement for labor rights group La Unión del Pueblo Entero, believes that Democrats did not engage Hispanic voters enough about the issues that concern them. 'I think that folks on the Democratic side have been really slow to have those conversations with Latino households and families.' Mireles said in Hidalgo County after Election Day. 'We can't wait for a big election to have those conversations. By that point, it's too late.'	https://www.voanews.com/a/a-texas-border-county-backed-democrats-for-generations-trump-won-it-decisively/7856263.html	2024-11-10T01:20:08-08:00	
Florida's iconic Key deer face an uncertain future as seas rise	BIG PINE KEY, Florida — The world's only Key deer, the smallest subspecies of the white-tailed deer, are found in piney and marshy wetlands bordered by the Atlantic Ocean and Gulf of Mexico on the Florida Keys. For years, their biggest threat was being struck by vehicles speeding along U.S. Highway 1 or local roads. But those waters surrounding the islands now pose the biggest long-term risk for this herd of about 800 deer as sea rise jeopardizes their sole habitat. These charismatic diminutive deer have been listed as endangered for almost 60 years after their numbers dipped to about 50 from hunting and poaching long ago. Yet they've made a tremendous comeback, with a peak population of about 1,000 in the mid-2010s before a deadly parasite and Hurricane Irma took a heavy toll. However, experts and wildlife advocates say this conservation success story today is at risk of being undone by climate change. Sea level rise is already altering the landscape of Big Pine Key and at least 20 smaller islands the deer call home. The bulk of the deer live on Big Pine Key, a marshy island 48 kilometers from Key West. They roam neighborhoods where about 4,500 people live, browsing on lush gardens and drinking water from buckets residents put out for them as natural freshwater supplies dwindle. Key deer are far smaller than their North American counterparts, with the biggest bucks standing less than 1 meter tall at the shoulder and weighing around 34 kilograms. 'They were always vulnerable,' said Chris Bergh, the South Florida program manager for the Nature Conservancy, who oversees sea level rise projects and lives in Big Pine Key. 'They're much more vulnerable now. And with the sea level rising and their habitat shrinking, they're becoming even more so.' Highway deer deaths On Big Pine Key, mom and pop bars and restaurants dot either side of bustling U.S. 1, along with gas stations and small motels. The main industry revolves around the water — charter boats, fishing, diving, vacation rentals. To protect the deer from being hit by vehicles, signs tell motorists they're entering deer habitat. A 3.2-kilometer stretch of U.S. 1 is elevated and fenced, allowing deer to cross under the road. And speed limits are strictly enforced, often frustrating tourists driving to Key West. Deer still are struck at an alarming rate. 'The bottom line is that some 90 to 120 deer are known to be killed by vehicles each year,' said Jan Svejkovsky, chief scientist for Save Our Key Deer. Wildlife officials have worked hard get out the message: Don't feed Key deer. They fear deer will approach cars and go near roadways for handouts. Even with the traffic deaths, the population has remained stable. But a larger threat looms. Climate change impacts on deer The National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration projects that by 2100, seas will rise 0.5 to 2 meters in parts of the Florida Keys. The threat is greatest to low lying islands like Big Pine Key, where the highest point is only about 2.4 meters above sea level. Sea rise will continue to shrink freshwater and food sources Key deer need to survive, experts say. 'So as the sea rises, that shrinks the amount of available freshwater, the amount of available, palatable vegetation, the places for bearing their young,' said Bergh of the Nature Conservancy. 'It puts them increasingly in conflict with people who are also occupying those higher grounds.' In addition to sea rise, climate change brings the threat of stronger hurricanes, with storm surges that can damage deer habitat and freshwater supplies. Salt water intrusion also is responsible for killing many of the Florida slash pines that gave Big Pine Key its name. Mangroves are growing in their place in an ever-changing environment, choking deer habitat even more. Shrinking habitat drives deer to neighborhoods Key deer on Big Pine Key move through neighborhoods, munching on gardens. Some people even have names for ones that frequent their yards. 'They are very gentle, very, very gentle,' said Connie Ritchie, who sometimes sees about 30 deer a day. 'And the longer you live here, the more you want to protect them. Big time. Protect them because they're so innocent.' 'They have certain plants that they really love,' Ritchie said, noting that the federal deer refuge here hosts events where it gives away native plants. 'So they're trying to teach us to plant the plants that the deer won't eat.' Development on Big Pine Key began in the 1970s and 1980s 'when entire swaths of land on islands that still held deer were developed into planned subdivisions, complete with saltwater canal networks to provide lot-buyers with direct water access,' said Svejkovsky of Save Our Key Deer. While the key remains mostly rural with modest Florida bungalows and more palatial places, development has taken away some deer habitat. 'We have lots of people and the wildlife living in the same really concentrated area,' said Katy Hosokawa, a park ranger at the National Key Deer Refuge, established in 1957 on 3,457 hectares of Big Pine Key. 'So the more houses that we build, or the less lands that we have protected, the less areas that they have that are safe.' The deer have adapted to the humans and move freely between wild spaces and the neighborhoods. 'They roam, they spend their day grazing,' Hosokawa said. 'We don't have a really nutritionally dense soil, so they need to eat a lot of food to get what they need. But trust me, they're very good at it. If it's soft and tender, they will try to eat it.' Future of the deer The future, while uncertain, looks grim. Just 15 centimeters of sea rise, expected by 2030, would mean loss of 16% of the freshwater holes on Big Pine Key, said Nova Silvy, professor emeritus with Texas A&M University who has studied Key deer since 1968 and has lived here for several years. By 2050, sea rise is expected to overtake about 84% of the 805 hectares of the preferred habitat on Big Pine Key — and 'the deer will already be gone,' Silvy said. What happens if the deer can't survive in the Keys? Bergh said he prefers to buy more time to keep the deer viable here. 'And at some point, if that's no longer possible, I personally think zoos are the most responsible alternative,' he said. 'But that's a terrible alternative. Who wants that for a wild animal?' In rare instances, scientists have been allowed to relocate endangered species threatened by climate change as a last resort. But Silvy said, 'The problem is if you take them any other place with deer, they're going to interbreed and then you've lost the Key deer.'	https://www.voanews.com/a/florida-s-iconic-key-deer-face-an-uncertain-future-as-seas-rise/7856241.html	2024-11-10T01:19:29-08:00	
Mexico City's floating gardens in peril	MEXICO CITY — Cassandra Garduño squinted in the sunlight, her pink boots smudged by dirt as she gazed out over her family's chinampa — one of the islands first built up by the Aztecs with fertile mud from the bottom of a lake that, later drained, would one day become Mexico City. Food from these islands has fed people for hundreds of years, but the chinampas are under threat from urbanization. The produce grown here doesn't fetch much money, and many families are abandoning the ancient practice to rent out or sell their land for more lucrative uses such as soccer fields. 'People don't want to farm anymore,' said Garduño. 'They don't see it as a necessity, they don't want to produce, and people don't want to buy the products.' Some of those remaining, like Garduño, are banding together to preserve and promote the traditional use of the chinampas. 'None of this can exist without human hands, the hands of those who worked here and created the chinampa a thousand years ago,' she said on a recent morning as the smell of celery growing nearby filled the air. The gardens crisscrossed by canals in the capital's southern Xochimilco borough are built up from layers of dredged soil, held together by tall, thin ahuejotes — a kind of willow tree — planted around their perimeter. Xochimilco has more than 2,500 acres of protected land owned by generations of local chinamperos, as those who farm the islands are known. Garduño's earliest memories of her family's chinampa came from peering through her grandparents' window at the plot of land and watching canoes weave in and out of the canals. Even then, she saw how the chinampas were deteriorating under pressure from urbanization and as some farmers began to drop the practice. When her grandfather died in 2010 and her uncles didn't want to carry on, Garduño took it upon herself to learn and conserve generations of farming. Her neighbors and relatives were skeptical at first, but she bought land for her own chinampa from a friend's uncle in 2020 and now grows an assortment of produce, including sunflowers, eggplant, and the Mexican marigold 'cempasuchil.' Now the 32-year-old Garduño is one of the growing collective called Chinampa Refuge, started by the National Autonomous University of Mexico, and she and other famers encourage chinamperos to preserve their land. They follow ancient growing techniques but are trying new commercial approaches to compete with cheaper produce grown on massive farms elsewhere in Mexico. That includes a special tag — Etiqueta Chinampera — that tells buyers the produce came from a chinampa, and may tout things like water quality or the chinampa's status as a biodiversity refuge. 'Change comes with educating the new generations,' said Garduño. 'Talking about the origins and efforts to conserve and why it's important to do it.' Luis Zambrano, an ecologist from the National Autonomous University of Mexico who has worked in Xochimilco for decades, said the fields are largely self-sustaining. Nourished by the lake, they can produce three to five crops of vegetables a year without the need of chemicals or irrigation, he said. Moreover, the ecosystem of Xochimilco benefits the sprawling city. Many different species of birds and fish thrive there, and the extensive canals help reduce the city's overall temperature, he said. But now, on weekends, it's common to see more soccer players boating to islands in their jerseys and cleats than farmers tending their crops. The soccer fields stretch for miles along the canals after what Zambrano called 'a massive increase' over the past two to three years. In Xochimilco, many people are reluctant to talk about transforming their chinampas to soccer fields. One landowner who declined to be identified for fear of legal or community backlash said keeping the chinampas productive required more work and financial investment and yielded less revenue. Instead, she has established multiple businesses on her land — a soccer field for weekend games, a food stand and kayaking tours for foreign visitors. 'If you do well (farming) you could earn $5,000 to $10,000 (100,000 to 200,000 pesos) a year,' Garduño said. 'In the tourist area you could have that within a couple of weekends.' But converting the agricultural fields carries ecological impact. While traditional farming methods avoid insecticides and fertilizers, the soccer fields are another story. 'It doesn't look that detrimental because there's no construction,' said Zambrano. But 'it's just as damaging because the amount of chemicals that are used, the amount of pollution that is generated is very, very large.' The chinampas are among the significant features that led Mexico City's historic center and Xochimilco to be recognized as a world heritage site by UNESCO. But any protective measures are up to federal, state and local authorities. Carlos Vasquez, director of the Natural Protected Areas under Mexico City's Environmental Department, said they are working on proposals to address the soccer fields. 'Many are counter to the conservation of the ecosystems,' he said. 'We're looking to regulate these activities.' After a long day's work out in the sun, Garduño and some neighboring farmers congregate under Garduño's makeshift hut for a feast of chicken and tortillas. They catch up on their tasks and outline what's left to do. Juan Ávalos, 63, and his brother Salvador Gonzalez Ávalos, 55, have been working on chinampas all their lives. Their family has several plots in Xochimilco's San Gregorio neighborhood. A year ago, after some convincing by Garduño, the brothers joined Chinampa Refuge to adopt a more holistic approach to their farming. Salvador said the approach is a continuous reminder of his family's legacy in maintaining the ancient practices — something they want to pass on to their grandchildren. 'That's something we need to work on as grandparents,' he said. 'That they integrate themselves with a taste for this earth.'	https://www.voanews.com/a/mexico-city-s-floating-gardens-in-peril-/7853221.html	2024-11-10T01:18:53-08:00	
Ukraine attacks Moscow with 32 drones, biggest strike on the Russian capital	MOSCOW — Ukraine attacked Moscow on Sunday with at least 32 drones, the biggest drone strike on the Russian capital since the start of the war in 2022, forcing flights to be diverted from three of the city's major airports and injuring at least one person. Russian air defenses shot down 32 drones flying toward Moscow over the Ramenskoye and Kolomensky districts of the Moscow region, as well as in Domodedovo city, home to one of the city's biggest airports, Moscow Mayor Sergei Sobyanin said. '32 drones flying to Moscow have been destroyed,' Sobyanin said. He reported no major damage, though Russia's federal air transport agency said the airports of Domodedovo, Sheremetyevo and Zhukovo had diverted flights. One person was injured. The airports have since resumed their operations, Russia's aviation watchdog Rosaviatsia said. Moscow and its surrounding region, with a population of at least 21 million people, is one of the biggest metropolitan areas in Europe, alongside Istanbul. The Ramenskoye district, some 45 kilometers southeast of the Kremlin, was last targeted in September in what was then Ukraine's biggest attack on the Russian capital, when Russian air defense units destroyed 20 drones. Unverified video posted on Russian Telegram channels showed drones buzzing across the skyline. Russian officials reported multiple Ukrainian drone attacks in other regions, among them the Kaluga, Bryansk and Orlov regions. The 2-1/2-year-old war in Ukraine is entering what some officials say could be its final act after Moscow's forces advanced at the fastest pace since the early days of the war and Donald Trump was elected 47th president of the United States. Trump, who takes office in January, said during campaigning that he could bring peace in Ukraine within 24 hours, but has given few details on how he would seek to do this. When Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskiy called Trump to congratulate him on his presidential election victory, Tesla CEO and Trump supporter Elon Musk joined the call, according to media reports. Musk owns SpaceX, which provides Starlink satellite communication services that are vital for Ukraine's defense effort. Moscow 'umbrellas' Kyiv, itself the target of repeated mass drone strikes from Russian forces, has tried to strike back against its vastly larger eastern neighbor with repeated drone strikes against oil refineries, airfields and even the Russian strategic early warning radar stations. While the 1,000-kilometer front has largely resembled grinding World War I trench and artillery warfare for much of the war, one of the biggest innovations of the conflict has been drone warfare. Moscow and Kyiv have both sought to buy and develop new drones, deploy them in innovative ways, and seek new ways to destroy them - from using farmers' shotguns to advanced electronic jamming systems. Moscow has developed a series of electronic 'umbrellas' over Moscow, with additional advanced internal layers over strategic buildings, and a complex web of air defenses which shoot down the drones before they reach the Kremlin at the heart of the Russian capital. Both sides have turned cheap commercial drones into deadly weapons while ramping up their own production. Soldiers on both sides have reported the visceral fear of drones -- and both sides have used macabre video footage of fatal drone strikes in their propaganda. Russian President Vladimir Putin, who has sought to insulate Moscow from the grinding rigors of the war, has called Ukrainian drone attacks that target civilian infrastructure such as nuclear power plants 'terrorism' and has vowed a response. Moscow, by far Russia's richest city, has boomed during the war, buoyed by the biggest defense spending splurge since the Cold War. There was no sign of panic on Moscow's boulevards. Muscovites walked their dogs while the bells of the onion-domed Russian Orthodox churches rang out across the capital.	https://www.voanews.com/a/ukraine-attacks-moscow-with-32-drones-biggest-strike-on-the-russian-capital/7858653.html	2024-11-10T01:18:13-08:00	
Under monthlong Israeli siege, hunger reaches dire levels in North Gaza	JERUSALEM — With virtually no food allowed into the northernmost part of Gaza for the past month, tens of thousands of Palestinians under Israeli siege are rationing their last lentils and flour to survive. As bombardment pounds around them, some say they risk their lives to search for cans of food in the rubble of destroyed homes. Thousands have staggered out of the area, hungry and thin, into Gaza City, where they find the situation little better. 'We are being starved to force us to leave our homes,' said Mohammed Arqouq, whose family of eight is determined to stay in the north, weathering Israel's siege. 'We will die here in our homes.' Medical workers warn that hunger is spiraling to dire proportions under a monthlong siege on north Gaza by the Israeli military, which has been waging a fierce campaign since the beginning of October, saying it's rooting out militants. Hamas militants, who are still holding hostages inside Gaza, have regrouped in the area and have been carrying out hit-and-run attacks from tunnels and bombed-out buildings. The military has severed the area with checkpoints, ordering residents to leave. Many Palestinians fear Israel aims to depopulate the north long-term. On Friday, experts from a panel that monitors food security said famine is imminent in the north or may already be happening. The growing desperation comes as the deadline approaches next week for a 30-day ultimatum the Biden administration gave Israel: raise the level of humanitarian assistance allowed into Gaza or risk possible restrictions on U.S. military funding. The U.S. says Israel must allow a minimum of 350 trucks a day carrying food and other supplies. Israel has fallen far short. In October, 57 trucks a day entered Gaza on average, according to figures from Israel's military agency overseeing aid entry, known as COGAT. In the first week of November, the average was 81 a day. The U.N. puts the number even lower — 37 trucks daily since the beginning of October. It says Israeli military operations and general lawlessness often prevent it from collecting supplies, leaving hundreds of truckloads stranded at the border. U.S. State Department spokesperson Matthew Miller said Israel had made some progress by announcing the opening of a new crossing into central Gaza and approving new delivery routes. But he said Israel must do more. 'It's not just sufficient to open new roads if more humanitarian assistance isn't going through those roads,' he said. A trickle of food has reached Gaza City, but as of Thursday, nothing entered the towns farther north for 30 days, even as an estimated 70,000 people remain there, said Louise Wateridge, spokesperson for the U.N. agency for Palestinian refugees, speaking from Gaza City. The Israeli government acknowledged in late October that it hadn't allowed aid into Jabaliya because of military 'operational constraints' in response to a petition by Israeli human rights groups. On Saturday, COGAT said it allowed 11 trucks of food and supplies into Beit Hanoun and Jabaliya. But Alia Zaki, a spokesperson for the U.N.’s World Food Program, said Israeli troops at a checkpoint forced the convoy to unload the food before it could reach shelters in Beit Hanoun. It was not clear what then happened to the supplies. Palestinians in the north described to The Associated Press a desperate daily struggle to find food, water and safety, as strikes level buildings, sometimes killing entire families. Arqouq said he goes out at night to search bombed-out buildings: 'Sometimes you find a half-empty package of flour, canned food and lentils.' His family relies on help from others sheltering at a Jabaliya school, he said, but their food, too, is running low. 'We are like dogs and cats searching for their food in the rubble,' said Um Saber, a widow. She said she and her six children had to flee a school-turned-shelter in Beit Lahiya when Israel struck it. Now they live in her father-in-law's home, stretching meager supplies of lentils and pasta with 40 others, mostly women and children. Ahmed Abu Awda, a 28-year-old father of three living with 25 relatives in a Jabaliya house, said they have a daily meal of lentils with bread, rationing to ensure children eat. 'Sometimes we don't eat at all,' he said. Dr. Rana Soboh, a nutrition specialist at Gaza City's Patient Friend Benevolent Hospital, said she sees about 350 cases of moderate to severe acute malnutrition daily, most from the north but also Gaza City. 'The bone of their chest is showing, the eyes are protruding,' she said, and many have trouble concentrating. 'You repeat something a number of times, so they can understand what we are saying.' She cited a 32-year-old woman shedding weight in her third month of pregnancy — when they put her on the scale, she weighed only 40 kilograms. 'We are suffering, facing the ghost of famine that is hovering over Gaza,' Soboh said. Even before the siege in the north, the Patient Friend hospital saw a flood of children suffering from malnutrition — more than 4,780 in September compared with 1,100 in July, said Dr Ahmad Eskiek, who oversees hospital operations. Soboh said staff get calls from Beit Lahiya and Jabaliya pleading for help: 'What can we do? We have nothing.'	https://www.voanews.com/a/under-monthlong-israeli-siege-hunger-reaches-dire-levels-in-north-gaza/7858652.html	2024-11-10T01:02:50-08:00	
Soldier with Yemen's exiled government opens fire, killing 2 Saudi troops	DUBAI, United Arab Emirates — A soldier for Yemen's exiled government opened fire on Saudi troops as they exercised in eastern Yemen, killing two of them and wounding another in a rare insider attack during the kingdom's nearly decadelong war there, officials said Saturday. The assault in eastern Hadramawt province comes as a yearslong cease-fire between Saudi Arabia and Yemen's Houthi rebels largely has held despite the militants' ongoing attacks against shipping in the Red Sea corridor. While the Houthis did not claim the attack, at least one Houthi official praised it as being 'the beginning and an indication of a harsh future awaiting the invaders.' Meanwhile, U.S. warplanes carried out new strikes targeting Houthi positions that lasted into early Sunday morning, the American military said. The strikes come after the militants likely shot down yet-another American reconnaissance drone over the country. The attack on the Saudi troops took place Friday night in Seiyun, a city some 500 kilometers east of Sanaa. As troops worked out at a Saudi-led base there, the soldier opened fire, killing an officer and a noncommissioned officer, the state-run Saudi Press Agency said, citing a military statement. 'The Joint Forces Command underscores that this 'Lone Wolf' cowardly attack does not represent the honorable members of the Yemeni Ministry of Defense,' the statement added. The dead and the other wounded Saudi solider have been brought back to the kingdom, it added. Aidarous al-Zubaidi, the leader of Yemen's successionist Southern Transitional Council, identified the soldier who carried out the attack as belonging to the First Military Region, which is based out of Seiyun. Police in the area published pictures of the soldier, saying there was a 30-million-Yemeni-rial reward for information leading to the soldier's arrest. That's worth around $15,000 on the black market. Authorities offered no motive for the attack. Al-Qaida in the Arabian Peninsula, the militant group's Yemen branch, long has operated around Hadramawt. However, the group did not immediately claim the attack. A recent United Nations expert report has said that the al-Qaida group and the Houthis have begun to 'coordinate operations directly with each other.' The Houthis meanwhile did not claim the attack either. However, Houthi official Hamid Rizq praised the attack in a message on the social platform X, claiming it came from 'the feeling of oppression' over Saudi troops being stationed in the area. 'The heroic operation is the beginning and an indication of a harsh future awaiting the invaders,' Rizq wrote. Yemen has been mired in a decadelong war since the Houthis swept into Sanaa from their northern strongholds in September 2014. A Saudi-led coalition entered the war on behalf of Yemen's exiled government in 2015. The war further internationalized, with Iran backing the Houthis with weapons and support that cemented the conflict into a yearslong stalemate. The war has killed more than 150,000 people, including fighters and civilians, and created one of the world's worst humanitarian disasters, killing tens of thousands more. A cease-fire that expired in October 2022 largely has held in the time since, however, even as the Houthis have seized on the Israel-Hamas war in the Gaza Strip and Israel's invasion of Lebanon. On Saturday night, Houthi-run media reported U.S. airstrikes targeting areas around Sanaa. The airstrikes continued into Sunday morning and also included sites in Amran province just outside of the capital, the Houthis said. The rebels offered no immediate damage assessment from the strikes. The U.S. military later told The Associated Press on Sunday it conducted airstrikes 'on numerous Iran-backed Houthi weapons storage facilities within Houthi-controlled areas of Yemen.' It described the sites as housing advanced conventional weapons used to target military and civilian ships in the Red Sea corridor but offered no other immediate details. The U.S. military has targeted radar stations, military bases and drone and missile launch sites since beginning its ongoing airstrike campaign against the Houthis in January.	https://www.voanews.com/a/soldier-with-yemen-s-exiled-government-opens-fire-killing-2-saudi-troops/7858648.html	2024-11-09T23:57:07-08:00	
Cricket star Botham saved from crocodile-infested waters after fishing mishap	SYDNEY — England cricketing great Ian Botham was saved by his former Ashes rival Merv Hughes after a fall into crocodile-infested waters while on a fishing trip in northern Australia. Botham, along with Hughes and a group of friends, was on a boat when the accident happened, resulting in some heavy bruising to his torso but no serious injuries for the former England all-rounder. The 68-year-old Botham reportedly got tangled in some ropes while moving to another boat, causing him to slip headfirst into the Moyle River, 200 kilometers southwest of Darwin in Australia's tropical north. The river is known to be inhabited by saltwater crocodiles and bull sharks. Posting about the incident on social media, Botham shared his relief, saying: 'My catch of the day was the barra while I was nearly catch of the day for all the crocs and bull sharks...thanks boys for getting me out.' The two cricket legends, who faced off many times during Ashes series in the late 1980s and early '90s, have maintained a close friendship over the years. In a comment to News Corp, Botham compared himself to the Australian film character Crocodile Dundee, saying: 'At the end of the day, Crocodile Beefy survived. 'I was out of the water quicker than I went in it. Quite a few sets of eyes were having a peep at me. Luckily I had no time to think about what was in the water. The guys were brilliant, it was just one of those accidents. It was all very quick and I'm OK now.' There have been three fatal crocodile attacks in Australia this year.	https://www.voanews.com/a/cricket-star-botham-saved-from-crocodile-infested-waters-after-fishing-mishap-/7858647.html	2024-11-09T23:46:35-08:00	
Why AP called Arizona for Trump	WASHINGTON — The Associated Press declared President-elect Donald Trump the winner in Arizona on Saturday night after vote updates in Maricopa and other counties added to his overall lead, putting the state out of reach for Vice President Kamala Harris. At the time the AP called the race at 9:21 p.m. ET, Trump led Harris, 52.6% to 46.4%, a margin of about 185,000 votes. Harris needed to win about 7 out of every 10 votes of the roughly 443,000 uncounted ballots remaining, a percentage that has steadily grown as additional votes were counted. Trump has now swept all seven of the hotly contested presidential battlegrounds, winning 312 electoral votes, compared to 226 for Harris. The number needed to clinch the presidency is 270. In 2020, President Joe Biden carried the state narrowly over Trump, but he won Maricopa County by a margin of 50 percentage points to 48. On Saturday, Trump was leading Harris 52 to 47. The AP only declares a winner once it can determine that a trailing candidate can't close the gap and overtake the vote leader. Here's a look at how the AP called this race: Candidates: President: Harris (D) vs. Trump (R) vs. Chase Oliver (Libertarian) vs. Jill Stein (Green). Winner: Trump. Poll closing time: 9 p.m. ET Tuesday. Arizona does not release votes until all precincts have reported or one hour after all polls are closed, whichever is first, usually 10 p.m. ET. About the race: Both Harris and Trump crisscrossed this border state, where immigration is a prominent issue, multiple times before Election Day. Trump put immigration at the center of his candidacy, promising to deport people without legal documentation while Harris called for pathways to citizenship as well as tighter security at the border. Independent voters are the largest bloc in the state, followed by Republicans, then Democrats, who have succeeded in winning Senate contests and the governorship since 2018. Biden became just the second Democrat to win the state in more than 70 years. Both candidates made a play for vote-rich Maricopa County, which is home to Phoenix, Mesa and Tempe. Trump carried the county by 3 points in 2016, while Biden won with a 2-point margin four years later. Arizona is primarily an early voting state. In 2016, just over three-quarters of the votes were cast early. In 2020, that climbed to nearly 90%. Why AP called the race: In statewide elections going back a dozen years, Democrats have always carried four counties in both winning and losing campaigns: Apache, Coconino, Pima and Santa Cruz. Harris had large leads over Trump in all four counties, but she far underperformed Biden's showing from 2020. She was trailing Trump in decisive Maricopa County, which Biden won in 2020 and has been a must-win county for statewide Democratic candidates in recent elections. Although Harris very briefly led in the statewide vote count on election night, Trump has consistently led since then. The AP's analysis of Arizona's voting history and political demographics at the county level showed there was no scenario that would allow Harris to close the gap. The analysis also showed that even if remaining updates showed vote swings in Harris' favor, they would not be enough to give her the lead.	https://www.voanews.com/a/why-ap-called-arizona-for-trump/7858627.html	2024-11-09T21:09:52-08:00	
Trump completes swing state sweep by taking Arizona	Washington — Donald Trump won the state of Arizona in this week's U.S. presidential election, U.S. TV networks projected on Saturday, completing the Republican's sweep of all seven swing states. After four days of counting in the southwest state with a large Hispanic population, CNN and NBC projected Trump had obtained its 11 electoral votes as he defeated Vice President Kamala Harris. Outgoing President Joe Biden scored a narrow but crucial victory in Arizona in 2020 that condemned Trump to defeat after his first term in office. The scale and strength of Trump's comeback, which also saw the real estate tycoon win the popular vote by a margin of around 4 million votes, has sent shockwaves through the defeated Democratic Party. The Republicans have already regained control of the Senate and look well set to retain a majority in the House of Representatives thanks to support from white working-class voters and a large share of Hispanics. CNN has called Republican victories for 213 seats in the House, with 218 needed for a majority in the lower chamber. The networks' figures show Democrats on 205 seats, although senior party figures are still hoping they can pull off a slim victory that would significantly curtail Trump's powers. NBC sees the Republicans with 212 seats so far, and 204 for the Democrats. The other six swing states won by Trump in the presidential race are Pennsylvania, Wisconsin, Michigan, North Carolina, Nevada and Georgia. The latest good news for Trump came as the White House said Biden would meet with the president-elect at the White House on Wednesday. Trump -- who never conceded his 2020 loss -- sealed a remarkable comeback to the presidency in the November 5 vote, cementing what is set to be more than a decade of U.S. politics dominated by his hardline right-wing stance. This type of meeting between the outgoing and incoming presidents was considered customary, but Trump did not invite Biden for one after making unsubstantiated election fraud claims that culminated in the January 6, 2021, Capitol riot. Trump also broke with precedent by skipping Biden's inauguration, but the White House has said the Democratic president will attend the upcoming ceremony. Biden's meeting with Trump will take place in the Oval Office, the White House said Saturday, with the clock ticking down to the ex-president's return to power. Trump, the 78-year-old ex-reality TV star, won wider margins than before, despite a criminal conviction, two impeachments while in office and warnings from his former chief of staff that he is a fascist. Exit polls showed that voters' top concerns remained the economy and inflation that spiked under Biden in the wake of the COVID pandemic. The 81-year-old president, who dropped out of the White House race in July over concerns about his age, health and mental acuity, called Trump on Wednesday to congratulate him on the election win. Trump 2.0 Democrats have been pointing fingers over who is to blame for Harris' decisive loss after she replaced Biden at the top of the ticket roughly 100 days before the election. Former House Speaker Nancy Pelosi took aim at Biden, telling The New York Times that 'had the president gotten out sooner, there may have been other candidates in the race.' As the Democrats weigh what went wrong, Trump has begun to assemble his second administration by naming campaign manager Susie Wiles to serve as his White House chief of staff. She is the first woman to be named to the high-profile role and the Republican's first appointment to his incoming administration. Jockeying for jobs Trump on Saturday ruled out re-appointing two senior figures from his first administration, former Secretary of State Mike Pompeo and former U.N. Ambassador Nikki Haley. Former Ambassador to Germany Richard Grenell is seen as a front-runner for the secretary of state position, as is Florida Senator Marco Rubio who called Trump a 'con artist' and the 'most vulgar person to ever aspire to the presidency' in 2016. The other front-runners for a place in the Trump 2.0 administration reflect the significant changes it is likely to implement. Robert F. Kennedy Jr., a leading figure in the anti-vaccine movement for whom Trump has pledged a 'big role' in health care, told NBC News on Wednesday that 'I'm not going to take away anybody's vaccines.' The world's richest man, Elon Musk, could also be in line for a job auditing government waste after the right-wing SpaceX, Tesla and X boss enthusiastically backed Trump.	https://www.voanews.com/a/trump-completes-swing-state-sweep-by-taking-arizona/7858618.html	2024-11-09T20:36:35-08:00	
Canada detects its first presumptive human H5 bird flu case	OTTAWA, Ontario — Canada has detected its first presumptive case of H5 bird flu in a person, a teenager in the western province of British Columbia, health officials said Saturday. The teenager likely caught the virus from a bird or animal and was receiving care at a children's hospital, the province said in a statement. The province said it was investigating the source of exposure and identifying the teenager's contacts. The risk to the public remains low, Canada's Health Minister Mark Holland said in posting on X. 'This is a rare event,' British Columbia Health Officer Bonnie Henry said in a statement. 'We are conducting a thorough investigation to fully understand the source of exposure here in B.C.' H5 bird flu is widespread in wild birds worldwide and is causing outbreaks in poultry and U.S. dairy cows, with several recent human cases in U.S. dairy and poultry workers. There has been no evidence of person-to-person spread so far. But if that were to happen, a pandemic could unfold, scientists have said. Earlier in November, the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention asked for farm workers who have been exposed to animals with bird flu to be tested for the virus even if they do not have symptoms. Bird flu has infected nearly 450 dairy farms in 15 U.S. states since March, and the CDC has identified 46 human cases of bird flu since April. In Canada, British Columbia has identified at least 22 infected poultry farms since October, and numerous wild birds tested positive, according to the province. Canada has had no cases reported in dairy cattle and no evidence of bird flu in samples of milk.	https://www.voanews.com/a/canada-detects-its-first-presumptive-human-h5-bird-flu-case/7858606.html	2024-11-09T18:21:37-08:00	
Trump says Haley, Pompeo will not join his administration	Washington — President-elect Donald Trump said Saturday that former Republican presidential contender Nikki Haley and former Secretary of State Mike Pompeo will not be asked to join his administration. 'I will not be inviting former Ambassador Nikki Haley, or former Secretary of State Mike Pompeo, to join the Trump Administration, which is currently in formation,' Trump posted on social media. 'I very much enjoyed and appreciated working with them previously, and would like to thank them for their service to our country.' Trump is meeting with potential candidates to serve in his administration before his January 20 inauguration as president. Reuters reported Friday that Trump met with prominent investor Scott Bessent, who is a potential U.S. Treasury Secretary nominee. Haley, a former South Carolina governor who served as U.S. ambassador to the United Nations under Trump, endorsed Trump for president despite having criticized him harshly when she ran against him in the party primaries. Pompeo, who also served as director of the Central Intelligence Agency under Trump, has been mentioned in some media reports as a possible defense secretary and also had been seen a potential Republican presidential candidate, before he announced in April 2023 he would not run. Haley and Pompeo could not immediately be reached for comment on Saturday. During his first term as president, Trump made some key personnel announcements via social media posts. Separately, Trump said the 2025 presidential inauguration will be co-chaired by real estate investor and campaign donor Steve Witkoff and former Senator Kelly Loeffler.	https://www.voanews.com/a/trump-says-haley-pompeo-will-not-join-his-administration-/7858603.html	2024-11-09T18:12:31-08:00	
Record 13 women will be governors next year in US	The election of Republican Kelly Ayotte as New Hampshire's governor means 13 women will serve as a state's chief executive next year, breaking the record of 12 set after the 2022 elections. Governors hold powerful sway in American politics, shaping state policy and often using the experience and profile gained to launch campaigns for higher offices. 'It matters to have women in those roles to normalize the image of women in political leadership and even more specifically in executive leadership, where they’re the sole leader, not just a member of a team,' said Kelly Dittmar, director of research at the Rutgers Center for American Women and Politics. Gov. Gretchen Whitmer was floated as a potential Democratic nominee for president after President Joe Biden exited the race. Republican South Dakota Gov. Kristi Noem was thought to be in the running for President-elect Donald Trump's vice presidential post. Ayotte, a former U.S. senator, defeated the Democratic nominee Joyce Craig, a former mayor of Manchester, New Hampshire’s largest city. Still, 18 states have never had a woman in the governor’s office. 'This is another side of political leadership where women continue to be underrepresented,' Dittmar said. 'Thirteen out of 50 is still underrepresentation.' With two women vying for governor in New Hampshire, a new record for female governors was inevitable. The state has a long history of electing women. As a senator, Ayotte was part of the nation’s first all-female congressional delegation. It was also the first state to have a female governor, state Senate president and House speaker at the same time, and the first to have a female majority in its Senate. Ayotte will be the state's third woman to be governor. 'Being a woman isn’t really that critical to her political persona,' Linda Fowler, professor emerita of government at Dartmouth College, said of Ayotte. Both Ayotte and Craig said their gender hasn’t come up on the campaign trail although reproductive rights often took front and center. In her campaign, Craig attacked Ayotte’s record on abortion, and both candidates released TV ads detailing their own miscarriages. Ayotte said she will veto any bill further restricting abortion in New Hampshire where it is illegal after 24 weeks of pregnancy. When Ayotte is sworn in, five Republican women will serve as governor at the same time, another new high. The other eight are Democrats. New Hampshire's was one of the few competitive gubernatorial races among the 11 this year. More inroads or setbacks for women’s representation could come in 2026 when 36 states will elect governors.Most voters tend to cast their ballots based on party loyalty and ideology rather than gender, Dittmar said. However, she noted female candidates often face layers of scrutiny that male counterparts largely avoid, with voters judging such things as a woman's intelligence, appearance and even dating history with a sharper lens. The small gain for women in governor’s offices comes as Vice President Kamala Harris failed in her effort to become the first female president. 'I would not suggest to you that Kamala Harris lost a race because she was a woman, because she was a Black and South Asian woman,' Dittmar said. 'We would also fail to tell the correct story if we didn’t acknowledge the ways in which both gender and race shapes the campaign overall, and also had a direct effect on how Kamala Harris was evaluated by voters, treated by her opponents and even in the media and other spaces.' Executive roles, especially the presidency with its associations like commander in chief, often carry masculine stereotypes that women must work harder to overcome, Dittmar said. Experts say women confront these perceptions more acutely in executive races, such as for governor and president, than in state legislatures, where women are making historic strides as leaders, filling roles such as speaker and committee chairs. 'Sexism, racism, misogyny, it’s never the silver bullet. It’s never why one voter acts one way or another,' said Erin Vilardi, CEO of Vote Run Lead, a left-leaning group that supports women running for state legislatures. 'But we have so much of that built in to how we see a leader.'	https://www.voanews.com/a/record-13-women-will-be-governors-next-year-in-us/7858602.html	2024-11-09T17:57:09-08:00	
Royal Air Force veteran, 100, joining UK Remembrance Day for 1st time	LONDON — Michael Woods has visited his wife, Mary, every day since she moved into a nursing home two years ago. But on Sunday, the 100-year-old Royal Air Force veteran will skip the daily get-together so he can fulfill another duty — honoring the men he served with during World War II. For the first time since he left the RAF in 1947, Woods will take part in Britain's national Remembrance Day service, joining thousands of veterans as they march past the Cenotaph war memorial in central London to honor those who died during the world wars and all the conflicts that followed. 'It's a great privilege for me to do this,' said Woods, a mechanic who kept Lancaster bombers flying during the war. 'And I suppose I'll never do it again.' The annual ceremony is a solemn event marked every year when the king and envoys from the Commonwealth nations that fought alongside Britain in the two world wars lay wreaths at the Cenotaph. It culminates when up to 10,000 veterans, many with medals gleaming on their chests and regimental berets on their heads, parade past the memorial. Until now, Woods has watched on television from his home in Dunstable, 50 kilometers away. Mary always watched with him. Woods had a lot on his mind before. For many years, he was busy with his family: two daughters, a son, eight grandchildren and nine great-grandchildren. And, more recently, he was looking after Mary, his wife of 68 years. But there was something else holding him back as well. He didn't feel he deserved the honor, as he was 'just' a mechanic working on the 12-cylinder Rolls-Royce Merlin engines that powered the Lancaster bombers. He changed his mind after he connected with other ex-service members through Blind Veterans U.K., the charity that has helped him with his macular degeneration and glaucoma. He felt it was time to remember the men who didn't come home after they roared into the sky aboard planes he had certified as airworthy. Each Lancaster carried a crew of seven, most in their early 20s, so the losses — so many at once — were hard to bear. 'It's very, very upsetting when a Lancaster takes off and it doesn't return,' Woods told The Associated Press. 'I couldn't forget it if I wanted to,' he added. 'It's just imprinted on your mind, you know.' The RAF's Bomber Command had the highest attrition rate of any Allied unit during World War II, with 44% of aircrew members killed in action, according to the International Bomber Command Center. Some 55,573 of the 125,000 who served on the aircrews died during the war. Adrian Bell, CEO of Blind Veterans U.K., said he's met many World War II veterans who describe themselves as mere cogs in a massive machine. But that's what it took to defeat fascism. Everyone was needed. So come Sunday, Woods will be marching. With the stubbornness to retain his independence that seems to have come with turning 100, Woods insists he won't use a wheelchair because he has never used one before and isn't going to start now. Besides, his son, Eddie, will be there to act as a guide and his buddies from the charity will be nearby to offer emotional support. He will be an inspiration, Bell said. 'I think the most important thing is the fortitude of a man who is 100 years old, who fought in the Second World War and beyond, who is going to be there physically on Sunday and marching as a tribute to those who lost their lives and as a sort of a sign of hope and a sign ... that there is life after all of these things,' Bell said. 'That's the embodiment of something that I think is really important.'	https://www.voanews.com/a/royal-air-force-veteran-100-joining-uk-remembrance-day-for-1st-time/7858600.html	2024-11-09T17:29:17-08:00	
12 bodies recovered from Cameroon landslides	Yaounde, Cameroon — Workers have recovered 12 bodies following landslides that engulfed a road in the west of Cameroon, a regional official said Saturday, adding there is no hope of finding survivors. State television CRTV reported the comments by the governor of Ouest region, Augustine Awa Fonka. 'In our opinion, there is no longer any possibility of finding survivors,' he told the station. Only 12 bodies had been recovered from the site of the disaster, the last of them on Saturday morning, he said. Dozens more people are still missing, and the search for bodies is still continuing, he added. Two landslides hit the Dschang cliff road Tuesday — the second as emergency workers were using heavy machinery to try to clear the road. Vehicles hit included three coaches with around 20 seats each, five six-seater vehicles, and several motorbikes said Awa Fonka in an earlier statement. Cameroon's roads are notoriously dangerous, with almost 3,000 deaths each year in accidents, or more than 10 deaths per 100,000 inhabitants, according to the latest figures from the World Health Organization, published in 2023. In early September, a tractor-trailer carrying passengers plunged off a cliff road into a ravine near the town of Dschang, killing eight people and injuring 62 others, including eight children.	https://www.voanews.com/a/bodies-recovered-from-cameroon-landslides-/7858599.html	2024-11-09T17:25:51-08:00	
Israelis fear for hostages as Qatar says Gaza mediation on hold	Tel Aviv, Israel — Israeli protesters expressed concern for the hostages in Gaza on Saturday, after Qatar said it was pausing as a key mediator for a cease-fire that would help bring the captives home. Thousands of people rallied in Tel Aviv holding signs reading '400,' the number of days since the hostages were taken when Hamas militants attacked southern Israel on October 7, 2023. Efforts to broker a truce in the ensuing war between Hamas and Israel have proven fruitless, and on Saturday Qatar put its mediation on hold until the two sides showed 'willingness and seriousness' in talks. Protester Ruti Lior said she was unsure how much sway Qatar had, but was still 'very, very worried' by their decision to pull back from negotiations. 'This is further proof for me that there really is no seriousness, and these deals are being sabotaged,' the 62-year-old psychotherapist told AFP. Saturday's rally featured an installation of masks representing Netanyahu along with signs bearing the word 'Guilty.' Other placards read 'Hostage deal now' and 'Drop your weapon, stop the war.' 'How many more tears must fall and how much more blood must be shed before someone does what needs to be done and brings our children home?' Niva Wenkert, mother of hostage Omer Wenkert, was quoted as saying in a statement released by campaign group Hostage and Missing Families Forum. In the October 7, 2023, attack, Hamas militants killed 1,200 people and captured about 250 hostages, sparking the war in Gaza. Israel says it believes Hamas is still holding 101 hostages, including 35 the military says are dead. Hamas has been designated a terror group by the United States, the U.K. and other Western countries. Israel’s counteroffensive in Gaza has killed more than 43,000 people, according to the territory's health ministry, which does not distinguish between combatants and civilians in its count. Israelis have been protesting weekly to pressure their government to do more to secure the captives' release. Qatar, which has hosted Hamas's political leadership since 2012 with U.S. blessing, has been involved in months of protracted diplomacy aimed at ending the war in Gaza. But the talks, also mediated by Cairo and Washington, have repeatedly hit snags since a one-week truce in November 2023 -- the only one so far -- with both sides trading blame for the impasse.	https://www.voanews.com/a/israelis-fear-for-hostages-as-qatar-says-gaza-mediation-on-hold/7858597.html	2024-11-09T17:14:41-08:00	
US, Mexico OK new Rio Grande water-sharing agreement	Mexico City — Mexico and the United States said they have reached an agreement they hope will help Mexico to be timelier with its water-sharing payments in the Rio Bravo watershed, also known as the Rio Grande. The agreement announced Saturday provides Mexico with tools and flexibility to deliver water earlier in a five-year cycle under the 1944 U.S.-Mexico water treaty, according to the bilateral International Border and Water Commission. The proposed tools include better coordination on water conservation, re-use, alternative water sources and other measures. The treaty moves in five-year cycles and allows Mexico to run a water debt in the first four years, if it can make it up in the fifth. That has led Mexico to fall behind, hoping a hurricane or other heavy rains will dump water in the border area. That has frustrated Texas farmers, who need a predictable supply of water. When a hurricane or tropical storm hits the region, Mexico can play catch-up but at that point, the water isn't needed, and that doesn't always happen. Mexico has long used that wait-and-hope strategy, but it has led to problems in the past, both at home and in the U.S. Mexico is obliged to deliver 430 million cubic meters of water per year, or about 2.15 billion cubic meters over five years. An acre-foot of water is enough to flood a one-acre field with one foot of water. The United States, in return, gives Mexico even more water from other water sources farther west. But in the current cycle, which began in 2020, Mexico has so far delivered only about 525 million cubic meters overall, or about one-quarter of what it owes for the five-year period, which ends in October 2025. Mexico has to release water from dams on tributaries feeding into the Rio Grande but that angers Mexican farmers, who want it for themselves and call it 'our water.' The treaty gives the United States rights to one-third of the flows from six Mexican tributaries. In 2020, a dispute over water payments to the United States boiled over into violence, with angry farmers pushing back National Guard troops guarding a dam, because Mexico had fallen behind on payments in that cycle and had to deliver water quickly to the United States. Mexico dispatched National Guard officers to protect the La Boquilla dam, but hundreds of farmers pushed them back hundreds of yards in a failed bid to take over the dam's control room. Before that, farmers took over another dam near the border town of Ojinaga. Both dams are near the Texas border, west of the Big Bend area. During the 2020 conflict, Mexican farmers also burned vehicles and blocked railway lines. In the end, the United States allowed Mexico to transfer rights to water held in joint international reservoirs, in a face-saving solution.	https://www.voanews.com/a/us-mexico-ok-new-rio-grande-water-sharing-agreement-/7858580.html	2024-11-09T17:03:56-08:00	
With costs of living on everyone's minds, Mauritius holds election	port louis — Mauritius holds a parliamentary election Sunday with incumbent Prime Minister and his main rivals all promising to tackle a cost-of-living crisis in the Indian Ocean archipelago. The country of about 1.3 million people markets itself as a link between Africa and Asia, deriving most of its revenues from a flourishing offshore financial sector, tourism and textiles. It has forecast 6.5% economic growth this year compared with 7.0% last year but many voters are not feeling the benefits. Jugnauth's Alliance Lepep coalition has promised to raise minimum wages, increase pensions and reduce value added tax on some basic goods. It says it will use payments from the U.K. under an October agreement for Britain to cede the Chagos Islands while retaining the U.S.-U.K. Diego Garcia air base. Mauritius also receives aid from China. 'The alliance led by the prime minister is selling the economic prosperity card, with promises of more money to different segments of the population,' said political analyst Subash Gobine. The opposition is also pledging to increase pensions as well as introduce free transport and internet services and reduce fuel prices. It is dominated by the Alliance du Changement coalition led by Navin Ramgoolam and two other parties running in the Linion Reform alliance whose leaders, Nando Bodha and Roshi Bhadain, plan to alternate as prime minister if they win. 'It is the youths who will make the difference in these elections,' voter David Stafford, 36, said in the capital Port Louis, explaining that people were looking for economic innovation and job opportunities as much as fiscal changes. Just over 1 million people are expected to choose lawmakers for the islands' 62 seats in parliament for the next five years from a list of 68 parties and five political alliances. Last week, Jugnauth's government blocked social media platforms until a day after the election, when results are expected, citing national security concerns after conversations between public figures were leaked. It lifted the ban a day later after opposition parties criticized the move. Voting starts at 0300 GMT on Sunday and closes at 1400 GMT. Whichever party or coalition gets more than half the seats in parliament also wins the prime minister's post.	https://www.voanews.com/a/with-costs-of-living-on-everyone-s-minds-mauritius-holds-election-/7858576.html	2024-11-09T16:20:22-08:00	
Firefighters in California, New Jersey make progress on wildfires	Firefighters on two U.S. coasts were making progress Saturday on wildfires in California and New Jersey. Southern California firefighters were gaining ground on a wildfire that destroyed more than 130 structures as gusty winds subsided Saturday with favorable weather conditions expected through the weekend. The Mountain Fire in Ventura County was held at about 83 square kilometers and was 17% contained, Fire Operations Section Chief Clint Swensen said. The fire broke out Wednesday and exploded in size thanks in part to the arrival of dry, warm and gusty northeast winds, forcing thousands of residents to flee and threatening 3,500 structures in suburban neighborhoods, ranches and agricultural areas around the community of Camarillo. Red flag warnings indicating conditions for high fire danger expired in most of the region Thursday. Smoky air hung over the area Saturday thanks to light winds, the very conditions that were aiding firefighters, said Ryan Kittell, a meteorologist with the National Weather Service in Oxnard. 'It's very favorable for the weekend,' Kittell said. 'Good for firefighting efforts but not great for air quality.' Some forecasts showed winds returning to the area Tuesday but not to the extent seen last week, Kittell said. The region northwest of Los Angeles, California, has seen some of the state's most destructive fires over the years. Across the country in New Jersey, firefighters were reporting 'substantial progress' against a wildfire that was threatening dozens of structures, one of a number of forest fires they are fighting in the state. The New Jersey Department of Environmental Protection's Forest Fire Service said Saturday afternoon that the fire in the Pompton Lakes area of Passaic County had been 50% contained. The blaze is burning more than 65 hectares and is threatening 55 structures, although no evacuations have been ordered. Earlier, the blaze prompted closure of the right lane of northbound Interstate 287, officials said. The Forest Fire Service was battling the blaze with fire engines and ground crews and a helicopter capable of dropping 1,325 liters of water, officials said. Structures were being protected by local fire companies, they said. Officials also reported fighting a new wildfire that has ignited across more than 728 hectares near the New York-New Jersey border in Passaic County's West Milford and Orange County, New York. The Jennings Creek wildfire was threatening two homes and eight buildings in the Long Pond Ironworks Historic District. An earlier wildfire in the Bethany Run area on the border of Burlington and Camden counties in Evesham and Voorhees townships was reported 90% contained. A blaze along the Palisades Interstate Parkway in Englewood Cliffs in Bergen County, across the Hudson River from New York, was reported 40% contained and threatened no structures. The National Weather Service has issued a red flag warning, saying gusty winds and low humidity could help spread fires quickly. New Jersey has not received measurable precipitation in over a month, the weather service said, setting a record.	https://www.voanews.com/a/firefighters-in-california-new-jersey-make-progress-on-wildfires-/7858380.html	2024-11-09T15:53:57-08:00	
2 Saudi military personnel killed in Yemen attack: state media	Riyadh, Saudi Arabia — Two Saudi military personnel have been killed in an attack in Yemen, Saudi state media said Saturday, reporting that the assailant was affiliated with Yemen's defense ministry. 'An officer and a non-commissioned officer were martyred, and an officer was injured as a result of a treacherous and cowardly attack' Friday inside a military camp in the city of Seiyun, the official Saudi Press Agency (SPA) said, citing defense ministry spokesperson Brigadier General Turki al-Maliki. Saudi Arabia mobilized an international coalition to intervene in Yemen to support the internationally recognized government in 2015, after Iran-backed Houthi rebels seized the capital Sanaa the previous year. Seiyun is in the governorate of Hadhramout, which falls under the control of the internationally recognized government. The coalition forces stationed in the camp where the attack took place were helping train local forces to combat terrorism and smuggling, SPA said. The attack took place during athletics training, it said, without elaborating on how it was carried out or providing details of the assailant's identity or position. A Yemeni officer told AFP that the incident began with a verbal altercation between the Yemeni perpetrator and the Saudis, which led to an exchange of gunfire. SPA said that the perpetrator 'does not represent the honorable members of the Yemeni Ministry of Defense who appreciate the positive and important role played by the coalition forces' to back the government. The bodies of the dead and the wounded officer have been transported to Saudi Arabia, SPA said. 'The joint forces will work in coordination with the Yemeni Ministry of Defense to follow up on the investigation procedures to find out the reasons and motives and arrest the perpetrator and bring him to justice,' the report said. The war in Yemen has killed hundreds of thousands either in fighting or from indirect causes such as a lack of food, the United Nations says. Hostilities fell off considerably in April 2022, when a six-month, U.N.-brokered truce came into effect, and they have remained at a low level since.	https://www.voanews.com/a/saudi-military-personnel-killed-in-yemen-attack-state-media-/7858378.html	2024-11-09T15:28:24-08:00	
Israeli raids on Syria kill 4 militants, war monitor says	Beirut, Lebanon — Four pro-Iran fighters were among five people killed in overnight Israeli strikes in north and northwest Syria, a war monitor said on Saturday. 'Four Syrian pro-Iran fighters were killed in Israeli air strikes on the scientific research center and warehouses near Safira east of Aleppo,' the Syrian Observatory for Human Rights said. The Britain-based monitor said two other raids further west targeting Saraqeb in Idlib province killed a fifth person. Israeli authorities rarely comment on such strikes but have repeatedly said they will not allow archenemy Iran to expand its presence in Syria. The Observatory said the strikes targeted two headquarters of Syrian regime forces frequented by members of the Iran-backed Hezbollah group. Late Saturday, the Observatory reported 'two Israeli strikes' targeting a Syrian army radar position in the southern province of Suweida, without immediately giving further details. Since Syria's civil war broke out in 2011, Israel has carried out hundreds of strikes in Syria, mainly targeting army positions and fighters including from Hezbollah. The monitor said the Idlib raids took place near the front line of the rebel group Hayat Tahrir al-Sham (HTS), the main rebel organization active in the area. HTS controls swaths of the Idlib province and parts of neighboring Aleppo, Hama and Latakia. Syria's official SANA news agency also reported the raids, citing a military source. 'The Israeli army launched an air attack from the direction of southeast Aleppo, targeting a number of sites in the Aleppo and Idlib region,' it said. Several soldiers were injured and there were 'material losses,' SANA added. It said the strikes took place at 12:45 a.m. local time, (2245 GMT Friday). Such strikes have intensified since the escalation on September 23 of Israel's war against Hezbollah in Lebanon. Targets for attack have included border crossings between Syrian and Lebanon, which Israel said have been used as supply routes to rearm Hezbollah.	https://www.voanews.com/a/israeli-raids-on-syria-kill-4-militants-war-monitor-says-/7858370.html	2024-11-09T15:07:06-08:00	
Spaniards demand Valencia leader resign for bungled flood response	VALENCIA, Spain — Tens of thousands of Spaniards marched in the eastern city of Valencia on Saturday to demand the resignation of the regional president in charge of the emergency response to last week's floods that left more than 200 dead and others missing. A group of protestors clashed with riot police in front of Valencia's city hall, where the protestors started their march to the seat of the regional government. Police used batons to beat them back. Regional leader Carlos Mazon is under pressure after his administration failed to issue flood alerts to citizens' cellphones until hours after the flooding started on the night of October 29. Many marchers held up homemade signs or chanted 'Mazon Resign!' Others carried signs with messages such as 'You Killed Us!' Upon arrival at the regional government seat, some protesters slung mud on the building and left handprints of the muck on its facade. Earlier Saturday, Mazon told regional broadcaster A Punt that 'there will be time to hold officials accountable,' but that now 'is time to keep cleaning our streets, helping people and rebuilding.' He said that he 'respected' the march. Mazon, of the conservative Popular Party, is also being criticized for what people perceive as the slow and chaotic response to the natural disaster. Thousands of volunteers were the first boots on the ground in many of the hardest hit areas on Valencia's southern outskirts. It took days for officials to mobilize the thousands of police reinforcements and soldiers that the regional government asked central authorities to send in. In Spain, regional governments are charged with handling civil protection and can ask the national government in Madrid, led by the Socialists, for extra resources. Mazon has defended his handling of the crisis, saying that its magnitude was unforeseeable and that his administration didn't receive sufficient warnings from central authorities. But Spain's weather agency issued a red alert, the highest level of warning, for bad weather as early as 7:30 a.m. on Tuesday morning as the disaster loomed. Some communities were flooded by 6 p.m. It took until after 8 p.m. for Mazon's administration to send out alerts to people's cellphones. Mazon was with Spain's royals and Socialist prime minister when they were pelted with mud by enraged residents during their first visit to a devastated area last weekend. Sara Sanchez Gurillo attended the protest because she had lost her brother-in-law, 62-year-old Candido Molina Pulgarin. She said his body was found in a field of orange trees after he was trapped by the water in his home in the town of Cheste, west of Valencia. She wanted Mazon to go, but also had harsh words for the country's leaders. 'It's shameful what has happened,' Sanchez said. 'They knew that the sky was going to fall and yet they didn't warn anyone. They didn't evacuate the people. We want them to resign!' 'The central government should have taken charge. They should have sent in the army earlier. The king should have made them send it in. Why do we want him as a symbolic figure? He is worthless. The people are alone. They have abandoned us.' The death toll stood at 220 victims Saturday, with 212 coming in the eastern Valencia region, as the search for bodies goes on. Thousands more lost their homes and streets are still covered in mud and debris 11 days since the arrival of a tsunami-like wave following a record deluge.	https://www.voanews.com/a/spaniards-demand-valencia-leader-resign-for-bungled-flood-response-/7858365.html	2024-11-09T14:45:40-08:00	
Afghanistan to attend UN climate talks, says Kabul	kabul, Afghanistan — An Afghan delegation will attend the upcoming United Nations climate change summit in Azerbaijan, the foreign ministry spokesperson told Agence France-Presse on Saturday, marking a first since the Taliban government came to power. 'A delegation of the Afghan government will be in Baku' for the COP29 summit, which opens on Monday in the Azerbaijani capital, said the spokesperson, Abdul Qahar Balkhi. It was not immediately clear in what capacity the delegation would participate at COP29, but sources indicated it would have observer status. Afghanistan is ranked as the country sixth most vulnerable to climate change and Taliban authorities have pushed for the government's participation in COP summits, saying their political isolation shouldn't bar them from international climate talks. No state has recognized the Taliban authorities since they swept to power in 2021, ousting the Western-backed administration. Officials from the country's National Environmental Protection Agency have repeatedly said climate change should not be politicized and called for environment-related projects put on hold due to the Taliban takeover to be reinstated. Azerbaijan, a fossil fuel-rich former Soviet republic wedged between Russia and Iran, will host the COP29 from November 11-22. Baku reopened its embassy in Kabul in February this year, though it has not officially recognized the Taliban government.	https://www.voanews.com/a/afghanistan-to-attend-un-climate-talks-says-kabul/7858352.html	2024-11-09T14:04:34-08:00	
Putin signs into law mutual defense treaty with North Korea	Russian President Vladimir Putin signed into law a treaty on the country's strategic partnership with North Korea which includes a mutual defense provision, according to a decree published Saturday. The accord, signed by Putin and North Korean leader Kim Jong Un in June after a summit in Pyongyang, calls on each side to come to the other's aid in case of an armed attack. Russia's upper house ratified the treaty this week, while the lower house endorsed it last month. Putin signed a decree on that ratification that appeared Saturday on a government website outlining legislative procedures. The treaty galvanizes closer ties between Moscow and Pyongyang since Russia launched its full-scale invasion of Ukraine in February 2022. Reports from South Korea and Western countries say North Korea has supplied Russia with weaponry. Ukrainian forensic experts say they have found traces of the weapons at sites of Russian attacks. Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy said Thursday that North Korea has sent 11,000 troops to Russia and some of them suffered casualties in combat with Kyiv's forces in Russia's southern Kursk region. Russia has not confirmed the presence of the North Korean troops.	https://www.voanews.com/a/putin-signs-into-law-mutual-defense-treaty-with-north-korea-/7858346.html	2024-11-09T13:55:43-08:00	
Israeli strikes pound Lebanese towns, killing more than 20 say officials	Beirut — Israeli airstrikes on Lebanon over the last day have killed more than 20 people including several children, Lebanese authorities said on Saturday, after heavy Israeli bombardment pounded the southern suburbs of the capital Beirut overnight. At least seven people were killed in the coastal city of Tyre late on Friday, Lebanon's health ministry said. The Israeli military has previously ordered swathes of the city to evacuate but there were no orders published by the Israeli military spokesperson on social media platform X ahead of Friday's strikes. The ministry said two children were among the dead. Rescue operations were ongoing and other body parts retrieved in the aftermath of the attack would undergo DNA testing to identify them, the ministry added. At least 16 more people were killed in Israeli strikes on Saturday across the eastern plains around the historic city of Baalbek, the area's governor said in a post on social media platform X. Israel's military did not immediately respond to a request for comment. The Lebanese health ministry said Israeli attacks have killed at least 3,136 people and wounded 13,979 in Lebanon over the last year. The toll includes 619 women and 194 children. Israel has been locked in fighting with Lebanese armed group Hezbollah since October 2023, but fighting has escalated dramatically since late September of this year. Israel has intensified and expanded its bombing campaign, and Hezbollah has ramped up daily rocket and drone attacks against Israel. The Iran-backed group announced more than 20 operations on Saturday, as well as one that it said fighters carried out the previous day against a military factory south of Tel Aviv. More than a dozen Israeli strikes also hit the southern suburbs of Beirut overnight, once a bustling collection of neighborhoods and a key stronghold of Hezbollah. Now, many buildings have been almost entirely flattened, with Hezbollah's yellow flags jutting out from the ruins, according to Reuters reporters who were taken on a tour of the area by Hezbollah. Some buildings were partially damaged by the strikes, leading some floors to collapse and sending furniture and other personal belongings spilling onto parked cars below. Men and women were picking through the rubble for their belongings, shoving blankets and mats under their arms or into black plastic bags. 'We are trying to gather as many [of our possessions] as we can, so we can manage to live off them, nothing more,' said Hassan Hannawi, one of the men looking for his belongings.	https://www.voanews.com/a/7858334.html	2024-11-09T13:37:06-08:00	
Experts release new guidelines for preventing strokes	Most strokes could be prevented, according to new guidelines aimed at helping people and their doctors do just that. Stroke was the fourth-leading cause of death in the U.S. in 2023, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, and more than half a million Americans have a stroke every year. But up to 80% of strokes may be preventable with better nutrition, exercise and identification of risk factors. The first new guidelines on stroke prevention in 10 years from the American Stroke Association, a division of the American Heart Association, include recommendations for people and doctors that reflect a better understanding of who gets strokes and why, along with new drugs that can help reduce risk. The good news is that the best way to reduce your risk for stroke is also the best way to reduce your risk for a whole host of health problems — eat a healthy diet, move your body and don't smoke. The bad news is that it's not always so easy to sustain. Dr. Sean Duke, a stroke doctor at the University of Mississippi Medical Center, blames the forces in society that keep people sedentary and eating poorly, like cell phones and cheap, unhealthy food. 'Our world is stacked against us,' he said. Here's what to know about stroke and the new guidelines: What is a stroke? A stroke happens when blood flow to part of the brain is blocked or if a blood vessel in the brain bursts. That deprives the brain of oxygen which can cause brain damage that can lead to difficulty thinking, talking and walking, or even death. How eating healthy can reduce your risk for stroke Eating healthy can help control several factors that increase your risk for stroke, including high cholesterol, high blood sugar, and obesity, according to the heart association. The group recommends foods in the so-called Mediterranean diet such as fruits, vegetables, whole grains and olive oil, which can help keep cholesterol levels down. It suggests limiting red meat and other sources of saturated fat. Instead, get your protein from beans, nuts, poultry, fish and seafood. Limit highly processed foods and foods and drinks with a lot of added sugar. This can also reduce your calorie intake, which helps keep weight in check. Moving your body can help prevent strokes Getting up and walking around for at least 10 minutes a day can 'drastically' reduce your risk, said Dr. Cheryl Bushnell, a neurologist at Wake Forest University School of Medicine who was part of the group that came up with the new guidelines. Among the many benefits: Regular exercise can help reduce blood pressure, a major risk factor for stroke. Of course, more is better: The heart association recommends at least 150 minutes of moderate aerobic or 75 minutes of vigorous activity — or some combination — per week. How you do it doesn't matter so much, experts said: Go to the gym, take a walk or run in your neighborhood or use treadmills or stepper machines at home. New tools to reduce obesity, a risk factor for stroke Diet and exercise can help control weight, another important risk factor for strokes. But a new class of drugs that can drastically reduce weight have been approved by regulators, providing new tools to reduce stroke risk since guidelines were last updated. The guidelines now recommend that doctors consider prescribing these drugs, including those sold under the brand names Ozempic, Wegovy, Mounjaro and Zepbound, to people with obesity or diabetes. But while those drugs can help, people still need to eat well and get exercise, cautions Dr. Fadi Nahab, a stroke expert at Emory University Hospital. Guidelines help identify people who might be at higher risk The new guidelines for the first time recommend doctors screen patients for other factors that could increase stroke risk, including sex and gender and non-medical factors such as economic stability, access to health care, discrimination and racism. For example, the risk for having a first stroke is nearly twice as high for Black adults in the U.S. as it is for white adults, according to the CDC. 'If somebody doesn't have insurance or they can't get to a doctor's office because of transportation issues or they can't get off work to get health care ... these are all things that can impact the ability to prevent stroke,' Bushnell said. Doctors may be able to point to resources for low-cost health care or food, and can give ideas about how to be active without breaking the bank for a gym membership. The guidelines also now recommend doctors should screen for conditions that could increase a woman's risk for stroke, such as high blood pressure during pregnancy or early menopause. How do I know if I'm having a stroke and what do I do? Three of the most common stroke symptoms include face weakness, arm weakness and difficulty speaking. And time is important, because brain damage can happen quickly and damage can be limited if a stroke is treated quickly. Stroke experts have coined an acronym to help you remember: FAST. F for face, A for arm, S for speech, and T for time. If you think you or a loved one could be having a stroke, call 911 right away.	https://www.voanews.com/a/experts-release-new-guidelines-for-preventing-strokes/7858318.html	2024-11-09T12:55:33-08:00	
Burkina wants to reinstate death penalty: government source	Abidjan, Ivory Coast — Burkina Faso's military regime wants to reinstate the death penalty after the West African country abolished it in 2018, a government source told AFP on Saturday. The latest execution in Burkina Faso was in 1988, according to Amnesty International. Reintroducing capital punishment to the penal code 'is being considered. It's up to the government to discuss it, then make the proposal to the Transitional Legislative Assembly (ALT) for adoption,' the source said, adding that the date had not been chosen. Justice Minister Rodrigue Bayala said Friday — after parliament passed a bill introducing community service — that 'the issue of death penalty, which is being discussed, will be implemented in the draft criminal code.' Bayala also said there could be further amendments to the criminal code, 'to follow the vision and the guidelines given by the head of state, Captain Ibrahim Traore,' who seized power in a September 2022 coup. The Burkinabe government in July passed a bill that included plans to ban homosexuality. Amnesty International has reported a surge in the use of the death penalty on the African continent, saying in a statement in October that 'recorded executions more than tripled and recorded death sentences increased significantly by 66%.' On the other hand, the rights group noted that '24 countries across sub-Saharan Africa have abolished the death penalty for all crimes while two additional countries have abolished it for ordinary crimes only.' 'Kenya and Zimbabwe currently have bills tabled to abolish the death penalty for all crimes, while Gambia ... has commenced a constitutional amendment process that will ... effectively abolish the death penalty,' it said.	https://www.voanews.com/a/7858302.html	2024-11-09T12:09:49-08:00	
Ecuador's vice president suspended amid rift with president	QUITO, ECUADOR — Ecuadoran Vice President Veronica Abad was suspended Saturday for 150 days after being accused of 'unjustified abandonment' of her duties. It comes during a public rift between Abad and President Daniel Noboa that could have implications for Ecuador's February elections. Abad's suspension without pay came at midnight, her lawyer Dominique Davila told The Associated Press. Davila called the move 'extremely serious' and claimed it may not have any legal backing. Abad was accused by the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of not following an order in September to temporarily transfer her from Israel — where she also serves as ambassador — to Turkey due to the conflict, arriving eight days after the order. Abad had argued that she was not 'properly prepared' for the trip to Turkey and that Ecuador's government suggested 'that I leave my children in Israel to go to Turkey alone.' The move comes at a time of deep tensions between Abad and Noboa who, despite running the government together, have clashed for years, establishing a sort of feud, the origins of which are unknown. In August, Abad filed a legal complaint accusing Noboa and other officials of gender-based violence. The suspension was the second sanction against Abad in less than a week. Abad was also fined $8,500 on Tuesday by Ecuador’s Electoral Disputes Tribunal for early election campaigning in 2023, when she was a candidate for mayor of Cuenca. The vice president has previously cited the Israel case and other incidents as government measures to pressure her to resign, while the president has called her 'disloyal.' Davila said the suspension was the latest attempt to push Abad out, calling it a 'trick to prevent the presidential succession' and something they planned to appeal. Abad’s fate has special importance for Noboa, who hopes to run for reelection in February 2025 and will have to request a leave of absence to carry out the campaign, according to experts. In that case, Abad would take over the presidency. But with the recent sanctions, the pathway to her taking the reins would be blocked, according to constitutional lawyer Andre Benavides. The expert said that while the suspension lacks strong legal backing, any appeals process to reverse the 150-day suspension would take longer than the suspension period.	https://www.voanews.com/a/ecuador-s-vice-president-suspended-amid-rift-with-president/7858286.html	2024-11-09T11:12:29-08:00	
US will appeal ruling that 9/11 defendants can plead guilty, avoid death penalty	WASHINGTON — The U.S. Defense Department will appeal a military judge's ruling that plea agreements struck by Khalid Sheikh Mohammed, the alleged mastermind of the September 11, 2001, attacks, and two of his co-defendants are valid, a defense official said Saturday. The ruling this past week voided Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin's order to throw out the deals and concluded that the plea agreements were valid. The judge granted the three motions to enter guilty pleas and said he would schedule them for a future date to be determined by the military commission. The department will also seek a postponement of any hearing on the pleas, according to the official, who was not authorized to publicly discuss legal matters and spoke on condition of anonymity. Rear Admiral Aaron Rugh, the chief prosecutor, sent a letter Friday to the families of 9/11 victims informing them of the decision. The ruling by the judge, Air Force Colonel Matthew McCall, allowed the three 9/11 defendants to enter guilty pleas in the U.S. military courtroom at Guantanamo Bay, Cuba, and would spare them the risk of the death penalty. The pleas by Mohammed, Walid bin Attash and Mustafa al-Hawsawi would be a key step toward closing out the long-running and legally troubled government prosecution in the attacks that killed nearly 3,000 people. Government prosecutors had negotiated the deals with defense lawyers under government auspices, and the top official for the military commission at Guantanamo had approved the agreements. But the deals were immediately slammed by Republican lawmakers and others when they were made public this summer. Within days, Austin issued an order saying he was nullifying them. He said plea bargains in possible death penalty cases tied to one of the gravest crimes ever carried out on U.S. soil were a momentous step that should only be decided by the defense secretary. The judge had ruled that Austin lacked the legal authority to toss out the plea deals. The agreements, and Austin’s attempt to reverse them, have made for one of the most fraught episodes in a U.S. prosecution marked by delays and legal difficulties. That includes years of ongoing pretrial hearings to determine the admissibility of statements by the defendants, given their torture in CIA custody. While families of some of the victims and others are adamant that the 9/11 prosecutions continue until trial and possible death sentences, legal experts say it is not clear that could ever happen. If the 9/11 cases ever clear the hurdles of trial, verdicts and sentencings, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit would likely hear many of the issues in the course of any death penalty appeals. The issues include the CIA destruction of videos of interrogations, whether Austin’s plea deal reversal constituted unlawful interference and whether the torture of the men tainted subsequent interrogations by 'clean teams' of FBI agents that did not involve violence.	https://www.voanews.com/a/us-will-appeal-ruling-that-9-11-defendants-can-plead-guilty-avoid-death-penalty/7858278.html	2024-11-09T10:48:09-08:00	
Suspect arrested in killing of American tourist in Budapest	BUDAPEST, HUNGARY — A 31-year-old American tourist was killed while on vacation in Hungary’s capital, and the suspect, a 37-year-old Irish man, has been arrested, Hungarian police said Saturday. The victim, Mackenzie Michalski of Portland, Oregon, was reported missing on November 5 after she was last seen at a nightclub in central Budapest. Police launched a missing person investigation and reviewed security footage from local nightclubs, on which they observed Michalski with a man later identified as the suspect in several of the clubs the night of her disappearance. Police detained the man, an Irish citizen, on the evening of November 7. Investigators said that Michalski and the suspect met at a nightclub and danced before leaving for the man's rented apartment. The man killed Michalski while they were engaged in an 'intimate encounter,' police said. The suspect, whom police identified by the initials L.T.M., later confessed to the killing but said it was an accident, police said, adding that he attempted to cover up his crime by cleaning the apartment and hiding Michalski's body in a wardrobe before purchasing a suitcase and placing her body inside. He then rented a car and drove to Lake Balaton, around 150 kilometers (90 miles) southwest of Budapest, where he disposed of the body in a wooden area outside the town of Szigliget. Video released by police showed the suspect guiding authorities to the location where he had left the body. Police said the suspect had made internet searches before being apprehended on how to dispose of a body, police procedures in missing person cases, whether pigs really eat dead bodies and the presence of wild boars in the Lake Balaton area. He also made an internet search inquiring on the competence of Budapest police. Michalski’s parents are currently in Budapest, police told The Associated Press. According to a post by an administrator of a Facebook group called 'Find Mackenzie Michalski,' which was created on November 7, Michalski, who went by 'Kenzie,' was a nurse practitioner who 'will forever be remembered as a beautiful and compassionate young woman.'	https://www.voanews.com/a/suspect-arrested-in-killing-of-american-tourist-in-budapest/7858275.html	2024-11-09T10:39:35-08:00	
Lithuanian defense minister proposes ways for smoother relations between Europe, Trump	PRAGUE — European nations should not repeat the mistake of creating a barrier between them and President-elect Donald Trump but instead cooperate on issues of common interest, Lithuania’s defense minister said Saturday. Assuming that Trump will again apply what Laurynas Kasciunas called 'his contract approach to our relations,' Kasciunas outlined areas where Europe and the new president could join forces: more investment in defense, European acquisition of American weapons and cooperation on containing China and Iran. 'What we did a little bit wrong last time when he was elected [by defeating] Hillary Clinton, and it was unexpected, we built against him a moral wall,' Kasciunas told The Associated Press. 'I think it was not a correct way,' Kasciunas said. He was speaking on the sidelines of a three-day gathering in Prague focusing on European and transatlantic military capabilities. During his first term, from 2017 to 2021, Trump pushed NATO’s European members to spend more on defense, up to and beyond 2% of gross domestic product, and to be less reliant on U.S. military. That’s what the allies have been doing. A total of 23 members are expected to meet the 2% target this year, compared with three 10 years ago, according to NATO. Lithuania has already surpassed 2.5% with a goal of reaching 4%, which would be more than the United States. Europe’s defense industry managed to increase output of some products after Russia’s full-scale invasion of Ukraine in 2022, but European countries also donated their own weapons to Ukraine and 'remain dependent on the U.S. for some important aspects of their military capability,' a report published by the London-based International Institute for Strategic Studies at the Prague event said. Lithuania, which borders Russia’s Kaliningrad exclave to the west and Belarus to the east, remains the largest buyer of U.S. arms among the three Baltic states. The minister, whose country was in a spat with China over Taiwan, also spoke in favor of European Union sanctions on Iran. However, Russia's war against Ukraine has been divisive. Trump has repeatedly taken issue with U.S. aid to Ukraine, made vague vows to end the war and has praised Russian President Vladimir Putin. Kasciunas insisted that Europe’s military aid to Ukraine must continue and that Russia should not dictate the conditions for peace, while a limited cease-fire would not make sense because it would only help Russian troops recover from losses and strike again. 'We need a just peace, credible peace,' he said. During his election campaign, Trump also threatened actions that could have groundbreaking consequences for nations across Europe, from a trade war with the EU to a withdrawal of NATO commitments.	https://www.voanews.com/a/lithuanian-defense-minister-proposes-ways-for-smoother-relations-between-europe-trump/7858268.html	2024-11-09T10:29:44-08:00	
Tourists in Rome have walkway to Trevi Fountain but can't toss coins into it	ROME — Tourists in Rome won’t be allowed to toss coins over their shoulders into the Trevi Fountain, following tradition, although an elevated walkway now gives limited access to the monument during maintenance work. Rome Mayor Roberto Gualtieri inaugurated the steel walkway Saturday, saying it will provide tourists with a close-up view of the fountain and calling it a 'unique experience' that won’t be ruined by overcrowding. The walkway over the fountain’s basin will be able to accommodate about 130 people at a time. But tourists won’t be allowed to toss coins from there, as the fountain is currently drained, and could face a 50-euro fine if they do, the mayor warned. City lore has it that tossing a coin into the Baroque fountain will ensure a return trip to Rome. Gualtieri said a small pool has been set up next to the walkway to collect the coins, which are donated to the Caritas charity to fund meals for people in need. The walkway will remain until the end of the maintenance work, which is expected to be finished by year's end. Rome city officials are devising a plan to block off the area around the fountain. Under the plan, visitors will be required to book online and pay 2 euros ($2.20). Once inside, they will have 30 minutes to enjoy the fountain.	https://www.voanews.com/a/tourists-in-rome-have-walkway-to-trevi-fountain-but-can-t-toss-coins-into-it/7858262.html	2024-11-09T10:13:39-08:00	
Ukrainian judge in occupied territory refuses to side with Russia	In parts of Ukraine occupied by Russia, Ukrainian officials can suddenly find themselves at the mercy of Moscow and cut off from Kyiv.

Swiss villagers ready to evacuate after Alpine rockslide alert — again	GENEVA — Authorities in eastern Switzerland on Saturday ordered residents of a tiny village to prepare to evacuate as an Alpine rockslide looming overhead threatened to break loose and spill down on their homes. It was the second time that residents of Brienz received evacuation orders, after a similar threat last summer. Local officials said in a statement to villagers that 'high above Brienz, the top part of the uppermost part of the rubble pile has accelerated considerably. It cannot be ruled out that up to 1.2 million cubic meters of rock debris will be moving down the valley in a stream of debris.' Measurements taken by the municipality’s early warning service showed that the top of the rubble pile has been moving at a rate of more than 30 centimeters (11.8 inches) per day at times since the second half of September, the SRF public broadcaster reported. They said that if the rockslide starts accelerating, it could soon reach the village. The centuries-old village straddles German- and Romansch-speaking parts of the eastern Graubuenden region, sitting southwest of Davos at an altitude of about 1,150 meters (about 3,800 feet). Today it has less than 100 residents. The mountain and the rocks on it have been moving since the last Ice Age, local officials say. Over the last century, the village itself has moved a few centimeters each year, but the movement sped up over the last 20 years. The landslide has been moving about a meter (about 3 feet) per year.	https://www.voanews.com/a/swiss-villagers-ready-to-evacuate-after-alpine-rockslide-alert-again/7858238.html	2024-11-09T09:37:39-08:00	
Biden, Trump will meet in Oval Office Wednesday, White House says	WASHINGTON — U.S. President Joe Biden will meet with President-elect Donald Trump at the White House on Wednesday after Biden pledged an orderly transfer of power following the Republican's decisive election victory. Biden and Trump will meet at the Oval Office at 11:00 a.m., the White House said Saturday, with the clock ticking down to the ex-president's return to power in January. Trump sealed a historic comeback to the White House in the November 5 election, cementing what is set to be more than a decade of U.S. politics overshadowed by his often divisive politics. The 78-year-old won wider margins than before, despite a criminal conviction and two impeachments while in office. Exit polls showed that voters' top concern remained the economy and inflation that spiked under Biden in the wake of the COVID pandemic. Biden, who dropped out of the race in July over concerns about his ability to continue at the age of 81, called Trump to congratulate him after his election win.	https://www.voanews.com/a/biden-trump-will-meet-in-oval-office-wednesday-white-house-says/7858229.html	2024-11-09T09:30:09-08:00

Iranian American activist defiant over Iranian plots to kill her, Trump	BERLIN — In the middle of a Berlin hotel cafe, Masih Alinejad raises her voice and starts singing at the top of her lungs in Farsi, as waiters and her three German government bodyguards turn to watch. 'I blossom through my wounds and my scars,' she translates the lyrics as. 'Because I am a woman. I am a woman. I am a woman.' Alinejad was expressing her defiance and asserting her right to express herself following the news of Iranian murder-for-hire plots to kill her and Donald Trump that were disclosed by the U.S. Justice Department. She said that some Iranian women had been jailed for singing. The Iranian American human rights activist, who was in Berlin on Saturday to celebrate the 35th anniversary of the fall of the Berlin Wall together with other human rights activists from around the globe, told The Associated Press in an interview that despite the shock of the news, she felt more determination than ever to continue fighting for women's rights in Iran. 'They want to get rid of me. When they want me dead, it means that I’m doing something. I’m hurting them so bad,' said Alinejad, 48, referring to the Iranian government. 'I’m echoing the voice of powerful women and that scares them.' She raised her hand in a defiant fist repeatedly during the interview. On Friday, the U.S. Justice Department said that it was charging a man who said he had been tasked by a government official before this week’s election with planning the assassination of Trump. Investigators were told of the plan by Farhad Shakeri, an accused Iranian government asset who spent time in American prisons for robbery and who authorities say maintains a network of criminal associates enlisted by Tehran for surveillance and murder-for-hire plots. Shakeri is at large and remains in Iran. Two other men — identified as Jonathan Loadholt and Carlisle Rivera by the U.S. Justice Department — were arrested on charges that Shakeri recruited them to follow and kill Alinejad, who has endured multiple Iranian murder-for-hire plots foiled by law enforcement. The Justice Department alleges that the two men spent months conducting surveillance on her and, during their efforts to locate and kill her, shared messages about their progress and photographs. Around February, they traveled to Fairfield University in the U.S. state of Connecticut, where Alinejad was scheduled to appear, and took photos of the campus. Around April, Shakeri sent Rivera a series of voice notes discussing their efforts to locate and kill her, the Justice Department said in a statement Friday. In one voice note, Shakeri told Rivera that 'you gotta wait and have patience to catch her either going in the house or coming out or following her out somewhere and taking care of it,' the statement said. 'It’s scary. But at the same time, I was very pleased that the U.S. law enforcement is protecting me,' Alinejad said, recounting her call with American security officials. 'The same person who was trying to kill President Trump was assigned to kill me as well. I mean, that’s a badge of honor.' In Tehran, Esmail Baghaei, an Iranian Foreign Ministry spokesperson, rejected the report and called it a plot by Israel-linked circles to make Iran-U.S. relations more complicated, the official IRNA news agency reported. Alinejad is a prominent figure on Farsi-language satellite channels abroad that critically view Iran, and she has worked as a contractor for U.S.-funded Voice of America’s Farsi-language network since 2015. She fled Iran following the country’s disputed 2009 presidential election and became a U.S. citizen in October 2019. Alinejad accused the Iranian government of continuing to oppress women in Iran and make them wear the mandatory headscarf, or hijab, even two years after the death of Mahsa Amini that sparked weekslong mass protests. The fact that the Iranian government has repeatedly tried to kill her, she said, 'makes me more determined to give voice to powerful women inside Iran who are facing the same killers every single day.'	https://www.voanews.com/a/iranian-american-activist-defiant-over-iranian-plots-to-kill-her-trump/7858221.html	2024-11-09T09:12:37-08:00	
Iran accuses Germany of defending 'terrorist' after death of dual national	TEHRAN, IRAN — Iranian Foreign Minister Abbas Araghchi accused Germany of defending a 'terrorist' after the death in Iran of Jamshid Sharmahd, a dual national sentenced to execution, which triggered condemnation from Berlin. Iran on October 28 announced the execution of Sharmahd, 69, but eight days later the judiciary spokesperson said Sharmahd had died before the 'imminent' execution could be carried out, implying natural causes. After the initial execution announcement, Berlin recalled its ambassador to Iran and closed three Iranian consulates in Germany. That in turn triggered what Iran called a 'strong protest' to the German charge d'affaires, who was summoned. 'I regret that this is straining German-Iranian relations, and I wish I could have prevented it,' Araghchi said in an interview published Friday by the German weekly Der Spiegel. 'But to do that, the German government would have had to cooperate and communicate that this is a terrorist, instead of defending someone who has trampled all humanitarian standards underfoot,' he said, according to Spiegel's English edition published online. Earlier this week, Germany's Foreign Ministry, reacting to the official's comment about Sharmahd’s passing, said, 'His death was confirmed to us by the Iranian side. 'Jamshid Sharmahd was abducted by Iran and held for years without a fair trial, in inhumane conditions and without the necessary medical care,' the ministry said. 'Iran is responsible for his death.' Germany added it was 'lobbying the Iranian government to hand over his body to his family.' Iran, which does not recognize dual citizenship, announced Sharmahd's arrest after a 'complex operation,' without specifying when, where or how he was detained. His family said he was seized by Iranian authorities in 2020 while traveling through the United Arab Emirates. Iran sentenced Sharmahd to death for his involvement in an April 2008 bombing of a mosque in Shiraz, in the south of the country, which killed 14 people and wounded about 300. Sharmahd was also accused of leading the Tondar group, which aims to topple the Islamic Republic. Iran classes it as a terrorist organization. Jamshid Sharmahd's daughter has told AFP that she and her family 'do not trust anything' Iran says about the circumstances of her father's death. 'If there is a corpse, he needs to be returned and brought back to us as soon as possible,' Gazelle Sharmahd said. Araghchi told Der Spiegel that, 'If his family officially submits a request, we see no obstacles' to returning Jamshid Sharmahd's body. 'The question of whether he was executed or died of natural causes is beside the point,' he said. During the interview, Araghchi also censured what he called the Western 'double standards' that he said failed to condemn Israel for its actions in the Gaza Strip, where its war with Hamas has led to tens of thousands of deaths. 'I am not calling Hamas, Hezbollah and others, 'proxies.' I call them freedom movements. Supporting them brings no benefits to Iran,' which arms and finances Lebanon's Hezbollah and backs Hamas, Araghchi told the German publication.	https://www.voanews.com/a/7858214.html	2024-11-09T09:00:27-08:00	
Qatar to pull out of Gaza cease-fire mediation, source says	DOHA, QATAR — Qatar will stop trying to mediate a Gaza cease-fire deal until Hamas and Israel show a 'sincere willingness' to return to the negotiating table, an official briefed on the matter told Reuters on Saturday, in the biggest setback to efforts to reach a truce since the war began. The Gulf country has also concluded that Hamas' political office in Doha 'no longer serves its purpose,' the official added, in a blow to the Palestinian militant group whose top leaders have been assassinated by Israel. Qatar, alongside the United States and Egypt, has played a major role in rounds of so-far fruitless talks to broker a cease fire to the yearlong war in Gaza. The latest round of talks in mid-October failed to produce a deal, with Hamas rejecting a short-term proposal. 'The Qataris have said since the start of the conflict that they can only mediate when both parties demonstrate a genuine interest in finding a resolution,' the official said, adding that Qatar had notified Hamas, Israel and the U.S. administration of its decision. Washington had told Qatar that Hamas' presence in Doha was no longer acceptable in the weeks since the Palestinian militant group rejected the latest proposal to achieve a cease fire and hostage deal, a U.S. official said on Friday.	https://www.voanews.com/a/qatar-to-pull-out-of-gaza-cease-fire-mediation-source-says/7858188.html	2024-11-09T08:24:44-08:00	
Iran urges Trump to change 'maximum pressure' policy	TEHRAN, IRAN — Iran signaled an openness toward Donald Trump Saturday, calling on the president-elect to adopt new policies toward it after Washington accused Tehran of involvement in a plot to kill him. Vice President for Strategic Affairs Mohammad Javad Zarif urged Trump to reassess the policy of 'maximum pressure' he employed against the Islamic republic during his first term. 'Trump must show that he is not following the wrong policies of the past,' Zarif told reporters. His remarks came after the United States accused Iran of conspiring to assassinate Trump. The Foreign Ministry described the American accusations Saturday as 'totally unfounded.' Tehran and Washington severed diplomatic relations shortly after the Islamic revolution in 1979. 2015 nuclear power accord Zarif, a veteran diplomat who previously served as foreign minister, helped to seal the 2015 nuclear accord between Iran and Western powers, including the United States. However, the deal was torpedoed in 2018 after the United States unilaterally withdrew from the deal under Trump, who later reimposed sanctions on Tehran. In response, Iran rolled back its obligations under the deal and has since enriched uranium up to 60%, just 30 percentage points lower than nuclear-grade uranium. Tehran has repeatedly denied Western accusations that it seeks to develop a nuclear weapon. Zarif said Saturday that it was Trump's political approach toward Iran that led to the surge in enrichment levels. 'He must have realized that the maximum pressure policy that he initiated caused Iran's enrichment to reach 60% from 3.5% and increased its centrifuges,' he said. Provocations 'As a man of calculation, he should do the math and see what the advantages and disadvantages of this policy have been and whether he wants to continue or change this harmful policy,' Zarif said. In December 2017, Trump recognized Jerusalem as Israel's capital and the following year moved the American embassy there. Trump also recognized Israeli sovereignty over the Golan Heights, which Israel captured from Syria in 1967 and later annexed. During his first term, Trump also ordered the killing of revered Iranian military commander Qasem Soleimani, who led the Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps foreign operations arm, the Quds Force. Soleimani was killed in a drone strike while he was in the Iraqi capital, Baghdad, in January 2020. The Islamic Republic has not recognized its archnemesis Israel since the U.S.-backed shah was toppled in 1979. On Thursday, Foreign Ministry spokesperson Esmaeil Baghaei said he hoped the president-elect's return to power would allow Washington to 'revise the wrong approaches of the past,' although he avoided mentioning Trump by name. On Tuesday, election day in the United States, Trump told reporters he was 'not looking to do damage to Iran.' 'My terms are very easy. They can't have a nuclear weapon. I'd like them to be a very successful country,' he said after casting his ballot. Iran insists that it uses nuclear technology for safe and civilian purposes. Trump's election victory came after Iran and Israel attacked each other directly, raising fears of a further regional spillover of the conflicts in Gaza and Lebanon.	https://www.voanews.com/a/iran-urges-trump-to-change-maximum-pressure-policy/7858161.html	2024-11-09T08:04:13-08:00	
After election, Kenya-born legislator heads to Minnesota capitol	MINNEAPOLIS, MINNESOTA — Huldah Momanyi Hiltsley made history November 5 by becoming the first Kenyan-born immigrant elected to the Minnesota House of Representatives. She describes her victory as a testament to resilience, determination and the realization of the American dream. Standing in the State Capitol for the first time on the morning of her orientation, Hiltsley told VOA she was overwhelmed with emotions and eager to start her journey as an elected official. 'I am super excited,' Hiltsley said. 'Today is orientation day for new legislators, and to be standing in this Capitol as an African immigrant woman is a tremendous honor. I’m just overexcited right now.' She said this milestone did not come easily. Her path to the Minnesota State Capitol was marked by struggles, including a fight against an immigration system that nearly led to her family’s deportation. She credits much of her success to the community support and the intervention of the late U.S. Senator Paul Wellstone, whose advocacy she said ultimately secured her family’s green cards and, later, citizenship. 'Getting to this moment honestly is just a testament to the struggles that my family has gone through to be in this country,' she said. There has been a media frenzy surrounding Hiltsley’s victory, and it has captured the attention of Kenyan media, with celebrations taking place in her hometown, Nyamboyo village, which is eight hours from Nairobi, Kenya's capital. Despite the attention, Hiltsley said she remains humble. 'I’m that little girl from that little village somewhere in the middle of Kenya, and now I’m in the spotlight of this media frenzy. And so, I’m still trying to really appreciate the magnitude of the moment,' she said. Hiltsley said she has a desire to inspire others, particularly young girls in Kenya and the United States. 'It is still surreal,' she said, adding that 'if I can make it to this point, I can be a role model to somebody to remind them that it is possible that our wildest dreams are possible. And that would be something that I would look back and say, wow, I’ve made a difference in somebody’s life.' Her legislative priorities Looking ahead, Hiltsley said she is committed to championing issues that matter to her constituents in Minnesota’s Legislative District 38A. Her priorities include community-centered public safety policies, affordable housing options, workers’ rights and support for small businesses — many of which are run by African immigrants. 'The resources are out here,' she said, promising to empower her community. 'It is my job to go back to my community and tell them, hey, there are resources here. This is how this system works. Let’s work together to mobilize and make sure that we are also taking a piece of the pie,' she said. As the first Kenyan American woman in Minnesota's Legislature, Hiltsley said she recognizes the weight and responsibility of her position. She described it as 'an honor that I don’t take lightly.' 'I don’t want to be the last,' she, adding that she hopes 'this moment right here is a testimony that you can come to this country, work hard, take care of business, know your craft, stick to it, be consistent and get to where you want to.' Her message to those who have yet to succeed in their political campaigns is clear: Perseverance is key. 'Be consistent. Keep going. There’s enough space in this Legislature for more people of color, especially immigrants, because that’s the voice that is missing,' Hiltsley said. Changing political scene Hiltsley shared her thoughts on the changing political landscape in Washington, particularly with the coming administration under President-elect Donald Trump. While acknowledging the challenges, she said she will stay focused on serving her constituents in Minnesota, regardless of politics. 'We are here to serve the people, and it doesn’t matter if you are Democrat or Republican,' she said. 'We are here as legislators to serve the people of Minnesota.' Hiltsley also shared her heartfelt message to fellow Kenyans who have been celebrating her historic achievement. 'This is a historical moment, and I’m honored to be a Kenyan American,' she said. 'Let’s continue celebrating this victory, but after that, we have work to do.' She said her eyes are set on not just her role in Minnesota, but also finding ways to collaborate with Kenya’s leaders to address issues facing the country, including corruption and a lack of strong leadership. 'Kenya has unlimited potential,' she said. 'It’s up to our leaders to do right by the people.' Hiltsley will officially take her seat in the Minnesota State House of Representatives and be sworn in on January 7. Representatives are elected to serve two-year terms.

Boeing to face civil trial over 2019 MAX crash	NEW YORK — Beleaguered aviation giant Boeing is set to confront another hurdle next week when it faces a civil trial over the March 2019 Ethiopian Airlines crash that killed 157 people. The trial, scheduled for federal court in Chicago, originally included six plaintiffs, but 'all but one' have settled, a person close to the litigation told AFP this week. Barring an accord, the case will be Boeing's first civil trial over the MAX crashes. A settlement, which would need court approval, is still possible, even after the proceedings start. But the source told AFP the case is expected to go to trial, a view held by a second legal source. Plaintiffs in the case are relatives of Indian-born Manisha Nukavarapu, who was in her second year of medical school, specializing in endocrinology at East Tennessee State University. Nukavarapu, who was single and without children, boarded a 737 MAX on March 10, 2019, in Addis Ababa in a flight bound for Nairobi to visit her sister, who had just given birth, according to a complaint. But the jet, which had been delivered in November 2018, crashed just six minutes after taking off, killing everyone on board. More trials expected Relatives of 155 victims were deposed by the court between April 2019 and March 2021 in cases of wrongful death due to negligence, according to legal filings. 'As of today, there are 30 cases pending on behalf of 29 decedents,' a third legal source told AFP on October 22. The cases have been split into groups, with the next trial scheduled for April 2025 unless all the suits are settled. Boeing has 'accepted responsibility for the MAX crashes publicly and in civil litigation because the design of the MCAS ... contributed to these events,' an attorney for Boeing said at an October 11 court hearing. The MCAS was a flight stabilizing system that malfunctioned in the Ethiopian Airlines crash and in the October 2018 Lion Air crash in Indonesia, which killed 189 people. The MAX entered commercial service in May 2017. The worldwide fleet was grounded for 20 months following the Ethiopian Airlines crash. According to Boeing, more than 90% of the cases stemming from the crashes have been settled. The company has not disclosed the overall financial hit from these cases. 'Boeing has paid billions of dollars to the crash families and their lawyers in connection with civil litigation,' a Boeing attorney said at the October 11 hearing, which took place in Texas and involves a Department of Justice criminal case over the MAX. Dozens of plaintiffs have been deposed in civil litigation over the Lion Air crash, with 46 represented by Seattle law firm Herrmann. The Texas litigation concerns a new deferred prosecution agreement with the Department of Justice after the DOJ concluded Boeing flouted a $2.5 billion January 2021 criminal settlement over fraud charges related to the MAX certification. In July, Boeing agreed to plead guilty to fraud as part of the latest DPA, but the accord has yet to be accepted by a federal judge.	https://www.voanews.com/a/boeing-to-face-civil-trial-over-2019-max-crash/7858033.html	2024-11-09T04:35:00-08:00	
Berlin Wall once shaped German women's lives; echoes remain today	BERLIN — Like many other young women living in communist East Germany, Solveig Leo thought nothing about juggling work and motherhood. The mother of two was able to preside over a large state-owned farm in the northeastern village of Banzkow because child care was widely available. Contrast that with Claudia Huth, a mother of five, who grew up in capitalist West Germany. Huth quit her job as a bank clerk when she was pregnant with her first child and led a life as a traditional housewife in the village of Egelsbach, in Hesse, raising the kids and tending to her husband, who worked as a chemist. Leo and Huth fulfilled roles that in many ways were typical for women in the vastly different political systems that governed Germany during its decades of division following the country’s defeat in World War II in 1945. As Germany celebrates the 35th anniversary of the fall of the Berlin Wall on November 9, 1989 — and the country’s reunification less than a year later on October 3, 1990 — many in Germany are reflecting on how women’s lives that diverged so starkly under communism and capitalism have become much more similar again — although some differences remain even today. 'In West Germany, women — not all, but many — had to fight for their right to have a career,' said Clara Marz, the curator of an exhibition about women in divided Germany for the Federal Foundation for the Study of the Communist Dictatorship in Germany. Women in East Germany, meanwhile, often had jobs — though that was something that 'they had been ordered from above to do,' she said. Built in 1961, the Wall stood for 28 years at the front line of the Cold War between the Americans and the Soviets. It was built by the communist regime to cut off East Germans from the supposed ideological contamination of the West and to stem the tide of people fleeing East Germany. Today only a few stretches of the 156.4-kilometer (97.2-mile) barrier around the capitalist exclave of West Berlin remain, mostly as a tourist attraction. 'All the heavy industry was in the West; there was nothing here,' Leo, who is now 81 years old, said during a recent interview looking back at her life as a woman under communism. 'East Germany had to pay war reparations to the Soviet Union. Women needed to work our own way out of that misery.' By contrast, Leo said, women in the West didn't need to work because they were 'spoiled by the Marshall Plan' — the United States’ reconstruction plan that poured billions of dollars into West Germany and other European countries after the war. In capitalist West Germany, the economy recovered so quickly after the total devastation of WWII that people soon started talking of a Wirtschaftswunder, or 'economic miracle,' that brought them affluence and stability less than 10 years after the war. That economic success, however, indirectly hampered women’s quest for equal rights. Most West German women stayed at home and were expected to take care of their household while their husbands worked. Religion, too, played a much bigger role than in atheist East Germany, confining women to traditional roles as caregivers of the family. Mothers who tried to break out of these conventions and took on jobs were infamously decried as Rabenmutter, or uncaring moms who put work over family. Not all West German women perceived their traditional roles as restrictive. 'I always had this idea to be with my children, because I loved being with them,' said Huth, now 69. 'It never really occurred to me to go to work.' More than three decades after Germany’s unification, a new generation of women is barely aware of the different lives their mothers and grandmothers led depending on which part of the country they lived in. For most, combining work and motherhood has also become the normal way of life. Hannah Fiedler, an 18-year-old high school graduate from Berlin, said the fact that her family lived in East Germany during the decades of the country's division has no impact on her life today. 'East or West — it's not even a topic in our family anymore,' she said, as she sat on a bench near a thin, cobblestone path in the capital's Mitte neighborhood, which marks the former course of the Berlin Wall. She also said that growing up, she had not experienced any disadvantages because she's female. 'I'm white and privileged — for good or worse — I don't expect any problems when I enter the working world in the future,' she said. Some small differences between the formerly divided parts of Germany linger. In the former East, 74% of women work, compared with 71.5% in the West, according to a 2023 study by the Hans-Bockler-Stiftung foundation. Child care is also still more available in the former East than in the West. In 2018, 57% of children under the age of 3 were looked after in a child care facility in the eastern state of Saxony. That compares with 27% in the western state of North Rhine-Westphalia and 44% in Hamburg and Bremen, according to Germany's Federal Statistical Office. Germany trails some other European countries when it comes to gender equality. About 31.4% lawmakers in Germany's national parliament are female, compared with 41% in Belgium's parliament, 43.6% in Denmark, 45% in Norway and 45.6% in Sweden. Nonetheless, Leo, the 81-year-old farmer from former East Germany, is optimistic that eventually women all over the country will have the same opportunities. 'I can’t imagine that there are any women who don’t like to be independent,' she said.	https://www.voanews.com/a/berlin-wall-once-shaped-german-women-s-lives-echoes-remain-today/7858022.html	2024-11-09T04:22:45-08:00	
Germany marks 1989 Berlin Wall fall with 'Preserve Freedom' party	BERLIN — Germany marks 35 years since the Berlin Wall fell with festivities beginning Saturday under the theme 'Preserve Freedom!' as Russia's war rages in Ukraine and many fear democracy is under attack. Chancellor Olaf Scholz — whose governing coalition dramatically collapsed this week — said in a message to the nation that the liberal ideals of 1989 'are not something we can take for granted.' 'A look at our history and at the world around us shows this,' said Scholz, whose three-party ruling alliance imploded on the day Donald Trump was elected president in the United States, plunging Germany into political turmoil and toward new elections. November 9, 1989, is celebrated as the day East Germany's dictatorship opened the borders to the West after months of peaceful mass protests, paving the way for German reunification and the collapse of Soviet communism. One Berliner who remembers those momentous events, retiree Jutta Krueger, 75, said about the political crisis hitting just ahead of the anniversary weekend: 'It's a shame that it's coinciding like this now.' 'But we should still really celebrate the fall of the Wall,' she said, hailing it as the moment East Germans could travel and 'freedom had arrived throughout Germany.' President Frank-Walter Steinmeier will kick off events on Saturday at the Berlin Wall Memorial, honoring the at least 140 people killed trying to flee the Moscow-backed German Democratic Republic during the Cold War. In the evening, a 'freedom party' with a music and light show will be held at Berlin's iconic Brandenburg Gate, on the former path of the concrete barrier that had cut the city in two beginning in 1961. On Sunday, the Russian protest punk band Pussy Riot will perform in front of the former headquarters of the Stasi, former East Germany's feared secret police. Pro-democracy activists from around the world have been invited for the commemorations — among them Belarusian opposition leader Svetlana Tikhanovskaya and Iranian dissident Masih Alinejad. Talks, performances and a large-scale open-air art exhibition will also mark what Culture Minister Claudia Roth called 'one of the most joyous moments in world history.' Replica placards from the 1989 protests will be on display along 4 kilometers of the wall's route, past the historic Reichstag building and the famous Checkpoint Charlie. Among the art installations will be thousands of images created by citizens on the theme of 'freedom,' to drive home the enduring relevance of the historical event. Populism and division Berlin's top cultural affairs official Joe Chialo said the theme was crucial 'at a time when we are confronted by rising populism, disinformation and social division.' Axel Klausmeier, head of the Berlin Wall foundation, said the values of the 1989 protests 'are the power-bank for the defense of our democracy, which today is being gnawed at from the left and the right.' Most East Germans are grateful the East German regime ended, but many also have unhappy memories of the perceived arrogance of West Germans, and resentment lingers about a remaining gap in incomes and pensions. These sentiments have been cited to explain the strong support for the far-right Alternative for Germany, or AfD, in eastern Germany, as well as for the Russia-friendly and anti-capitalist BSW. Strong gains for both at three state elections in the east in September highlighted the enduring political divisions between eastern and western Germany over three decades since reunification. While the troubled government led by Scholz's Social Democrats and the opposition CDU strongly supports Ukraine's defense against Russia, the antiestablishment AfD and BSW oppose it. The AfD, which rails against immigration, was embarrassed this week when several of its members were arrested as suspected members of a racist paramilitary group that had practiced urban warfare drills. On the eve of the anniversary of the Berlin Wall's fall, government spokesperson Christiane Hoffmann recalled that the weekend will also mark another, far darker chapter in German history. During the Nazis' Kristallnacht or Night of Broken Glass pogrom of November 9-10, 1938, at least 90 Jews were murdered, countless properties destroyed, and 1,400 synagogues torched in Germany and Austria. Hoffmann said, 'It is very important for our society to remember the victims ... and learn the correct lessons from those events for our conduct today.'	https://www.voanews.com/a/germany-marks-1989-berlin-wall-fall-with-preserve-freedom-party/7858018.html	2024-11-09T03:53:20-08:00	
Bolivia's Morales barred from running for political office	LA PAZ, BOLIVIA — A constitutional court in Bolivia has barred former President Evo Morales from running again for office, ushering in a new phase in the country's long-running political crisis. Morales, who led Bolivia from 2006 to 2019, had been vying for the candidacy of his MAS party, alongside his former mentee-turned-rival, President Luis Arce. But, in a decision last week that was reported on Friday, Bolivia's constitutional court ruled that presidents were limited to serving two terms, whether consecutive or nonconsecutive. After his first two terms, a court ruling allowed Morales to serve a third term because his first preceded a constitutional rewrite. He ran for a fourth term in the 2019 elections but fled the country after the results were disputed and unrest ensued. Arce was elected in 2020. 'Without a doubt, this ushers in a new era of politics in Bolivia,' opposition lawmaker Marcelo Pedrazas told journalists Friday. 'In 2025, we'll have an election without Evo Morales on the ballot.' Morales' lawyer, Orlando Ceballos, called the court's ruling politically motivated. 'What are they trying to do? To get rid of MAS, to disqualify Evo, that's the point,' Ceballos said in a radio interview, adding that they would take up the matter with the Inter-American Commission on Human Rights. Morales and Arce have increasingly butted heads in past weeks, with Morales supporters using roadblocks to halt commerce and raiding military bases. Morales has called for peaceful talks with the government but went on a nearly weeklong hunger strike in protest of what he considers political persecution by Arce's administration. On Friday, lawmakers loyal to Morales caused chaos in Congress, shouting and throwing flowers at the vice president ahead of Arce's planned yearly address and forcing him to deliver his speech from the presidential palace.	https://www.voanews.com/a/bolivia-s-morales-barred-from-running-for-political-office/7858017.html	2024-11-09T03:31:12-08:00	
North Korea jams GPS signals, affecting ships, aircraft in South	SEOUL, SOUTH KOREA — North Korea staged GPS jamming attacks on Friday and Saturday, an operation that was affecting several ships and dozens of civilian aircraft in South Korea, Seoul's military said. The jamming allegations come about a week after the North test-fired what it said was its most advanced and powerful solid-fuel ICBM missile, its first such launch since being accused of sending soldiers to help Russia fight Ukraine. The South fired its own ballistic missile into the sea on Friday in a show of force aimed at demonstrating its resolve to respond to 'any North Korean provocations.' 'North Korea conducted GPS jamming provocations in Haeju and Kaesong yesterday and today,' Seoul's joint chiefs of staff said in a statement Saturday, adding that several vessels and dozens of civilian aircraft were experiencing 'some operational disruptions.' The military warned ships and aircraft operating in the Yellow Sea to beware of such attacks. 'We strongly urge North Korea to immediately cease its GPS provocations and warn that it will be held responsible for any subsequent issues arising from this,' they said in the statement. Relations between the two Koreas are at one of their lowest points in years, with the North launching a flurry of ballistic missiles in violation of UN sanctions. It also has been bombarding the South with trash-carrying balloons since May, in what it says is retaliation for anti-Pyongyang propaganda missives sent North by activists. The South Korean military said Pyongyang also attempted to jam GPS signals in May, but added at the time that it did not hinder any military operations in the South. In Friday's drill, South Korea fired a Hyunmoo surface-to-surface short-range missile into the West Sea, which the military said was to show Seoul's 'strong resolve to firmly respond' to any North Korean threats. The Hyunmoo missiles are key to the country's so-called 'Kill Chain' preemptive strike system, which allows Seoul to launch an attack if there are signs of an imminent North Korean attack. 'Real risk' Experts say such jamming attacks can lead to other incidents that could escalate tensions on the Korean peninsula. 'It remains unclear whether there is an intention to divert the world's attention from troop deployments, instill psychological insecurity among residents in the South, or respond to Friday's drills,' said Yang Moo-jin, president of the University of North Korean Studies in Seoul. 'However, GPS jamming attacks pose a real risk of serious incidents, including potential aircraft accidents in the worst-case scenario,' he told AFP. Ahn Chan-il, a defector-turned-researcher who runs the World Institute for North Korea Studies, told AFP the North's jamming could be 'to shield their own communications and intelligence exchanges during critical military operations' at home and abroad. Russia and Ukraine North Korea has become one of the most vocal and important backers of Russia's offensive in Ukraine. Seoul and the West have long accused Pyongyang of supplying artillery shells and missiles to Moscow for use in Ukraine. The latest accusations, based on intelligence reports, indicate the North has deployed around 10,000 troops to Russia, suggesting even deeper involvement in the conflict and triggering outcry in Seoul, Kyiv and Western capitals. Seoul, a security ally of Washington, said last month the presence of North Korean troops in Europe would be a major escalation. South Korea, a major arms exporter, has a long-standing policy of not providing weapons to countries in conflict. But President Yoon Suk Yeol said this week that Seoul is now not ruling out the possibility of providing weapons directly to Ukraine, given Pyongyang's military support of Moscow. On Friday, Seoul's presidential office said cyberattacks by pro-Russian hacking groups against South Korea have increased following North Korea's troop dispatch for Russia's war in Ukraine.	https://www.voanews.com/a/north-korea-jams-gps-signals-affecting-ships-aircraft-in-south/7858015.html	2024-11-09T03:18:52-08:00	
After Amsterdam violence, Israelis worry about sports teams’ safety abroad	The violence against fans of Maccabi Tel Aviv in Amsterdam has some Israelis worried that it isn't safe for their sports teams and fans to travel to games abroad. Many Palestinians want them banned entirely over Israel's conduct of the war with Hamas. Dutch authorities say Israeli fans were assaulted after a football game in Amsterdam by hordes of young people apparently riled up by calls on social media to target Jewish people. Five people were treated at hospitals and dozens were arrested after the Thursday night attacks, which were condemned as antisemitic by authorities in Amsterdam, Israel and across Europe. Israel's football teams play domestic games at home despite the Israel-Hamas war. But European football body UEFA has ruled that the war with Hamas means Israel cannot host international games. Supporters of the Palestinian campaign to ban Israel from international competition have criticized world football body FIFA for not matching its 2022 decision to suspend Russian national teams from competitions days after the invasion of Ukraine. UEFA also removed Russian teams. Sports and war Israeli teams have been playing their home games in Hungary, Serbia and Cyprus. Hungary Prime Minister Viktor Orbán has close ties with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and has long promoted Hungary as the safest European country for Jews. He has banned Palestinian solidarity protests, arguing they are a safety threat. Israel's national team has been playing all of its home matches in the men's Nations League this season in Bozsik Arena in Budapest. Maccabi Tel Aviv — the only Israeli men's team to qualify for European club football competitions this season — has been playing its home games in Szombathely, Hungary, and Belgrade, Serbia. A question about away games, too Belgium declined to stage a men's Nations League game against Israel in September. That game was played in Hungary instead, with no fans in the stadium. Other away games have been carried out without incident but the violence in Amsterdam could change things, and not just for soccer. Israel's National Security Council urged Israelis not to attend a match Friday with Maccabi's basketball team in Bologna, Italy, to avoid 'externalizing Israeli/Jewish identification marks as much as possible.' Italian police said security was increased for the game, both for fans and for the Maccabi team. Even before the Amsterdam attacks, UEFA announced that the Maccabi football team's next away match in the Europa League, which was scheduled to take place in Istanbul on November 28 against Besiktas, would be moved to a neutral venue 'following a decision by the Turkish authorities.' The Israeli national team's next away game in men's football is in the Nations League on Thursday, against France at the Stade de France outside Paris. French Interior Minister Bruno Retailleau said Friday that the game would go ahead after police assured him they could keep fans safe. Assaf Nachum, a spokesperson for Israel's Beitar football club, said Israeli football fans will 'need to see a lot of actions of security and police around where we are going to stay' in Paris. 'I imagine it will be harder to convince Israeli fans to come, especially because this happened in Amsterdam,' he said. Threats, jeers and protests when Israelis compete Israeli athletes competed in the Paris Olympics under heavy security. There were no major security incidents, but some Israeli athletes said they received threats. The Israeli team was met by jeers in stadiums during the country's national anthem, and athletes arrived under heavy police escort, including riot police vans. Anti-Israel protests have occurred at sports events around Europe this year, including at Maccabi football’s away games against the teams Steaua Bucharest of Romania and Braga of Portugal. Both teams were fined 10,000 euros ($10,800) each on charges of behavior unfit for sports after fans waved Palestinian flags. In September, a group of about 50 Italy fans in black turned their backs in apparent protest during Israel's national anthem before a Nations League match in Budapest. In May, a women's European Championship qualifier between Scotland and Israel in Glasgow was delayed after a pro-Palestinian protester chained himself to the goalpost. The protester made it onto the field even though the game was being played without spectators over concerns about disruptive protests over Israel's offensive in Gaza. Palestinians want to ban Israel from international football Israel's neighbors in the Middle East play in Asian competitions. Israel did too until the 1970s, when it was expelled from the Asian Football Confederation after several Arab and Muslim nations refused to play against it. Israel was invited to European qualifying for the 1982 World Cup and has been a member of UEFA since 1994. The Palestinian football federation has sent multiple requests to FIFA for Israel to be suspended from international soccer competitions. In its motion, the federation noted 'international law violations committed by the Israeli occupation in Palestine, particularly in Gaza' and cited FIFA statutory commitments on human rights and against discrimination. It also said its football infrastructure — including its signature Al-Yarmuk stadium — has been destroyed or damaged. FIFA stopped short of suspending Israel in October but asked for a disciplinary investigation of possible discrimination by Israeli officials. The Palestinian football federation also has consistently asked FIFA for more than a decade to take action against the Israeli football body for incorporating teams from West Bank settlements in its leagues. Could Israel be banned like Russia? Russia is a pariah in European football. Its teams were banned by FIFA ahead of the 2022 World Cup qualifying playoffs because of chaos that could ensue if opponents refused to play Russia. FIFA said the consequences for the World Cup 'would be irreparable and chaotic' had Russia advanced to the tournament in Qatar. No European federation has refused to play the national or clubs teams of Israel, which has been a member of UEFA for 30 years. Israel's men's team will be in the draw for European qualifying groups for the 2026 World Cup, which is made on December 13 in Zurich. The next World Cup is co-hosted by the United States, Canada and Mexico. Ukraine's national and club teams have not played international games on its own territory since the Russian military invasion in February 2022.	https://www.voanews.com/a/after-amsterdam-violence-israelis-worry-about-sports-teams-safety-abroad/7857917.html	2024-11-09T01:48:36-08:00	
India's ban on Rushdie’s 'Satanic Verses' may end — thanks to missing paperwork	NEW DELHI — The decadeslong ban of Salman Rushdie's The Satanic Verses in his native India is now in doubt — not because of a change of heart more than two years after the author's near-fatal stabbing, but because of what amounts to some missing paperwork. Earlier this week, a court in New Delhi closed proceedings on a petition filed five years ago that challenged the then-government's decision to ban the import of the novel, which enraged Muslims worldwide because of its alleged blasphemy, just days after its 1988 publication. In a ruling issued Tuesday, according to the Press Trust of India news agency, a bench headed by Justice Rekha Palli said authorities had failed to produce the notification of the ban. 'We have no other option except to presume that no such notification exists,' the judges concluded. The petitioner, Sandipan Khan, had argued that he couldn't buy the book because of a notification issued by the Central Board of Indirect Taxes and Customs on October 5, 1988, which forbade its import into India, adding that he was unable to locate the notification on any official website or through officials. Khan's lawyer, Uddyam Mukherjee, said that the court's ruling meant that as of now, nothing prohibits anybody from importing the novel into India. 'But whether this means it will be sold in bookstores — I don't know, that depends on the publishers or sellers,' he told The Associated Press. When reached by phone, several bookstores in the country's capital were unaware of the news. An employee of Jain Book Agency in New Delhi said that they did not know whether this news meant that the novel would be available again in stores in India, adding that if that was the case, it could still take time and that they would need to hear from the publisher. 'What the ruling does is open up a potential path for the book to become available here,' Mukherjee said, but added that any aggrieved individual, group or the government can also appeal against it. Rushdie's literary agent, Andrew Wylie, declined comment to the AP. Rushdie, now a citizen of the United Kingdom and the United States, has yet to comment publicly. He has more than 1 million followers on his X account, on which he last posted in September. Rushdie's publisher in India, Penguin Random House India, issued a statement Friday called the ruling a 'significant new development' and adding that it was 'thinking through next steps.' This week's ruling adds a new twist to Rushdie's complex relationship with India, where he was born in 1947, just before the country's independence. He left as a child and was living in the United Kingdom at the time of his breakout novel, Midnight's Children, which came out in 1981 and infuriated India's prime minister at the time, Indira Gandhi, who was satirized in the book. After she sued over a reference to her having caused her husband's death, Rushdie agreed to remove it, and the case was settled. When India banned The Satanic Verses, Rushdie condemned the action and doubted whether his censors had even read the novel. In an open letter to then-Prime Minister Rajiv Gandhi, published in The New York Times in 1988, he alleged the book was 'being used as a political football' and called the ban not only 'anti-democratic, but opportunistic.' Over the years, Rushdie has made private trips to India and attended the Jaipur Literary Festival in 2007. But five years later, he canceled plans to attend the Jaipur gathering because of security concerns. The festival did not immediately respond to a request for comment on the ruling. Besides the ban in his native country, The Satanic Verses elicited a fatwa calling for Rushdie's death from Iran's Ayotollah Ruhollah Khomeini, forcing the author into hiding in 1989. He gradually resumed a normal life, especially after Iranian officials announced in 1998 that the government had no plans to enforce it. But his relative calm abruptly ended in 2022, when he was stabbed repeatedly onstage by a young assailant during a literary festival in western New York. Rushdie survived the attack, which left him blind in one eye, and wrote about it in the memoir Knife, a finalist this year for the National Book Award. On Friday, Khan's lawyer said that his client was an avid book reader driven to find answers after he found out the novel was banned. He filed numerous requests for information with various authorities — and tried for over a year to get a hold of the notification. Mukherjee said Khan was told by authorities that it was not traceable. 'When we realized there was no hope, we proceeded to go to court and challenge the notification,' Mukherjee added. The court also said that Khan has the right under law to procure this book. So how does he plan to get it now? 'He doesn't have a clear answer to this yet — if it becomes available in India, he will buy a copy of it,' Mukherjee said. 'But he can also potentially buy it from international booksellers online, as it's no longer illegal to import the book into the country.'	https://www.voanews.com/a/india-s-ban-on-rushdie-s-satanic-verses-may-end-thanks-to-missing-paperwork-/7857915.html	2024-11-09T01:47:56-08:00	
Berlin Wall, divide that once shaped German women's lives, echoes today	berlin — Like many other young women living in communist East Germany, Solveig Leo thought nothing about juggling work and motherhood. The mother of two was able to preside over a large state-owned farm in the northeastern village of Banzkow because childcare was widely available. Contrast that with Claudia Huth, a mother of five, who grew up in capitalist West Germany. Huth quit her job as a bank clerk when she was pregnant with her first child and led a life as a traditional housewife in the village of Egelsbach in Hesse, raising the kids and tending to her husband, who worked as a chemist. Both Leo and Huth fulfilled roles that in many ways were typical for women in the vastly different political systems that governed Germany during its decades of division following the country's defeat in World War II in 1945. As Germany celebrates the 35th anniversary of the fall of the Berlin Wall on Nov. 9, 1989 — and the country's reunification less than a year later on Oct. 3, 1990 — many in Germany are reflecting on how women's lives that have diverged so starkly under communism and capitalism have become much more similar again — though some differences remain even today. 'In West Germany, women — not all, but many — had to fight for their right to have a career,' said Clara Marz, the curator of an exhibition about women in divided Germany for the Federal Foundation for the Study of the Communist Dictatorship in Germany. Women in East Germany, meanwhile, often had jobs — though that was something that 'they had been ordered from above to do,' she added. Front line of Cold War Built in 1961, the Wall stood for 28 years at the front line of the Cold War between the Americans and the Soviets. It was built by the communist regime to cut off East Germans from the supposed ideological contamination of the West and to stem the tide of people fleeing East Germany. Today only a few stretches of the 156.4-kilometer (97.2-mile) barrier around the capitalist exclave of West Berlin remain, mostly as a tourist attraction. 'All the heavy industry was in the west, there was nothing here,' Leo, who is now 81 years old, said during a recent interview looking back at her life as a woman under communism. 'East Germany had to pay war reparations to the Soviet Union. Women needed to work our own way out of that misery.' By contrast, Leo said, women in the West didn't need to work because they were 'spoiled by the Marshall Plan' — the United States' generous reconstruction plan that poured billions of dollars into West Germany and other European countries after the war. In capitalist West Germany, the economy recovered so quickly after the total devastation of WWII that people soon started talking of a Wirtschaftswunder, or 'economic miracle,' that brought them affluence and stability less than 10 years after the war. That economic success, however, indirectly hampered women's quest for equal rights. Most West German women stayed at home and were expected to take care of their household while their husbands worked. Religion, too, played a much bigger role than in atheist East Germany, confining women to traditional roles as caregivers of the family. Mothers who tried to break out of these conventions and took on jobs were infamously decried as Rabenmütter, or uncaring moms who put work over family. Not all West German women perceived their traditional roles as restrictive. 'I always had this idea to be with my children, because I loved being with them,' said Huth, now 69. 'It never really occurred to me to go to work.' A new generation More than three decades after Germany's unification, a new generation of women is barely aware of the different lives their mothers and grandmothers led depending on which part of the country they lived in. For most, combining work and motherhood also has become the normal way of life. Hannah Fiedler, an 18-year-old high school graduate from Berlin, said the fact that her family lived in East Germany during the decades of the country's division has no impact on her life today. 'East or West — it's not even a topic in our family anymore,' she said, as she sat on a bench near a thin, cobble-stoned path in the capital's Mitte neighborhood, which marks the former course of the Berlin Wall in the then-divided city. She also said that growing up, she had not experienced any disadvantages because she's female. 'I'm white and privileged — for good or worse — I don't expect any problems when I enter the working world in the future,' she said. Some small differences between the formerly divided parts of Germany linger. In the former East, 74% of women are working, compared to 71.5% in the West, according to a 2023 study by the Hans-Böckler-Stiftung foundation. Childcare is also still more available in the former East than in the West. In 2018, 57% of children under the age of 3 were looked after in a childcare facility in the eastern state of Saxony. That compares with 27% in the western state of North Rhine-Westphalia and 44% in Hamburg and Bremen, according to Germany's Federal Statistical Office. Germany as a whole trails behind some other European countries when it comes to gender equality. Only 31.4% lawmakers in Germany's national parliament are female, compared to 41% in Belgium's parliament, 43.6% in Denmark, 45% in Norway and 45.6% in Sweden. Nonetheless, Leo, the 81-year-old farmer from former East Germany, is optimistic that eventually women all over the country will have the same opportunities. 'I can't imagine that there are any women who don't like to be independent,' she said.	https://www.voanews.com/a/7857886.html	2024-11-09T01:47:22-08:00	
As data center industry booms, English village becomes battleground	ABBOTS LANGLEY, England — Originally built to store crops from peasant farmers, the Tithe Barn on the edge of the English village of Abbots Langley was converted into homes that preserve its centuries of history. Now, its residents are fighting to stop a development next door that represents the future. A proposal to build a data center on a field across the road was rejected by local authorities amid fierce opposition from villagers. But it's getting a second chance from British Prime Minister Keir Starmer's government, which is pursuing reforms to boost economic growth following his Labour party's election victory in July. Residents of Abbots Langley, 30 kilometers northwest of London, worry the facility will strain local resources and create noise and traffic that damages the character of the quiet village, which is home to more than 20,000 people. Off the main street there's a church with a stone tower built in the 12th century and, further down the road, a picturesque circular courtyard of rustic thatched-roof cottages that used to be a farm modeled on one built for French Queen Marie Antoinette. 'It's just hideously inappropriate,' said Stewart Lewis, 70, who lives in one of the converted houses in the 600-year-old Tithe Barn. 'I think any reasonable person anywhere would say, 'Hang on, they want a data center? This isn't the place for it.'' As the artificial intelligence boom fuels demand for cloud-based computing from server farms around the world, such projects are pitting business considerations, national priorities and local interests against each other. Britain's Deputy Prime Minister Angela Rayner has stepped in to review the appeals filed by developers of three data center projects after they were rejected by local authorities, taking the decision out of the hands of town planners. Those proposals include Abbots Langley and two projects in Buckinghamshire, which sits west of London. The first decision is expected by January. The projects are controversial because the data centers would be built on 'greenbelt' land, which has been set aside to prevent urbanization. Rayner wants to tap the greenbelt for development, saying much of it is low quality. One proposed Buckinghamshire project, for example, involves redeveloping an industrial park next to a busy highway. 'Whilst it's officially greenbelt designated land, there isn't anything 'green' about the site today,' said Stephen Beard, global head of data centers at Knight Frank, a property consultancy that's working on the project. 'It's actually an eyesore which is very prominent from the M25' highway, he said. Greystoke, the company behind the Abbots Langley center and a second Buckinghamshire project to be built on a former landfill, didn't respond to requests for comment. In an online video for Abbots Langley, a company representative says, 'We have carried out a comprehensive search for sites, and this one is the very best.' It doesn't specify which companies would possibly use the center. The British government is making data centers a core element of its economic growth plans, deeming them 'critical national infrastructure' to give businesses confidence to invest in them. Starmer has announced deals for new centers, including a 10 billion pound ($13 billion) investment from private equity firm Blackstone to build what will be Europe's biggest AI data center in northeast England. The land for the Abbots Langley data center is currently used to graze horses. It's bordered on two other sides by a cluster of affordable housing and a highway. Greystoke's plans to construct two large buildings totaling 84,000 square meters and standing up to 20 meters tall have alarmed Lewis and other villagers, who worry that it will dwarf everything else nearby. They also doubt Greystoke's promise that it will create up to 260 jobs. 'Everything will be automated, so they wouldn't need people,' said tech consultant Jennifer Stirrup, 51, who lives in the area. Not everyone in the village is opposed. Retiree Bryan Power says he would welcome the data center, believing it would benefit the area in a similar way as another big project on the other side of the village, the Warner Bros.' Studio Tour featuring a Harry Potter exhibition. 'It'll bring some jobs, whatever. It'll be good. Yeah. No problem. Because if it doesn't come, it'll go somewhere else,' said Power, 56. One of the biggest concerns about data centers is their environmental impact, especially the huge amounts of electricity they need. Greystoke says the facility will draw 96 megawatts of 'IT load.' But James Felstead, director of a renewable energy company and Lewis' neighbor, said the area's power grid wouldn't be able to handle so much extra demand. It's a problem reflected across Europe, where data center power demand is expected to triple by the end of the decade, according to consulting firm McKinsey. While the AI-fueled data boom has prompted Google, Amazon and Microsoft to look to nuclear power as a source of clean energy, worries about their ecological footprint have already sparked tensions over data centers elsewhere. Google was forced to halt plans in September for a $200 million data center in Chile's capital, Santiago, after community complaints about its potential water and energy usage. In Ireland, where many Silicon Valley companies have European headquarters, the grid operator has temporarily halted new data centers around Dublin until 2028 over worries they're guzzling too much electricity. A massive data center project in northern Virginia narrowly won county approval last year, amid heavy opposition from residents concerned about its environmental impact. Other places like Frankfurt, Amsterdam and Singapore have imposed various restrictions on data centers. Public knowledge about the industry is still low but 'people are realizing more that these data centers are quite problematic,' said Sebastian Lehuede, a lecturer in ethics, AI and society at King's College London who studied the Google case in Chile. As awareness grows about their environmental impact, Lehuede said, 'I'm sure we will have more opposition from different communities.'	https://www.voanews.com/a/as-data-center-industry-booms-english-village-becomes-battleground/7856298.html	2024-11-09T01:46:47-08:00	
Japan plans automated cargo transport system to relieve shortage of drivers and cut emissions	TOKYO — Japan is planning to build an automated cargo transport corridor between Tokyo and Osaka, dubbed a 'conveyor belt road' by the government, to make up for a shortage of truck drivers. The amount of funding for the project is not yet set. But it's seen as one key way to help the country cope with soaring deliveries. A computer graphics video made by the government shows big, wheeled boxes moving along a three-lane corridor, also called an 'auto flow road,' in the middle of a big highway. A trial system is due to start test runs in 2027 or early 2028, aiming for full operations by the mid-2030s. 'We need to be innovative with the way we approach roads,' said Yuri Endo, a senior deputy director overseeing the effort at the Ministry of Land, Infrastructure, Transport and Tourism. Apart from making up for a shrinking labor force and the need to reduce workloads for drivers, the system also will help cut carbon emissions, she said. 'The key concept of the auto flow-road is to create dedicated spaces within the road network for logistics, utilizing a 24-hour automated and unmanned transportation system,' Endo said. The plan may sound like a solution that would only work in relatively low-crime, densely populated societies like Japan, not sprawling nations like the U.S. But similar ideas are being considered in Switzerland and Great Britain. The plan in Switzerland involves an underground pathway, while the one being planned in London will be a fully automated system running on low-cost linear motors. In Japan, loading will be automated, using forklifts, and coordinated with airports, railways and ports. The boxes measure 180 centimeters in height and are 110 centimeters by 110 centimeters in width and length, about the size of a big closet. The system, which is also intended for business deliveries, may be expanded to other routes if all goes well. Human drivers may still have to do last-mile deliveries to people's doors, although driverless technology may be used in the future. Japan's shortage of truck drivers is worsening due to laws that took effect earlier this year that limit the amount of overtime drivers can log. That's seen as necessary to avoid overwork and accidents and to make the jobs tolerable, but in Japanese logistics, government and transportation circles, it's known as the '2024 problem.' Under current conditions, Japan's overall transport capacity will plunge by 34% by 2030, according to government estimates. The domestic transport capacity stands at about 4.3 billion metric tons, almost all, or more than 91%, by trucks, according to the Japan Trucking Association. That's a fraction of what's moving in a massive country like the U.S. About 5.2 trillion ton-miles of freight are transported in the United States each year, and that's projected to reach more than 8 trillion ton-miles of freight by 2050. A ton-mile measures the amount of freight shipped and how far it's moved, with the standard unit being one ton being moved one mile (1.6 kilometers). Demand for deliveries from online shopping surged during the pandemic, with users jumping from about 40% of Japanese households to more than 60%, according to government data, even as the overall population keeps declining as the birth rate falls. As is true in most places, truck drivers have tough jobs requiring them to be on the road for days at a time, work that most jobseekers find unappealing. In recent years, annual fatalities from delivery trucks crashing on roads have hovered at about 1,000 deaths. That's improved from nearly 2,000 deaths in 2010, but the Trucking Association, which groups some 400 trucking businesses and organizations in the nation, would like to make deliveries even safer. The association is also urging consumers to hold back on delivery orders or at least bundle their orders. Some industry experts are urging businesses to limit free delivery offers. Trucks carry about 90% of Japan's cargo, and about 60% of Japan's fresh produce, like fruits and vegetables, come from distant places requiring trucking, according to Yuji Yano, a professor at the Ryutsu Keizai University, which is funded? by deliveries giant Nippon Express Co., now called NX Holdings, and focuses on economics and liberal arts studies, including trucking problems. 'That means the 2024 problem isn't just a transportation problem but really a people's problem,' Yano said.	https://www.voanews.com/a/japan-plans-automated-cargo-transport-system-to-relieve-shortage-of-drivers-and-cut-emissions-/7856284.html	2024-11-09T01:46:15-08:00	
New Chinese stealth fighter to take center stage at China's biggest air show	SEOUL, south korea/BEIJING — China's new J-35A stealth fighter jet will be displayed for the first time next week at the country's biggest civil and military air show, a biennial event where Beijing showcases its expanding aerospace industry. The six-day China International Aviation & Aerospace Exhibition begins Tuesday in the southern Greater Bay city of Zhuhai. The 2022 edition of the event led to about $40 billion in 'cooperation agreements' being signed, according to its organizers. Developing domestic aerospace design and manufacturing capabilities is a major strategic priority for Beijing as it vies for regional military dominance with the U.S. amid escalating tensions around Taiwan and the South China Sea. China also seeks to reduce its reliance on foreign imports, a concern borne out after the election as the next U.S. president this week of Donald Trump, who has been vocal about increasing trade tariffs and decoupling supply chains from the world's second-largest economy. Alongside drones, weapons systems, aircraft and electronic warfare technologies, China's emerging role as a commercial airliner manufacturer through state-owned planemaker COMAC will be on display. Fighter jet As the expected highlight of the show, the People's Liberation Army Air Force (PLAAF) will reveal to the public the Shenyang Aircraft Corporation's J-35A, which the air force last week described as a 'medium-sized stealth multi-purpose fighter.' Russia has also flown its most advanced fighter jet, the SU-57, to Zhuhai for its first air show abroad, in an apparent message to the West about China-Russia cooperation. The J-35A, which uses airstrips to take off and land, is a variant of the J-35, a stealthy aircraft China is developing for use on aircraft carriers. Little is known about its performance or capabilities, although it superficially resembles the Lockheed Martin LMT.N F-35. The J-35 program is a follow-on from China's J-31 fighter, which made its public debut at the Zhuhai show in 2014 but was never used by the People's Liberation Army or sold to foreign customers. Diplomats and security analysts have closely watched the evolution of J-35 variants given the importance of the plane to China's aircraft carrier program, which seeks to expand jets' range and payload to project power beyond China's home waters. Monday marks the 75th anniversary of the PLAAF, which will have its largest presence at the air show, Xinhua news agency has reported. COMAC This year's Zhuhai air show is its first post-pandemic edition since Beijing lifted its zero-COVID policy and travel restrictions in 2023. Airbus AIR.PA and the world's third-largest planemaker, Embraer EMBR3.SA, will have a presence at the show, but Boeing BA.N will not be officially represented after new CEO Kelly Ortberg halted travel to industry events as the troubled U.S. manufacturer recovers from a damaging seven-week workers' strike that ended this week. Beijing has invested heavily in developing home-grown commercial planes, and engines that one day may replace the foreign versions that currently power COMAC's jets. COMAC-watchers will, in particular, be paying attention to a possible re-branding of the company's ARJ21 regional jet, after one was spotted by aviation enthusiasts in mid-October at a Chinese airport with C909 painted on its blue tail, instead of ARJ21. Although largely symbolic, the change -- which would align with the manufacturer's naming convention for its other models -- signals Beijing's growing intention to present itself as a full-scale alternative to Airbus and Boeing, which are both struggling to keep up with demand. Industry sources say COMAC is a long way off from making inroads internationally without benchmark certifications from the EU -- which COMAC is pursuing for its C919 airliner -- or the U.S. In particular, competing with Western engines poses one of the most daunting challenges for China's rising aerospace industry, even after a spate of industrial problems in the West. Even so, Chinese manufacturers will benefit from the sheer scale of their domestic market, analysts say. China is the world's second-largest domestic aviation market after the U.S. Boeing has said China will more than double its commercial airplane fleet and need 8,830 new planes by 2043.	https://www.voanews.com/a/new-chinese-stealth-fighter-to-take-center-stage-at-china-s-biggest-air-show/7856275.html	2024-11-09T01:45:24-08:00	
Why Mozambique's election has sparked weeks of protests, violent crackdown by police	CAPE TOWN, South Africa — Thousands protested in Mozambique's capital on Thursday and security forces responded by firing tear gas and rubber bullets, as weeks of post-election unrest continued in the southern African country. The protests were sparked by a vote last month that will keep the ruling party in power for more than a half-century amid allegations of rigging. Opposition parties and many citizens have rejected the results of the October 9 presidential election as fraudulent and growing protests in the capital, Maputo, and other cities have been met by deadly force from police. Thursday's protest was the biggest yet. International rights groups say at least 20 people have been killed by police since the unrest began nearly a month ago, while local groups say the death toll is more than 50. Authorities are threatening to deploy the army as protesters set fires on the streets and burn ruling party offices. The internet is being restricted and social media sites have been blocked, according to Human Rights Watch. Neighboring South Africa has shut its border post with Mozambique and heightened security around it. What happened in the election? The candidate for the ruling Front for the Liberation of Mozambique, Daniel Chapo, was declared the winner of the presidential election on October 24. That keeps the party that has governed Mozambique since independence from Portugal in 1975 in power for another five years. Even before the results were announced, opposition parties claimed fraud, accusing the ruling party, known as Frelimo, of ballot stuffing, manipulating voter lists and staffing polling stations with officials loyal to it. Frelimo has long been accused of rigging elections in the country of around 34 million. The European Union's observer team said there were irregularities in the election, including the altering of some results. Mozambican media has reported that the Constitutional Council, the supreme body for election law, has asked the commission that ran the election to explain discrepancies. Senior opposition figures killed Independent candidate Venancio Mondlane, who was second behind Chapo in the official results, has led criticism of the vote. He called for a national strike and for people to stay at home in the days after the election in protest at the alleged tampering. But the mood changed when two senior opposition figures were killed in their car in a late-night shooting by unidentified gunmen on October 18. The men who were killed were the lawyer for Mondlane and the official spokesperson for the political party that supported Mondlane in the election. Mondlane said they were assassinated and he and opposition supporters gathered near the site of the killings the day after to protest. Police fired tear gas canisters at Mondlane, his aides and journalists who were interviewing him, forcing them to flee. Growing protests Since then, there have been waves of protests across the country. In one city, protesters toppled and cut the head off a statue of current President Filipe Nyusi, who is stepping down after serving a maximum two terms. Mondlane said on social media that he had gone into exile in fear for his life after the killing of his lawyer. His whereabouts are unknown, but he has called on social media for more protests 'so that we can then be freed from these shackles that have held us up for 50 years.' Authorities have said little other than the protests have been violent and needed to be quelled. They have not given information on the number of people killed or injured in the protests. Rights groups accused the police of shooting at peaceful protests in the days after the election and said children were among the victims. Anger among opposition supporters has swelled. The presidential palace is under heavy guard. A history of civil war and violence Mozambique is still in the shadow of a bloody 15-year civil war the leftist Frelimo fought against rebel group Renamo after independence. The country only held its first elections in 1994 and this was the first vote where there were no armed groups connected to political parties after a process to disarm militias. The country, which has rich natural resources including large, newly discovered natural gas fields, was already struggling with a yearslong insurgency by an Islamic State-affiliated group in the northern province of Cabo Delgado. Mondlane, who broke away from Renamo, has support among Mozambique's disaffected youth and he and the new Podesa party that is backing him have become the biggest challenge to Frelimo's long rule.	https://www.voanews.com/a/why-mozambique-s-election-has-sparked-weeks-of-protests-violent-crackdown-by-police-/7856254.html	2024-11-09T01:44:51-08:00	
Church of Saint-Sulpice in Paris shines in light show	paris — As dusk falls over the City of Light, a new spectacle is illuminating Saint-Sulpice church, a monument whose interiors are even larger than Notre Dame's — and arguably just as breathtaking. The cavernous walls of the neoclassical gem on Paris' Left Bank are coming alive with 360-degree video projections, sparkling cutting-edge technology and actors, all telling the story of the church and its place in French history. Blending centuries of intrigue, revolution and family drama, the show reimagines the Saint-Germain district during the Fronde, the 17th-century civil war, and the lead-up to the French Revolution. 'Paris Cœur de Lumières' (Paris Chancel of Lights), which runs until November 23, transforms the church's sprawling 6,000-square-meter (65,000-square-foot) interior into a digital stage through advanced video mapping. 'From a technological standpoint, it's a laser scan of the entire building that allows us to reconstruct the space in three dimensions,' director Damien Fontaine explained. 'We then 'unfold' it like origami ... and put it back into 3D to be projected as a single unified image. We have over 45 projectors, each covering a part of the vaults, a section of a pillar, or a piece of the nave. It's ... a mosaic of images to form one large picture.' Projections transform stone carvings into animated storytellers, while immersive soundscapes, paired with an original score, wrap the audience in a sensory experience. The actors brought history to life. Over 350 performers and volunteers, clad in more than 500 historical costumes, move among the audience portraying local families and rivalries, threading personal narratives into the broader history. Many of those who volunteered themselves marveled at learning about little known aspects of French history. Anne Dubosc, a 65-year-old amateur actress, played Anne of Austria, mother of Sun King Louis XIV. 'She was a remarkable woman, very involved in politics and religion,' Dubosc said. 'I hadn't realized how important she was. If Louis XIV became the man he was, it was partly thanks to this woman, this mother who was like a tigress, doing everything to protect her son and teaching him to be a great statesman.' Performing in Saint-Sulpice, she added, was extraordinary: 'It's exceptional. You lose track of what's happening, of where fiction ends and history begins.' Her historic costume shaped her performance — literally. 'I have a corset that squeezes me so tightly,' she said. 'You realize there's a very 18th-century way of holding yourself, of carrying your shoulders and neck, which gives a natural majesty. The costume really impacts how you carry your body, and that posture influences your mind, giving character to this woman of state.' The production underscored a growing trend in Paris of using light technology to show off the city's storied church interiors. A similar illuminations display took place at Saint-Eustache church until September, featuring video projections, lighting effects and spatialized electronic soundtrack.	https://www.voanews.com/a/church-of-saint-sulpice-in-paris-shines-in-an-immersive-light-show-/7853238.html	2024-11-09T01:44:21-08:00	
Ruby slippers from 'Wizard of Oz' are for sale nearly 2 decades after they were stolen	DALLAS — A pair of ruby slippers worn by Judy Garland in 'The Wizard of Oz' is on the auction block nearly two decades after a thief stole the iconic shoes, convinced they were adorned with real jewels. Online bidding has started and will continue through December 7, Heritage Auctions in Dallas announced in a news release Monday. The auction company received the sequin-and-bead-bedazzled slippers from Michael Shaw, the memorabilia collector who originally owned the footwear at the heart of the beloved 1939 musical. Shaw had loaned the shoes in 2005 to the Judy Garland Museum in Grand Rapids, Minnesota. That summer, someone smashed through a display case and stole the slippers. Their whereabouts remained a mystery until the FBI recovered them in 2018. Now the museum is among those vying for the slippers, which were one of several pairs Garland wore during the filming. Only four remain. Grand Rapids raised money for the slippers at its annual Judy Garland festival. The funds will supplement the $100,000 set aside this year by Minnesota lawmakers to purchase the slippers. The man who stole the slippers, Terry Jon Martin, was 76 when he was sentenced in January to time served because of his poor health. He admitting to using a hammer to smash the glass of the museum's door and display case in what his attorney said was an attempt to pull off 'one last score' after an old associate with connections to the mob told him the shoes had to be adorned with real jewels to justify their $1 million insured value. The auction of movie memorabilia includes other items from 'The Wizard of Oz,' such as a hat worn by Margaret Hamilton's Wicked Witch of the West and the screen door from Dorothy's Kansas home.	https://www.voanews.com/a/ruby-slippers-from-the-wizard-of-oz-are-for-sale-nearly-2-decades-after-they-were-stolen/7853208.html	2024-11-09T01:43:36-08:00	
Russian drone attack on Ukraine's Odesa kills one, injures 13, governor says	kyiv, ukraine — Russian drones attacked Ukraine's Black Sea port of Odesa overnight, killing one person and injuring 13 others, including two boys, regional governor Oleh Kiper said on Saturday. Several residential apartment buildings, private houses, commercial buildings and dozens of private cars were damaged in what was the second day in a row of Russian drone attacks on the city, Kiper said. 'At night the enemy again attacked Odesa and the nearby region with attack drones. One person died and 13 were wounded. Among the injured there were two children,' he said on the Telegram messaging app. Prosecutors said the children were boys aged 4 and 16. Russia launched 51 drones, focusing its attack on Odesa and the nearby region in the south of Ukraine, the Ukrainian air force said, adding that Ukrainian air defense units and mobile drone hunter groups shot down 32 Russian drones. It also said that 18 drones were 'lost,' most likely meaning they had been thwarted electronically. Russian drones also triggered a large fire in one of Odesa's districts, public broadcaster Suspilne reported, quoting residents. Other media outlets in the city posted video footage showing cars and buildings ablaze and thick smoke billowing skyward. As the war against Russia nears its 1,000-day mark, Moscow's forces have intensified air attacks on Ukrainian cities and towns, sending swarms of drones almost every night. Ukraine's military said that Russia launched more than 2,000 attack drones at civilian and military targets in October. Moscow says it does not target civilians. The UN Human Rights Monitoring Mission in Ukraine had verified 11,743 civilian deaths in conflict-related violence from Russia's full-scale invasion in February 2022 to the end of August this year. The Ukrainian government says the toll is likely to be much higher due to difficulties accessing parts of the country.	https://www.voanews.com/a/russian-drone-attack-on-ukraine-s-odesa-kills-one-injures-13-governor-says/7857985.html	2024-11-09T01:41:29-08:00	
Gaza rescuers say 14 killed in Israeli strikes	Gaza Strip — Gaza's civil defense agency said Saturday that Israeli airstrikes killed at least 14 Palestinians overnight, including women and children, while the Israeli military said it had eliminated dozens of militants in the territory's north. An airstrike hit tents housing displaced Palestinians in the southern area of Khan Yunis, killing at least nine people, civil defense spokesperson Mahmud Bassal told AFP. The Palestinian Red Crescent also confirmed the toll, saying 11 others were wounded in the strike and were taken to Nasser Hospital. A second air strike killed five people and injured about 22 when 'Israeli warplanes hit Fahad Al-Sabah school,' which had been turned into a shelter for 'thousands of displaced people' in the Al-Tuffah district of Gaza City, Bassal said. The dead and injured were taken to Al-Ahli Arab Hospital, he added. In recent months, the military has struck several schools-turned-shelters where Israel has said Palestinian militants are operating. Meanwhile, the Israeli military said its troops killed 'dozens of terrorists' in the Jabalia area of northern Gaza, where it has been conducting a sweeping air and ground operation for more than a month to prevent Hamas from regrouping. Israeli forces also killed several militants in the area of Rafah in the territory's south, the military added. The military is currently engaged in a two-front war, with troops fighting Hezbollah in Lebanon and Hamas in Gaza. Both Hamas and Hezbollah have been designated as terror groups by the United States, the U.K. and other Western countries. 'Over the past day, the IAF (air force) struck over 50 terror targets in Lebanon and the Gaza Strip,' the military said in a statement. 'Among the targets struck were military structures, weapons storage facilities and launchers,' it added. Israel's war in Gaza broke out after Hamas militants attacked Israel on October 7, 2023. In that attack, Hamas militants killed 1,200 people and captured about 250 hostages, sparking the war in Gaza. Israel says it believes Hamas is still holding 101 hostages, including 35 the military says are dead. Israel’s counteroffensive in Gaza has killed more than 43,000 people, according to the territory's health ministry, which does not distinguish between combatants and civilians in its count.	https://www.voanews.com/a/gaza-rescuers-say-14-killed-in-israeli-strikes/7857976.html	2024-11-09T01:02:24-08:00	
Death toll rises to 20 in southwestern Pakistan rail station bombing	QUETTA, Pakistan — The death toll from a powerful bombing at a Quetta rail station in restive southwestern Pakistan on Saturday rose to at least 20, officials said. The attack also left more than 40 others wounded, some critically. The bomb exploded when nearly 100 passengers were waiting for a train to travel to the garrison city of Rawalpindi from Quetta, the capital of the restive Balochistan province, said Mohammad Baloch, a senior police officer. A separatist group, the Balochistan Liberation Army, claimed the attack in a statement, saying a suicide bomber targeted troops present at the railway station. The outlawed BLA has long waged an insurgency seeking independence from Islamabad. Shahid Rind, a government spokesperson said the bombing seemed to have been a suicide attack, but an investigation was still ongoing to confirm the BLA's claim. TV footage showed the steel structure of the platform's roof blown apart and a tea stall destroyed as luggage littered the place. Ayesha Faiz, a Quetta police official, said some of the critically wounded passengers died at a hospital, raising the deaths. Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif denounced the bombing in a statement, saying those who orchestrated the attack 'will pay a very heavy price for it,' adding that security forces were determined to eliminate 'the menace of terrorism.' The oil- and mineral-rich Balochistan is Pakistan's largest but also least populated province. It is also a hub for the country's ethnic Baloch minority whose members say they face discrimination and exploitation by the central government. Along with separatist groups, Islamic militants also operate in the province. BLA often targets security forces and foreigners, especially Chinese nationals who are in Pakistan as part of Beijing's multibillion-dollar Belt and Road Initiative, which is building major infrastructure projects. Last month, BLA claimed responsibility for a suicide bombing that targeted a convoy with Chinese nationals outside the Karachi airport, killing two. Since then, Beijing has asked Pakistan to ensure the safety of its citizens working on multiple projects in Balochistan and other parts of the country.	https://www.voanews.com/a/death-toll-rises-to-20-in-southwestern-pakistan-rail-station-bombing/7857955.html	2024-11-08T22:47:56-08:00	
EV industry watching Musk's role in tariff fixing	New Delhi — The electric vehicle industry is closely watching to see how Tesla boss Elon Musk, who played a key role in the victory of Republican President-elect Donald Trump, will use his influence with the incoming president to steer the industry's future. At stake are several issues including the new administration's approach to tariffs on Chinese EVs and tax credits. In anticipation of decisions favorable to Tesla, shares in the company rose 27% after the election result was announced, taking its market capitalization to $1 trillion. During the campaign, Trump said he would increase tariffs on Chinese goods and roll back tax credits available to EV buyers in the U.S. He also vowed to reduce or eliminate many vehicle emissions standards under the Environmental Protection Agency, which support the EV industry. Industry analysts are divided on whether high tariffs on Chinese EVs are advantageous or disadvantageous for Tesla's business. Some analysts have suggested that Musk could persuade the Trump administration to reduce the tariffs on Chinese EVs and might even temper the overall tariff regime against Chinese goods. However, Musk is likely to support the elimination of the $7,500 tax credit given to EV buyers in the United States. The absence of tax credits would make it difficult for legacy carmakers to introduce EV versions of their cars in competition with Tesla. 'As Elon Musk played a very important role in funding Trump's campaign, he will no doubt have the ear of the U.S. president and play a role that will help shape policies that are advantageous to Tesla and his other businesses,' Bill Russo, founder and CEO of Automobility Limited, a Shanghai-based strategic consulting and investment platform, told VOA. To be sure, Musk opposed U.S. tariffs on China-made EVs last May. 'Neither Tesla nor I asked for these tariffs. In fact, I was surprised when they were announced. Things that inhibit freedom of exchange or distort the market are not good,' Musk said after the Biden administration enhanced tariffs on Chinese EVs. The question is whether he will continue to oppose tariffs on Chinese EVs after Trump enters the White House. A section of analysts has predicted that Musk would continue this line of argument because China accounts for one-third of Tesla sales. 'Tesla is in China because Elon Musk needs the scale and efficient cost structure of the Chinese supply chain to make the company more competitive around the world,' Russo said. China makes over 70% of the EV batteries in the world and almost two-thirds of all EVs and related components. 'Tariffs make accessing this supply chain more costly, and that does not help Tesla,' he said. Between January and May this year, Tesla sold almost as many cars in China as it did in the United States. Chinese consumers bought one-third of Tesla cars of all models totaling 513,644. In the same period, the company sold 522,444 vehicles in the U.S. Wedbush Securities analyst Dan Ives argued that higher tariffs would help Tesla compete better with Chinese EVs in the U.S. market. 'Tesla has the scale and scope that is unmatched in the EV industry and this dynamic could give Musk and Tesla a clear competitive advantage in a non-EV subsidy environment, coupled by likely higher China tariffs that would continue to push away cheaper Chinese EV players (BYD, Nio etc.) from flooding the U.S. market over the coming years,' Ives said in a note to clients this week. Taking a different view, Beatrix C. Keim, director of Germany-based Centre Automotive Research, said the next president is unlikely to listen to arguments for reducing tariffs on Chinese EVs. 'There is a 100% tariff for Chinese EVs in place. I don't think that Trump will weaken this,' she said. The high tariff does not affect Tesla because it does not export cars from its Shanghai plant for the U.S. market, and builds them in the U.S. Keim said Musk will do whatever serves Tesla's business in China. 'Chinese people are very likely to react emotionally if he is perceived as acting against China's interest,' she said. 'Chinese customers had once blocked the sales of Tesla cars, and this can happen again.' Musk said last April that he loved the Chinese people. 'I'm a big fan of China. I also have a lot of fans in China. Well, the feelings are reciprocated,' Musk, who has often been described in Chinese social media as a 'friend of China,' said in April. Tesla is set to introduce a new fully self-driving (FSD - Supervised) car in the coming months, though the vehicle's safety remains under review. Musk must have sufficient influence in both Washington and Beijing to obtain the regulatory approvals necessary to sell it. 'China is likely to approve FSD as it would like to show goodwill toward foreign technology,' Russo said. However, Tesla's FSD may have a limited market in China where local manufacturers play a much bigger role. Keim said Tesla's FSD might not face regulatory challenges in Europe, but it may be difficult for it to find enough customers in the face of local competition. One of the questions that is often asked is whether China would retaliate by imposing higher tariffs on American goods, including Tesla. 'This is very unlikely, as Tesla has invested in China and is used as an example of how foreign brands are still welcome in China, and Tesla is held up as a benchmark for Chinese companies to measure against,' Russo said. 'Killing competition is not viewed as healthy for the forward development of the Chinese automakers. This is in stark contrast to the way the U.S. has acted so far.'	https://www.voanews.com/a/ev-industry-watching-musk-s-role-in-tariff-fixing/7857946.html	2024-11-08T21:59:30-08:00	
Indonesia's Mount Lewotobi Laki Laki unleashes towering columns of hot clouds	MAUMERE, Indonesia — Indonesia's Mount Lewotobi Laki Laki volcano spewed towering columns of hot ash high into the air Saturday, days after a huge eruption killed nine people and injured dozens of others. Activity at the volcano on the remote island of Flores, in East Nusa Tenggara province, has increased since Monday's initial eruption. On Thursday, authorities expanded the danger zone as the volcano erupted again. Friday's activity saw the largest column of ash so far recorded at 10 kilometers high, Hadi Wijaya, the head of the Center for Volcanology and Geological Disaster Mitigation, told a news conference. Wijaya said volcanic materials, including smoldering rocks, lava, and hot, thumb-size fragments of gravel and ash, were thrown up to 8 kilometers from the crater on Friday. There were no casualties reported from the latest eruption as the 1,584-meter volcano shot billowing columns of ash at least three times Saturday, rising up to 9 kilometers, the volcano monitoring agency said. Authorities increased Lewotobi Laki Laki's alert status to the highest level since Monday, and expanded the danger zone on Thursday to a radius of 8 kilometers on the northwest and southwest sides of the mountain slope. 'We are still evaluating how far the (danger zone) radius should be expanded,' Wijaya said. Hot clouds of ash 'are currently spreading in all directions.' The volcanic activity has damaged schools and thousands of houses and buildings, including convents, churches and a seminary on the majority-Catholic island. Craters left by rocks falling from the eruptions measured up to 13 meters wide and 5 meters deep, experts found. Authorities have warned the thousands of people who fled the area not to return home, as the government planned to evacuate about 16,000 residents out of the danger zone. The series of eruptions throughout the week have already affected more than 10,000 people in 14 villages, with more than half moving into makeshift emergency shelters. A total of 2,384 houses and public facilities were damaged or had collapsed after tons of volcanic material hit the buildings, said Kanesius Didimus, head of a local disaster management agency. It also destroyed a main road connecting East Flores district where the mountain is located to neighboring Larantuka district. Rescue workers, police and soldiers searched devastated areas to ensure all residents had been moved out from the danger zone. Logistic and relief supplies were provided to about 10,700 displaced people in eight evacuation sites as of Saturday. The National Disaster Management Agency said residents of the hardest-hit villages would be relocated within six months, and each family waiting to be rehoused would be compensated 500,000 rupiah ($32) per month. About 6,500 people were evacuated in January after Mount Lewotobi Laki Laki began erupting, spewing thick clouds and forcing the government to close the island's Fransiskus Xaverius Seda Airport. No casualties or major damage were reported, but the airport has remained closed due to seismic activity. Three other airports in neighboring districts of Ende, Larantuka and Bajawa have been closed since Monday after Indonesia's Air Navigation issued a safety warning due to volcanic ash. Lewotobi Laki Laki is one of a pair of stratovolcanoes in the East Flores district of East Nusa Tenggara province, known locally as the husband-and-wife mountains. 'Laki laki' means man, while its mate is Lewotobi Perempuan, or woman. It's one of the 120 active volcanoes in Indonesia, an archipelago of 280 million people. The country is prone to earthquakes, landslides and volcanic activity because it sits along the 'Ring of Fire,' a horseshoe-shaped series of seismic fault lines around the Pacific Ocean.	https://www.voanews.com/a/indonesia-s-mount-lewotobi-laki-laki-unleashes-towering-columns-of-hot-clouds-/7857943.html	2024-11-08T21:34:18-08:00	
Pompeii archaeological park sets daily visitors' limit to combat over-tourism	ROME — The Pompeii archaeological park plans to limit visitor numbers to 20,000 a day and introduce personalized tickets starting next week in a bid to cope with over-tourism and protect the world heritage site, officials said Friday. The move comes after what authorities called a record summer that saw more than 4 million people visiting the world-famous remains of the ancient Roman city, buried under ash and rock following the eruption of Mount Vesuvius in 79 A.D. The park's director Gabriel Zuchtriegel said visitors to the main archaeological site now exceed an average of 15,000 to 20,000 every day, and the new daily cap will prevent the numbers from surging further. 'We are working on a series of projects to lift the human pressure on the site, which could pose risks both for visitors and the heritage (that is) so unique and fragile,' Zuchtriegel said. Starting November 15 tickets to access the park will be personalized to include the full names of visitors. A maximum of 20,000 tickets will be released each day, with different time slots during the peak summer season. The park's management is also trying to attract more tourists to visit other ancient sites connected to Pompeii by a free shuttle bus under the 'Greater Pompeii' project, including Stabia, Torre Annunziata and Boscoreale sites. 'The measures to manage flows and safety and the personalization of the visits are part of this strategy,' Zuchtriegel said. 'We are aiming for slow, sustainable, pleasant and non-mass tourism and above all widespread throughout the territory around the UNESCO site, which is full of cultural jewels to discover,' he added.	https://www.voanews.com/a/pompeii-archaeological-park-sets-daily-visitors-limit-to-combat-over-tourism/7857940.html	2024-11-08T21:25:48-08:00	
US to send contactors to Ukraine to repair, maintain US weapons	The United States will send a small number of contractors to Ukraine to help it maintain and repair the U.S.-provided weapons and air defense systems it is using against Russia’s invasion, a defense official said Friday. The official said the contractors 'will be far from the front lines and they will not be fighting Russian forces.' Ukraine needs the contractors to repair and maintain equipment, such as F-16s and Patriot air defense systems, that requires 'specific technical expertise to maintain,' the official said. The decision to send the contractors was made 'after careful risk assessment,' the official said. On Wednesday, when Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy called U.S. President-elect Donald Trump to congratulate him on his election victory, Trump had Elon Musk join the call. The billionaire businessman was a contributor to Trump’s presidential campaign. A Ukrainian official told The Associated Press that Zelenskyy thanked Musk for helping Ukraine gain access to the Starlink satellite internet platform. Other media outlets reported that Trump told Zelenskyy that he would support Ukraine, and that Musk said he would continue to supply Starlink. Musk was on the phone for only part of the conversation. Overnight attacks Ukrainian officials said Friday morning that Russia attacked the regions of Odesa, Kharkiv and Kyiv overnight into Friday with drones, missiles and aerial bombs, damaging residential buildings and infrastructure and killing at least one person and injuring at least 25. Regional officials in Kharkiv say a Russian guided aerial bomb struck a 12-story residential building in the early hours Friday. They said the bomb struck the first three floors. A search was underway for anyone trapped in the rubble. In Odesa, police and emergency service officials told the French news agency Agence France-Presse that a Russian drone struck several residential buildings, sparking fires in some. They said a 46-year-old man was killed when his car was struck by shrapnel, and at least nine others were injured. The Odesa officials reported shrapnel from the attacks also ruptured fuel lines, causing several fires. On the social media platform X, President Zelenskyy said Ukrainian forces shot down four missiles and about 60 drones launched by Russia against Ukraine overnight Thursday. 'Each time Russia attempts to destroy our lives, it is crucial to respond collectively and decisively at the international level to reduce and block the potential for terror,' Zelenskyy wrote. 'Ukraine needs strength to achieve this. This is the only way to achieve a just peace and to ending the killing of our people,' he said. He called for more air defenses, and long-range capabilities, weapons packages, and sanctions against Russia. Zelenskyy took that message Thursday to the European Political Community Summit in Budapest, where he met with European leaders and reportedly reached new defense agreements to strengthen Ukrainian forces, along with agreements on positive steps toward reinforcing air defenses before winter. But while most European leaders signaled continued support for Ukraine’s war effort, there were indications that Trump’s victory in the U.S. elections this week could change that picture. In a radio interview Friday, the host of that summit, Hungarian Prime Minister Viktor Orban, who has close ties to both Trump and Russian President Vladimir Putin, said U.S. support for Ukraine will end with the election of Trump and that Europe needs to re-think its approach to the war. 'The Americans will quit this war,' Orban told Hungarian state radio and indicated he felt Europe must follow suit. 'Europe cannot finance this war alone, there are some who still want it, who still want to continue sending enormous amounts of money into this lost war, but the number of those who remain silent, though they were loud before, and those who cautiously voice that we should adjust to the new situation, is growing,' Orban said. The Hungarian leader made the comments ahead of the European Union summit Friday in Budapest. Before that meeting, outgoing European Council President Charles Michel told reporters Europe wants to strengthen ties with the United States and continue strengthening Ukraine. 'We have to support Ukraine because if we do not support Ukraine, this is the wrong signal that we send to Putin but also to some other authoritarian regimes across the world,' Michel said. Trump has criticized the level of U.S. support for Ukraine's fight against Russia's 2022 full-scale invasion, and before the election he promised to end the conflict before even taking office, without explaining how. Some information for this story was provided by The Associated Press, Reuters and Agence France-Presse.	https://www.voanews.com/a/us-to-send-contactors-to-ukraine-to-repair-maintain-us-weapons/7857926.html	2024-11-08T19:31:36-08:00	
Will Indonesia's Prabowo move closer to Trump, Xi or both?	Washington — Indonesia's newly inaugurated President Prabowo Subianto set off for China on Friday for his first international trip as president. 'From Beijing I will fly directly to Washington, D.C., on the invitation of the U.S. president,' said Prabowo upon departing Jakarta. Indonesians often refer to public figures by their first names. His tour aims to 'cultivate good relations with all parties,' Prabowo said. He has stated his ambition to raise Indonesia's international profile and made early foreign policy moves, including a surprise decision to join Southeast Asia's largest economy to the BRICS bloc. BRICS, which stands for Brazil, Russia, India, China and South Africa, comprises a growing group of emerging economies and is seen as a counterweight to the West. In October, the group added Indonesia as one of its 13 new 'partner countries.' The move is a shift away from the position taken by Prabowo's predecessor, Joko Widodo, who took in massive amounts of infrastructure investments from Beijing but remained mostly nonaligned geopolitically. Prabowo's visit comes during a transitional period at the White House, ahead of the incoming administration of President-elect Donald Trump in January. The White House has not formally announced the visit; however, Jakarta said Prabowo is scheduled to meet U.S. President Joe Biden at the White House early next week. Indonesian diplomatic sources who spoke under condition of anonymity told VOA that Prabowo has requested a meeting with Trump. The Trump team has not responded to VOA's query on whether it will be granted. New period of US-Indonesia ties Starting in January, both countries will be under the helm of leaders who were democratically elected but have employed authoritarian rhetoric, at a time when Washington is focused on its rivalry with the authoritarian regime in China under Xi Jinping. Like Trump, Prabowo made a historical political comeback under unlikely circumstances. He secured a landslide victory after two failed attempts, 26 years after his father-in-law, President Suharto, was ousted from power. This, despite Prabowo admitting he was ordered by Suharto in 1998 to abduct activists protesting the regime. Washington was aware of Prabowo's involvement, and the Clinton, Bush and Obama administrations denied Prabowo entry to the U.S., citing human rights concerns. The Trump administration lifted the visa ban and then-Defense Secretary Mark Esper invited then-Defense Minister Prabowo to Washington in 2020. With Trump in the White House, analysts say, Jakarta could see more opportunities to expand ties with Washington if Prabowo makes inroads through the right people for the right incentives, given Trump's history of relying more on personal connections than institutional relationships. Personal connections Jakarta's point person for Washington under the first Trump administration was Luhut Binsar Pandjaitan, a businessman and retired four-star army general who then served as coordinating minister for maritime affairs and investment. Luhut developed close ties with Adam Boehler, head of the U.S. International Development Finance Corporation and a former college roommate of Trump's son-in-law Jared Kushner. In 2020, Boehler dangled the promise of a $2 billion investment into Indonesia's planned sovereign wealth fund. The plan fell through because the price, recognition of Israel under the Trump administration's Abraham Accords, was too high for Jakarta, according to an interview Boehler gave to Bloomberg at the end of 2020. In Prabowo's administration, Luhut holds the position of head of the National Economic Council and special adviser on investment affairs. But in a Cabinet of more than 100 officials, his influence has diminished. 'The deck is being shuffled right now, and we don't know yet where the cards will land,' said Yeremia Lalisang, assistant professor of international relations at the University of Indonesia. What's clear, Lalisang told VOA, is that the 'pragmatic' Prabowo will be delighted to be welcomed by Trump after being treated as a 'human rights criminal' by previous U.S. administrations. One possibility to bolster ties under Trump would be for Prabowo to capitalize on the connection between billionaires among Trump's inner circle. This would include Trump's wealthiest backer, Elon Musk, and Hary Tanoesoedibjo, an Indonesian tycoon who has partnered with the Trump family on several real estate projects in Indonesia. Both were at Trump's residence in Mar-a-Lago, Florida, Tuesday night, celebrating his election victory. Tanoesoedibjo, who commonly goes by his initials H.T., would not confirm whether he is facilitating a Trump-Prabowo meeting next week. However, he said, Trump's victory would bring 'positive hope for Indonesia.' 'Trump's favorable understanding of Indonesia should be maximalized for the economic benefit of both countries, especially Indonesia's economic interests,' H.T. told VOA. Investing in nickel Under Jokowi's administration, Jakarta courted Musk, head of SpaceX and Tesla, to invest in two key areas: satellites and electric vehicle batteries. Earlier this year, Musk launched SpaceX's satellite internet service, Starlink, in Bali and Maluku. With the Earth's largest reserves of nickel, Indonesia is eager to develop its EV battery industry, and Prabowo is expected to continue his predecessor's yearslong effort to lure Tesla to invest. The Biden administration has put aside tens of billions of dollars in tax credits to spur the U.S. EV industry, under the Inflation Reduction Act, its signature climate and energy legislation. To qualify for the credit, 40% of the minerals used for battery production for EVs sold in the U.S. must be extracted or processed domestically or in one of its free-trade partners. Jakarta has been pushing for a limited free-trade agreement that will allow it to benefit from IRA tax credits. However, its nickel industry is backed by investment from Chinese companies and besieged by environmental concerns, limiting its access to the U.S. market. 'You might see some of this calculus change during the course of the Trump administration,' said Andreyka Natalegawa, associate fellow for the Southeast Asia Program at the Center for Strategic and International Studies. Trump has vowed to loosen environmental restrictions. U.S.-Indonesia cooperation on nickel is 'out there as an objective,' said Ann Marie Murphy, senior research scholar at the Weatherhead East Asian Institute at Columbia University. 'If it fails to come to fruition, I think that could be disappointing to both sides,' she told VOA. However, Trump, who has made high tariffs on China a central theme of his campaign, will be looking closely at the tariffs' impact on the EV industry. He has vowed to roll back tax credits available to EV buyers in the U.S. He will also be watching bilateral trade deficits. In 2017, his administration placed Indonesia on a watchlist of countries that have a large trade surplus, threatening Jakarta with unspecified consequences if trade was not brought into balance. 'There's lots of question marks here that we still need to wait and see to get answers,' Natalegawa told VOA.

Judge pauses court deadlines in Trump's 2020 election interference case	A U.S. judge has set aside all the pending court deadlines President-elect Donald Trump is facing for his 2020 election interference case. U.S. District Judge Tanya Chutkan approved the request for the move Friday by Special Counsel Jack Smith, the prosecutor in the criminal case against the president-elect. Smith's team said in its request for the delay that it needs 'time to assess this unprecedented circumstance and determine the appropriate course going forward consistent with Department of Justice policy.' Sitting presidents, according to Justice Department policy, cannot be prosecuted. Now it seems that as Trump is on the verge of assuming the country's highest office again, following his victory this week over Vice President Kamala Harris in the presidential election, the presidential office could shield Trump from facing charges stemming from what has become known as the Capitol riot. Chutkan has instructed the prosecutors to file their court papers with their proposed way forward in the case against Trump by December 2. Trump has always maintained that he has immunity from prosecution. In July, the Supreme Court ruled that former presidents do have broad immunity from prosecution and kicked the case back to Chutkan for her to determine how the case against the former president could proceed. Trump's lawyers were scheduled to respond by November 21 to Smith's argument that the case could still proceed because most of the activities Trump was accused of came in his role as a candidate for re-election, not as president. On January 6, 2021, Trump and his supporters sought to prevent Joe Biden from assuming the presidency. Biden had defeated then-President Trump in the 2020 election, but on Inauguration Day, after Trump delivered a fiery speech, his supporters surged the Capitol as lawmakers were set to certify the presidential election results. More than 1,000 of Trump's supporters have been convicted for their participation in the riot. Despite the violent images that have emerged from that day, including insurrectionists beating police officers, Trump has continued to characterize his supporters as 'patriots' and has said he would pardon many of them if elected. Some information in this report came from The Associated Press and Reuters.	https://www.voanews.com/a/judge-pauses-court-deadlines-in-trump-s-2020-election-interference-case-/7857610.html	2024-11-08T16:24:11-08:00	
China’s police seize assets, demand payments amid economic downturn	washington — Zhang Ke, not his real name, has been hiding from police in the southern megalopolis of Guangzhou since September. He said he had not committed a crime but was dodging authorities to avoid extortion by police from another city more than 1,400 kilometers away in northern China. In July, Zhang said his life was turned upside down when all of his bank accounts were frozen by the Nanle County Public Security Bureau in Henan province. Zhang told VOA Mandarin that police demanded $55,000 — nearly all the money he has earned from his sports lottery distributor business — in exchange for having the freeze lifted. According to Zhang and posts by others on China’s social media, he is not the only one being targeted and fleeced by police. As China’s economy struggles and economic pressures constrain local government budgets, law enforcement officers have been using flexible legal codes and financial punishments to fill government coffers, analysts say. Reports circulating on Chinese social media detailed nearly 10,000 incidents in which companies in Guangzhou province alone had their assets frozen or removed from bank accounts by police. Zhang’s business was one of them. Two years ago, Zhang began selling services to clients on social media. Buyers would pay him to gamble on their behalf instead of going to stores in person. If the tickets won, he would wire them the money. Chinese law regulates the sale of physical lottery tickets, but Zhang's business exists in a legal gray area. Chinese law forbids the sale of sports lottery tickets online. Zhang's company does not distribute physical tickets to his customers. However, law enforcement has subjectively interpreted the law to target Zhang and his company. The lack of clarity and standards for interpretation, Zhang said, provides these cross-provincial police officers an opportunity to 'incriminate tens of thousands of store owners' like himself as a means of profit generation. Internet users have begun using the catchphrase 'offshore fishing' to describe the extralegal police practice of arresting, freezing or transferring the assets of private enterprises and individuals in another province. Zhang said he has met many other lottery distributors who were also subjected to undue financial punishments. 'The police asked them for money and the money was then transferred to the policemen's personal accounts, not to the public security bureau's corporate accounts,' he said. Teng Biao, a visiting professor at Hunter College, told VOA that 'offshore fishing' does not properly enforce laws across provinces but rather generates revenue for police and local governments. 'A lot of private enterprises, including many small-business owners, are facing an extremely bad legal and political environment. There are so many gray areas in China’s legal system that it’s almost impossible for businesses to fully align with the law. Combined with China's imperfect and distorted market system, it is very easy for the police to find an excuse to crack down on the entrepreneurs,' he said. Teng attributed the prevalence of 'offshore fishing' to China’s economic downturn. 'The local governments used to rely on selling land for financial resources. But the economic downturn and crippled property market stripped them of that option. That provides an incentive for frequent cross-provincial law enforcement, the so-called ‘offshore fishing,’ ' he said. Many lottery sellers, including Zhang, have been forced to pay money to avoid jail time, he told VOA. 'If you don't give the police money, you're going to be locked up. Some lottery sellers pay the fine on the same day they are questioned, and get released right away, and never hear from the police again. If you don’t do what they say, you’re locked up until you give in,' he said. Last month, the director of the National Development and Reform Commission responsible for planning China’s economy, Zheng Shajie, talked about the issue of 'offshore fishing' at a press conference and called for the standardization of law enforcement. 'Law enforcement must not cross regional boundaries in violation of regulations, nor should it be conducted for profit,' he said. Local police departments have also taken steps to address the issue. Jiubao police station in the eastern city of Hangzhou, a business hub for many of China’s e-commerce merchants, issued a public notice in August, saying: 'Non-local police are forbidden to enforce laws in Jiubao unless they’re accompanied by local police. Film and call the local police if you find them illegally entering your property.' Zhang said he called all the anti-corruption hotlines but never received a reply. 'I have no other choice. I have tried everything. I probably will give up the fight in the end. Now I know what it feels like to have no freedom, and I finally understand why all those wealthy Chinese businessmen move to other countries,' he said. 'I don't want to live in China anymore. I want to learn English and go to work abroad, and even if I drive a taxi for the rest of my life, I will take it. I don't want to live in this land of China anymore; it's disgusting,' Zhang told VOA. VOA tried to reach Puyang Public Security Bureau authorities in Henan province by phone, but the calls went unanswered. Katherine Michaelson and Adrianna Zhang contributed to this report.	https://www.voanews.com/a/china-s-police-seize-assets-demand-payments-amid-economic-downturn-/7857592.html	2024-11-08T14:55:43-08:00	
Turkish authorities ban screening of LGBTQI-themed film 'Queer'	Washington/Istanbul — Local authorities in Turkey's metropolitan Istanbul province banned a screening of the LGBTQI-themed movie 'Queer' on Thursday because of concerns that it would endanger public peace and security. The screening of 'Queer,' a film directed by Italian director Luca Guadagnino and starring Daniel Craig and Drew Starkey, was scheduled to open a film festival in Istanbul's Kadikoy district on Thursday. The festival was organized by Mubi, an international streaming platform and film production and distribution company. Mubi canceled the entire festival, noting 'This ban not only targets a single film but also undermines the very essence and purpose of the festival.' In a statement shared on X, Mubi announced that the Kadikoy District Governor's Office had notified them of the ban hours before the festival was set to begin. 'The decision states that the film is prohibited on the grounds that it contains provocative content that could endanger public peace, with the ban being imposed for security reasons,' Mubi wrote. 'We believe this ban is a direct restriction on art and freedom of expression,' Mubi added. The Kadikoy District Governor's Office has not made a public statement on the ban and has not responded to VOA's inquiry at the time of this story's publication. Rising anti-LGBTQI+ rhetoric The Turkish government has toughened rhetoric against its LGBTQI+ community in recent years, with Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan repeatedly calling its members 'perverts' or 'deviants.' Authorities have banned pride marches throughout the country since 2015, citing security concerns. At least 15 people were detained in Istanbul in June for taking part in a pride rally. Yıldız Tar, editor in chief of the LGBTQI news portal KaosGL, does not find the ban surprising considering the government's anti-LGBTQI stance. 'The reason for the ban on 'Queer' is of course that it is a film about LGBTI+ people. When you try to organize any LGBTI+-themed event in Turkey since 2015, you already encounter such bans,' Tar told VOA. Tar noted that the Kadikoy District Governor's Office banned the screening of another movie, 'Pride,' as part of Pride Month events in June 2023. The Istanbul festival, which was scheduled to take place November 7 to 10, included a variety of film screenings, talks and performances. According to Mubi, tickets for the festival had sold out days in advance. Tar views Mubi's decision to cancel the festival after the ban as 'an important and valuable message' and argues that the platform's decision should be exemplary. 'If LGBTI+ themed films are being censored so openly at this point, then festivals and the world of culture and arts need to raise a very strong voice against this censorship,' Tar said. Academic and film critic Yeşim Burul also sees the district governor's ban as censorship. 'We are talking about unacceptable censorship here. It is truly absurd that a district governorship would make such decisions to prevent a film from reaching the audience,' Burul told VOA. 'We, as adults, can decide which film we can and cannot watch. Such festivals are already organized for those over the age of 18, and tickets are sold that way,' Burul added. The 2024 film 'Queer,' with a screenplay adapted from William S. Burroughs' 1985 novel, tells the story of an American expatriate living in Mexico City in the 1950s who establishes an intimate connection with a younger man. In October, Mubi acquired distribution rights for the film in multiple territories, including Turkey, India, the United Kingdom, Germany and Latin America. Reactions Several rights groups and organizations reacted to the ban on the screening. According to the LGBTI+ Rights Commission of the Istanbul branch of the Human Rights Association, the ban is 'a continuation of criminalizing LGBTI+ individuals.' In a post on X, the rights group argued that the ban violates not only domestic law but also the 'protection from discrimination' principle of the European Convention on Human Rights, to which Turkey is a signatory. The Actors' Union of Turkey called the ban 'clearly an application of censorship.' 'The duty of art and artists is to broaden the horizons of societies and offer them new perspectives while telling their own stories,' the union said in a statement published on X. The union also reminded that the law on freedom of expression protects artistic activities in Turkey.	https://www.voanews.com/a/7857598.html	2024-11-08T14:52:44-08:00	
Who is Trump’s new chief of staff? Susie Wiles will be 1st woman to hold post	With her appointment as chief of staff to President-elect Donald Trump, Susie Wiles moves from a largely behind-the-scenes role of campaign co-chair to one of the most prominent positions in a new White House administration. The 67-year-old will become the first woman to serve in the post for any U.S. president when she assumes the role as the president's closest adviser in January. In announcing his decision Thursday, Trump said Wiles is 'tough, smart, innovative, and is universally admired and respected.' It was his first appointment since winning Tuesday’s election against Vice President Kamala Harris. 'It is a well deserved honor to have Susie as the first-ever female Chief of Staff in United States history. I have no doubt that she will make our country proud,' Trump said in his statement. Wiles largely avoided the spotlight during her time as co-chair of Trump’s successful election campaign and was credited — along with co-campaign manager Chris LaCivita — with bringing some discipline to Trump’s free-wheeling, off-script campaign style. She didn’t speak during Trump’s victory celebration early Wednesday morning when he called her to the podium, and she refused to take the microphone. Wiles rarely gives televised interviews and tends to avoid the spotlight, a contrast with LaCivita, who is known for being outspoken. For someone of her stature, she is not well-known in political circles. During his victory speech, Trump referred to Wiles as the 'ice maiden.' She is one of Trump’s most trusted advisers. During a rally in Milwaukee, Wisconsin, earlier this month, he said: 'She’s incredible. Incredible.' Top Trump pollster Tony Fabrizio told Politico in April, 'There is nobody, I think, that has the wealth of information that she does. Nobody in our orbit. Nobody.' While Wiles is a somewhat enigmatic figure, she has a long career of working behind the scenes in U.S. politics. Shortly after she graduated from the University of Maryland in 1979, she went to work for New York Congressman Jack Kemp and joined Ronald Reagan’s presidential campaign in 1980. She eventually moved to Florida where she advised the campaigns of two Florida mayors and helped then-businessman Rick Scott transition to politics in his successful 2010 campaign for governor. She managed Utah Governor Jon Huntsman Jr.’s presidential bid in 2012, and managed Florida for Trump’s 2016 campaign. She joined Ron DeSantis’ race for governor in 2018, but she parted ways with him after a falling out in 2019. Wiles made a rare appearance on social media shortly before DeSantis dropped out of the presidential race in January. 'Bye, bye,' she wrote. She went on to run Trump’s primary campaign against DeSantis, which Trump easily won. Wiles is the only campaign manager to survive an entire Trump campaign and is known for her ability to tamp down his mercurial, sometimes volatile behavior. In one anecdote reported by The Associated Press, during a campaign speech in Pennsylvania when Trump strayed off his talking points and quipped about not minding if members of the media were shot, she came out and silently stared at him until he got back on track. That ability should serve her well in her new role. In his last four years in office, Trump went through four chiefs of staff, a record for modern presidents. Some information in this report was provided by The Associated Press.	https://www.voanews.com/a/who-is-trump-s-new-chief-of-staff-/7857567.html	2024-11-08T14:16:00-08:00	
Amsterdam bans rallies after Israeli soccer fans attacked	amsterdam — Amsterdam banned demonstrations for three days from Friday after overnight attacks on Israeli soccer supporters by what the mayor called 'antisemitic hit-and-run squads,' and Israel sent planes to the Netherlands to fly fans home. Mayor Femke Halsema said Maccabi Tel Aviv fans had been 'attacked, abused and pelted with fireworks' around the city, and that riot police intervened to protect them and escort them to hotels. At least five people were treated in a hospital. Videos on social media showed riot police in action, with some attackers shouting anti-Israeli slurs. Footage also showed Maccabi Tel Aviv supporters chanting anti-Arab slogans before Thursday evening's match. 'We saw a lot of demonstrations, a lot of people running. It was really, really terrifying,' said Joni Pogrebetsy, an Israeli soccer fan in Amsterdam for the match. Antisemitic incidents have surged in the Netherlands since Israel launched its assault on the Palestinian enclave of Gaza after the attacks on Israel by Hamas militants in October last year, with many Jewish organizations and schools reporting threats and hate mail. Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's government sent planes to the Netherlands to bring fans home, while Foreign Minister Gideon Saar flew to Amsterdam for impromptu meetings with the Dutch government and far-right leader Geert Wilders. Amsterdam banned demonstrations through the weekend and gave police emergency stop-and-search powers in response to the unrest, which exposed deep anger over the Gaza-Israel conflict. More than 43,000 Palestinians have been killed and millions displaced in Israel's military offensive on Gaza, according to health officials there. The offensive was launched after Hamas killed 1,200 Israelis and took more than 250 hostage in the initial cross-border attack, according to Israel. Hamas has been designated a terror group by the U.S., U.K., EU and others. In Washington, U.S. President Biden condemned the attacks as 'despicable' and said they 'echo dark moments in history when Jews were persecuted.' United Nations Secretary-General Antonio Guterres was shocked by the violence in Amsterdam, a U.N. spokesperson said. Security tightened Mayor Halsema said police had been taken by surprise after security services failed to flag the match against Ajax Amsterdam, traditionally identified as a Jewish club, as high-risk. 'Antisemitic hit-and-run squads' had managed to evade a force of around 200 officers, she said. Security was tightened in the city, where a service was planned at a Jewish monument on Saturday to remember Kristallnacht, the Nazi pogrom against Jews across Germany on Nov. 9-10, 1938. A video verified by Reuters showed a group of men running near Amsterdam central station, chasing and assaulting other men as police sirens sounded. Dutch Prime Minister Dick Schoof said he was 'horrified by the anti-Semitic attacks on Israeli citizens' and had assured Netanyahu by phone that 'the perpetrators will be identified and prosecuted.' Israeli President Isaac Herzog spoke with Dutch King Willem-Alexander, who he said had 'expressed deep horror and shock.' Herzog quoted the king as saying the Netherlands had failed its Jewish community during World War II — under Nazi occupation and persecution — and again on Thursday night. Anti-Muslim politician Wilders, head of the largest party in the government, said he was 'ashamed that this can happen in the Netherlands.' In a post on X, he blamed 'criminal Muslims' and said they should be deported. Police said there had been incidents before the game, for which 3,000 Maccabi supporters traveled to Amsterdam. Israel says violence recalls European pogroms The Israeli Embassy in The Hague said mobs had chanted anti-Israel slogans and shared videos of their violence on social media, 'kicking, beating, even running over Israeli citizens.' 'On the eve of Kristallnacht — when Jews in Nazi Germany faced brutal attacks — it is horrifying to witness antisemitic violence on the streets of Europe once again,' it said. Police said 62 suspects had been detained after the game as pro-Palestinian demonstrators tried to reach the Johan Cruyff Arena, even though the city had forbidden a protest there. Ten remained in custody on Friday. They said fans had left the stadium without incident after the Europa League match, which Ajax won 5-0, but that clashes erupted overnight in the city center. Herzog was among senior Israeli politicians who said the violence recalled the attack on Israel by Hamas gunmen last year as well as attacks on European Jews in the pogroms of previous centuries. 'We see with horror this morning, the shocking images and videos that since October 7th, we had hoped never to see again: an anti-Semitic pogrom currently taking place against Maccabi Tel Aviv fans and Israeli citizens in the heart of Amsterdam,' he wrote on X. Senior Hamas official Sami Abu Zuhri said that the mass killing by Israeli forces in Gaza and lack of international intervention to stop it 'is likely to lead to such spontaneous repercussions.' 'This emphasizes that stopping the genocide in Gaza is an essential part of respecting and protecting human rights, as well as ensuring regional and global security and peace,' he told Reuters. The Gaza war has led to protests in support of both sides across Europe and the United States, and both Jews and Arabs have been attacked.	https://www.voanews.com/a/amsterdam-bans-demonstrations-after-israeli-soccer-fans-attacked/7857473.html	2024-11-08T13:13:46-08:00	
In Morocco, politics limited sermons, including about war in Middle East	rabat, morocco — Politicians and activists in Morocco are questioning limitations imposed on preachers regarding what they may say about war in the Middle East during sermons. During a meeting at the country's parliament this week, socialist lawmaker Nabila Mounib bemoaned the way that imams were curtailed in how they can speak about the plight of Palestinians and call for religious struggle to support their cause. 'No imam can speak about the Palestinian issue,' Mounib claimed on Tuesday. 'Today no one is demanding jihad for our brothers in Palestine.' In Morocco, imams are employed by the state and their sermons cannot be overtly political. Morocco's Ministry of Islamic Affairs has said discussion of the Israel-Hamas war is permitted. Yet activists are still worried about de facto limits placed on preaching about Palestinians. The question first arose in October 2023 after a document circulated on social media claiming to outline such limits. Morocco's Ministry of Islamic Affairs said in a statement that preaching about the suffering of Palestinians was authorized and that the document was fake. In an interview with Moroccan news website Anfas Press on Friday, Mounib said she had intended to denounce efforts to prevent imams from preaching about Palestinians but had not said imams should call for jihad from their pulpits. 'Jihad,' which means struggle or effort in Arabic, can denote striving to live in accordance with the path of God, either through internally finding one's faith or externally fighting for Islamic principles like justice. However, it can be interpreted in more militant terms as 'holy war' and has been used by some as a religious concept to recruit volunteers to fight since the Soviet-Afghanistan war began in 1979. The debate centers on whether imams should be allowed to invoke jihad in regard to the war between Israel and Hamas. Minister of Islamic Affairs Ahmed Toufiq has denied Mounib's claim that preachers cannot broach the Israel-Hamas war, but he acknowledged and defended the prohibition on calls for jihad. 'Any imam who talks about barbarism and injustice and denounces them is welcome, but calling for jihad is something else,' he said. Explaining the prohibition this week, Toufiq cautioned that there were different interpretations of jihad. Yet to some pro-Palestinian activists in Morocco, the limitations are less about jihad and more about the tensions between state and society that have simmered since the war began. 'Imams have a right to take a stand and, in Islam, even have a duty,' Ahmed Wehman of the Moroccan Observatory for Anti-Normalization told The Associated Press. 'The government has nothing to do with Moroccan public opinion. They do not represent Morocco and Moroccans.' Morocco has one of the region's most historically significant Jewish communities and was one of four Arab states to normalize ties with Israel in 2020. But tens of thousands of protesters have regularly taken to the streets of its major cities throughout the 14-month war, protesting Israel's actions and demanding Morocco cut diplomatic ties. Many governments dictate what preachers can say from the pulpit in Muslim-majority countries, including Morocco, which has long worked to describe its brand of Islam to the world as a moderating force. Doing so is among authorities' strategies to curb extremism but can at times push believers to look for spiritual guidance outside the government-controlled religious sphere. Francesco Cavatorta, a political science professor at Université Laval in Quebec, said countries like Morocco, Algeria, Egypt and Syria have historically exerted control over imams to control the narrative of religion and ensure sermons don't undermine national stability. In Morocco, he said, the regulation is 'part of an effort to be seen as a country that is a Muslim country but a tolerant country and a welcoming country.' Morocco has this year suspended preachers who veer from directives. Its Ministry of Islamic Affairs publishes guidance for imams on Wednesdays, two days before Friday prayers. The content of sermons has in the past pitted the government against activists. In 2017, when anti-government protests were sweeping Morocco's north, the Ministry of Islamic Affairs directed preachers to reproach activists for promoting division among Muslims, the online news outlet Le Desk reported. Nasser Zefzafi, the country's most famous political prisoner, was arrested later that year after interrupting a sermon about the protests, shouting a question about whether mosques served God or the monarchy. Morocco's Ministry of Islamic Affairs did not respond to requests for comment. Imams throughout the Middle East and North Africa have regularly referenced the war since October 2023, including in countries where the government oversees their sermons. 'The way to eliminate oppression and evil, no matter where it is in the world, is through the unity and solidarity of Muslims,' Ali Erbas, the head of the Turkish Presidency of Religious Affairs, said in a Friday sermon delivered in Azerbaijan. 'When Muslims act together with the consciousness of brotherhood and the spirit of solidarity, all people will find peace.'	https://www.voanews.com/a/in-morocco-politics-limited-sermons-including-about-war-in-middle-east-/7857499.html	2024-11-08T12:53:22-08:00	
Crews in Southern California, New Jersey make progress against wildfires	Southern California firefighters made progress against a wildfire that has destroyed 132 structures, mostly homes. The fierce wind gusts that fanned the flames began easing Friday, allowing some people to return to sort through the charred remains of their homes. Maryanne Belote returned to her hillside neighborhood in Camarillo, a city northwest of Los Angeles, after making a harrowing escape with her cat, dog and horses as the blaze raged in the area. The only thing standing was a rock wall she built. 'If I hadn't gotten the horses, I would have been devastated, but I have my family and I have my animals so, I'm OK. I will rebuild,' she said, standing outside the remains of her home of 50 years. The Mountain Fire started Wednesday morning in Ventura County and had grown to about 83 square kilometers. It was 7% contained Friday morning. About 10,000 people remained under evacuation orders Friday morning as the fire continued to threaten about 3,500 structures in suburban neighborhoods, ranches and agricultural areas around Camarillo in Ventura County. At least 88 structures were damaged in addition to the 132 destroyed. Officials did not specify whether they had fire, water or smoke damage. The cause of the fire has not been determined. Ten people suffered smoke inhalation or other non-life-threatening injuries, Ventura County Sheriff James Fryhoff said. Crews working in steep terrain with support from water-dropping helicopters were focusing on protecting homes on hillsides along the fire's northeast edge near the city of Santa Paula, home to more than 30,000 people, county fire officials said. Officials in several Southern California counties urged residents to watch for fast-spreading blazes, power outages and downed trees during the latest round of notorious Santa Ana winds. Santa Anas are dry, warm and gusty northeast winds that blow from the interior of Southern California toward the coast and offshore, moving in the opposite direction of the normal onshore flow that carries moist air from the Pacific. They typically occur during the fall months and continue through winter and into early spring. Red flag warnings, indicating conditions for high fire danger, expired Friday morning when winds began diminishing. Governor Gavin Newsom has proclaimed a state of emergency in Ventura County. An air quality alert for harmful fine particle pollution was in effect from Friday morning until Saturday afternoon due to smoke from the wildfires. Across the country in New Jersey, firefighters were stretched thin Friday with at least four wildfires burning in the state, stretching from the Pinelands in the central and western parts of the state to the New York City suburbs. The latest fire broke out along the Palisades Interstate Parkway in Englewood Cliffs in Bergen County, across the Hudson River from New York. It was smaller than the three others burning in New Jersey, each of which had burned less than a square mile as of late Thursday. Those fires, in Jackson, Glassboro and Evesham, were between 50% and 80% contained Friday. New Jersey has not received measurable precipitation in over a month, the weather service said, setting a record.	https://www.voanews.com/a/crews-in-southern-california-new-jersey-make-progress-against-wildfires-/7857490.html	2024-11-08T12:46:03-08:00	
US exposes Iranian-directed network plotting Trump assassination	Iranian operatives sought to assassinate now President-elect Doanld Trump just weeks before Tuesday's U.S. presidential election and were willing to forego other plots against regime critics and high-profile targets to see it through, court documents say. The revelations, in documents unsealed Friday against the suspects in an unrelated murder-for-hire plot, stem from a series of conversations between the alleged ringleader, 51-year-old Farhad Shakeri, and the FBI. The documents indicate that Shakeri, who said he was in Tehran at the time of the conversations, agreed to speak with the FBI to gain a reduced prison sentence for an unnamed prisoner in the U.S. Shakeri told the agents that an official with the Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps approached him in mid- to late September, asking him to set aside a plot to kill an Iranian dissident and journalist in New York, to instead go after Trump. Shakeri said he was asked to provide a plan within seven days and that when he said targeting Trump would be costly, the IRGC official told him, 'We have already spent a lot of money … money's not an issue.' He also told the FBI that if a plan could not be formulated within the seven-day timeframe, the IRGC official planned to wait until after the U.S. election, reasoning Trump would lose and that it would be easier to kill him. The court documents do not say whether Shakeri’s conversations with the FBI were authorized by the IRGC or other authorities in Iran. The Iranian mission at the United Nations did not respond to a request for comment. The plot against Trump is just the latest in what U.S. officials have described as brazen attempts by Tehran to kill the former and future U.S. president in retaliation for a 2020 drone strike in Baghdad that killed Qassem Soleimani, the leader of the IRGC's Quds Force. In August, U.S. officials charged a Pakistani man, Asif Merchant, who had traveled to the United States months earlier on behalf of Iran looking for hitmen to kill Trump and others. 'There are few actors in the world that pose as grave a threat to the national security of the United States as does Iran,' said U.S. Attorney General Merrick Garland in a statement Friday. 'We will not stand for the Iranian regime's attempts to endanger the American people and America's national security,' he added. U.S. officials have been especially concerned about Iran's repeated use of criminal gangs and others to carry out its dirty work ((plotting)) on American soil. Court documents allege Shakeri, an Afghan national who immigrated to the U.S. as a child, fits the description. The documents say Shakeri was deported from the U.S. in 2008, after spending 14 years in prison for robbery. But they add that during his time behind bars, Shakeri cultivated a network of criminal associates that he then would use in efforts to carry out Iran's orders. According to prosecutors, one of those associates was working with Shakeri up until the U.S. election to kill VOA Persian Service journalist Masih Alinejad, described in the court documents as 'an Iranian American journalist, author, and political activist, and an outspoken critic of the Iranian regime's human rights abuses and corruption.' The associate, 49-year-old Carlisle Rivera, then turned to one of his acquaintances, 36-year-old Jonathan Loadholt, to carry out the attack for a sum of $100,000. Rivera and Loadholt were arrested Thursday. Shakeri, Rivera and Loadholt are charged with murder-for-hire, conspiracy to commit murder-for-hire and money laundering conspiracy. The charges carry maximum prison sentences of 10 to 20 years. Shakeri is also charged with providing and conspiring to provide material support to a foreign terrorist organization. Alinejad on Friday expressed astonishment that she was wrapped up in the plot to kill the president-elect. 'I am shocked,' she wrote on the X social media platform. '[T]he person assigned to assassinate @realDonaldTrump was also assigned to kill me on U.S. soil.' 'I came to America to practice my First Amendment right to freedom of speech — I don't want to die,' she said. 'Thank you to law enforcement for protecting me.' Last month, U.S. prosecutors charged a senior IRGC official in connection with a failed assassination attempt against Alinejad in 2022.	https://www.voanews.com/a/us-exposes-iranian-directed-network-plotting-trump-assassination-/7857477.html	2024-11-08T12:33:55-08:00	
US law enforcement investigates racist texts targeting Black Americans	WASHINGTON — Federal and state authorities are investigating racist text messages sent anonymously to Black Americans across the country this week telling them they should be enslaved, prompting widespread condemnations as well as warnings. The NAACP civil rights group said the messages urged recipients in multiple states, including Alabama, North Carolina, Pennsylvania and Virginia, to report to a plantation to pick cotton, an offensive reference to past enslavement of Black people in the United States. It remained unclear what individuals or entities were behind the reported texts or how many people received them. People in at least 21 states, including high school and college students, received the texts, CNN and The Associated Press reported. 'These actions are not normal. And we refuse to let them be normalized,' NAACP President Derrick Johnson said in a statement from the civil rights organization, which advocates for racial justice and rights for Black Americans. 'These messages represent an alarming increase in vile and abhorrent rhetoric from racist groups across the country,' he said. Many in Black American communities say they anticipate a rollback of civil rights after Republican Donald Trump, who won Tuesday's presidential election over Democrat Kamala Harris, takes office on January 20. Trump pledged during his campaign to end federal diversity and inclusion programs. 'President Trump’s campaign has absolutely nothing to do with these text messages,' his spokesperson Karoline Leavitt said in a statement on Friday. An exit poll conducted by Edison Research on Election Day showed Harris winning 85% of the Black vote nationwide while Trump won 13%, up 1 percentage point from an exit poll in 2020 when he lost the presidential election to Joe Biden. 'We strongly condemn these hateful messages and anyone targeting Americans based on their ethnicity or background,' Robyn Patterson, a White House spokesperson for Biden, said in a statement on Friday confirming the investigations. 'Racism has no place in our country. Period.' The Federal Communications Commission said on Friday its enforcement bureau is among those probing the incidents. TextNow said one or more accounts on its messaging service sent offending messages and were shut down within an hour, adding that the texts were sent across multiple carriers nationwide in what it called 'an attack,' vowing to work with law enforcement. Local authorities are also investigating, with some state attorneys general urging recipients to report the messages to their civil rights divisions. Some school districts issued warnings and urged students and parents to report any such texts received to school staff or local authorities.	https://www.voanews.com/a/us-law-enforcement-investigates-racist-texts-targeting-black-americans/7857466.html	2024-11-08T12:31:44-08:00	
China backs Myanmar military amid growing border tensions	WASHINGTON — As clashes escalate along Myanmar’s northern border, Chinese Premier Li Qiang this week reaffirmed Beijing's support for Myanmar’s military leader, Senior General Min Aung Hlaing. The comment came Wednesday following a sideline meeting with the embattled junta leader at the November 6-7 Greater Mekong Subregion Summit in Kunming, in China’s southern Yunan province, according to a Chinese Foreign Affairs Ministry statement issued the same day. During the meeting, Li pledged China’s commitment to regional stability, stressing the importance of trade and border security, even as key crossings remain closed because of heightened conflict. He assured Myanmar of China’s support for 'a development path suited to its national conditions,' promising 'ongoing cooperation to advance Myanmar’s political reconciliation and transformation,' according to the statement. The statement went on to say that Li had 'underscored China’s commitment to the China-Myanmar Economic Corridor under the Belt and Road Initiative,' viewing it as a key project for both nations. The so-called CMEC links the Chinese province of Yunnan with economic hubs in Myanmar and give China access to the India Ocean through a series of infrastructure projects. In the meeting, Li 'expressed his hope that Myanmar would ensure the security of Chinese personnel, institutions and projects' within its borders, while calling for greater cooperation in combating cross-border problems such as online gambling and telecom fraud. Min Aung Hlaing, in turn, expressed gratitude, the Foreign Ministry stated, for China’s assistance in development, pledging to 'protect Chinese investments within Myanmar' as both countries approach the 75th anniversary of diplomatic relations. Opposition criticizes visit to China Myanmar’s opposition National Unity Government has expressed concern over Min Aung Hlaing’s visit to China, describing it as an attempt by the military regime to gain legitimacy and financial support. Speaking to VOA by phone on Wednesday, Kyaw Zaw, spokesperson for the NUG President’s Office, described the visit as 'an effort to secure recognition and economic support for a regime that lacks legitimacy.' He further stated that Min Aung Hlaing has 'hindered Myanmar’s progress and stability,' attributing recent economic struggles to the junta’s actions. The NUG called on China to reconsider its engagement with the junta, with Kyaw Zaw saying that 'backing this regime could pose risks to regional stability and negatively impact civilians who rely on cross-border trade for their livelihoods.' China’s strategic calculations Myanmar analyst and former Communist Party of Burma member Than Soe Naing discussed China’s relationship with Myanmar’s junta by phone with VOA on Wednesday. 'China never directly blamed Min Aung Hlaing for the coup,' he said, although Beijing saw the arrests of Aung San Suu Kyi, the de facto leader of Myanmar’s ousted civilian government, and the dissolution of her National League for Democracy party as missteps. 'Min Aung Hlaing has mishandled the military, politics and economy,' prompting China to explore alternatives. In June, China invited the leader of an earlier Myanmar military government, General Thein Sein, to an event with Xi Jinping and Foreign Minister Wang Yi, sparking speculation that China might see Thein Sein as the leader of a future transitional government. Regional analysts described the invitation as a strategic signal. Thein Sein presided over earlier reforms and peacefully handed over power to Aung San Suu Kyi's National League for Democracy, or NLD, after a 2015 election. He is seen as a figure who might be trusted to lead a potential transitional government if Myanmar moves toward reconciliation. However, Min Aung Hlaing’s invitation to the Mekong Summit signals China’s current backing, given his influence and control of the military, Than Soe Naing said. 'China acknowledges Min Aung Hlaing’s support within the military,' he said, 'while Aung San Suu Kyi lacks armed backing. Inviting him to Yunnan, not Beijing, allows China to show international goodwill from a neutral location.' While Aung San Suu Kyi is currently in jail and lacks the formal support of the military, revolutionary forces who are aligned with the NUG support her. Support for infrastructure Intense battles in northern Shan state involving the Three Brotherhood Alliance — a coalition of ethnic armed groups made up of the Myanmar National Democratic Alliance Army, the Ta’ang National Liberation Army and the Arakan Army — are now spreading toward central Myanmar, revealing Min Aung Hlaing’s weakened control, he said. 'China sees an opportunity to influence the military by supporting it,' Than Soe Naing said, 'believing this strengthens its strategic ally.' He also noted China’s economic interests, including the Myitsone dam project in Kachin State, suspended in 2010. 'If talks succeed, Min Aung Hlaing may be invited to Beijing,' linking China’s support for the junta to advancing key infrastructure projects. The Three Brotherhood Alliance has been the strongest force against the junta. Last year, these groups launched Operation 1027, a coordinated offensive aimed at junta forces in northern Myanmar, which borders China, on October 27. China has increasingly assumed the role of mediator, facilitating a series of cease-fire meetings between the junta and the Three Brotherhood Alliance in Kunming — a move underscoring Beijing’s vested interest in regional stability and the security of its cross-border trade routes. However, these efforts have so far been unsuccessful and fighting in the region has escalated. China’s border trade restrictions China, long critical of Western sanctions, has imposed restrictions along the border, cutting off vital supplies such as food and medicine. Analysts believe the move aims to pressure the armed resistance groups while securing China’s regional interests. Border crossings into northern Shan and Kachin states — areas heavily influenced by opposition ethnic groups — have been closed, stalling trade. While Beijing has not publicly explained the closures, Chinese media have cited security concerns around key infrastructure, including the China-Myanmar oil pipeline. Observers see this as a calculated Chinese effort to weaken resistance forces and strengthen the Myanmar junta. Ta’ang National Liberation Army spokesperson Lway Yay Oo confirmed to VOA by phone that China’s trade restrictions have cut supplies to the TNLA and other allied ethnic armed groups. 'Border trade is still banned,' she said, adding that 'only food and clothing' have been allowed into Myanmar since October 25. Restrictions now also block goods from reaching areas controlled by the United Wa State Army, another armed ethnic group, and the Myanmar National Democratic Alliance Army, leading to shortages, particularly of medicine. When asked about China’s motive, she stated, 'China is pressuring us to halt military operations.' To support affected areas, she said, 'We’re providing tax exemptions on food, fuel and construction materials.' Although fighting has paused, Lway Yay Oo refused to say whether this is due to China’s pressure. 'Airstrikes by the junta are still ongoing,' she said, adding that China has not responded to calls for humanitarian aid. Analyst Than Soe Naing said China wants the Myanmar National Democratic Alliance 'to pull back and allow junta forces to reestablish control.' Kyaw Zaw, spokesperson for the NUG President Office, said 'Myanmar’s instability stems from the military’s violent actions that disrupt economic growth,' warning that restrictive border policies could significantly affect civilians dependent on cross-border trade.	https://www.voanews.com/a/china-backs-myanmar-military-amid-growing-border-tensions/7857417.html	2024-11-08T11:50:57-08:00	
Chad says airstrikes kill scores of Boko Haram fighters	YAOUNDE, CAMEROON — Chadian military airstrikes killed scores of Boko Haram fighters and injured several dozen more in the Lake Chad Basin, President Mahamat Idriss Deby said Friday. Chad planned the operation against the Islamist militant group after Boko Haram fighters killed 40 Chadian soldiers in an attack on a military garrison last month. About 700 Chadian soldiers celebrated as air force fliers returned to Kaiga Kindira, an island in the Lake Chad Basin near the border with Nigeria. Top military officials and Deby were there to greet them. Deby said he was happy because Haskinite, an operation he launched to search for and eliminate Boko Haram members hiding in the Lake Chad Basin, had begun successfully with the strikes carried out Thursday night into Friday. Military officials said the air attacks targeted five Boko Haram hideouts but did not identify locations. Deby said he also has ordered close to 1,000 infantry and navy troops to eliminate Boko Haram fighters and protect civilians, who are constantly harassed, raped, maimed and killed by militants in the Lake Chad area. Military officials said soldiers have seized many weapons and destroyed boats used by Boko Haram fighters to attack civilians and government troops. Deby said the attacks on Boko Haram will continue until the group is eradicated. Deby, who spoke on state TV, has been in areas of the Lake Chad Basin — shared by Cameroon, Nigeria, Niger and Chad — since October 28, when Boko Haram fighters attacked a military garrison, killing 40 soldiers and injuring scores of others, on the island of Bakaram, near the border with Nigeria. Chad's government called on its citizens to support the ongoing operation by reporting strangers to soldiers, government officials and traditional rulers. Passale Kanabe Marcellin, Chad's water and sanitation minister, told officials at the Lake Chad Basin Commission meeting in N’djamena on Friday he is happy villagers who live in fear of Boko Haram are assisting government troops by contributing food, water, first aid equipment and money. He said Deby wants all countries of the Lake Chad Basin Commission to assist Chadian troops fighting Boko Haram by allowing soldiers to cross into Cameroon, Nigeria and Niger in pursuit of the militants. Boko Haram launched an insurgency against the Nigerian government in 2009. Fighting spread into Cameroon, Chad and Niger, where the militants established bases and hideouts. The United Nations says the fighting has killed more than 40,000 people and displaced over 3 million.	https://www.voanews.com/a/chad-says-airstrikes-kill-scores-of-boko-haram-fighters/7857361.html	2024-11-08T11:32:08-08:00	
Israel rejects UN atrocity accusations in Gaza	Geneva — A report by the United Nations human rights office, which accuses Israel Defense Forces of committing grave violations of international law in Gaza, many of which could amount to war crimes, has been met with a rebuke from Israel. 'The State of Israel categorically rejects the recent update report by the Office of the High Commissioner for Human Rights on the situation in the Gaza Strip,' said a statement issued by the Israeli mission in Geneva on Friday. 'OHCHR fails to accurately reflect the realities on the ground, and disregards the extensive role of Hamas and other terrorist organizations in deliberately causing civilian harm in Gaza,' it says. The U.N. report details 'the horrific reality' that has unfolded for the people of Israel and Gaza from November 2023 to April 2024, following the brutal attack on Oct. 7, 2023, by Hamas militants in Israel, who killed 1,200 people and took 250 hostages. 'I have repeatedly warned about the risk of atrocity crimes being committed,' Volker Türk, U.N. high commissioner for human rights, said in a statement to coincide with the publication of the report Friday. 'The rules of war, in force now for 160 years, were designed to limit and prevent human suffering in times of armed conflict,' it said. 'It seems inconceivable that the parties to the conflict refuse to apply universally accepted and binding norms developed to preserve the very bare minimum of humanity.' While the report examines and documents breaches of international law committed by both parties to the conflict, it focuses largely on the many violations resulting from the punishing attacks inflicted by Israeli forces upon the Palestinian people and on the widescale destruction of civilian infrastructure in the Gaza Strip. According to the report, 'Civilians, including children, women and men, have borne the brunt of the attacks, through the complete siege, and the various forms of continuing closure and blockade by the IDF of Gaza.' It accuses the Israeli government of failing to ensure, and even blocking, entry of humanitarian aid into the Palestinian enclave, of destroying civilian infrastructure, and of repeated mass displacement of the population. The report says that has led to 'unprecedented levels of killings, death, injury, starvation, illness, disease, displacement, detention and destruction.' It finds Palestinian armed groups also have conducted hostilities in ways that have harmed civilians, noting the abuse of remaining Israeli hostages and projectiles that are indiscriminately fired into Israel. 'In many instances, the violations documented in this report by the parties could amount to war crimes,' it says. 'If committed as part of a widespread or systematic attack directed against a civilian population, further to a state or organizational policy, they may constitute crimes against humanity.' The report expresses concern about the forcible transfer of Palestinians, attacks on so-called safe zones as well as on hospitals 'in apparent systematic fashion.' It condemns the killings of medical staff, humanitarian workers, civil police and journalists and the reported use of white phosphorus munitions in densely populated areas. 'Our monitoring indicates that this unprecedented level of killing and injury of civilians is a direct consequence of the failure to comply with fundamental principles of international humanitarian law — namely the principles of distinction, proportionality and precautions in attack,' said Türk. 'Tragically these documented patterns of violations continue unabated, over one year after the start of the war.' Speaking on a video link in Amman, Jordan, Ajith Sunghay, the head of the U.N. human rights office for the Occupied Palestinian Territory, told journalists in Geneva that his office continues to monitor 'with grave concern' the situation in Gaza. 'Israel's conduct of hostilities has destroyed Gaza civilian infrastructure, its homes, hospitals and schools, its electricity, water and sewage systems,' he said. 'Within this dystopia of destruction and devastation, those alive are left injured, displaced and starving. 'We have been verifying the personal details of those killed in Gaza by strikes, shelling and other conduct of hostilities,' he added. 'Of those fatalities, we have so far found close to 70% to be children and women, indicating a systematic violation of the fundamental principles of international humanitarian law, including distinction and proportionality.' Israel's counteroffensive in Gaza has killed more than 43,300 Palestinians, according to the territory's Hamas-run health ministry, which does not distinguish between combatants and civilians in its count. Because of a lack of access to the enclave, Sunghay said his sources in Gaza have been able to verify only about 10,000 fatalities, including 4,700 children. He said that the figures provided by the Ministry of Health have matched those of the OHCHR and 'there was no reason to believe that it is any different now.' He explained that verifying 10,000 casualties with details on how they had perished 'was already a remarkable achievement under the current dire circumstances.' The Israeli mission did not find this explanation persuasive. 'By relying on unverified information, often promoted by Hamas or other entities known for manipulating narratives, the report severely compromises its objectivity and credibility and is indicative of the politically driven nature of this initiative.' Daniel Meron, Israel's ambassador to the U.N. in Geneva, accused the OHCHR of hand-picking facts, of advancing a distorted narrative of a tragic conflict, and of 'shielding a ruthless terrorist adversary that actively seeks to maximize civilian harm.' Israel has frequently accused Hamas of using the civilian population as human shields by placing military installations in hospitals, schools and densely populated areas. 'The outcome is emboldening Palestinian terrorism, and violence against Israelis and Jews around the world,' Meron said. U.N. human rights chief Türk said justice must be served for the grave violations of international law that have been committed in Israel and Gaza. 'It is essential that there is due reckoning with respect to the allegations of serious violations of international law through credible and impartial judicial bodies and that, in the meantime, all relevant information and evidence are collected and preserved,' he said. 'The violence must stop immediately; the hostages and those arbitrarily detained must be released, and we must focus on flooding Gaza with humanitarian aid.	https://www.voanews.com/a/israel-rejects-un-atrocity-accusations-in-gaza/7857377.html	2024-11-08T11:24:28-08:00	
Israel to open new Gaza humanitarian aid crossing	Israel says it is opening a new humanitarian aid crossing into the Gaza Strip amid mounting U.S. pressure to get more assistance to Palestinians struggling with shortages of food and shelter since the Israel-Hamas war began. In a joint statement Friday, the Israel Defense Forces and COGAT, the agency coordinating Israeli government activities in occupied territories, said they are preparing to open the Kissufim crossing. The statement, released on social media account X, said the IDF and COGAT were acting 'in accordance with the directive from the political echelon and as part of the effort to increase the volume and routes of aid to Gaza.' The statement said the IDF had built inspection facilities and protective infrastructure at the Kissufim crossing, and paved roads both in Israeli territory and within Gaza to allow the transfer of aid to the southern part of Gaza. Kissufim is a small border crossing into southern Gaza near Kibbutz Kissufim, one of the sites attacked by Hamas in its Oct. 7, 2023, terror assault on Israel that sparked the war. Hamas and Hezbollah in Lebanon have been designated as terror groups by the United States, the U.K. and other Western countries. The crossing has mostly been unused except by the military since Israel withdrew from Gaza in 2005. The opening comes as a deadline set by U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken and U.S. Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin draws near. In a letter delivered Oct. 13, Austin and Blinken gave the Israelis 30 days to boost its humanitarian aid to Palestinians in Gaza or face the possibility of cuts in U.S. military aid. The letter called for Israel to enable a minimum of 350 trucks a day to enter Gaza through four crossings and to open a fifth humanitarian entry point. During a U.S. State Department briefing Thursday, spokesman Mathew Miller mentioned the new crossing as he listed efforts Israel has taken to meet the demands made in the letter. Miller said that included efforts to stop looting from humanitarian trucks and an expansion of the Mawasi humanitarian area within Gaza. Miller said U.S. officials have seen as many as 229 humanitarian trucks enter Gaza two days ago, which he described as an improvement. As the Biden administration has just over two months left, it is unclear what will happen with the Biden-Austin demands, and Miller said he would not speculate on that. He did say that the U.S. has made clear 'there are potential legal and policy considerations' if Israel fails to improve humanitarian assistance to Gaza and implement steps outlined in the letter. Miller said there have been active discussions with Israel as recently as the past several days, and an assessment will be made at the end of the 30-day period laid out in the letter. At a briefing Friday at U.N. headquarters in New York, U.N. spokeswoman Stephanie Tremblay, citing a new report from the Integrated Food Security Phase Classification, said the situation in Gaza is extremely grave and rapidly deteriorating. The report said there is a strong likelihood that famine is imminent in areas within the northern Gaza Strip. Tremblay said, 'immediate action — within days not weeks — is required from all actors who are directly taking part in the conflict, or have influence on its conduct, to avert and alleviate this catastrophic situation.' Tremblay also updated the situation in the West Bank, citing a report from the U.N. Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs, or OCHA, which said multiple Israeli military operations in the north this week included airstrikes and other lethal war-like tactics, which appear to exceed law enforcement standards. The spokeswoman said initial information indicated eight Palestinians were killed and four others injured during Tuesday’s operations in Jenin, Tubas and Tulkarm. OCHA reports that between Oct. 29 and Nov. 4, Israel settlers carried out 35 attacks against Palestinians that caused casualties or property damage, including to olive trees that were vandalized. Since the beginning of October, OCHA has documented 177 settler incidents directly related to the olive harvest in 73 communities across the West Bank, most of which caused casualties or property damage. Also Friday, the United Nations Interim Force in Lebanon, or UNIFIL, issued a statement saying the IDF used two excavators and a bulldozer to destroy part of a fence and a concrete structure at a UNIFIL position in Ras Naqoura. In a statement posted to its X account, UNIFIL said the IDF responded to their protest by denying any activity was taking place inside the UNIFIL position. The UNIFIL statement went on to say the 'deliberate and direct destruction of clearly identifiable UNIFIL property is a flagrant violation of international law and resolution 1701.' In its own statement Friday, the IDF said it discovered and dismantled what it said was a Hezbollah terrorist training center located 200 meters from an UNIFIL post. They said the compound was 'used by terrorists for training, studying, and storing large quantities of weapons.' On its website, the IDF released pictures and videos of weapons and other materials it said it confiscated from the location. It did not identify the location of what it called the Hezbollah training center or the adjacent UNIFIL post and it was unclear if it was near the Ras Naqoura position.

US military reports drone crash in Somalia	The U.S. military says it is investigating what caused an army drone to crash in southern Somalia this week. The military's Africa Command, known as AFRICOM, confirmed the incident in a post Friday on social media platform X. 'A U.S. Army operated MQ-1C crashed in southern Somalia at approximately 12:40 PM local on Nov. 5,' AFRICOM said. 'An investigation is ongoing, although the crash does not appear to be the result of any attempt to shoot down the aircraft.' AFRICOM said it will release more information as it becomes available. AFRICOM did not disclose the exact location of the crash, but a Somali official said he was told a drone crashed in an area controlled by the al-Shabab militant group. Mohamed Ibrahim Barre, the governor of Lower Shabelle, told the VOA Horn of Africa Service that the drone crashed north of Farsoley village, in Lower Shabelle, about 85 kilometers west of Mogadishu. Barre said he did not know who the drone belongs to. The U.S. military has conducted surveillance and airstrikes against al-Shabab for years in support of successive Somali administrations. In addition, the U.S. also trains an elite Somali commando unit known as Danab, or lightning. Earlier this year, U.S. and Somalia have signed a memorandum of understanding (MoU) for the construction of up to five military bases for the Danab Brigade, in a project valued at over $100 million. This story originated in VOA's Horn of Africa Service.	https://www.voanews.com/a/us-military-reports-drone-crash-in-somalia-/7857327.html	2024-11-08T10:47:53-08:00	
Security analysts concerned as Nigeria warns of new terror group	Abuja, Nigeria — Nigerian security analysts are voicing concerns after defense officials on Thursday warned of a new insurgent group known as the Lakurawas, operating mainly in the country's northwestern region. Authorities said the group originated from the Sahel region, particularly Mali and Niger, after last July's coup in Niger disrupted joint military patrols along the Nigerian border. Nigerian defense officials announced the discovery to journalists in Abuja on Thursday and called for heightened vigilance. Major General Edward Buba, the defense spokesperson, did not provide details on whether the group had carried out any major attack, but local media report the group has been collecting cows from locals in exchange for 'protection.' The tactic is commonly used by extremist groups to exert control and finance their operations. Lakurawas infiltrated northwest Sokoto and Kebbi states from neighboring Niger and Mali following last year's coup, which severed ties between Nigeria and Niger and disrupted joint regional security patrols. Buba said security forces are tracking the group's activities. 'It is, indeed, the first attempt of the Sahelian jihadists to have a foothold in our country. They were kept at bay all this while, when we had joint cross-border operations with the Republic of Niger. They took advantage of the breakdown in cooperation between both countries, which has now been restored. We know exactly where they are,' Buba said. The ideology of the new group is not yet known. However, its emergence signals a growing threat in northwest Nigeria, already challenged by attacks by armed gangs and kidnappings for ransom. Nigeria has been struggling with prolonged insurgency by Boko Haram — a group opposed to western education in northern Nigeria. In October, Nigeria’s military said it killed some 160 insurgents, arrested more than 80 and freed scores of captives. Security analyst Senator Iroegbu said he is worried but not surprised by news of the new group, given that regional bloc ECOWAS, chaired by Nigeria's president, sanctioned Niger after the coup last year. 'We saw this coming when the Niger coup happened, especially withdrawal from ECOWAS membership,' Iroegbu said. 'Severing ties with ECOWAS does not mean that we should not have bilateral agreements intact. Even if we sever the relationship in other [levels] ... maybe at the diplomatic level, but at the security or intelligence level [it] should not be something that we should play with.' Iroegbu said the group’s emergence is going to have a negative impact on Nigeria's security. 'We should not downplay the significance of this thing. It's going to drain the scarce resources we have already. All the security, bilateral agreement, intelligence corporation, security corporation should be strengthened even more,' Iroegbu said. In August, Nigeria's chief of defense staff visited Niger in a bid to strengthen military ties and regional security. Buba said authorities and security forces are working to address the issue and protect citizens from the Lakurawas group.	https://www.voanews.com/a/security-analysts-concerned-as-nigeria-warns-of-new-terror-group/7857317.html	2024-11-08T10:46:25-08:00	
China's forays in disputed sea ups tensions as Indonesian leader visits Beijing	JAKARTA, INDONESIA — Indonesian President Prabowo Subianto is in Beijing Friday for his first official visit to China, where he is expected to meet with President Xi Jinping and Premier Li Qiang. Experts say he hopes to maintain the personal rapport with the Chinese leaders established by his predecessor, Joko 'Jokowi' Widodo. 'Presumably, he will be leaning more toward Beijing for economic purposes since Prabowo has ambitious plans for achieving 8% economic growth,' Aristyo Darmawan, a lecturer in international law at Universitas Indonesia, told VOA. However, Darmawan voiced concern about reports that Prabowo has proposed to collaborate with China on oil exploration in the North Natuna Sea, a portion of the South China Sea that has long been controlled by Indonesia and lies within its Exclusive Economic Zone but is claimed by China. 'I think this is unnecessary and actually dangerous for Indonesia,' he said. 'I think Prabowo is keen to have a closer relationship with Beijing, and, therefore, it might indicate how he might respond to any incursion in the North Natuna Sea.' In his inaugural speech to Parliament on October 20, Prabowo vowed to bolster the defense of Indonesian territory. The next day, Indonesia’s Maritime Security Agency drove a Chinese coast guard ship away from a contested area in the North Natuna Sea. The same ship returned on October 24 and 25, disrupting a survey being conducted by Indonesia’s state-owned oil company, Pertamina. The three intrusions, coming within a week during Prabowo’s first days in office, prompting questions about Beijing’s motives. Past territorial disputes Confrontations have dated back for years in the region, which is believed to hold huge, unexploited oil and gas deposits. These prompted then-President Widodo to hold a Cabinet meeting aboard a warship off the Natuna islands in 2016 to assert Indonesia’s sovereignty. In December 2020, Widodo again visited the Natuna islands amid a stand-off between Indonesian warships and Chinese coast guard vessels escorting 60 fishing boats. Afterward, Indonesia deployed fighter jets and warships to patrol the waters, and it sent a diplomatic note to the Chinese ambassador to Indonesia. One year later, China demanded that Indonesia stop drilling for oil and natural gas in the sea. A letter from Chinese diplomats to Indonesia’s Foreign Ministry claimed that a temporary offshore rig operated by Indonesia was in Chinese territory. In 2023, a Chinese coast guard ship escorted a Chinese research ship without permission into North Natuna waters to carry out exploration activities. Better monitoring Ario Seno, a researcher at the Indonesian Maritime Security agency, said Indonesia does not have enough manpower and patrol boats to monitor the vast area effectively. This makes it hard to catch trespassing fishing boats or coast guard ships in a timely manner. To address the problem, the agency is developing a monitoring system using buoys equipped with radar, long-distance surveillance cameras and sonar, which will be connected to its satellite system and the agency’s base. 'Our patrol boats will be able to focus on enforcing the law, so we don't have to often patrol around in circles and then find nothing. With the existence of these floating surveillance tools, violations can be immediately detected, and the available patrol boats can immediately take action,' Ario said. Indonesian authorities say the proposed system could be ready by 2026 and will provide major savings in surveillance costs. China’s lukewarm response During an October 24 press conference, Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesperson Lin Jian defended China’s behavior in North Natuna, insisting the waters belonged to his country even though Beijing’s expansive claims to the South China Sea have been rejected by an international tribunal. 'China’s coast guard vessel carries out routine patrols in waters under the jurisdiction of China in accordance with international law and China’s domestic laws,' Lin said. 'China stands ready to enhance communication and consultation with Indonesia through diplomatic channels and properly handle maritime issues between the two countries.' A week later, Indonesia’s Foreign Ministry spokesperson, Rolliansyah 'Roy' Soemirat, said Indonesia’s position on the contested waters 'remains unchanged.' 'We continue to have dialogue behind the scenes and other diplomatic efforts to address this issue proportionally with other countries,' he said, adding that Indonesia was in the process of seeking confirmation and exchanging 'the most factual' information with the related parties. Aristyo, the Universitas Indonesia lecturer, said Indonesia should be careful in its talks with China to ensure that Indonesia is treating the issue seriously. He said that in the past, Prabowo has sent mixed signals regarding the territorial dispute. It’s too early to judge how he will respond as president, but there are expectations he will defend Indonesia’s sovereign waters more forcefully.	https://www.voanews.com/a/china-s-forays-in-disputed-sea-ups-tensions-as-indonesian-leader-visits-beijing/7857240.html	2024-11-08T10:10:44-08:00	
Trump’s victory: Ukraine braces for policy shifts amid war	With former President Donald Trump returning to the White House, Ukrainians are bracing for potential shifts in U.S. policy that could reshape its fight for survival against Russian aggression. Trump’s agenda could take a sharp turn from the Biden administration's unwavering support, raising fears that vital U.S. aid might be at risk. Myroslava Gongadze reports from Europe. Camera: Vladyslav Smilianets	https://www.voanews.com/a/trump-s-victory-ukraine-braces-for-policy-shifts-amid-war-/7857027.html	2024-11-08T07:15:09-08:00	
India optimistic about Trump presidency, worried about trade, tariffs	NEW DELHI — As India looks ahead to President-elect Donald Trump taking charge in Washington, there is optimism the strategic relationship built by the two countries in recent years will strengthen. India also hopes to benefit if Trump takes a less confrontational approach to Russia, say analysts. New Delhi also is bracing for turbulence in trade ties, though, which could be affected by Trump’s 'America first' agenda. In his congratulatory message posted on social media platform X, Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi called Trump 'my friend' and said, 'I look forward to renewing our collaboration to further strengthen the India-U.S. Comprehensive Global and Strategic Partnership.' Modi shared photos of the two leaders hugging and Trump’s visit to India during his first term in 2020 — a time when Trump shared warm relations with Modi. Analysts in New Delhi expect that India will remain a key partner for Washington. 'Compared to most other countries, particularly some of the USA’s closest partners, perhaps India is better placed because of its centrality in the Indo-Pacific and the role it plays in counterbalancing China,' said Harsh Pant, vice president for studies and foreign policy at the Observer Research Foundation in New Delhi. 'Given that Trump had invested in this partnership in his earlier term, there is hope it will continue the same trajectory,' he said. The Quad group — a partnership among the United States, Japan, Australia and India, which had been dormant earlier — was revived under the previous Trump administration with an eye on China. However, a sense of uncertainty lingers in the corridors of power in New Delhi. 'The relationship may face hiccups, which we cannot anticipate at the moment given Trump’s leadership style and unpredictability,' said Pant. India also hopes that confrontation between the U.S. and Russia will lessen under the Trump administration. During the campaign, Trump had said he would end the Russia-Ukraine war without elaborating. In the past he has spoken of having a good relationship with Russian President Vladimir Putin. 'If U.S. hostility to Russia lessens under Trump, we believe that it would reduce the extreme and overwhelming Russian dependence on China, which is good from India’s perspective,' according to Sreeram Chaulia, dean at the Jindal School of International Affairs at O.P. Jindal Global University. Despite a recent thaw in ties with China, India remains wary of Beijing. Others point out that maintaining India’s time-tested ties with Russia could become easier under a Trump presidency. India refused to join Western sanctions against Russia or condemn the war in Ukraine, positions that became an irritant in Washington. 'Trump appears to have a less strident approach to Russia, and that will help India by making it simpler to balance relations between Washington and Russia,' said Anand Kumar, associate fellow at the Manohar Parrikar Institute for Defense Studies and Analyses in New Delhi. 'Tariff king' While security ties will likely stay on track, there are worries over whether trade relations will take a hit under Trump, who has said he will follow an 'America first' agenda and impose tariffs on countries that have trade surpluses with Washington. The U.S. is India’s largest trading partner — two-way trade last year totaled almost $120 billion, with a surplus of $30 billion in India’s favor. During his previous term, Trump called India a 'tariff king,' criticized high duties that New Delhi imposed on American products such as Harley-Davidson motorcycles, and terminated India’s designation as a developing nation that had allowed businesses to export hundreds of products duty-free to the United States. India retaliated by raising duties on some American products. Such tensions could be exacerbated because Trump is likely to push New Delhi to lower import duties for American companies. 'This will be a slippery slope for India; he could demand market concessions,' said Chaulia. Indian officials, however, have sounded an optimistic note. 'There was already a reordering of the supply chains taking place. It is very likely that in view of the [U.S.] election results, this would accelerate. Some of it will be disruptive, but we in India see it as an opportunity,' Indian Foreign Minister Jaishankar Subrahmanyan told business leaders in Australia on Thursday. He was referring to the trend of companies such as Apple setting up manufacturing bases in India as they looked to diversify production from China. But analysts say Trump could take a diametrically different approach. 'He has this philosophy of onshoring, that is bringing manufacturing back to the U.S. rather than friendshoring which Biden used to talk about — that is encouraging businesses to move to friendly countries. So, the overall idea that U.S. businesses that are leaving China would think of India as an alternative — that model Trump may not encourage,' said Chaulia. Defense and technology There also are questions about how the defense and technology cooperation between India and the U.S. that gained momentum under the Biden administration will move forward. India has pushed for co-production of defense technology rather than relying solely on direct purchases of military equipment; sustaining that under Trump may pose a challenge, according to analysts. 'The U.S. has operated under the assumption that boosting India’s capabilities is in America’s self-interest, especially in balancing China. But Trump is likely to demand some Indian ‘pro’ for American ‘quid,’' analyst C. Raja Mohan wrote in the Indian Express newspaper on Thursday. 'India may find itself on a steep learning curve as it figures out there may be no ‘free lunch’ under Trump’s second term,' Mohan wrote. Still, as India prepares to navigate a Trump presidency, there is an overall sense of confidence. 'I don’t think India is as worried as some other world capitals. New Delhi understands that if Trump’s obsession with China continues, that gives India greater space to maneuver,' said Pant.	https://www.voanews.com/a/india-optimistic-about-trump-presidency-worried-about-trade-tariffs/7856987.html	2024-11-08T06:54:43-08:00	
China approves $840B plan to refinance local government debt, boost slowing economy	BEIJING — China on Friday approved a 6 trillion yuan ($839 billion) plan to help local governments refinance their mountains of debt, in the latest push to rev up growth in the world's second largest economy. The plan will be implemented over the next three years, Xu Hongcai, vice-chairman of the National People's Congress's financial and economic committee, said at a news conference Friday. Finance minister Lan Fo'an estimated that the hidden debt of local governments was 14.3 trillion yuan ($2 trillion) at the end of 2023. Hidden debt refers to debt that has not been disclosed publicly. Lan said 2 trillion yuan would be allocated each year from 2024 to 2026 to help local governments resolve their debts. He estimated that the amount of hidden debt will drop to 2.3 trillion yuan ($320.9 billion) by the end of 2028. Officials also said Friday that the ceiling to issue special bonds will be raised to 35.52 trillion yuan ($4.96 billion) from 29.52 trillion yuan ($4.12 billion) for local governments. Lan said that the implementation of such a large-scale replacement measure indicates a 'fundamental shift' in China's approach to debt restructuring and said that China's government debt risk was 'controllable.' Analysts have called for bold, multi-trillion-yuan measures to reinvigorate the world's second largest economy, which has yet to bounce back fully from the COVID-19 pandemic. Local government debts have ballooned partly due to high spending and low tax revenues during the pandemic, but also due to a downturn in the property industry, since sales of land use rights, a key source of local government revenue, have sagged. The central bank loosened restrictions on borrowing in late September, sparking a stock market rally, but economists say the government needs to do more to ignite a sustained recovery. Government officials have indicated that could come at this week's meeting of the Standing Committee of the National People's Congress, which must give official approval to any new spending. The economy has shown signs of life in the past two months. Purchase subsidies offered to people who trade in old cars or appliances for new ones helped auto sales rebound in September. A survey of manufacturers turned positive in October after five straight months of decline, and exports surged 12.7% last month, the largest increase in more than two years. For most of the year, the ruling Communist Party appeared more focused on addressing long-term structural issues with the economy rather than short-term ones. Previous steps to boost the economy were piecemeal, seemingly aimed at keeping the economy afloat rather than sparking a robust recovery. In recent weeks, the party has signaled a growing concern about the economy's sluggishness as it tries to meet its goal of achieving growth of around 5% this year. The central bank's monetary easing was followed by government pronouncements that it still has ample funds to pump into the economy. Still, the longer-term goals of transforming China into a high-tech and green energy economy seem likely to remain the chief aims of the Communist Party, which doesn't face election pressures like the ones that toppled the Democrats and swept Donald Trump's Republicans to power in America this week.	https://www.voanews.com/a/china-approves-840b-plan-to-refinance-local-government-debt-boost-slowing-economy-/7856983.html	2024-11-08T06:39:28-08:00	
Ready or not? How China scrambled to counter the second Trump shock	BEIJING/HONG KONG — After Donald Trump first stormed the White House eight years ago, rattled Chinese leaders responded to his tariffs and fiery rhetoric with force, resulting in a trade war that plunged ties between the globe's largest economies to multiyear lows. This time around, Beijing has been preparing for Trump's return by deepening ties with allies, boosting self-reliance in tech, and setting aside money to prop up the economy that is now more vulnerable to fresh tariffs already threatened by Trump. While some retaliation to those moves might be unavoidable, China will focus on exploiting rifts between the U.S. and its allies, experts say, and aim to lower the temperature to help strike an early deal to cushion the blow from trade friction. Zhao Minghao, international relations expert at Shanghai's Fudan University said China probably wouldn't replay the playbook from the first Trump presidency when Beijing had a very strong reaction to Trump's moves on tariffs. He pointed out Chinese President Xi Jinping's message to Trump from Thursday, in which Xi called for 'cooperation' and not 'confrontation,' emphasizing 'stable, sound and sustainable' relations between the two superpowers. 'Trump is not a stranger to Beijing at this time,' Zhao told Reuters. 'Beijing would respond in a measured way and make efforts to communicate with the Trump team.' While Chinese tech giants are now far less reliant on U.S. imports, the economy — hit by a massive property crisis and saddled with unsustainable debt — is in a weaker position than in 2016, struggling to eke out 5% growth compared to 6.7% then. To make things worse, Trump has pledged to end China's most-favored-nation trading status and slap tariffs on Chinese imports in excess of 60% - much higher than those imposed during his first term. Fudan's Zhao said Beijing has this scenario gamed out but expects tariffs to come in below the level pledged on the campaign trail because 'that would significantly push up the inflation in the U.S.' Still, that threat alone has unnerved producers in the world's largest exporter because China sells goods worth more than $400 billion a year to the U.S. and hundreds of billions more in parts for products Americans buy elsewhere. Li Mingjiang, a scholar at the Rajaratnam School of International Studies in Singapore, said that as a result, the Chinese economy might require even more stimulus than the $1.4 trillion expected on Friday. 'It'll be a very serious blow to China's international trade that will affect jobs and government revenues,' said Li. 'China will probably have to come up with a much bigger stimulus package domestically.' Charm offensive To boost global trade, China has been on a diplomatic blitz, shoring up alliances, mending fences with foes, and continuing difficult talks with the European Union, even after the bloc imposed stiff tariffs on Chinese electric vehicles. Last month China ended a four-year military stand-off with India on their disputed border; in August, it resolved a two-year spat with Japan over the discharge of radioactive water from the Fukushima nuclear plant; and Premier Li Qiang in June visited Australia — the first such trip in seven years. Also last month, both Xi and Li attended separate summits of BRICS — which now accounts for 35% of the global economy — and the 10-state Shanghai Cooperation Organization, as China deepens ties with the Global South. 'The first Trump administration did not show a lot of interest in robust engagement in Africa, Latin America, and Southeast Asia, which provided the Chinese a lot of latitude to operate in these markets largely uncontested,' said Eric Olander, editor-in-chief of the China-Global South Project. In Europe, trade tensions with China could be counterbalanced by worries over Trump's potentially reduced role in the Ukraine war and his economic policies, creating an opening for Beijing, say some experts. 'China will carry on reaching out to Europeans, the British, the Australians and even the Japanese, not only to try to drive a wedge between the U.S. and the countries of the north,' said Jean-Pierre Cabestan, an expert at Hong Kong's Baptist University. 'But also as part of its mission to rebalance its foreign trade in favor of the Global South,' he said. Tech punchline During the first trade war, Trump banned high-tech exports to China and sanctioned companies including China's largest chipmaker SMIC, prompting its tech sector to become domestic-focused and self-sufficient. Winston Ma, a former managing director for the China Investment Corporation (CIC), China's sovereign wealth fund, said a major trigger for this shift was Trump's ban on the sale of components to Chinese telecommunications firm ZTE in 2018. That was 'really scary from a China perspective, so they began to prepare. It was the start of that sort of defensive thinking,' added Ma. Soon after, Xi urged the nation to boost self-reliance in science and tech, pushing China to build-up crucial industries including AI and space. The result: Eight years ago, China had only four government procurement projects worth over $1.4 million, replacing foreign hardware and software with domestic alternatives. That number has exploded to 169 such projects this year, data show. Despite these strides, chipmakers 'definitely feel the tightening — these Chinese companies couldn't supply to global clients and can't have access to the latest chips,' said Ma. Nazak Nikakhtar, a Commerce Department official under Trump who knows his advisers, said she expected Trump to be 'much more aggressive about export control policies towards China.' She anticipated 'a significant expansion of the entity list,' that restricts exports to those on it to capture affiliates and business partners of listed companies. Ma, the ex-CIC executive, said the restrictions will have an impact for some time as the U.S. expands the sanctions regime to overseas suppliers. 'I think the punchline is that the coming years are the most critical for this U.S.-China tech rivalry.'	https://www.voanews.com/a/ready-or-not-how-china-scrambled-to-counter-the-second-trump-shock-/7856403.html	2024-11-08T03:41:24-08:00	
China summons Philippine ambassador over new maritime laws	BEIJING/MANILA, Philippines — China summoned the Philippines' ambassador on Friday to express its objection to two new laws in the Southeast Asian nation asserting maritime rights and sovereignty over disputed areas of the South China Sea, its foreign ministry said. China made 'solemn representations' to the ambassador shortly after Philippine President Ferdinand Marcos Jr signed the Maritime Zones Act and the Archipelagic Sea Lanes Act into law to strengthen his country's maritime claims and bolster its territorial integrity. The Maritime Zones law 'illegally includes most of China's Huangyan Island and Nansha Islands and related maritime areas in the Philippines' maritime zones,' Beijing's foreign ministry spokesperson Mao Ning said, using the Chinese names for Scarborough Shoal and the Spratly Islands respectively. Beijing has rejected a 2016 ruling by The Hague-based Permanent Court of Arbitration which said its expansive maritime claims over the South China Sea had no legal basis, in a case that was brought by Manila. The United States, a Philippine ally, backs the court's ruling. Marcos said the two laws he signed, which define maritime entitlements and set designated sea lanes and air routes, were a demonstration of commitment to uphold the international rules-based order, and protect Manila's rights to exploit resources peacefully in its exclusive economic zone (EEZ). 'Our people, especially our fisher folk, should be able to pursue their livelihood free from uncertainty and harassment,' Marcos said. 'We must be able to harness mineral and energy resources in our sea bed.' But Beijing said the laws were a 'serious infringement' of its claims over the contested areas. 'China urges the Philippine side to effectively respect China's territorial sovereignty and maritime rights and interests, to immediately stop taking any unilateral actions that may lead to the widening of the dispute and complicate the situation,' Mao said. China, which also has sovereignty disputes with the other countries in the region, has in the past enacted domestic laws covering the South China Sea, such as a coast guard law in 2021 that allows it to detain foreigners suspected of trespassing. Beijing, which uses an armada of coast guard ships to assert its claims, routinely accuses vessels of trespassing in areas of the South China Sea that fall inside the EEZs of its neighbors, and has clashed repeatedly with the Philippines in the past year. Philippine officials acknowledged the challenges they face in implementing the new laws, with one author, Senator Francis Tolentino, saying he did not expect a reduction in tensions. 'China will not recognize these, but the imprimatur that we'll be getting from the international community would strengthen our position,' Tolentino told a press conference.	https://www.voanews.com/a/china-summons-philippine-ambassador-over-new-maritime-laws/7856351.html	2024-11-08T01:57:20-08:00	
Nearly 70% of Gaza war dead women and children, UN rights office says	GENEVA — The U.N. Human Rights Office said on Friday nearly 70% of the fatalities it has verified in the Gaza war were women and children, and condemned what it called a systematic violation of the fundamental principles of international humanitarian law. The U.N. count covers the first seven months of the Israel-Hamas conflict in the Gaza Strip that began more than a year ago. The 8,119 victims verified by the U.N. Rights Office in that seven-month period is considerably lower than the toll of over 43,000 provided by Palestinian health authorities for the full 13 months of conflict. But the U.N. breakdown of the victims' age and gender backs the Palestinian assertion that women and children represent a large portion of those killed in the war. This finding indicates 'a systematic violation of the fundamental principles of international humanitarian law, including distinction and proportionality,' the U.N. rights office said in a statement accompanying the 32-page report. 'It is essential that there is due reckoning with respect to the allegations of serious violations of international law through credible and impartial judicial bodies and that, in the meantime, all relevant information and evidence are collected and preserved,' United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights Volker Turk said. Israel did not immediately comment on the report's findings. Israel's military, which began its offensive in response to the October 7, 2023, attack in which Hamas fighters killed about 1,200 people in southern Israel and seized more than 250 hostages, says it takes care to avoid harming civilians in Gaza. It has said approximately one civilian has been killed for every fighter, a ratio it blames on Hamas, saying the Palestinian militant group uses civilian facilities. Hamas has denied using civilians and civilian infrastructure, including hospitals, as human shields. Youngest victim aged 1 day The youngest victim whose death was verified by U.N. monitors was a 1-day-old boy, and the oldest was a 97-year-old woman, the report said. Overall, children represented 44% of the victims, with children aged 5-9 representing the single biggest age category, followed by those aged 10-14, and then those aged up to and including 4. This broadly reflects the enclave's demographics, which the report said reflected an apparent failure to take precautions to avoid civilian losses. It showed that in 88% of cases, five or more people were killed in the same attack, pointing to the Israeli military's use of weapons with an effect across a wide area, although it said some fatalities may have been the result of errant projectiles from Palestinian armed groups.	https://www.voanews.com/a/nearly-70-of-gaza-war-dead-women-and-children-un-rights-office-says/7856343.html	2024-11-08T01:30:53-08:00	
Overnight Russian attacks across Ukraine kill 1, officials say	KYIV, Ukraine — Russia launched a barrage of drones and missiles at Ukraine overnight, killing one civilian and wounding more than 30 people in the center, south, and northeast, Ukrainian officials said Friday. The Russian forces launched 92 drones and five missiles at 12 Ukrainian regions, the Ukrainian air force said. Sixty-two drones and four missiles were downed, it said, and 26 drones were 'lost,' most likely meaning they had been thwarted electronically. The Interior Ministry said one person had been killed in the Odesa region, where civilian infrastructure and homes were damaged and nine people were injured. Four people were wounded in a drone attack on the Kyiv region and at least six private houses and several cars were damaged, it said. Russia also pounded the city of Kharkiv in the northeast with guided bombs, wounding at least 25 people, said regional governor Oleh Syniehubov. President Volodymyr Zelenskiy issued a fresh appeal to Kyiv's partners to help strengthen its air defenses. 'Air defense, long-range capabilities, weapons packages, sanctions against the aggressor -- this is the answer that is needed, not only in words, but also in actions,' he said on the Telegram messaging app. Russia has intensified its air attacks on Ukrainian cities and towns, sending swarms of drones almost every night. Ukrainian officials say Russia is trying to stretch Ukraine's air defenses and demoralize the civilian population as the war nears the 1,000-day mark and Moscow's troops advance in the east. Russia launched more than 2,000 attack drones at civilian and military targets in October, Ukraine's military said.	https://www.voanews.com/a/overnight-russian-attacks-across-ukraine-kill-1-officials-say/7856338.html	2024-11-08T01:15:54-08:00	
In Israeli settlement named after Trump, residents see opportunity after the election	RAMAT TRUMP, Golan Heights — Israeli residents of 'Trump Heights' are welcoming the election of their namesake, hoping Donald Trump's return to the U.S. presidency will breathe new life into this tiny, remote settlement in the central Golan Heights. During his first term, Trump became the first and only foreign leader to recognize Israel's control of the Golan, which it seized from Syria in the 1967 Mideast war. Israel thanked him by rebranding this outpost after him. But a large-scale influx of new residents never materialized after that 2019 ceremony, and just a couple dozen families live in Trump Heights, or 'Ramat Trump' in Hebrew. Job opportunities are limited, and Israel's more-than-yearlong war against Hezbollah militants in nearby Lebanon has added to the sense of isolation. Trump's election has inspired hope in the community that it will attract more members and also more funding for security improvements. 'Maybe it can raise more awareness and maybe some support to help here and help our kids here,' said Yarden Freimann, Trump Heights' community manager. Ori Kallner, head of the Golan's regional council, showed off dozens of plots of land, replete with new asphalt roads, lampposts and utility lines, that residents have prepared for future housing developments. 'President Trump's return to the White House definitely puts the town in the headlines,' he said. Hanging on while war rages nearby Kallner stood next to a metal statue of an eagle and a menorah, symbolizing the United States and Israel, as Israeli warplanes flew overhead. Two explosions from rockets fired from Lebanon punched the hills nearby, and just across the border in Lebanon, plumes of smoke rose into the air from Israeli airstrikes. An enormous sign with the settlement's name in Hebrew and English gleamed in the sun, while two large sunbaked metal flags of Israel and the United States were faded almost beyond recognition. Surrounded by ashen ruins of villages fled by Syrians in the 1967 war, the town is perched above the Hula Valley, where Israel has amassed tanks, artillery and troops for its fight in Lebanon. Most towns in the valley have been evacuated. Trump Heights sends its kids to a makeshift daycare in a nearby settlement after the government shuttered all schools in the region in the wake of the October 1 invasion of Lebanon. 'We find ourselves hanging by our fingernails to be in our own community, not be evacuated, and on the other hand, we cannot work, we cannot send our kids to any kind of an education system,' said Freimann. Trump Heights is only about 12 kilometers from Lebanon and Syria. Alerts for incoming fire gives residents about 30 seconds' head start to get to a bomb shelter. Trump broke with other leaders on the Golan Heights Israel annexed the Golan, a strategic plateau overlooking northern Israel, in 1981 in a move that is not internationally recognized. That changed in March 2019 when Trump, without notice, tweeted that the U.S. would 'fully recognize' Israel's control of the territory. His announcement drew widespread condemnation from the international community, which considers the Golan to be occupied Syrian territory and Israel's settlements to be illegal. The Biden administration left the decision intact, but the U.S. remains the lone country to recognize the Israeli annexation. Kallner said he hopes Trump will now persuade European countries to recognize Israeli sovereignty there. According to Israeli figures, the Golan is home to about 50,000 people — roughly half of them Jewish Israelis and the other half Arab Druze, many of whom still consider themselves Syrians under occupation. Israel has encouraged and promoted settlements in the Golan, and the Druze residents operate farms and a tourism and restaurant sector popular with Israelis. But the area has struggled to develop because of its remoteness, several hours from Israel's economic center in Tel Aviv. That economic hardship has only worsened during the war as the hospitality sector cratered. On July 28, a rocket killed 12 Druze children on a soccer field in the city of Majdal Shams, about 20 kilometers away. Israel invaded Lebanon months later. In June 2019, Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu led an inauguration ceremony for Trump Heights. The U.S. ambassador at the time, David Friedman, noted that the ceremony came days after Trump's birthday and said: 'I can't think of a more appropriate and a more beautiful birthday present.' As president, Trump was close with Netanyahu The Golan recognition was among a series of diplomatic gifts that Trump delivered to Israel during his first term. They included recognizing Jerusalem as Israel's capital and moving the American embassy to the contested city, and a series of diplomatic agreements with Arab countries known as the Abraham Accords. He has vowed to bring peace to the tumultuous region during his second term, but has not said how. Netanyahu enjoyed a close relationship with Trump during his first term but ran afoul of the former president when he congratulated Joe Biden on his 2020 victory. The Israeli prime minister announced Tuesday that he was one of the first foreign leaders to call the president-elect and congratulate him on his victory. An official in his office, speaking on condition of anonymity to discuss internal communications, said aides were upbeat and giddy. 'Congratulations on history's greatest comeback!' the Israeli leader said in a statement. 'Your historic return to the White House offers a new beginning for America and a powerful recommitment to the great alliance between Israel and America.' At Trump Heights, Kallner was optimistic too: 'The Golan community is strong and resilient, and people that want to come and live here are from the same material. I believe we will overcome these challenging times and won't stop growing.'	https://www.voanews.com/a/in-israeli-settlement-named-after-trump-residents-see-opportunity-after-the-election/7856308.html	2024-11-08T00:42:47-08:00	
Israel, Netherlands condemn 'antisemitic' attacks on football fans in Amsterdam	AMSTERDAM — Antisemitic rioters 'actively sought out Israeli supporters to attack and assault them' after a football match, Amsterdam authorities said Friday as Israel said it was sending planes to the Dutch capital to fly fans home. An unknown number of Israeli supporters were injured in the Thursday night violence that was condemned by the leaders of both the Netherlands and Israel as antisemitic. A statement issued by the Dutch capital's municipality, police and prosecution office said that the night after the Europa League match between Ajax and Maccabi Tel Aviv 'was very turbulent with several incidents of violence aimed at Maccabi supporters.' There was no immediate word on the number of injured or arrests. The violence erupted Thursday despite a ban on a pro-Palestinian demonstration near the football stadium imposed by Amsterdam Mayor Femke Halsema, who had feared that clashes would break out between protesters and supporters of the Israeli football club. Israel ordered that two planes be sent to the Dutch capital to bring the Israelis home. 'The prime minister has directed that two rescue planes be sent immediately to assist our citizens,' said a statement from Benjamin Netanyahu's office. It added that 'the harsh pictures of the assault on our citizens in Amsterdam will not be overlooked,' and that Netanyahu 'views the horrifying incident with utmost gravity.' He demanded that the Dutch government take 'vigorous and swift action' against those involved. Netanyahu's office added that he had called for increased security for the Jewish community in the Netherlands. Dutch Prime Minister Dick Schoof said on X that he followed reports of the violence 'with horror.' 'Completely unacceptable anti-Semitic attacks on Israelis. I am in close contact with everyone involved,' he added, saying that he had spoken to Netanyahu and 'emphasized that the perpetrators will be tracked down and prosecuted. It is now quiet in the capital.' Geert Wilders, the hard right nationalist lawmaker whose Party for Freedom won elections in the Netherlands last year and who is a staunch ally of Israel, reacted to a video apparently showing a Maccabi fan being surrounded by several men. 'Looks like a Jew hunt in the streets of Amsterdam. Arrest and deport the multicultural scum that attacked Maccabi Tel Aviv supporters in our streets. Ashamed that this can happen in The Netherlands. Totally unacceptable,' Wilders said. Israel's Ambassador to the United Nations, Danny Danon, also condemned the violence in a post on the social media platform X. Ajax won the Europa League match 5-0.	https://www.voanews.com/a/israel-netherlands-condemn-antisemitic-attacks-on-football-fans-in-amsterdam-/7856321.html	2024-11-08T00:41:53-08:00
